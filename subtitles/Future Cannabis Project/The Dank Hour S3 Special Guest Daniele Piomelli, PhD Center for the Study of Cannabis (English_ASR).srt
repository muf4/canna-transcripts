[Music]

2
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,119
hello hello hello everybody and welcome

3
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,718
to another episode of the Dank hour

4
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,959
We're super excited to have you with you

5
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,920
sorry about the the slow start

6
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,878
today it's it's been an interesting one

7
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,440
because uh we we've had to bounce around

8
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:54,759
a little bit so we're streaming this

9
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,839
from Zoom onto streamyard into YouTube

10
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:59,000
so it's like we're multiplatform but

11
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,399
we're only going one spot but anyways I

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,439
hope you're excited as as usual I'm

13
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,439
London your dictator of dialogue your

14
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:06,399
your master of moderation all around

15
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:09,158
weird guy that likes to talk to about

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,520
cannabis with some wacky weirdos um I

17
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:11,759
shouldn't call you all weirdo you're

18
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:14,000
fantastic human beings I really

19
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,879
shouldn't be saying that but we have an

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,599
amazing really star in the Cannabis

21
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:22,199
space that is that is written I don't

22
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,959
know how many papers this year Alone um

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,478
so and we're a bit behind schedule so

24
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:28,239
we're going to roll right into it and

25
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:30,519
get the conversation go and welcome to

26
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,919
uh welcome to the show do

27
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:35,000
Daniel is that was that what you prefer

28
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,118
to go by or would you prefer something

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,239
else so so my name is Daniel I'm a

30
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:43,280
distinguished professor of Neuroscience

31
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:46,199
uh in at the school the University of

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,000
California irine school of medicine I'm

33
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,079
a neuroscientist a pharmacologist I uh

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,200
have a PhD from Columbia University I

35
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,759
did my postdoctoral work at the roeller

36
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,840
University and worked basically on the

37
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,560
endoc canaban System since the early

38
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,640
1990s uh for about 10 15

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,399
years 100% of my activity was on the

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,399
endocab signaling system then as it

41
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,560
became clear that cannabis was becoming

42
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,400
more and more legalized in the state of

43
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:21,000
California happens in 96 the first time

44
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,640
and in 2016 the second time uh it became

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,318
clear to me that there was a topic that

46
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:30,279
had to be tackled and so my lab started

47
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:32,598
also working on on phyto canav know so

48
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:37,039
cannabi notes that are derived from the

49
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:38,560
cannabis plant um and I am the editor-in

50
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:41,919
chief of a journal called cannabis and

51
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,120
canabo research that whose mission is

52
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:47,919
really to to publish solid peer-reviewed

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,840
work in everything cannabis and

54
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,598
cannaboid we had a little bit of an

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,280
issue on our last episode where we had

56
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:58,318
some problems with recording and all the

57
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,840
other business and and whatnot and so on

58
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:02,399
so we we got cut off on the first

59
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,878
question unfortunately we missed Kyle's

60
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,519
very first awesome question but we did

61
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:12,759
uh kind of start the recording of the

62
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:15,799
video in Zoom uh with uh Dr Mark's

63
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:18,239
question um and and really was quite

64
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,200
phenomenal so we sorry we've missed that

65
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,080
part of the recording but we're going to

66
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,238
get right back into it right now and you

67
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,440
can watch it watch it all from there

68
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,438
it's a fantastic episode so don't miss

69
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,680
out on any of it and we'll see you all

70
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:31,680
next week on The Dan cower

71
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,280
Med entirely by CB1 cannabinoid

72
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:40,559
receptors maybe there is a small CB2

73
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,719
component but CB1 drives most of the

74
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,400
pharmacology and the CB1 receptor gets

75
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:48,919
involved because am44 which does not

76
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,719
bind to CB1 receptors stops the

77
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:53,039
degradation of an enamide an enamide

78
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,639
levels increase so now an enamide

79
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:57,639
activates CB1 receptors and produces

80
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:59,438
analgesia and of course if you block the

81
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:00,919
CB1 receptor you block the effect of am

82
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,039
for for because you block the effect of

83
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:07,479
an anine so that's the that's the

84
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:09,878
context uh so we published that it was a

85
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:13,318
science paper in 1997 where we

86
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:15,878
identified that the the animate

87
00:04:13,318 --> 00:04:17,560
transporter and a few years later I

88
00:04:15,878 --> 00:04:18,238
think was the group of bankat but I

89
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,160
don't

90
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:24,079
remember precisely made an interesting

91
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,120
observation that if they gave tanol

92
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,959
which actually the structure of Talen is

93
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,079
very simple is contained in the

94
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:33,000
structure of am404 if they gave Talen to

95
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:36,120
well no no no you have to remove the the

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,680
acetate there's an acetal group acetate

97
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,800
yes yeah once you remove the acetate

98
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,000
group then you're right you can it has

99
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,639
yes it I was simplifying things Mark

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,319
that's that's precisely right you're

101
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:51,800
precisely correct

102
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:55,439
so they found that it gets this this

103
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,918
portion of of of Talon gets

104
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,160
condensed with with arachidonic acid and

105
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:01,719
that is a reaction ction that almost

106
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,919
certainly is carried out by the enzyme

107
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,240
fatty acid amm hydas which can work in

108
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:10,079
Reverse so now you have this structure

109
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,560
which is actually am404 and the the

110
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,279
because has been known for actually

111
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,240
quite a few years at the least in animal

112
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:19,719
models if you block CB1 receptor stanol

113
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,639
effects decrease or disappear people

114
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,319
draw drew the conclusion which I think

115
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,639
is not unreasonable that in Vivo

116
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,120
whenever we take

117
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,439
tylenol at least part of it and tyon is

118
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,038
taken a fairly high doses so the the

119
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:35,079
brain levels are probably micromolar so

120
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,879
they're probably rather substantial so

121
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:39,639
the reaction is not impossible of course

122
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,639
no one is seen it in the human brain so

123
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,879
it's still speculative but it could

124
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:46,600
happen and it is seen in the rat and the

125
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:49,319
mouse brain so melan brains can carry

126
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,479
out their reaction and if the reaction

127
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,960
takes place yes it's entirely possible

128
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:56,159
the INF for participates in the effects

129
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:58,279
of Tylenol because another important

130
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,439
background is that Tylenol although is

131
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:03,119
categorized often erroneously as an nade

132
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,759
so a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory

133
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,038
drug actually is not in that it does not

134
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,598
really really very effectively block the

135
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:14,478
major Target of all an AES like aspirin

136
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:14,478
or omein which is

137
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:20,240
cyol probably and it's been for many

138
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,719
years a mystery so this has been is one

139
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,360
of the possible uh solution of this

140
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,360
mystery again we would need to know

141
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,598
there is a simple experiment to be done

142
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,319
in humans if one could do this

143
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,879
experiments or one one had the you know

144
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,000
the you know the all the approvals to do

145
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,918
or the funding to do such an experiment

146
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,720
it just to give Tylenol to someone to

147
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,918
people measure the analgesic effect and

148
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,880
with or without a canabo receptor

149
00:06:44,918 --> 00:06:50,478
antagonist so if the effect is is is

150
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,120
abrogated by the canab receptor

151
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,318
antagonist then then you have your

152
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,918
answer no one has done these experiments

153
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,840
I don't think everyone will ever do it

154
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,439
but it's an interesting question it's an

155
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,598
interesting question well and we should

156
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:05,360
remind our our our viewers that the Cy

157
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:07,918
oxygenase pathway is one of the

158
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,000
penultimate um Pathways in the

159
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,000
arachadonic acid pathway right isn't

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,399
that

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:21,279
correct so so it it it shows how these

162
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:26,079
two sets of um Pathways if you will that

163
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:29,038
um uh making these um uh compounds that

164
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:32,439
have neurological activity as well as

165
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:35,478
anti an oxidant uh activity as well as

166
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:37,839
the prostaglandins which enjoy a variety

167
00:07:35,478 --> 00:07:39,878
of different biological activities these

168
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,959
are not trivial molecules but they're

169
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:45,759
molecules that are have their origins in

170
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:49,560
the lipid themselves which I find just

171
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:52,879
absolutely fascinating again going back

172
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,399
toomy so do the endoc canabo it's both

173
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,360
an but they do in a different way and

174
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,878
that's what's fascinating about them and

175
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,800
after this I think we should move on to

176
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,280
other question questions but the

177
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,478
basically what we what we showed over

178
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:08,959
the years is that anite andg the two

179
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:11,439
main andoc cannabinoids are preformed

180
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,839
and they're present preformed in the

181
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,759
fat-like membrane that surrounds cells

182
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,918
the lipid membrane that surround cells

183
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,199
they're preformed they're not active

184
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,439
because they are not liberated they are

185
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:24,879
liberated upon demand so there is a

186
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:27,519
stimulus that comes by activates the

187
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,319
cell the cell releases the active

188
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,279
endocannabinoid with it you know with

189
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:33,599
the endocannabinoid structure so the

190
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,879
arconic acid the ethanolamine aric acid

191
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,640
and glycerol and then the compound

192
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,838
activates the canabo receptor and then

193
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,639
he's destroyed now this is very

194
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:45,560
different from the e conoids which you

195
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,519
mentioned like cylo lioo product because

196
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:50,000
they in the the case you release an

197
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,480
arconic acid and then arconic acid is

198
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,320
metabolized but the concept is the same

199
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,560
the cell is not just a membrane is not

200
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,560
just a protection but it's a source of

201
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:02,559
signaling molecules and it's actually

202
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:05,119
really what fascinated me 35 years ago

203
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,759
and I I still am fascinated by it you

204
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,679
know obviously I don't have a lot of

205
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:12,439
fantasy or better things to do but

206
00:09:08,679 --> 00:09:16,199
that's that's what I that's what I work

207
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,440
on thank you really much enjoy your

208
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,879
literature and enjoy reading every paper

209
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,440
you've published thank you thank you

210
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:24,320
Mark that's very very kind of you I'm

211
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,760
just gonna jump into just real quick

212
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,839
before we have Tess go ahead I'm sorry

213
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:30,480
I'm on like the dark screen on this side

214
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:33,320
of the internet that doesn't want me

215
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,480
visible anymore uh but I did want to

216
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,360
throw out that you know we we have a

217
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,360
very passionate group of epic epic nerds

218
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,320
on our Channel and that like to follow

219
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,240
and do these things we we try and keep

220
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,120
it as high brow as possible so don't be

221
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,240
afraid if you want to go on a long

222
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,120
tangent about like you know whatever

223
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,639
we're we're we're here to listen we

224
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,240
always appreciate that um but anyways

225
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,120
I'm going to give the floor to Tess to

226
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,639
ask the next question thanks

227
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,560
again

228
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:04,799
I think that's a great uh segue London I

229
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,838
was about to comment on the level of

230
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,078
nerd Dum that was going on right now and

231
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:13,880
how much I was loving it so it's such a

232
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:16,039
pleasure to have you on Dr pelli I um am

233
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:20,519
a microbiologist by training but there

234
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:22,759
was a very uh couple years when I was a

235
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,200
um an undergrad and early grad student

236
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:26,519
where I worked in a neuroimmune

237
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,600
pharmacology lab and I was studying

238
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,720
neurogenesis and I thought it was

239
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,839
fascinating all of the things going on

240
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,200
in your brain all the different I always

241
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,360
thought of it as like a like a soap

242
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,000
opera of characters in your brain like

243
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,480
uh communicating with each other

244
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,240
sometimes liking each other sometimes

245
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,039
stabbing each other in the back and you

246
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,799
know and all the crazy networks of

247
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:51,519
signaling that goes on where there's

248
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:53,719
arrows and there's Arrows with a blunt

249
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,240
end and and all the crazy shenanigans

250
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,399
that goes on so like bringing it down a

251
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,240
couple nerd levels to just like what it

252
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,600
looks like when you're trying to

253
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,839
understand it from a Sy systematic point

254
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,480
of view and since you got started in you

255
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,200
know understanding and trying to study

256
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,720
lipid derive Messengers I was wondering

257
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,560
besides cannabis what's your favorite

258
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,440
lipid derived man or sorry endoc canabo

259
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:22,319
or other canabo related compounds

260
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,959
besides them because that's we talk

261
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,639
about that all the time um what are some

262
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,479
of your other favorite players

263
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,600
especially the lipids out there and why

264
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,278
oh that's a good question again you know

265
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,079
I was not expecting a nerd a nerd panel

266
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,679
being you know you know attacking me

267
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:42,000
from all from all angles I'm loving it

268
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:46,759
it's great it's more fun than I was

269
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,320
expecting so um my other favorite uh

270
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:53,240
lipid lipid derived molecules at this

271
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,360
point in my career are two actually and

272
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:58,639
we've been also working on them for

273
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,000
quite a while they are called the okay

274
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,278
I'm not going to say how they're called

275
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,759
right away I'm going to say first of all

276
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:05,519
they look like an

277
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,319
animite but they don't qu like an

278
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,799
animite and they don't walk like an

279
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,959
anide so they're not an endo they're not

280
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:15,838
endoc canabo but they have some basic

281
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:18,239
similarities with an anomid so an anite

282
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,839
is arachidonic acid which is this long

283
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:25,198
fatty acid with four double bonds or

284
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:27,360
unsaturations and one polar head made

285
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:29,639
made of ethanolamine so that's an anide

286
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,560
right and there is an bond between

287
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,320
ethanolamine and the fatty acid and

288
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:37,039
that's very very important the Amite

289
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,519
Bond okay these compounds are have the

290
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,319
same general structure so there is

291
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,919
ethanolamine there is an amine Bond but

292
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,879
instead of having arachidonic acid so a

293
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:48,399
very long chain fatty acid with multiple

294
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:51,320
unsaturations they have either no

295
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,679
unsaturation at all and 16 carbon atoms

296
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:59,600
that's called palmo ethanolamide or

297
00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:02,120
paa and Olay um 18 carbon atoms of one

298
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:06,079
double bond OIC acid and that that's

299
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:09,000
called oan olamide or OA so OA and paa

300
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:11,078
are my second second best lipids I call

301
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,039
them we call them parac canabo and let

302
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:16,519
me explain why we call them parac canabo

303
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:19,559
para in Greek means

304
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,278
around and uh so these are compounds

305
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:24,638
that are around our main

306
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,480
endocannabinoids anandamide and 2 a

307
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,039
because they resemble there are many

308
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,800
things they do in common with bomide in

309
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:34,958
particular they have as I said similar

310
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:38,439
structure but most importantly they have

311
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:41,159
a similar set of membrane precursors not

312
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,040
not identical but similar they are

313
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:44,719
produced by the very same enzyme there

314
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,240
is an enzyme which by the way Mark

315
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,839
contains a zinc atom so is one of your

316
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,799
favorite molecules uh this zinc

317
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,320
containing enzymes called nape

318
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:57,319
phospholipase D or AP plld and releases

319
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:00,600
an enamide and releases also these other

320
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:04,600
guys now the the the key difference

321
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:08,440
however is functional because OA and

322
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,560
paa um do not bind or activate in any

323
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,440
shape or form canabo receptors neither

324
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,359
the CB1 nor the CB2 they activate a

325
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,519
different set of receptors in

326
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,720
particularly they are uh High Affinity

327
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,440
Agonist lians so high Affinity

328
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,959
activators of the So-Cal peroxisome it's

329
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,079
a mouthful peroxisome proliferator

330
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:34,559
activated receptor type Alpha P Alpha

331
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:36,559
for short P Alpha for short and P Alpha

332
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:39,000
is a nuclear receptor so this compounds

333
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,638
going to the cell buy to this nuclear

334
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,679
receptor the nuclear receptor moves to

335
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,639
the Moon nucleus does all sort of

336
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:47,638
interesting things oea we proved this

337
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,480
you know already 20 years ago and we've

338
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:54,440
been studying it it very systematically

339
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:58,120
over the last two decades oea is a very

340
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:01,199
important regulator of of feeding and

341
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:05,039
liquid metabolism by activating P Alpha

342
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:08,758
for example it curbs food intake very

343
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:11,360
markedly is a very effective anorexiant

344
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:14,199
as they say technically but also it

345
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,800
stimulates the consumption utilization

346
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:19,719
of energy throughout the body in in the

347
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:22,399
white OS tisue in the brown OS tisue in

348
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,079
the liver etc etc and it's just a

349
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,919
fascinating molecule just from from that

350
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:30,559
perspective um PA if if if anything is

351
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:32,759
possible is even more fascinating it

352
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,919
also works on people Alpha but in

353
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:37,639
different cells than OA does and Pa is

354
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,799
particularly important immune cells and

355
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,879
it's particularly important in

356
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:45,318
regulating inflammatory responses and

357
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:47,919
pain so H PA now in fact is in the

358
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:50,360
market after you know we we discovered

359
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:52,198
its receptor many years ago and we you

360
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,278
know we characterized it you know it's

361
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:56,559
now been sold throughout the world

362
00:15:54,278 --> 00:16:00,198
mostly in Europe but also here in United

363
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:03,198
States as a supplement to a to reduce

364
00:16:00,198 --> 00:16:06,039
mild forms of pain and it is actually

365
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:08,078
quite effective in that regard not very

366
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:11,159
effective because it's rapidly destroyed

367
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:14,159
by the body but it's rather rather

368
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:17,480
effective so to answer your question I

369
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:19,600
love these parac canabo because they

370
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,759
encapsulate a very important principle

371
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,680
that in nature just as you said before

372
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,480
things don't work they're never that

373
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:28,559
simple so an animite is produced and

374
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,319
these other guys are produced they work

375
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:34,198
work together sometimes synergistically

376
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:37,439
so they they add onto the activity of

377
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:41,039
each other sometimes antagonistically

378
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,560
for example PA and an enamide both

379
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:46,519
inhibit pain and they do so in a way

380
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:50,479
that if you add one an animite and one

381
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:52,839
PA you have five the effect of five

382
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,639
molecules not a two molecules so there's

383
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:57,680
a sort of synergistic effect right so

384
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,839
they work together on pain but an

385
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:01,638
animite know work opposite on food

386
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,439
intake because an animite stimulates

387
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,959
food intake OA inhibits it and because

388
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,600
these are my favorite lipids in the

389
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:10,120
whole wide world I could talk about them

390
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,359
for hours but even the Nerds that are

391
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:14,639
listening to us I see it's not very many

392
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,599
of them but so I assume they're really

393
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,199
the you know those who are interested I

394
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:20,759
I think would would start shooting

395
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:24,880
themselves in the in you know in the

396
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:24,879
temple so I I I think I rather stop

397
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:28,918
here that's awesome I love that you have

398
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,440
other

399
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:34,640
favorite um signaling molecules and it's

400
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:37,400
cool to that they can be so similar but

401
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,840
also so different and it doesn't take

402
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,440
that much of a little tweak of a

403
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:44,000
molecule to completely change how it

404
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,759
behaves and I think that that Segways

405
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,240
really well into a question that Evian

406
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:52,519
had I kind of feel like hi Dr h f so I

407
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,759
actually feel like you were answering

408
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:57,400
the question as uh as we're going I was

409
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,200
like wait a minute I think he's actually

410
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,519
answering my question because my

411
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,000
question was around the um the feeding

412
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:07,000
in the body weight uh part of some of

413
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,759
your research was really fascinating to

414
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,038
me and how that implies you know what

415
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:15,960
the therapeutic applications for some of

416
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:18,759
that more recent research with the the

417
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,159
paa uh that was kind of where I wanted

418
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:21,919
to go with it which sounds like

419
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:24,120
basically what you just answered I was

420
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,080
curious about the signaling and the

421
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:28,839
responses and also like what the

422
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:31,038
implications are for

423
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:32,879
therapeutic uh you know how we're going

424
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,158
to apply these cannabinoid kind of

425
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,159
research that you've been working

426
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:40,640
towards for therapeutic application I'm

427
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:43,080
really fascinated by that and then also

428
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,480
um you know I know you've done a lot of

429
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:48,199
work around the molecular um signaling

430
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,000
also so I just wanted to see if maybe

431
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,640
you could break it down for people in a

432
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,519
way that is uh maybe like doesn't have

433
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,759
to totally be layman's terms but you

434
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:58,440
know just bringing how that research is

435
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,079
going to impact people and I was was

436
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,240
also very curious like where it's headed

437
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,798
for you on the therapeutic um element

438
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,839
like what what's your goals or what are

439
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,639
you most excited about researching into

440
00:19:06,839 --> 00:19:10,879
the future with these things so well

441
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,159
thank you those

442
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,840
are couple of different questions so let

443
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:19,919
me start with the first one um the issue

444
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:22,959
of food intake and Body Body Energy

445
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:27,240
regulation so that is actually really

446
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:30,960
really critical when um when we started

447
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,839
the 30 years ago working on on the endoc

448
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,919
canaban system the last thing the last

449
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:40,279
thing we would have imagined is that the

450
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:43,360
endoc canaban system is more important

451
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:47,639
outside the brain than it is inside the

452
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:49,839
brain and uh the reason why it's more

453
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:54,400
important outside the brain than inside

454
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:57,399
the brain is because it regulates energy

455
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,960
metabolism at every level from the

456
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:02,919
tongue

457
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:06,720
to the gut to the arpus organ to the

458
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:09,799
liver to the pancreas the entire

459
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,480
body has cannabinoid receptors

460
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:16,359
particularly CB1 cannabinoid receptors

461
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:20,599
that are linked somehow to something

462
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:24,719
that has to do with energy intake and

463
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:27,399
energy storage and the overarching logic

464
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,600
here is actually very very simple

465
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:33,320
regardless of how specifically they act

466
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:34,639
in different parts of the body CB1

467
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:37,158
cannabinoid receptors and the

468
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,559
endocannabinoids that activate them are

469
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:43,039
involved in keeping in getting as much

470
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,158
energy as possible from the environment

471
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,759
particularly fat energy because that's

472
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:51,440
the best energy that we can get and keep

473
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:54,200
it in our fat stores our adal stores as

474
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,880
much as possible and this is simply

475
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:01,038
because as I'm sure all of you know for

476
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,159
250,000 years we did not have uh

477
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,919
refrigerators and it was pretty hard for

478
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:08,760
us to find fat as you know we had to

479
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,720
hunt it and once we found it most of the

480
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:13,359
time animals are not fat most of the

481
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,440
times they lean because they you know

482
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,639
you know run around so you had we had to

483
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,600
break their bones and suck the marrow or

484
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,679
eat the brain this was the main way of

485
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:24,240
getting fat so really really hard and

486
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:27,519
the evolution of the endoc canab system

487
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:30,720
I believe is based on this on the idea

488
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,918
that just like insulin it helps us main

489
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,798
achieve as get as much fat as possible

490
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:38,320
from the environment and store it as

491
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:41,440
much as possible now now that you know

492
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:43,720
plenty has put us in a situation where

493
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,320
we have the opposite problem not finding

494
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,759
fat but getting rid of fat so that's

495
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:51,839
where canabo receptors also can become a

496
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:54,519
target from a therapeutic perspective a

497
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,119
molecular Target in that one by blocking

498
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:58,240
these receptors one could block all

499
00:21:56,119 --> 00:22:00,119
these actions that I just told you so so

500
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,120
basically you would block reduce

501
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:04,519
appetite you can reduce the absorption

502
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:07,839
of lipids in the gut you would res you

503
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:10,480
would reduce the ability of fat to be

504
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:13,399
incorporated into adipose cells and so

505
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,919
on and so forth now and that was done

506
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,038
was tested not just in the animals but

507
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:22,120
actually was shown to be quite effective

508
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:25,119
in humans uh now quite a few years ago

509
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:28,519
2003 2004

510
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:32,599
so 20 years ago or

511
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:35,359
so um the only problem the only problem

512
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:37,359
the small detail that the pharmaceutical

513
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,199
company that developed these agents are

514
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,439
called canabo receptor antagonist so

515
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,600
they block CB1 receptors quite

516
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,600
selectively and they have exactly the

517
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,359
opposite effect of what endocannabinoid

518
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:50,639
would have so they will block appetite

519
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:53,319
blah blah blah whatever I told it in in

520
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,278
Reverse whatever I said in Reverse okay

521
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:57,960
so these are very effective in humans

522
00:22:56,278 --> 00:23:00,038
and in fact there were clinical trials

523
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,000
showing that one of them called remona

524
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:06,798
band that was developed by a company

525
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,240
called sopi and remona band uh really

526
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:14,119
worked for obese people the only small

527
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,558
problem as I said was that they did not

528
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:18,839
consider the pharmaceutical company

529
00:23:15,558 --> 00:23:21,278
developed did not consider that the main

530
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:23,399
uh effect of the endoc canaban system in

531
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:25,599
the brain as we by the way had

532
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:30,559
discovered in those very same

533
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:35,319
years in 2001 to 2003 and the five is to

534
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:36,399
regulate mood so and to improve mood and

535
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:38,839
that's the other thing that the

536
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,360
cannabinoids do they they make her life

537
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:43,678
a little bit better

538
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:45,558
um and what happens if you block the

539
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,278
canab receptor in the bra in the brain

540
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:51,038
you can imagine now your life becomes

541
00:23:48,278 --> 00:23:53,359
sensibly less good so now you develop

542
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:56,278
anxiety you develop depression you

543
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:59,479
develop even suicidal ideation and so

544
00:23:56,278 --> 00:24:01,679
this all set of those dependent side

545
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,200
effects of the

546
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,559
cannabinoid the CB1 receptor antagonist

547
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,000
remona band emerged pretty quickly and

548
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,200
the Food and Drug Administration of the

549
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,319
United States never gave um the

550
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:17,400
authorization to use remona band in

551
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:19,918
patients um in Europe it was briefly

552
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,480
briefly approved but then withdrawn when

553
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,720
they saw the same s effects that have

554
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,120
been seen in in in the clinical trials

555
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,960
in the United States in the clinical

556
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:33,119
trials in the United States so now what

557
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,798
there people are doing um and this is

558
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:39,519
something that initially had hard time

559
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:42,879
in gain interaction but now has become

560
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:45,759
rather increasingly more popular they're

561
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,760
developing a CB1 CB1 receptor antagonist

562
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:51,798
that don't enter the CNS say they don't

563
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:54,480
enter the brain why why is that useful

564
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:56,879
well because the anxiety effect the pro

565
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,480
anxiety Pro depression effect occurs in

566
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,440
the central nervous system system but

567
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,480
the as I said before the effects on on

568
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,159
metabolism occur outside the central

569
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,558
nervous system and so you can take

570
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:11,880
advantage of this just by developing

571
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:13,879
agents that fail to cross the so-call

572
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,159
bloodb brain barrier which is this big

573
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,200
wall that you know prevents the entrance

574
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,440
of many substances from the circulation

575
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:23,798
into the into the brain parena and you

576
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,440
just you know if you play chemical

577
00:25:23,798 --> 00:25:27,398
tricks and I'm sure mark would would

578
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,159
know about them if you play chemical

579
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:31,199
tricks you can prevent that from

580
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,840
happening it's a lot harder to do than

581
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,798
it is to say but it can be done and it

582
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:39,199
has been done and now there are some of

583
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:41,038
this peripherally restricted as they

584
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,200
said they're called canabo receptor

585
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:46,278
antagonist which um seem very very

586
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:48,240
promising in animals they seem to be

587
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:50,798
very very promising and they believe the

588
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,558
clinical trials are either ongoing or

589
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:57,679
about to start so that's one possible

590
00:25:54,558 --> 00:26:00,519
therapeutic application of of using now

591
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:04,080
negatively using B blocking the canabo

592
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:07,119
receptor I personally think that there

593
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:09,000
is a lot more I mean not a lot more but

594
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:12,079
certainly a lot of a lot of value and

595
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:15,398
promise also in activating the canabo

596
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:17,918
receptor in ways that are that are

597
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:20,000
therapeutically relevant the simplest

598
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:23,440
way is of course by using

599
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,640
cannabis cannabis contains THC THC

600
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,399
mimics the endocannabinoids in many ways

601
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,200
and produces many any of the effects of

602
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:32,719
the endocannabinoids the problem in

603
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,440
using cannabis as we all know is that

604
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,240
you know it's very difficult to separate

605
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,440
one effect from the other because you

606
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,480
know once you have THC in circulation

607
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,038
you have THC in circulation it gets to

608
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,798
the brain and every you know basically

609
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:50,000
every canabo receptor in the brain is

610
00:26:45,798 --> 00:26:52,119
activated right pretty pretty much so um

611
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,599
depending on the dose then you can have

612
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:57,278
I don't know a relatively mild effect

613
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:59,519
which could be for example analgesic in

614
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:03,519
some cas cases but it's very hard now

615
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:05,679
not to not not to impinge upon the next

616
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,398
effect which is now you know maybe a

617
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,759
little bit of sedation maybe a little

618
00:27:07,398 --> 00:27:11,918
bit of euphoria giddiness and stuff like

619
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:13,798
that so it's hard to separate the

620
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,440
therapeutic effect which could be I

621
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:20,398
don't know analgesic or appetite

622
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:23,000
stimulating from a more uh a more into

623
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:24,439
intoxicating action which some people

624
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
just don't want you know if you of

625
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,919
course if you use cannabis for

626
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,038
nonmedical purposes you are seeking the

627
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,480
intoxication and if it's done you know

628
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:35,679
properly it's a very safe way of of

629
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:38,278
getting out of our own of our our

630
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,919
thoughts and and and and relax a little

631
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:42,480
bit so that's a separate problem

632
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,038
medically if you need to go to work and

633
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,679
you know you just want to you know

634
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:49,000
stimulate your appetite or block your or

635
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:51,159
block a pain or have an allistic effect

636
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,798
it's harder to separate the you know

637
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:55,080
this is called the therapeutic window by

638
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:57,798
the way and and the therapeutic window

639
00:27:55,079 --> 00:28:01,240
of THC of cannabis is really not very

640
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:04,038
not very uh not very large so there is a

641
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,079
very small separation between the

642
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:09,278
effects you want from an effect you may

643
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:11,720
not want okay so that's that's the main

644
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:14,159
problem we have with activating the

645
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:17,000
canabo system the endocab system

646
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,159
directly so I have spent you know

647
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,319
literally 20 years trying to activate it

648
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:23,278
indirectly and by by that what I mean is

649
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:26,480
that we have the

650
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:28,919
endocannabinoids we have enzymes that

651
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,919
destroy the endoc avoids or you know

652
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,080
protean systems like the transporter I

653
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:35,720
mentioned before they destroy the

654
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:38,000
endocannabinoids so if we block these

655
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,759
enzymes or we block these you know

656
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,798
protein systems what what happens well

657
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:45,519
the endocab levels will rise right so

658
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:47,519
and if they rise because you stop the

659
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,319
degradation if they rise they will

660
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,359
activate canabo receptors so you could

661
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:55,079
say well well then you know you it's the

662
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:57,719
same effect as given THC no it isn't and

663
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:59,839
the reason why it is not is that endoc

664
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,960
canabo let's not forget are not are

665
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,759
produced upon demand so they're not

666
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:07,679
normally there all the time they're

667
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:11,440
there when we need them when they are

668
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,720
needed and and where and when they are

669
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,320
needed so let's say in a particular area

670
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,319
of the brain there is a need for the

671
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:19,918
production of an animite an anite

672
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:22,879
production increases and at that point

673
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,159
if on board we have a drug a chemical

674
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,360
that blocks the degradation of an anite

675
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:29,399
in that specific region at that specific

676
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,759
spefic time there will be an increase in

677
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:33,959
an emite not elsewhere just in that

678
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:37,079
specific region and that increase in an

679
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:39,319
emite will presumably also be limited

680
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:41,798
just because there is only so much an

681
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,158
endite the body can produce right

682
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:46,960
whereas you know there is an unlimited

683
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:49,278
amount of THC one can take so in fact

684
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,600
this concept is not theoretical anymore

685
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:54,119
it's been demonstrated in in thousands

686
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:57,319
of animal studies since we launched the

687
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:59,639
idea uh with the first inhibitor of the

688
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:01,759
intracellular degradation of an anite

689
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,919
was published in

690
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:07,640
2002 uh since then we showed that you

691
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:10,360
know an anide blocking an anide

692
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:11,440
degradation is anxiolytic produces

693
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:14,240
reduces

694
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,960
anxiety and and that's one reason why

695
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,679
blocking canabo receptor causes anxiety

696
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,480
because you know an anide typically is a

697
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:23,720
kind of a body owned anxiolytic or

698
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:28,519
anti-anxiety

699
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:30,399
molecule right uh and so F Inhibitors

700
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:34,519
this this is the enzyme that Cleaves an

701
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:37,199
an is called fa faah fan and hydes and F

702
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:39,038
Inhibitors now 20 years after this

703
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,759
discovery 20 plus years after the

704
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:44,000
discovery are being tested in the clinic

705
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,158
for the treatment of social anxiety

706
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,038
which is something that of course you

707
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:49,679
know I'm following very closely it makes

708
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,720
me very very proud because they would be

709
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,120
uh after 20 years working on this a very

710
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:57,240
nice indication of our work um you know

711
00:30:55,119 --> 00:31:00,479
if it doesn't work it doesn't work as

712
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:04,319
but our job is at least to give it a

713
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:09,159
try so I I could go on you know honestly

714
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:11,278
uh if Yan I could go on uh on on on the

715
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:13,440
topic of therapeutic applications for a

716
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:16,038
while I just don't want to digress too

717
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,120
much and so maybe we could go back to

718
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:19,759
the questions I appreciate I will just

719
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:21,839
say I really appreciate your answer

720
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:23,839
because I and it did every time you go

721
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,439
it gives me like five more questions so

722
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:27,879
I know that there's a bunch of other

723
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,159
questions in there but I

724
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,240
I'm curious about the like a couple

725
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,320
things later just to put in the mind is

726
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,759
that I'm curious about the implications

727
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,200
you mentioned also with the other

728
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,798
cannaboid like thcv kept coming up in my

729
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:44,000
mind when you were speaking about that

730
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:47,839
and then also the um I feel like there's

731
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,079
something uh well I'll pass it on but I

732
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,000
feel like there's a couple things like

733
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:53,119
the inflammatory piece you did drop a

734
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,240
couple things about the inflammatory

735
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,439
potential so I'm also curious about that

736
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,240
but I'm just going to put it out there

737
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:02,480
and pass it on to I think Damon is next

738
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:07,000
or now lon's here if you wna no Damon's

739
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:09,200
up next perfect thank you Dr pelli um no

740
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,440
we're gonna talk more about therapeutic

741
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,679
cannabis this is an amazing

742
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,000
conversation uh so originally I wanted

743
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:20,679
to ask like why does cannabis work for

744
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,839
chronic pain management and uh you had a

745
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:26,320
really good discussion with Dr scalon

746
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:27,798
there and you touched on that um I like

747
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,439
what you said about the therapeutic

748
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:33,759
window of cannabis um that's something

749
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:36,639
that patients always have to keep in

750
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,278
mind what how would you ensure or like

751
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:40,278
what would you suggest that a medical

752
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:43,319
patient could do to stay within that

753
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:47,200
therapeutic window and what would you

754
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:49,119
suggest for dosage safety yeah so that's

755
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,519
a that's another very very very good

756
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,959
question so when it comes to canabus and

757
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,240
pain I am extremely frustrated but and

758
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:01,759
the reason for that is that uh um there

759
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:03,880
is uh what is called substantial

760
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:05,720
evidence that cannabis is effect and

761
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,120
cannabinoids are effective in

762
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,240
alleviating pain in adults substantial

763
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:14,798
evidence unfortunately is not conclusive

764
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:16,519
evidence all right and for this reason

765
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:20,119
um the medical

766
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:23,558
profession are very recalcitrant very

767
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:25,719
hesitant to recommend uh to recommend

768
00:33:23,558 --> 00:33:29,079
cannabis although they they do more and

769
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:30,798
more un fortunately what they do um

770
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:33,319
because they don't understand the system

771
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:36,359
very well is that they will suggest that

772
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:39,720
people start with CBD as if CBD was the

773
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:41,719
dumb cousin of THC CBD and THC are

774
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,000
completely different molecules me not

775
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,240
completely different chemically but

776
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
they're functionally completely

777
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,720
different and they do very very

778
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,720
different things so unfortunately we

779
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:55,038
have a very very long uh route before

780
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,079
before we we educate the medical

781
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:59,720
profession on this but back to to your

782
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:03,960
your

783
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:05,759
question given the fact that uh

784
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,039
Physicians especially in the United

785
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:13,039
States do not understand the problem a

786
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:15,519
lot of patients uh ask around go online

787
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:17,599
ask me you know they send me emails Etc

788
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,480
and that it puts me always in a very

789
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:22,159
difficult position the reason for that

790
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:24,280
is because if we had one cannabis I go

791
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,240
into a store and say give me give me

792
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,240
cannabis and they give you cannabis that

793
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,319
would be Rel easy to answer

794
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,559
unfortunately the choice that consumers

795
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,359
have these days especially in states

796
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:37,358
where I mean in states where it's legal

797
00:34:34,358 --> 00:34:40,639
obviously is is gigantic and there are

798
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:42,598
so many small differences you know

799
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,159
they're not big differences at the end

800
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:47,000
of the day you go into a a dispensary

801
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:50,280
and you look around it's pretty much all

802
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,199
kush but it's still it's still you know

803
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,159
there are still different varieties and

804
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:57,239
different levels of potency Etc so what

805
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,200
do I recommend I have to recommend you

806
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:01,358
know I mean I can recommend easily to a

807
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:03,719
nerd but it's difficult to recommend to

808
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:06,279
a person lay person who does not know

809
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:09,519
about this so I say look start a five

810
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:11,760
milligram THC I wish that you know they

811
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,880
could go into a store pull out a little

812
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,480
thing like this and say oh 5 milligram

813
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,160
of THC is this much unfortunately as you

814
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,039
well know doesn't work that way it's not

815
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:23,000
that simple but anyway start a five

816
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:27,679
milligram THC if you are a

817
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:31,239
Man start at 2.5 if you're a woman

818
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:37,279
and the reason for that is that women uh

819
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:40,279
tend to respond more uh profoundly to

820
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,680
cannabis mostly I I think because they

821
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:46,119
metabolize it more quickly to something

822
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:50,399
else called 11 hydroxy THC which is even

823
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:53,760
more poent than THC is so 2.5 as a woman

824
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,960
five milligram as a man and and by that

825
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,800
I mean of course a man you know between

826
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,199
say 70 and 90 kilograms of weight if you

827
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,960
have an obese person is different if you

828
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:07,239
have a child I do not recommend using

829
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,000
cannabis period that's a different story

830
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:13,118
maybe for for a separate question so now

831
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,358
we are between 2.5 and five and you do

832
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,838
that for a couple of weeks you cannot do

833
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:19,880
it just for a day you and by the way you

834
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,239
don't need to have a high it does not

835
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,000
necess you don't necessarily need to be

836
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:26,799
to feel the high you will feel certainly

837
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
something if you're completely naive you

838
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,920
feel imulation but not it's not going to

839
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:36,559
be a real intoxication in a normal

840
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:40,760
person and uh but if you don't feel any

841
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:44,480
s sign any relief from pain I would go I

842
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:47,880
would increase the dose maybe to 10

843
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:51,880
milligram and five milligram five in a

844
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:54,318
woman 10 in a man and or maybe 7.5

845
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:58,000
depending on how risk averse you one is

846
00:36:54,318 --> 00:37:00,318
the risk there again is to uh is to be

847
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,119
unable to drive a car for example being

848
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:05,920
you know having having you know an

849
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,800
intoxicating intoxication intoxicating

850
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,599
response and being unable to drive a

851
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,280
operate Machinery drive a car but you

852
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:13,880
could also offset that by using it at

853
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,640
night and that depends again on your

854
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,760
pain condition and a lot of people

855
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:19,960
especially people in my age group who

856
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,200
now start using cannabis because they

857
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:24,159
have pains and aches and don't sleep

858
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:26,639
well they use it at night that's the

859
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:29,078
ideal scenario it's an ideal scenar

860
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:31,159
scario because if you if you dose if you

861
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:34,760
take a relatively low dose of cannabis

862
00:37:31,159 --> 00:37:37,000
at night 5 10 milligrams 15 milligram 20

863
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:40,680
milligram tops 10 milligram 20 milligram

864
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,039
tops then you are very unlikely to have

865
00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:46,838
any side effects and you will wake up in

866
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:50,039
the morning with very little hangover if

867
00:37:46,838 --> 00:37:51,799
any the only thing that will undoubtedly

868
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:54,920
happen is that your REM sleep so the

869
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:57,400
Sleep associated with with with dreams

870
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,440
will be pushed toward the end of the

871
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,119
night so you will wake up remember every

872
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,760
single dream you made but aside from

873
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:08,720
that you know you may make up a little

874
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:10,680
hungry maybe but not necessarily so

875
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:12,559
that's my suggestion if you can use it

876
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:15,318
at night use it a fairly low doses

877
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:17,279
tiated yourself don't you know and often

878
00:38:15,318 --> 00:38:19,679
if you ask the the Physicians they won't

879
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,119
know what to say in some cases actually

880
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:25,118
and this is scandalous in my opinion but

881
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:27,119
I've heard of situations where the where

882
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,240
Physicians have been ordered by their

883
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,760
bosses not to advise on cannabis because

884
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:34,519
they you know some some people are just

885
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:37,119
so paranoid about

886
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:41,000
it in some fields of

887
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,920
medicine thank you very much Dr pelly um

888
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,000
that's a wonderful response I Now

889
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,760
understand why I remember all of my

890
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,559
dreams absolutely like I'm anecdotal

891
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,800
evidence to that one so London who you

892
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:57,199
got up next Kyle I I got I get to ask my

893
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,480
question because I I mean other than

894
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,679
your intro which I'm gonna have to like

895
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,880
steal from you quick again at the end of

896
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:06,239
the show but one thing I I really want

897
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,160
to dig into and and well actually it's

898
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,239
it's it's really a little bit more open

899
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,838
question that I mean you're really if

900
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:15,078
you look at we have a shared document

901
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:16,920
that we put up of of links to all the

902
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:19,318
papers that you've released over over

903
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:20,960
the years and then I mean just in 2023

904
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:22,199
alone I don't know how many there were

905
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,679
there I think there were seven or eight

906
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:27,039
papers um that were released that you

907
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:29,759
know are coming forward what is

908
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:31,318
something that maybe not is common

909
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,520
knowledge I mean of course we have a lot

910
00:39:31,318 --> 00:39:35,039
of people that are very invested in

911
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,119
cannabis that people don't know or that

912
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,800
every person should know about cannabis

913
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,680
that isn't being spoken about right now

914
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,519
what's something that um you know the

915
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,759
average person on in the world should

916
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:48,719
know about cannabis that isn't that

917
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,200
isn't common knowledge at this point in

918
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:55,759
time well

919
00:39:52,199 --> 00:40:00,279
uh I I I I feel that there are so many

920
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:03,640
things that uh as you said the LA person

921
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:06,079
who is not an expert in cannbis will not

922
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:08,440
know and the main problem is that we're

923
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,318
are facing just a barrage of this

924
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,280
information and misinformation that

925
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:16,400
comes from uh you know from the from the

926
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,760
media and um and that disinformation

927
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,599
comes into two basic buckets one is

928
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,000
those who love cannabis and think is you

929
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:27,599
know the best things in slic bread and

930
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,079
those who hate cannabis and they think

931
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,680
is it's going to kill you if you even

932
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:33,480
sniff it and so unfortunately this is we

933
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,159
are Lally between a rock and a hard

934
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:40,079
place and both position are obviously

935
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:41,598
wrong uh but um and you know one picks

936
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,960
you know people pick one or the other

937
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,039
maybe based on political inclinations or

938
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,119
personal experience what not but not

939
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:51,318
really Based on data so what I if there

940
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,920
was one thing about Canabis that I I

941
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:57,079
would tell sort of the average person

942
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,760
who you know

943
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:03,560
doesn't know much about it is don't be

944
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,640
afraid of it as long as you're not a

945
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:09,039
teenager if you are a

946
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:11,279
teenager um and you really want to test

947
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:13,519
you really want to try it fine but just

948
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,200
don't do it that often do it maybe once

949
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:19,358
a week don't make sure you don't do it

950
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:20,838
daily but if you are an adult don't be

951
00:41:19,358 --> 00:41:22,440
too afraid of it don't think it's going

952
00:41:20,838 --> 00:41:24,759
to kill you because it's not going to

953
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,559
kill you uh but on the other hand

954
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:30,319
consider that there is a finite chance

955
00:41:27,559 --> 00:41:32,599
in that you could become um it could

956
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:36,000
become habitual that you could just want

957
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:38,559
to do it regardless of what you know you

958
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,760
know you rather stay home excuse me and

959
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:44,719
smoke pop than say go to the the movies

960
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:48,000
with your

961
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,000
girlfriend excuse

962
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:54,078
me so and um sorry my my throat is

963
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,559
giving

964
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:00,160
me a little bit of a problem

965
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:02,719
I don't know something in the

966
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:05,118
air anyway so I guess what I'm trying to

967
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:05,118
say

968
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:10,679
is don't uh don't be paranoid about

969
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:13,039
cannabis a lot of people are

970
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:15,759
and and that's wrong but don't be too

971
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:18,199
laical about it either fit it with

972
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,160
respect that it deserves if it's

973
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:24,000
something you want to add to your life

974
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:25,799
just be careful with it and if you're if

975
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,400
you have kids and they're they want to

976
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,400
experience with

977
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:35,160
it direct them to an experimentation

978
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,800
that is free of harm so small you know

979
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:39,480
in a in a controlled

980
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,960
environment and most importantly not too

981
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:44,599
frequent because we are discovering

982
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:47,199
about long-term effects of cannabis that

983
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:49,599
are very very very

984
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,159
surprising let me give you an

985
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,760
example

986
00:42:51,159 --> 00:42:57,519
people get really freaked out about

987
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:59,599
cannabis and schizophrenia right

988
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:01,960
I think that that's overblown I think

989
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:06,200
that is completely overblown I think

990
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:09,440
that is uh yes there is evidence of an

991
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:12,919
increased risk with heavy Canabis use in

992
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,599
in adolescence but I think by and large

993
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:18,880
that evidence

994
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:21,039
is difficult to interpret but for

995
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,880
example use of cannabis during

996
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:27,239
adolescent will likely

997
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:30,358
cause permanent changes in your ad organ

998
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:32,838
you know your your ability to store fat

999
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:36,199
in Aros tissue white and

1000
00:43:32,838 --> 00:43:38,838
brown will probably change for life if

1001
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:41,199
you use regularly during adolescence and

1002
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:44,159
we have evidence from animal studies but

1003
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:48,000
also evidence from Human large number of

1004
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:51,440
human studies so that could be something

1005
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,559
you want to think about because before

1006
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,920
you enter you adopt a behavior that you

1007
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:59,640
know for a fact is going to change you

1008
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,800
forever and

1009
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:04,960
without with consequences that are not

1010
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,160
clear and cannot be fully be predicted a

1011
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,800
priority I think one should be really

1012
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:11,639
careful and I think that's the way I

1013
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,280
would talk to my daughter I mean I my

1014
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:15,358
daughter asked me about it and that's

1015
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,559
what I told her look look sweetie this

1016
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:19,039
is what it is if you really have to do

1017
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:21,640
it because your friends are pushing you

1018
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:24,440
because you're curious just try not to

1019
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:27,558
do it frequently do it every once a week

1020
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:30,240
or something like that and and and don't

1021
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,079
exaggerate it's just a just a basic rule

1022
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:34,000
so this is what I would tell people

1023
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,039
would not be like something very very

1024
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,960
technal would just be a way of assuaging

1025
00:44:37,039 --> 00:44:42,000
fears but also at the same time of not

1026
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:44,000
making look like okay cannabis just a

1027
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,239
glass of water you drink a glass of

1028
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,000
water you get you can smoke a a whole

1029
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:54,159
joint especially these days at 24% 25%

1030
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:57,960
30% THC the whole joint is a lot of THC

1031
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:57,960
so I would be I would be careful there

1032
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:03,039
awesome well I think there's I I I've

1033
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:04,800
always kind of landed in the middle spot

1034
00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:07,079
I like to think myself is although I've

1035
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,280
been a very passionate cannabis advocate

1036
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,800
for me it's always there's no matter

1037
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,400
what there's danger to everything like

1038
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,720
you know like 150 people die a year in

1039
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:17,720
the states alone from Tylenol right

1040
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:19,159
everything has its risk and everything

1041
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:21,239
has its safety so and we're still

1042
00:45:19,159 --> 00:45:23,399
learning so much and I think you know as

1043
00:45:21,239 --> 00:45:25,679
a parent as well I look at my kids and

1044
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,680
go I look at my kids and go you know if

1045
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:28,719
if what what my parents said to me was

1046
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,000
this terrible you're going to make

1047
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:32,358
yourself stupid and all that and when I

1048
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,239
spoke I'm like oh well this isn't true

1049
00:45:32,358 --> 00:45:35,679
where now I can have a more realistic

1050
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:37,399
Viewpoint of going to my children and

1051
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:38,679
going hey well you know like if you're

1052
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,480
going to do it which I'm probably not

1053
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:43,719
going to stop be able to stop you

1054
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,719
because you're my kids um at least like

1055
00:45:43,719 --> 00:45:47,199
you can do it in moderation this is why

1056
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:49,679
you should and I think it's a really

1057
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:51,358
important and valuable insight to have I

1058
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:53,960
want to give give the floor for one more

1059
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:56,480
question from from Kyle as I we we got

1060
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,159
his question cut off earlier um and then

1061
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,240
if I can just get you a little bit of an

1062
00:45:58,159 --> 00:46:01,480
intro just after that so before we run

1063
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:02,959
and finish off the show I want to be

1064
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,679
respectful for your time we said we

1065
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,199
would be till about I believe 6:30 PST

1066
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:09,239
so I don't don't want to take too much

1067
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:12,078
of your time I'm sure you have a dinner

1068
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:14,358
to get to go

1069
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,640
ahead so so now that we've got the

1070
00:46:14,358 --> 00:46:20,920
explanation of the pericin avonoids uh I

1071
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:23,400
have some questions about pae and OA as

1072
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:26,200
a as a supplement so I've and this

1073
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:28,599
question comes from uh Jason I guess

1074
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:30,199
inspired by Jason Wilson who uh I

1075
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:32,119
believe you've been on his show before

1076
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:34,279
um as well curious about cannabis but

1077
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:37,160
essentially he uses cannabis for his

1078
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:39,440
chronic pain and he has told me that

1079
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:42,519
when he uses pea as a supplement as an

1080
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,440
adjunct his his pain score goes way down

1081
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:47,759
like markedly and it's it's very

1082
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:50,920
noticeable um and so given what you know

1083
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:52,880
about PA and oea and its functions is

1084
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,519
that something that people you know

1085
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,400
people can be doing regularly is that

1086
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:57,199
something that people should be

1087
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:00,400
concerned learned about uh I know You'

1088
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:01,799
mentioned it targets uh par Alpha so is

1089
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,440
there such a thing as the potential for

1090
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,400
par Alpha down regulation with overuse

1091
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,039
is there is there any potential

1092
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,480
downsides that you see to using these

1093
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:11,838
things as adjunct either for pain and

1094
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,358
inflammation or in the case of oea for

1095
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:16,199
something like weight loss and

1096
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:18,759
dieting well that that's very very very

1097
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:21,598
thoughtful question so first of all your

1098
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:24,440
friend the person who uses THC cannabis

1099
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:28,280
THC containing cannabis and then when

1100
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:31,559
they add PA they find this much more

1101
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,480
pronounced effect uh this is an anecdote

1102
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:37,519
of course but actually fits extremely

1103
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:40,159
well with a very very important body of

1104
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:44,039
preclinical data data in animals showing

1105
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:48,799
that co-activation of the CB1 canabo

1106
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:51,838
receptors by an endide or by THC and the

1107
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:54,680
P Offa receptor by paa co-activation of

1108
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:57,558
these two receptors is synergistic which

1109
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:59,358
means that if one one produces two and

1110
00:47:57,559 --> 00:48:01,160
the other produces two in isolation when

1111
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:04,119
you put it together you actually have

1112
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:06,480
more like 20 and this is something that

1113
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:09,480
is very very very striking in animal in

1114
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:12,440
animal models the reason for that is

1115
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:15,119
because um it's quite interesting P

1116
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:17,760
Alpha and CB1 each

1117
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:20,920
independently is capable of reducing

1118
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,720
pain but through different mechanisms so

1119
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,200
when you add the two of them together

1120
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:27,318
the two mechanisms don't overlap so

1121
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:31,519
because they don't overlap you they

1122
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:33,558
don't block one another and but in fact

1123
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:36,480
they potential they potentiate one

1124
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:38,480
another so the the end result is I said

1125
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,240
is is sort of what we call formally a

1126
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:45,280
synergism a pharmacological

1127
00:48:41,239 --> 00:48:47,598
synergism uh this said pa alone is used

1128
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,960
and is sold in you know in Europe and in

1129
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,480
the United States uh in Europe is

1130
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,199
actually prescribed and found in

1131
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:56,199
pharmacies in the United States is

1132
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:59,838
mostly on Amazon or or we sites like

1133
00:48:56,199 --> 00:49:03,759
that and paa alone has some analgesic

1134
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:06,880
effect it's a it's a very safe compound

1135
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,559
uh it's considered Gras or grass

1136
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:13,838
generally recognized as

1137
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:16,480
safe uh I don't know if any even even

1138
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:18,838
squeezing my brain I can't remember of

1139
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:22,039
any single you know negative effect with

1140
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:24,798
PA that one should be concerned

1141
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:27,159
about but of course we're all different

1142
00:49:24,798 --> 00:49:30,000
right and so if one person decides to

1143
00:49:27,159 --> 00:49:31,639
use PA for their pain for example

1144
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,838
moderate pain I wouldn't use it for

1145
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:36,558
anything too serious because for

1146
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:38,558
instance I'll explain in a minute if you

1147
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:40,680
if they decide to use it just monitor

1148
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,720
yourself just like with THC not like

1149
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:45,838
with everything else monitor yourself

1150
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:47,598
you know don't let yourself in you know

1151
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:49,920
do an experiment on yourself you know

1152
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:51,798
you tried for a week for two weeks if

1153
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,240
something strange happens for example

1154
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:57,920
you get a pain somewhere that you don't

1155
00:49:54,239 --> 00:50:00,838
that is new to you stop wait and if the

1156
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:03,639
the new pain disappears likely it was

1157
00:50:00,838 --> 00:50:06,078
caused by paa but some weird reaction to

1158
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:07,879
PA we all are weird you know in a sense

1159
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:10,880
we all are different animals right we're

1160
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,960
not mice or rats we're not congenic so

1161
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:15,039
we need to we need to be cognizant of

1162
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,798
that so that's for PA I think you

1163
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:20,558
mentioned oea as well oea it's

1164
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:24,318
interesting is um a little bit more

1165
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:27,200
complicated than PA is is not quite as

1166
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:30,400
clearly as safe OA is is probably quite

1167
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:34,239
safe but um we don't have as much data

1168
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:36,798
on OA as we do on paa and Pa the main

1169
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:39,159
the effect of PA if you take it by mouth

1170
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:40,880
the main effect is actually to reduce

1171
00:50:39,159 --> 00:50:42,920
food intake so it will reduce your

1172
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,720
appetite will use your hunger and it

1173
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,838
does so in a weird way it does so in an

1174
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:51,318
interesting way it does not really make

1175
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:54,519
you eat less in a meal but it prolongs

1176
00:50:51,318 --> 00:50:59,199
the time between one meal and the next

1177
00:50:54,519 --> 00:51:01,920
meal so I you know even if you have a

1178
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:03,879
relatively small meal now you're not

1179
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,200
going to be hungry two hours later you

1180
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:09,480
would probably be H hungry four hours

1181
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:11,480
later if you had a nice dose of oea this

1182
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:13,960
has been shown in animal models but also

1183
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:16,480
in humans actually OA is quite effective

1184
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:19,119
as an anti-obesity drug has been shown

1185
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,639
in clinical trials as an anti-obesity

1186
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:23,200
agent it's not a drug it's a natural

1187
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:27,279
component natural

1188
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:30,558
compound uh it's a for OA and Pa the

1189
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:33,559
same rule applies they are natural

1190
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:36,839
compounds and that is their that there

1191
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:39,079
is their their strong their for their

1192
00:51:36,838 --> 00:51:40,318
strength but also their weakness what is

1193
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:43,798
their strength the strength is that

1194
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:45,558
because they are natural our body uh so

1195
00:51:43,798 --> 00:51:48,039
they recognize the receptors they do

1196
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:52,319
their thing and then our body disposes

1197
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:54,480
of them very quickly okay and that is

1198
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:57,639
important because if you overactivate

1199
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,599
the P Alpha receptor as you pointed out

1200
00:51:57,639 --> 00:52:01,598
you can risk to downregulate the

1201
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:03,119
receptor in fact you have all sort of

1202
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:05,599
effects not just the receptor down

1203
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,440
regulation all sort of nasty things you

1204
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,960
don't want to happen these are very

1205
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:13,318
delicate receptor systems right but

1206
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:15,079
instead you give OA pea you know they're

1207
00:52:13,318 --> 00:52:17,838
destroyed they activate the receptor

1208
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:20,760
they go away they're destroyed no no no

1209
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:23,279
no no no harm no

1210
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,000
foul this is a strength but it's also a

1211
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,200
weakness because of course you know if

1212
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,239
you want for example oea to go to a

1213
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:30,960
specific tissue I don't know the brain

1214
00:52:29,239 --> 00:52:32,838
good luck with that because you know it

1215
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,519
has to go through the intestinal mucose

1216
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:36,480
and through the intestinal mucosa where

1217
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:39,960
fats are absorbed then he has to pass

1218
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,199
the liver where oea finds an enzyme that

1219
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,679
destroys the whole role of that enzyme

1220
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:46,000
is to destroy OA and paa it's called fa

1221
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:48,239
again it's very abundant in the liver

1222
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,039
it's the same enzyme and so by the time

1223
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:52,598
you know you the blood exit the liver to

1224
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:55,679
go toward the brain the cerebral

1225
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:57,440
circulation oea is virtually old gone

1226
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:01,118
there is only the OA that is produced by

1227
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:03,079
the body so is is not a very good drug

1228
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:06,440
neither OA nor PA are good drugs because

1229
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:09,039
of this reason uh but the little the few

1230
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:11,679
things that they do they do well and

1231
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:15,079
they're safe the approach that I have

1232
00:53:11,679 --> 00:53:17,759
taken as a lab is again as I did for the

1233
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:20,280
endocannabinoids to try and block the

1234
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,760
degradation particularly of paa and

1235
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:27,000
there is one enzyme that is not far is

1236
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:31,079
called NLEA n it destroy PA and that

1237
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,280
enzyme is amazing is one is right now is

1238
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:36,599
my favorite enzyme right now I mean I I

1239
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,680
go by by years and so for for this year

1240
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:40,280
next year it's probably going to be my

1241
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:42,759
favorite enzyme and we develop

1242
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:44,839
inhibitors for these enzyme with call

1243
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,559
colleagues in Italy who are medicinal

1244
00:53:44,838 --> 00:53:48,920
chemists we develop inhibitors for this

1245
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:52,160
enzyme and these Inhibitors are killer

1246
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,838
analgesics they're just so good at

1247
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:55,879
blocking pain in animals and they're

1248
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:59,440
also very good anti-inflammatory

1249
00:53:55,880 --> 00:54:03,039
agents so my hope is that um yes it's

1250
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:05,280
good to use oea and Pa mostly PA OA we

1251
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:07,920
don't have as much data in terms of

1252
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,880
safety and some efficacy But ultimately

1253
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:13,318
what we want to do is to really use

1254
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:15,680
utilize make use of this system of this

1255
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:18,358
endogenous signaling system to achieve

1256
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:20,239
more efficacy for serious disorders like

1257
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:23,039
you know arthritis or chronic

1258
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:24,719
neuropathic pain Etc that was

1259
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:27,639
beautifully answered and the Tak homes

1260
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:29,399
that I got from that at least um are

1261
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:31,519
right pharmacological interventions and

1262
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,480
ways that we're trying to approach this

1263
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:34,960
Maybe by working on some of these

1264
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,400
enzymes or other things might be a good

1265
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,400
way but in terms of product formulators

1266
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,599
this is really great news like like you

1267
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,079
were saying the THC and Pa completely

1268
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:45,519
hitting different angles and kind of

1269
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:46,798
synergizing so it sounds like a lot of

1270
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:48,358
product formulators may want to consider

1271
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:51,039
using paracin abono a bit more in their

1272
00:54:48,358 --> 00:54:53,199
formulations what I got I hope I hope

1273
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:55,318
something there hope activity will

1274
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:56,759
develop in in that direction the FDA the

1275
00:54:55,318 --> 00:54:59,639
Food and Drug Administration does not

1276
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:02,079
like combining things they get all

1277
00:54:59,639 --> 00:55:04,279
freaked out when you combine things and

1278
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:06,119
you know and you know they care about

1279
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,480
well they seem to care about safety

1280
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:09,720
sometimes they do sometimes they don't

1281
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:11,719
depends on who on the situation but

1282
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:14,480
let's not go there it's politics

1283
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:16,598
is you know it it's fascinating to a

1284
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,960
chemist like me that a single double

1285
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:23,680
bond that's in the middle of that fatty

1286
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:26,000
chain has anything to do with anything

1287
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:30,679
you know right I mean it's like

1288
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:32,440
right so it's uncanny not it's uncanny

1289
00:55:30,679 --> 00:55:35,399
it is

1290
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:39,240
uncanny the the the the polyunsaturate

1291
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:41,400
analoges like L linolenic and linolic do

1292
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:45,879
those ethanolamides

1293
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:48,920
have CB1 they do primarily CB1 as you

1294
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:51,400
start adding double bonds it goes toward

1295
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:53,000
the CB1 if you remove the double bonds

1296
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,000
as you remove them it goes towards the

1297
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,679
peer

1298
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,358
Alpha and ER and uh in know people have

1299
00:55:58,679 --> 00:56:01,679
done including on my lab we have done

1300
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:04,598
you know structureal activity

1301
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:08,199
relationship studies showing exactly

1302
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:09,480
that and so and from an evolutionary

1303
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:11,159
perspective I think it's interesting

1304
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,400
because canab receptors are relatively

1305
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:15,038
new in evolution they're not present in

1306
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:17,440
insects they're probably present in

1307
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:20,720
cordada but they they're not present in

1308
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:23,440
bacteria or unicellular organisms but or

1309
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:26,838
implants but the these implants for

1310
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:29,559
example have something similar to PA

1311
00:56:26,838 --> 00:56:32,078
right that is also a signal in molecule

1312
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:34,680
I think that in order

1313
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:39,318
to the during Evolution the addition of

1314
00:56:34,679 --> 00:56:41,838
double bonds help uh sort of diversify

1315
00:56:39,318 --> 00:56:44,279
this General class of molecules of fatty

1316
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:46,519
acid ethanolamides that had all sort of

1317
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,640
signaling functions already Diversified

1318
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:52,519
them in a specific direction away from P

1319
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:53,879
Alpha toward GPR cap receptors like P

1320
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:55,480
CB1 and

1321
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,400
CB2

1322
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,400
I mean it's total speculation but I I

1323
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,960
mean and no one will ever know but you

1324
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:05,358
know it's it's a nice just so story I

1325
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,358
like to tell that to myself at

1326
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:10,038
night by the way here is a suggestion to

1327
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:12,199
your viewers if you you mention my

1328
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:14,079
papers before than you so much for that

1329
00:57:12,199 --> 00:57:15,759
if you have problems with cannabis and

1330
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:18,200
still want to sleep read my papers that

1331
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:21,799
way you'll your right to sleep no

1332
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:23,558
problem and no risk of

1333
00:57:21,798 --> 00:57:25,759
intoxication that's awesome you

1334
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:27,319
mentioned Italy and you know I didn't

1335
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,119
know if i' I've mentioned it before but

1336
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:32,358
I actually I'm I get to go back to

1337
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:34,480
Florence on the on the 23rd to go visit

1338
00:57:32,358 --> 00:57:38,239
my family and I I'm currently living in

1339
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:41,119
Croatia so it's like 2 am here or 3:30

1340
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:43,838
at this point in time so but uh I have a

1341
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:49,160
friend sativa Creations is his brand but

1342
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:50,440
he Mel Moda maaari always M pronounce

1343
00:57:49,159 --> 00:57:53,558
his last name but he works with some of

1344
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:56,119
the uh Italian Italian experts in the

1345
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:58,039
area so I bet you there's maybe one or

1346
00:57:56,119 --> 00:58:02,519
two apart here so do you get over to

1347
00:57:58,039 --> 00:58:05,920
Italy very often or are you you want a

1348
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:07,400
here I was there um I mean not during

1349
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:09,798
covid I went there because my mother

1350
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:13,240
passed away and I had some business to

1351
00:58:09,798 --> 00:58:15,519
do there but um then I I missed a year I

1352
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:18,759
was there in in October

1353
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:21,079
actually to for work mainly but I did

1354
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:23,240
stop in my hometown to to see my my old

1355
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:26,160
friends but Croatia is a beautiful

1356
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:28,358
beautiful country you are very well set

1357
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:30,318
I I'm very lucky you know it's no it's

1358
00:58:28,358 --> 00:58:31,598
no Italy you know don't tell the

1359
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:34,119
Croatian that because they'll kill me

1360
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:36,000
and they're all 18 feet tall so you know

1361
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:37,599
I'm just this little like half Italian

1362
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,559
guy so they're they're all a lot bigger

1363
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:44,000
than me um but I I have the the South

1364
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:46,319
like my my family is from the south and

1365
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,838
and we have a farm down there and it's

1366
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:50,318
just just something about it you know

1367
00:58:47,838 --> 00:58:53,318
between the cheese and the bread and the

1368
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:54,679
people it's it's magical to me so we're

1369
00:58:53,318 --> 00:58:56,279
we're actually I'm getting my C

1370
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:58,960
citizenship and moving there full-time

1371
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:01,559
and by should be by Summer we we all

1372
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:03,440
have my passport but I wanted to just do

1373
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:05,400
one last thing and ask you how can we

1374
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,880
support what's going on with you with

1375
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,400
all the research you're doing where can

1376
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,119
we check out more where can our our our

1377
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:13,160
I mean we we will of course share the

1378
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:15,160
link in our description of of where we

1379
00:59:13,159 --> 00:59:17,519
found the grouping of your papers but

1380
00:59:15,159 --> 00:59:20,279
where else can can people find out more

1381
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:21,480
and and get more involved if they would

1382
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:24,039
like

1383
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:25,159
to but you know I I don't do a lot of

1384
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:27,440
social media

1385
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:29,199
and that's a that's a weakness but you

1386
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,440
know my my journal does cannabis and

1387
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:32,639
canab research has you know some social

1388
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,920
media

1389
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:38,920
activity if your viewers are interested

1390
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:41,159
in uh in exploring and understanding and

1391
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:45,280
mostly if they're interesting interested

1392
00:59:41,159 --> 00:59:46,920
in solid information about cannabis and

1393
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,119
a cannabinoids really cannabis and

1394
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:52,159
cannabinoid research is a good is a good

1395
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:55,400
source of information uh is very

1396
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:57,879
scholarly of course very technical but

1397
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:59,318
at least everything is double double

1398
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:02,160
checked is vetted through the peer

1399
00:59:59,318 --> 01:00:05,119
review system and we also as a journal

1400
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:08,440
try to uh to explore everything Canabis

1401
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:11,280
so we go from the plant uh we publish

1402
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:14,519
papers in mody for example all the way

1403
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:17,480
to the clinic and to not just that we

1404
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:19,960
even go into the into policy so and we

1405
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,159
have editors for policy editors for boty

1406
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:25,159
editors for this and that so it's a

1407
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:28,239
place where I think um

1408
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:31,078
people will be able to find Reliable

1409
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:34,358
information there are unfortunately a

1410
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:35,880
bunch of sites out there to make money

1411
01:00:34,358 --> 01:00:37,159
that and we don't make money at least I

1412
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,318
don't make money out of that I don't

1413
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:42,239
know someone must you know good for them

1414
01:00:39,318 --> 01:00:45,798
but I don't uh NE do any of the of the

1415
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:48,279
editors and whatnot but the um there are

1416
01:00:45,798 --> 01:00:50,880
uh sites out there like this American

1417
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:54,200
Journal of endoc canaby as if it was

1418
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:57,318
even a discipline that I really I really

1419
01:00:54,199 --> 01:01:00,239
just to you know just to sell stuff and

1420
01:00:57,318 --> 01:01:02,279
I I I think people should be very aware

1421
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:04,919
about that because of course you know

1422
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:07,359
the in the case incentives are different

1423
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:09,760
and uh while everyone has got incentives

1424
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:12,239
incentive to sell is probably the

1425
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:15,440
strongest incentive to fool people and

1426
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:16,479
so I would be very careful in into using

1427
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,960
you

1428
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:22,519
know those quote unquote journals is a

1429
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,519
source of of reliable

1430
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,440
information

1431
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:51,480
[Music]

1432
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:54,480
know keeping with

1433
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,480
the
