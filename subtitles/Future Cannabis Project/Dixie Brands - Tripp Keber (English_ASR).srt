1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,989
[Music]

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,679
we're not going to pay attention what's

3
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:23,719
on the front of this magazine but more

4
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:26,118
importantly on the back hello

5
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:28,598
California

6
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:30,399
uh no no no no this is the more

7
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:32,599
important side of this magazine from my

8
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:34,399
perspective but uh first and foremost I

9
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:37,238
want to thank very much the uh producers

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,320
of this event uh state of marijuana it's

11
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:42,159
an honor it's a privilege to represent

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,520
what I believe are thousands if not tens

13
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:47,759
of thousands of entrepreneurs men and

14
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,440
women that are truly beginning to

15
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:53,159
prosper uh I don't know uh I'd actually

16
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:55,198
like to get a hand a show of hands who

17
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,759
here is from

18
00:00:55,198 --> 00:01:00,558
California everybody uh well that is

19
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:03,320
terrific from my perspective because

20
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:05,798
I've been reflecting for the last 45

21
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,719
minutes to an hour when the last time I

22
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,040
spoke uh to the Cannabis industry in

23
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,599
California and to be honest with you

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,640
this may be my official first so

25
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:18,399
hopefully you guys will be kind and

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,319
gentle to me but um I've been here for

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,079
about a week now and it is incredibly

28
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:26,679
exciting to see what is taking place in

29
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:28,599
your state I think everybody in this

30
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,479
room would agree that it was a

31
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:32,759
disappointment if you will

32
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,478
when Colorado legalized marijuana for

33
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,640
adult use in advance of California and

34
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:41,359
then to rub salt into the wound then

35
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:43,759
Washington state did it uh nobody has

36
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,759
worked harder to legalize adult used

37
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,680
cannabis in the United States than your

38
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:52,319
home state and I'm incredibly proud of

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,320
what you guys have

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,920
accomplished that's right I mean it it

41
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,439
really deserves uh certainly more than

42
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,478
uh a 5-second round of applause uh

43
00:02:00,438 --> 00:02:06,718
people have made tireless uh effort uh

44
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:08,800
made massive sacrifice and I can feel it

45
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,919
because I've been in the market albeit

46
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,560
only a week as a sales professional

47
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,479
literally carrying my Wares uh and we

48
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,640
are finally uh successfully launched my

49
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:22,318
brand which is that of Dixie Brands uh

50
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,199

partnership with indis Holdings out of

52
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:30,238
montere California montere County uh we

53
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:32,878

54
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,439
products uh in the state serving Today

55
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:35,199
medical marijuana patients what we hope

56
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:37,400
to

57
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:40,079
be adult use

58
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,920
consumers so when I was uh honored to

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,120
speak today uh here at the state of

60
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:48,158
marijuana conference uh they said we'd

61
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,480
like to talk to you or we'd like for you

62
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:52,840
to talk to our audience about you know

63
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:55,280
so you want to get into the marijuana

64
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,360
business uh which I'm happy to share

65
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,680
with you uh on certain days I would

66
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,760
encourage you to run the opposite

67
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,120
direction but that day is not today I'm

68
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:07,158
feeling very very bullish but again just

69
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,039
a quick raise of hands Who currently is

70
00:03:07,158 --> 00:03:11,598
actively in the Cannabis space whether

71
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,919
it be direct to the plant cultivation

72
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:17,158
manufacturing retail distribution or

73
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,158
serving as an ancillary

74
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,640
service okay a majority so what I'll

75
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,039
call a target-rich

76
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:26,798
environment um I'm going to go ahead and

77
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:29,479
move to the next slide I'm also going to

78
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,560
get out of the way it's probably easier

79
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,959
um

80
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,959
and what I was asked to talk about again

81
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:38,640
is you know trying to either convince

82
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,360
positively or suggest otherwise that you

83
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:44,158
make a move into the space and the good

84
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:48,200
news is that we have a majority of the

85
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:52,120
uh audience already into uh the space in

86
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:54,000
N excuse me in 2009 uh I was basically

87
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,959
temporarily retired I'm a seral

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,239
entreprenur uh and I've owned many many

89
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:04,000
businesses I'm a frustrated slash a

90
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,719
retired developer uh which in 2008 2009

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
we all knew what that meant both here in

92
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:10,598
the state of C California but also

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,799
around the country I've owned nightclubs

94
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:16,079
I've done technology uh telefony voice

95
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,560
and data um and at the time I was

96
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,560
basically

97
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,560
bored and I was in the bar

98
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:25,800
business successfully Distributing

99
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,560
probably a far dangerous product than

100
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,079
marijuana which is alcohol I think

101
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,879
everybody would believe that that's

102
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,680
right effing

103
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:37,719
right and I noticed as an astute

104
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:41,560
Observer that people that consume

105
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,960
marijuana generally drink less alcohol

106
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,240
and when you're in the alcohol

107
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,239
distribution

108
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,960
business and people are smoking

109
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,519
marijuana outside of your restaurant or

110
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:53,079
your nightclub that poses a

111
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,120
problem and so literally I asked the law

112
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:58,159
enforcement officers that were outside

113
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,759
of my club that were working for us I

114
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,320
said we have to get these gentlemen many

115
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,759
and women back inside the club because

116
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:04,360
you know they're smoking marijuana I'm

117
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,960
not sure if that's allowed and literally

118
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,038
in Epiphany he corrected me and said no

119
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:10,879
we had passed medical marijuana in the

120
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,079
state of Colorado and I was shocked I

121
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:15,199
knew nothing about it you know I'm

122
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,478
slightly sheepishly embarrassed that up

123
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,919
to that point I didn't have a very

124
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,199
strong relationship with cannabis each

125
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,639
and every day I try and improve that

126
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:25,199
relationship some days better than ever

127
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,680
uh better than others but uh you know

128
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,120
like our own president probably every

129
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,079
single person in this room that I

130
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,639
understand that marijuana is less

131
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:35,758
harmful than alcohol and so with that I

132
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:39,079
went on a journey and that Journey was

133
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,360
really to better understand about this

134
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:43,599
plant but again I'll sheepishly admit

135
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,600
and certainly I've

136
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,199
been critiqued for it that I got into

137
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,160
this business not to help people you

138
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,400
know boo his that would be the time to

139
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:58,160
to to boo uh I got into it to make money

140
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:01,560
and I saw a fascinating opportunity I

141
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,639
saw low barrier t ENT I saw a very

142
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:08,839
chaotic Marketplace I did not see very

143
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:12,439
sophisticated High financed players and

144
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:15,598
I said maybe I could make a move and get

145
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:18,680
into the space again I want to emphasize

146
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:21,279
that I got into it to make money and boy

147
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,038
was I wrong because anybody who's been

148
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:26,359
in this business for five minutes or

149
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:30,240
five years knows how incredibly

150
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:33,560
challenging it is to be in this space

151
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,879
it's a fascinating space what industry

152
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,439
can you all think of and we're going to

153
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,360
talk a little bit about it in a few

154
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:42,639
minutes where you can absolutely

155
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,160
unequivocally help people achieve a new

156
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,319
level of Wellness that you might not be

157
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,240
able to achieve through alcohol opiates

158
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:53,800
tobacco

159
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:57,360
even cure a to zed when it comes to ills

160
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,800
uh ailments or illnesses again I can't

161
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,160
make that claim I'm not a medical doctor

162
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,879
but our own very sanj Gupta has probably

163
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,879
done as much for marijuana reform in the

164
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,000
last three years that even MPP with

165
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,639
which I'm a board member has done the

166
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,120
last 20 I mean it's shocking I mean he

167
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,079
literally apologized to every single one

168
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,319
of us in this country for 20 years of

169
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:20,639
disinformation for sharing that this

170
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,280
plant is a dangerous narcotic come on

171
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,960
this is a

172
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:29,519
plant collap I mean uh we know what that

173
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:29,519
means right

174
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:37,478
it's just not the case I mean we are

175
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:40,478
absolutely seen proof through powerful

176
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:43,159
soldiers men like Dr excuse me women

177
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,519
excuse me women like Dr Sue sisly please

178
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,599
don't tell her I said that I'm on

179
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:49,038
occasion frightened of her what she's

180
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:52,079
doing for men and women soldiers

181
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:54,560
veterans that are coming back from

182
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,878
overseas that are suffering from

183
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:01,720
post-traumatic stress

184
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:04,039
disorder and 14% these 22 men and women

185
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:07,000
that are taking their own lives 22 of

186
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:09,038
them I wear proudly a uh dog tag that

187
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,240
was given to me by this organization I

188
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:14,279
wear it every single day 14% of them

189
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,280
have alcohol and opiates in their

190
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:19,119
system I mean this is I'm a businessman

191
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,239
you are business people in this room

192
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,879
when we lose money I promise you I do

193
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,240
everything I can to make it up I lose

194
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:32,038
$100,000 today I'm going to make

195
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:35,879
$200,000 tomorrow but 22 today Sunday 44

196
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:37,918
Monday 66 33,000 men and women are no

197
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:41,200
longer on this

198
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:45,319
planet because we cannot treat them

199
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,000
ostensibly with this harmless plan it's

200
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,200
messed

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,039
up

202
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:56,160
lastly well helping people we can make

203
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:59,480
money the state of California represents

204
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,159
the Glenn Gary Glenn Ros leads all right

205
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,440
if you've ever seen that movie and

206
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:05,240
there's a Salesman or salesperson in you

207
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,160
somewhere go out and watch it because

208
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,680
this state I don't care if it's 1.4

209
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,519
billion according to arkview or two

210
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:15,519
billion according to marijuana Business

211
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:17,200
Daily or 5 to 7 billion which is

212
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,159
probably closer to the reality what

213
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,160
you're talking about both the white the

214
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:24,120
gray and the black markets it's a big

215
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:27,759
big market and there's not going to be

216
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,000
one individual one company or one brand

217
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:34,240
that is going to own it there's going to

218
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,559
be dozens and dozens of people companies

219
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,278
brands that are going to

220
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:42,078
prosper and that should be an

221
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:45,958
inspiration to you because again if you

222
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:48,159
can help somebody you can make money and

223
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:50,639
ostensibly every single one of us I'm

224
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:53,159
looking around the room and I see faces

225
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:56,799
that I met six years ago every single

226
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:59,759
one of us is truly part of History think

227
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,879
of that think of The Perfect Storm if

228
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,838
that's not an inspiration then I'm not

229
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:07,759
going to be of help to you today but I

230
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:10,440
embrac that opportunity in 2009 and got

231
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:13,360
on to a journey onto a path that has

232
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,920
been very winding and very Meandering

233
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,320
and finds me here today selling cannabis

234
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,958
legally in the state of Colorado with a

235
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,399
fully licensed facility almost duplicate

236
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,199
to what we've built in Colorado which is

237
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,360
had a very very strong regulatory

238
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,720
framework for four plus

239
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,440
years and now d Dixie and other brands

240
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,360
many of which are represented here today

241
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,600
are

242
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,519
thriving I mean over the last four or

243
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,079
five days every time I sit down with a

244
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,720
business

245
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:46,638
owner the order gets bigger I mean your

246
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,120
state has a voracious voracious appetite

247
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,440
for

248
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,440
cannabis that's

249
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:02,720
right excuse me I'm fired up so

250
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:05,399
that's good news so the journey again

251
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,399
has brought me

252
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:11,919
here I have said this

253
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,720
literally a thousand times the only

254
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:19,199
thing that is consistent or constant is

255
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:22,000
change you have to have a delusional

256
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:25,000
confidence a term that I use and I'm

257
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,919
accused of on a daily basis sometimes

258
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,240
better sometimes for worse but literally

259
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:35,799
you're typical consumer packaged goods

260
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:38,399
company changes their packaging every 36

261
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:42,519
months 36 months three

262
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:45,320
years in the last 12 months I've changed

263
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:48,919
my packaging three

264
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,800
times and probably in the next six

265
00:11:48,919 --> 00:11:53,958
months I'll change it at least

266
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,639
definitively one more time the last time

267
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,199
I changed my packaging my Flagship

268
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,879
product which is that of the Dixie

269
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,720
Elixir I went from a 12

270
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:04,519
Flint bottle glass bottle very

271
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,278
inefficient not echo-friendly uh it was

272
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,039
glass it was Flint so you could see

273
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:09,559
through it we felt very very strongly

274
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:13,519
that you as a medical marijuana patient

275
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:15,119
or an adult used consumer could see in

276
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,839
we called them the uh dingleberries we

277
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,440
didn't want that those oil globules

278
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,920
floating we didn't want RPM raw plant

279
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,920
material on the bottom uh condensing so

280
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:27,198
we were very very proud of the emosion

281
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:29,599
that we created gone we started a 8.5

282
00:12:27,198 --> 00:12:31,719
ounce brushed aluminum bottle that we

283
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,839
thought would take the the market by

284
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:39,240
storm and it did incredibly exciting

285
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:42,279
fought viciously for this rigid platform

286
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,440
a container really to elevate our game

287
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:46,159
as an industry so that of my

288
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,120
contemporaries my competitors would do

289
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,719
the

290
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,240
same brilliant idea until the state of

291
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,920
Colorado's marijuana enforcement

292
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:58,519
division got involved and now today we

293
00:12:54,919 --> 00:13:02,000
manufactur in a same 8.5 ounce uh it's a

294
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:05,799
p BX it's plastic uh but we have now

295
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,198
what is a childproof tamper resistant

296
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:10,439
resealable dosing

297
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:12,039
cup I I mean I couldn't even get my

298
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,040
hands around it for weeks I didn't

299
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:15,278
understand but I surely this exists

300
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:18,919
somewhere in the

301
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:21,360
world wrong six weeks later I said I

302
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:25,360
must invent this product this platform

303
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:28,360
this Innovative delivery system again

304
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:31,199
$300,000 in expense that necessarily

305
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:33,680
wasn't plan for I didn't have this on my

306
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:36,120
pro forma every single one of you in

307
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,399
this room that is in a business that is

308
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,278
either serving the Cannabis

309
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,759
industry or is direct to the plant again

310
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:46,720
commercial cultivation

311
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:48,958
pesticides God is that going to become

312
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,959
an issue here in the state of California

313
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:54,359
we are getting crushed by it two

314
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:59,078
customers to vendors of mine who are

315
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:02,120
also customers combined 100,000 plants

316
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:05,479
quarantine for 4 months think of the

317
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,159
trickle down effect 100,000 plants two

318
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:12,120
retailers sitting on dozens of metric

319
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:14,679
tons of cannabis that adult use

320
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:18,399
consumers and medical marijuana patients

321
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:21,838
need okay they need them we couldn't get

322
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:26,120
them to the market fast enough that

323
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:30,240
change is what will separate the ladies

324
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,600
from the girls and the men from the boys

325
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,680
because you must have that delusional

326
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,360
confidence that you are going to break

327
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:39,559
through whatever the state is throwing

328
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,560
at

329
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:44,838
you and so you have to learn to embrace

330
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:48,359
it and again some days that's easier

331
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:50,480
than others but there are dozens and

332
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,320
dozens of situations or scenarios that I

333
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,839
could present to

334
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,440
you that indicate that the only thing

335
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,600
that is constant in this business is

336
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,079
change

337
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:06,639
and so when you go upstairs

338
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:09,000
tonight and reflecting on today's

339
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,480
discussions which I'm sure most of those

340
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
are far more interesed what I'm talking

341
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,240
about today really reflect what does

342
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,958
that mean to you I'm obsessive

343
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:21,440
compulsive and I'm a control freak I'm a

344
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:24,439
disaster for the Cannabis industry okay

345
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,639
so but my therapist promises me that I'm

346
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:30,959
going to be okay just use more

347
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,959
marijuana and let

348
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:41,879
tequila I hear from wouldbe Cannabis

349
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:45,600
entrepreneurs young men and

350
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:48,000
women seasoned veterans from other

351
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,680
Industries whether it be technology

352
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,759

commercial farmers and they say I am

354
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:57,440
going to get into the marijuana business

355
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,759
what do you

356
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,720
think I said well depends on what day of

357
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:07,399
the week it is but more

358
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,560
importantly really focus focus your

359
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:12,519
efforts Focus your business plans I've

360
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:15,719
been here for 30 40 minutes literally

361
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:18,600
I've been honored to meet a dozen plus

362
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,319
people that have been interested in

363
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,519
sharing a business plan with me I mean

364
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:28,519
that's exciting right every single day a

365
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:31,278
new idea is being formed I hear all the

366
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:34,600
time trip is it too late to get into the

367
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:37,919
Cannabis industry are you kidding me we

368
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:41,199
are literally in the bottom of the first

369
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:44,439
of a seven game series I mean this

370
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:47,879
industry is growing Leaps and Bounds

371
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:51,000
it's doubling on an annual basis and we

372
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:53,318
put the ceiling at about 50 billion 5

373
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,120
billion dollar but I want to remind you

374
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:58,360
of something most people do not use

375
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,159
marijuana in the United States or more

376
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:04,679
importantly around the globe because it

377
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:07,000
is illegal at the federal level now that

378
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,199
may seem silly to all of us sitting in

379
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,240
the room as we have Vape lounges

380
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,160
upstairs and we have you know adult use

381
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,679
cannabis rampant in the state of

382
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,919
Colorado to a positive effect but most

383
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,038
people in the state of California do not

384
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,520
use marijuana because it's illegal at

385
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:26,519
the federal level and they're not

386
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:30,000
perceived as a medical marijuana patient

387
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:32,960
how silly is that and so if it's $50

388
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,319
billion today and the federal government

389
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:40,400
capitulates on it tomorrow who knows

390
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:40,399
what that number is there's no

391
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:46,399
telling so that's a motivating factor

392
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:51,440
but again I will encourage you that not

393
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:55,440
every single opportunity is Right pick a

394
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:59,558
business pick an idea pick a segment of

395
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,720
this industry that is so fascinating

396
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:04,240
there is no MMJ for dummies book by the

397
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:08,159
way whoever writes it it's a free tip

398
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,640
will be a pot billionaire okay a

399
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:14,880
marijuana Maven whatever it

400
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,480
is the reality is is that today I own 28

401
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,760
companies related to

402
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,240
cannabis about half of those are what we

403
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:24,200
call Direct to the

404
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:27,558
plant but the other half are anary

405
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,558
services companies security companies

406
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:33,000
technology companies equipment

407
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:34,918
manufacturing companies all selling the

408
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,038
proverbial pick and shovel which is such

409
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:40,159
an overused cliche but it's it's it's

410
00:18:38,038 --> 00:18:43,359
accurate but I want to be very very

411
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:46,159
clear I spent the first three years

412
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:49,599
making literally hundreds and hundreds

413
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:52,240
of mistakes on an annual basis trying to

414
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:55,599
perfect how somebody really wants to get

415
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,079
in here uh or they're trying to get out

416
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:00,240
uh no they're trying to get in it's a

417
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:00,240
good sign

418
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,319
I'm honored I'm privileged to have

419
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:10,480
access to all these companies because

420
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,678
over those first three years I built a

421
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:16,079
brand and a product and we got good at

422
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,679
it we're still not great but we got good

423
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:21,798
at it and from there we were able to

424
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:25,320
diversify and through management through

425
00:19:21,798 --> 00:19:27,440
powerful women through powerful men that

426
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:30,558
work alongside me that I represent

427
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:33,840
really today which numberers close to

428
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:35,960
450 to 475 been gone for a month the

429
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,158
company will probably double who knows I

430
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,558
mean it's just it's growing that fast

431
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:44,039
but the reality is I focused on One

432
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:46,519
widget which was a marijuana infused

433
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:49,519
product today we have 150 of them

434
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:51,558
represented about 14 or 15 Delivery

435
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,839
Systems Tom was so incredibly generous

436
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:55,960
with this new uh story that came out to

437
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,558
highlight uh Tom you really didn't need

438
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:01,759
to use trip ink that was a little too

439
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:03,839
much but uh listen it's a

440
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,960
powerful

441
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,240
collaboration my company is called Dixie

442
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,159
brands for a reason I'm not smart enough

443
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,319
to figure this out myself and I know

444
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,120
that's self-deprecating but I am smart

445
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,678
enough to find an intelligent woman like

446
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:19,279
you that I can align myself with and

447
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:20,320
take what I've learned both good and bad

448
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,359
and pay it

449
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:27,519
forward so Dixie Brands is doing exactly

450
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:29,399
that most recently Foria which is a THC

451
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,960
infused personal lubricant designed to

452
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,919
enhance a woman's sexuality an amazing

453
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:38,440
product that I think is going to have

454
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:42,520
incredible legs these individuals just

455
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:44,798
needed help uh last month fascinating

456
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:47,480
experiment uh and I still live through

457
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:52,079
it we launched two Wellness companies

458
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:54,120
focused on cannabid CBD derived from

459
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:55,960
Whole plant

460
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,719
formulation

461
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,120
hemp we launched a wellness company

462
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,519
designed to serve the human beings or

463
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:06,839
the human race and we designed a product

464
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:09,798
to design our four-legged

465
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:12,119
companions pets no one cares about

466
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:14,558
accesso which is the human being company

467
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:17,000
it's it's all about therapists I did a

468
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:18,879
media tour last week every single

469
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,720
journalist all they wanted to talk about

470
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:25,600
is is Fluffy or Pho going to get high no

471
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,159
can uh cannabid does not have that

472
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,240
aspect to it it didn't matter that's all

473
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:30,799
they wanted to talk about but the

474
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,919
reality is getting back to the purpose

475
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:38,079
of point of this slide is that focus on

476
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,919
something that you see is an opportunity

477
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:42,599
and don't look for the shiny object over

478
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:46,120
here don't look for the next big thing

479
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:48,678
over here get good at what you want to

480
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:51,759
do find a product that you can sell to

481
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:53,000
me and I'll B buy more of it than you

482
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,599
likely can

483
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,200
produce and there's hundreds and

484
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,519
hundreds of

485
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,278
Manufacturers there are hundreds and

486
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:04,038
hundreds of customers both on the retail

487
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:07,119
the manufacturing and the commercial

488
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:09,038
cultivation side that are jonesing

489
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:11,359
jonesing for

490
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:14,038
technology the irony I sat down with the

491
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:15,599
CEO of CNBC which is where I get all my

492
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:17,599
marijuana information it's a great

493
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:21,558
source it seems like and Mig magazine

494
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:24,678
I'm sorry Tom um but you know the irony

495
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:26,759
of six years of risk of trials and

496
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:29,159
tribulations uh I sit on the board

497
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:30,480

00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:33,120
anybody familiar with

massroots kind of Facebook meets

Instagram meets cannabis a powerful

501
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:41,919
powerful movement semi Anonymous

502
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,720
Community uh that is allowing people to

503
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,360
share their experiences there are lots

504
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:48,360
of other uh companies that come out uh

505
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:51,959
this is a company that is likely going

506
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:53,678
to be uplisted to the NASDAQ in two to

507
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,880
four weeks this will be the first time

508
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,798
in history of the United States where a

509
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,200
cannabis themed company is on one of the

510
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:03,440
big boy boards you know we're not

511
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,159
talking about OTC ping sheets which when

512
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,640
I got into this business in nine was

513
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:10,320
zero in

514
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,559
2012 there was probably a dozen or two

515
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,879
dozen today there's probably an excess

516
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:17,839
of 200 plus publicly traded companies

517
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,679
many of those companies are incredibly

518
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:21,359
good companies that are committed to

519
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,400
compliance that are not selling

520
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:28,079
vaporware that are not pump and dump

521
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,159
shops but this is incredibly exciting to

522
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,038
see

523
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:34,960
what technology is going to be able to

524
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:37,278
do for individuals men and women that

525
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,919
potentially can't get into the space but

526
00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:44,079
want to participate in that green Rush

527
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,080
another satisfied customer

528
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:54,839
leaving the risk that we all

529
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,840
take is on occasion

530
00:23:54,919 --> 00:24:00,320
untenable I'm going to ask a a tough

531
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,759
question since 90% of you are in this

532
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:03,879
industry with me how many people have

533
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:09,038
been

534
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:11,278
afraid doing what you do truly

535
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:12,960
afraid I watched an interview with a

536
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,400
dear dear friend of mine Andy Williams

537
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,960
from medicine

538
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,038
man just a powerful person just a kind

539
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,840
gentle man and he was sharing with a

540
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:26,079
reporter that he was truly distraught in

541
00:24:22,839 --> 00:24:27,839
the early days I mean fantasizing

542
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,158
dreaming nightmares what I would call

543
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,278
them that the guys in the black boots

544
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,120
were going to be out in front of his

545
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:36,119
shop the day he pulled up I didn't tell

546
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:37,639
many people but I used to sit in my

547
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:39,558
conference room which was a big glass

548
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,080
window I had an office I sat in the

549
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:43,398
conference room because I could see the

550
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:46,119
trucks and the people pulling up into my

551
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:48,359
parking lot every day and I too

552
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:50,079
fantasized about the guys in the black

553
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:53,240
boots that were going to show up and

554
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:56,278
potentially take me off to jail I was

555
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,079
honored to represent the industry Steve

556
00:24:56,278 --> 00:24:59,720
Croft from 60 Minutes did an interview

557
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,639
and he asked me very succinctly he says

558
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,519
trip we want to understand how you sleep

559
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,120
at night because based on our

560
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:11,480
calculations you've qualified for about

561
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:14,599
six lifetime sentences for Kingpin

562
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,360
status hit home at that moment

563
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:20,558
right because I'm a father uh you know I

564
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:23,000
have family and I provide for not only

565
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:26,398
my own but for many others through

566
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,919
employment that was heavy

567
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:31,479
duty gossip but the reality is I answer

568
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,600
it I sleep fine at night and by the way

569
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,759
I don't even use marijuana very often

570
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:38,519
because I operate at the pleasure of the

571
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,640
state of Colorado just like today we

572
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:43,558
will be operating at the pleasure of the

573
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:47,080
State of California and so those fears

574
00:25:43,558 --> 00:25:52,079
those nightmares if you will should

575
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:56,199
dissipate but again do not mince words

576
00:25:52,079 --> 00:26:00,240
that there is still risk and we all know

577
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,240
the cliche where risk equals reward

578
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:05,398
and I think that applies certainly here

579
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,120
but the risk that we take each and every

580
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:10,759
day you have to what I call check up for

581
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:14,079
the neck up and see where you

582
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:17,558
are are you willing to work seven days a

583
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:18,678
week are you willing to work 16 to 18

584
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:21,278
hours a

585
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,320
day because you have to but also because

586
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:25,319
you want

587
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:27,200
to sh falls through the cracks when you

588
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:29,200
do that but that's the type of

589
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,399
commitment that it's generally going to

590
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,240
take to be successful because of the

591
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:35,239
previous three slides that I talked

592
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:40,759
about this looks like my first marijuana

593
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,480
facility that I built in Denver back in

594
00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:46,240
about 2009 and it's probably not too far

595
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,720
from the truth uh we did start in a 400

596
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,720
SQ foot shed uh I won't even call it a

597
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:56,600
facility but uh uh I don't know where

598
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:59,440
that is looks like Alabama um so um the

599
00:26:56,599 --> 00:27:04,639
reality is is that yes of

600
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:07,600
course I would imagine 90% of you of the

601
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,000
100% that are in this room have had some

602
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,519
previous

603
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,599
career and I would imagine that most of

604
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:16,720
your employers did not hand you an

605
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:19,319
envelope that was stuffed with cash that

606
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,200
represents the last two weeks

607
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:24,319
wages I literally have hundreds and

608
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:27,558
hundreds of friends contemporaries in

609
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:30,720
this industry that still today pay their

610
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:33,398
employees and themselves in US

611
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,640
currency it spends but think of the

612
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:38,199
terror that a young woman probably has

613
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,399
when she has that

614
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:43,000
payday forget about woman man or woman

615
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:44,239
and they have thousands of dollars in

616
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,759
their pocket and they have to go home

617
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:49,759
and figure out where to put it it is

618
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:51,158
absolutely untenable banking is the

619
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,398
single greatest

620
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:56,320
opportunity but also the single greatest

621
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:58,759
threat to an industry that is doubling

622
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:01,158
year after year after

623
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:04,038
year we're going to do a billion dollars

624
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,799
this year in Colorado if not darn close

625
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:09,278
to it we did $700 Million last year in

626
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:12,359
the state of Colorado generated $76

627
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:14,558
million to the state coffers this year

628
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:18,519
we're forecasting about a 100 million

629
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:21,038
dollars by the way the state has

630
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:22,599
banking state of Washington uses Bank of

631
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:24,798
America the state of Colorado use as

632
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:29,439
well as Fargo I've been with both those

633
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:31,720
banks no longer uh the hypocrisy but the

634
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,880
infrastructure the most obvious is in

635
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,960
fact the

636
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,440
banking but even

637
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,159
technology you know CRM customer

638
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,278
relationship management software I

639
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:46,720
couldn't get somebody to sell me a box

640
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:50,240
to put my products in I had to go to the

641
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:53,480
the uh the The Craft brewery uh store

642
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:56,919
and pay retail pricing cuz the guy who

643
00:28:53,480 --> 00:29:00,120
sold boxes in our region wouldn't sell

644
00:28:56,919 --> 00:29:01,600
it to me cuz I was one of them I'll tell

645
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:04,119
you now that they're lined up out the

646
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:05,918
door so that's not an indic if that's

647
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:08,639
not an indication of how our industry is

648
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:11,120
being perceived I don't know what is

649
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,240
literally every single week we hear from

650
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:16,759
dozens and dozens of

651
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,720
investors that have an excuse me I just

652
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:20,038
said investors I meant vendors excuse me

653
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,640
that have an interest in doing business

654
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:25,319
with us we also hear from investors as

655
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:28,399
well but listen the infrastructure does

656
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:30,960
not exist in basic terms for from

657
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:34,798
previous careers which is a not so

658
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,159
subtle hint that find that Gap find an

659
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,480
area in my company as an example that

660
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:41,720
has a

661
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,798
weakness and exploit it because there's

662
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:47,319
dozens of them and I think each one of

663
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:49,278
those represents an opportunity that any

664
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:52,720
one of you could solve

665
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:55,240
for and so there are literally uh

666
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,440
hundreds and hundreds of uh businesses

667
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,558
that are starving for that

668
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:01,278
infrastructure that I think any one of

669
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:05,200
you potentially um could create on your

670
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:08,440
own or more importantly invest

671
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,759
in so that infrastructure albeit a

672
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:14,000
challenge is also an opportunity again

673
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:16,960
that's where that delusional confidence

674
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,960
comes into uh

675
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:28,559
play you know you look around the room

676
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:32,880
today I mean we are such a diverse

677
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:34,398
group of individuals men women

678
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,278
Caucasians

679
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:40,119
African-Americans Asians people from all

680
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:43,480
different aspects of

681
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:45,839
socioeconomic levels of society it's the

682
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:49,319
most exciting thing when I walk into a

683
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:51,319
store serving cannabis or when I walk

684
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:52,639
into a conference like this because it

685
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:55,319
represents

686
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,159
opportunity but it is so

687
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:00,879
unique it is like nothing that I've ever

688
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:02,679
involved myself with as a serial

689
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,360
entrepreneur for 20 plus

690
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:07,240
years I remember vividly sitting in a

691
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:10,000
room at the fairon hotel in San

692
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,480
Francisco um two years no a year and a

693
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,798
half ago with uh arkview and we had

694
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,798
brought uh Stak holders from all over

695
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,599
the industry into this hotel room we

696
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:22,038
were going to begin to talk about the

697
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:24,439
legalization of marijuana at the uh

698
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:27,158
state level here in California and Rob

699
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,440
campy is the Ed for MPP marijuana policy

700
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:30,480
projects a trip I would really

701
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,840
appreciate if you could sit down and

702
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,079
make some comments to the group before

703
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:35,119
we start just because you have an

704
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:37,638
interesting

705
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:39,479
perspective I was dressed like this

706
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:41,319
there was a gentleman sitting next to me

707
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,960
that was equally as passionate I was

708
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:46,439
about the legalization of marijuana and

709
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:49,399
I started my Spiel and he said stop

710
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:54,200
right there enough he goes you're not

711
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:57,158
even from the state okay I represent ABC

712
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,200
uh Growers and you know your opinion

713
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:03,840
does not matter matter here I looked at

714
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:07,480
Rob I said WTF I said uh I thought that

715
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:11,079
this was a uh a friendly audience uh he

716
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:13,360
says today I come in peace that was the

717
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:16,480
words this individual used not important

718
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:18,719
who or where he came from but I mean

719
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,480
that is an

720
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,919
interesting introduction right to

721
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,759
conceptually launching adult use

722
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,759
marijuana in your state 34 million plus

723
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:30,119
people you can't get 34 million people

724
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:33,720
to agree on what day of the week it is

725
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:36,959
let alone this highly highly complicated

726
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:38,960
issue and so again as a control freak

727
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,240
and somebody who as a serial

728
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,200
entrepreneur most of his adult life for

729
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,038
a reason because I don't like to be told

730
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:50,480
what to do that is my character

731
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:53,879
flaw ask my parents ask former wives ask

732
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,839
my girlfriend you know it's it's it's a

733
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:59,399
flaw but you have to

734
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:02,079
collaborate because my brothers at bang

735
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:04,239
or my brothers at Kea or my brothers at

736
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:07,599
cushy punch any brands that I've met

737
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,120
with this week we have to find a way to

738
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:13,278
collaborate because if we don't it's

739
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:16,879
never going to happen we have to find a

740
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:20,359
way to work together because again this

741
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:23,120
industry is incredibly unique and unless

742
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:24,398
you were alive in 1933 which a quick

743
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:26,278
glance of the room doesn't look like

744
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:28,319
anybody qualifies for that which was the

745
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:30,638
end of alcohol

746
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,798
prohibition which there's a lot of s

747
00:33:30,638 --> 00:33:34,638
James is raising his arms back there you

748
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:38,759
look pretty good

749
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:41,519
sir we have to find a way to

750
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:43,960
connect connecting is what we are doing

751
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,480
today if you do not know the person that

752
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,038
is sitting to the left of you or the

753
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,079
person sitting to the right of you and I

754
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:53,679
know this is cheesy but please please

755
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:56,678
please introduce yourself find out what

756
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,399
this individual is doing here today and

757
00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:02,559
more importantly what they want to do

758
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:05,439
tomorrow I literally host three to five

759
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:08,480
people that I've never met in my life in

760
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,519
my office a week usually through

761
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:15,199
Linkedin or Facebook or uh

762
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:16,639
some random interaction and I connect

763
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,078
with

764
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,720
them because they have an interest a

765
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,839
motivation to jump into an industry that

766
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,759
is doubling every year that has a

767
00:34:24,838 --> 00:34:29,119
diverse group of individuals like you

768
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,200
men and women in in this room and I

769
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,800
don't care if they have the same beliefs

770
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:37,039
as me I don't care if they're an

771
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:39,159
activist a reformist or a free market

772
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:42,679
capitalist I want to connect with them

773
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:46,039
because they have an idea that I have

774
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:48,639
not thought about and so people like the

775
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:51,599
state of marijuana group create these

776
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,320
forums these environments that are

777
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,359
incredibly efficient because I don't

778
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,680
have to go visit every single one of you

779
00:34:56,358 --> 00:35:01,119
you know for the next 60 to 75 days I

780
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:03,919
can meet a majority of you people

781
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:07,480
today so again I challenge you whether

782
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:11,159
it be right after this event or upstairs

783
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:13,838
do not be bashful do not be abrasive do

784
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:17,440
not be

785
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:19,679
arrogant find a way in which to connect

786
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,679
with that man or woman that is sitting

787
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:26,480
on either side of you

788
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:28,199
today I'm going to wrap it up uh and

789
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,440
it's a powerful quote

790
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:34,000
uh which I think should resonate with

791
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:35,679
every single person here uh because you

792
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,838
being here in this room ultimately means

793
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:37,838
that

794
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,320
you're you're in the

795
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:45,598
arena because people that are sitting on

796
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:48,559
the sidelines aren't ever going to get

797
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,160
in that game and this is a game this is

798
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:54,440
a game where lots and lots of people are

799
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:56,719
going to win and the biggest chance of

800
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,280
losing is if you're never going to get

801
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:59,799
in it

802
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,640
and again you've made the investment

803
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,640
today whether it be the first investment

804
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:06,559
or one of

805
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:09,799
many you have to

806
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:13,199
engage but I was asked to

807
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:14,160
speak at a uh conference next week uh I

808
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,118
don't even know where it is I think it's

809
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:18,920
in Colorado oh it's startup week Denver

810
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:20,480
startup week hundreds and hundreds of uh

811
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,240
individuals that are starting companies

812
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:26,318
ironically now starting to turn to us as

813
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:28,399
the experts uh that's crazy um but I

814
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:31,039
reflected on a quote that somebody gave

815
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,838
me uh some advice somebody gave me years

816
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:37,639
ago and I kind of applied it but you

817
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:40,039
know men and women are all about who has

818
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:43,358
who have children in here I got one 15

819
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:44,759
years old she's still pretty good uh I

820
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:47,799
might start using marijuana a little bit

821
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,640
more often these days uh but um it's all

822
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,680
about the betterment of

823
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:55,318
society and

824
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:57,879
so I looked at my life and then I looked

825
00:36:55,318 --> 00:37:02,000
at previous generations my great

826
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:07,800
grandfather worked in the steel mills of

827
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:10,960
pennil Tucky uh Pennsylvania uh I joke

828
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:14,079
uh I went to Villanova University uh so

829
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,720
I could say that uh my grandfather

830
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:21,440
worked in the steel mills so my father

831
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:23,799
could become a doctor so I could sell

832
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,599
marijuana if that's not powerful I

833
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:29,519
don't know what is guys thank you very

834
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,519

836
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:36,480
I don't know if it's because of me or

837
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:39,000
not but uh I'm certainly available to

838
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,800
ask a few questions if that's conducive

839
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
to you or certainly I'll be around for a

840
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,480
little while but uh is there any

841
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,400
question that somebody cannot wait and

842
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,920
has to get out I'm happy to answer

843
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,079
tonight in front of

844
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,079
everybody yes sir

845
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:01,440
what it excites me about

846
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,359
what man well um when we met earlier I

847
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,519
talked about is forget about the fire

848
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:12,400
hoses the fire hydrant uh and I can be I

849
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:14,318
certainly been accused of being quote

850
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,519
unquote greedy I mean I've got a vasist

851
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:20,440
appetite myself for opportunity uh what

852
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:23,199
I can tell you is that nobody not even

853
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:24,559
the sagest veterans in this room or in

854
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:28,679
the industry many of whom I know

855
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:30,960
personally have a crystal ball and so

856
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:32,879
somebody like myself pontificating up

857
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:37,199
here on stage and again I consider an

858
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:40,280
honor to represent the industry no one

859
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:41,439
really knows right I mean I believe that

860
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:44,440
the federal government is going to

861
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,838
capitulate in the year 2017 I bet Rob

862
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,280
campy $1,000 I will do it again uh next

863
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:51,078
week at or at the national marijuana

864
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,519
business conference in Las Vegas because

865
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:54,160
I know he'll be foolish enough to get up

866
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:55,159
on stage with me but I believe the

867
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:56,559
federal government is going to

868
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:59,399
capitulate they're going to defer to

869
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:01,599
State's rights just like um uh gay

870
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,200
marriage uh you know civil you know

871
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,720
whatever it is uh so that's going to be

872
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:09,358
exciting to me whether it's 2017 because

873
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:11,559
I have happy ears or whether it's 2019

874
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:14,279
like Rob campio believes I don't know

875
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:16,358
but I can tell you it is not oot Over

876
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,760
the Horizon it is right there I can see

877
00:39:16,358 --> 00:39:20,480
it I'm on my bicycle pedaling so damn

878
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,720
hard to that bright light I just don't

879
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,838
know when I'm going to get to it so that

880
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:25,759
ultimately is what motivates me excites

881
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:28,759
me about our industry that we're on

882
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,760
today

883
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:32,719
oh
