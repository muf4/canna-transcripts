00:00:05,628 --> 00:00:09,629
so what is it so Tom I want to share

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,690
with you the ballot initiative measure

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:14,309
AF in Mendocino County ballot measure

5
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:16,789
for work ballot measure in Mendocino

6
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:18,809
County for this election coming yes

7
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:20,689
remember 8 that's right

8
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:23,219
in California we're all gonna vote for

9
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:25,079
legalization of recreational cannabis in

10
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:27,149
Mendocino County specifically we're

11
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,759
gonna vote for protecting the small

12
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:31,169
farmers and that's because big AG is

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,980
already coming in and trying to dominate

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,630
the field

15
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,280
we don't want cannabis to be just like

16
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,380
every other crop that's been dominated

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,480
by big agriculture and big corporation

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,739
we want it to be the small farmers and

19
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:42,569
the family traditions they've had for

20
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:43,919
generations protected you're one of the

21
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,988
only people he cares about a small boy

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,539
was it talks about that so true so these

23
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:50,459
guys all grow pot y'all grow pot they've

24
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,500
been doing it for generations son groans

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,210
oh I haven't been in jail that's right

26
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,369
so they really believe in it back it up

27
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,000
and so this initiative will keep the

28
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:01,530
small farmers from becoming adopted by a

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,969
big farmer and this will protect them

30
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,920
from having pharmaceutical companies

31
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,570
coming and buying the property and going

32
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,650
with big agriculture you'll have a lot

33
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:09,239
of places doing that already

34
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,950
we're just saying let's protect the

35
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,640
heritage strains their heritage

36
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,969
practices farmers in this region so by

37
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,868

38
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:24,569
donate a big portion of the proceeds to

39
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:31,658
