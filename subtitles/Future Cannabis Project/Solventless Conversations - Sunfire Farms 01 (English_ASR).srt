35
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:21,739
159 Oh once it says 150 it sounds good

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:45,729
so that into this yeah really go like

37
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:53,980
148 that's a talk of a thing the pipe

38
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:57,189
yeah so flavorful coming right away

39
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:57,189
thanks nice

40
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:15,460
perfect good temperature perfect I know

41
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:16,889
yeah I love that bubble cap that's still

42
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:30,700
my fear I like it better than the

43
00:03:16,889 --> 00:03:33,459
binaries word uh yeah so this cap made

44
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:35,859
by brick glass brick glass yeah just a

45
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,890
bubble cap a lot of people are like on

46
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:42,270
the spinner cap wave which I still love

47
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:45,009
like I have this mud like the binary cap

48
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,600
but yeah I just like this one because it

49
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:49,569
just kind of is a little more like

50
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:51,759
restrictive and kind of gets I feel like

51
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:53,049
it gets everything a little better you

52
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,030
can move your to have around and whatnot

53
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:57,580
it's more interactive or yeah it's more

54
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,610
interactive they both have their they

55
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,980
both have their fun definitely have you

56
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,750
used this cap would it just sit on top

57
00:04:02,979 --> 00:04:06,669
and that would spin automatically yeah

58
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:12,129
yeah you'll just set it and it'll just

59
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:14,709
like hands-free Wow pretty easily too

60
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:16,540
and quick yeah this pipe like it's

61
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,949
pretty restricting so like if you have

62
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,340
like a straight tube like it makes the

63
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:26,459
bead go like way faster so I kinda like

64
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:31,389
the bubble cap on this guy but very nice

65
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:34,180
this is where an email would be having

66
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:36,069
do you know right I used to have them I

67
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,019
got friends that have them for sure yeah

68
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:40,209
and they make some pretty cool ones you

69
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:42,430
they look like a like ice cream truck is

70
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:45,759
like this they do the hoppers up like

71
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:48,400
that it's very simple you know I think

72
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,089
they're all for you they work pretty

73
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,388
well

74
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:57,159

75
00:04:52,389 --> 00:05:00,629
like a that's like okay there's normal

76
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,790
like the highly educated cops

77
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:04,170
the highly educated talks like the ones

78
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,319
that are like you have to use the old

79
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:09,569
carb caps for you know like the like

80
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:14,909

82
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,320
around it's like a titanium Yale oh yes

83

hash are there cause you put the hog I

117
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:55,939

Kevin you can't tell yeah you can't tell

120
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:06,629
that's why I got the black little

121
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:08,339
attachment on there yeah do you I think

122
00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:10,038
I might have got some water like when

123
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:14,299
you get water on this it like sizzles

124
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:19,889
when it's heating up so hopefully right

125
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:28,710
now and we're gonna review the puff co+

126
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:30,629
yes so we're your first what are your

127
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:32,750
expectations of someone who's never had

128
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:37,049
that because you've already hit the

129
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:39,240
first edition of yeah this is a puff

130
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,750
coke plus I think I just hit the of

131
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,430
cocaine

132
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,320
this is edition number two and what are

133
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:46,739
the things you notice that are different

134
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,089
well right away the the poker I guess

135
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,209
when I thought I called poker or the

136
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:52,820
yeah applier no no well mini dabber yeah

137
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:56,000
it was just it

138
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:58,790
was the just like a sphere like it's

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,470
just a straight like point but now you

140
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:02,750
have a little scooper to it and it's

141
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,629
angled so that's nice too

142
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,879
you know yeah picking it up for sure and

143
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:11,120
the ceramic itself too was a lot deeper

144
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:12,980
and that's helpful because it was kind

145
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,730
of pain yeah it was good for one hit you

146
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,399
know right

147
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:23,659
bigger dab size yeah that's always good

148
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:25,009
so um let's see you should try the GMO

149
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:30,980
for sure read my mind

150
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:32,330
yeah good now this is all set to go

151
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:37,670
how does it work the same I guess you

152
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:40,810
could grab it out of let's scoop some of

153
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:43,759
the Sun Fire farms and you grew this and

154
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:45,739
like light depth right yeah so this is

155
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,439
all that grown and extracted by me just

156
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:51,889
like light up living soil here in

157
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:57,010
Southern California yeah and what could

158
00:09:51,889 --> 00:10:00,799
give me some description like are you

159
00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:03,769
yeah we are actually more a little a

160
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:07,009
little more coastal so we are not too

161
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:10,460
high in elevation kind of more just in

162
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:12,710
the valley so I guess all day man oh

163
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:15,050
yeah my favorite smelling ones

164
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:17,269
definitely it's like the stingiest yeah

165
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:18,919
it's like always prevalent it's not like

166
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:23,750
a fruity smell for sure it's very

167
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:25,849
attractive totally okay so it has

168
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:28,700
settings I know that from the other pen

169
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:32,389
so you hit it five times and it will

170
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:34,640
change and that'll turn it on okay on

171
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:38,659
for sure I think was already on before I

172
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:41,779
streamed it off so back on and then four

173
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:44,569
times will go like from white which is

174
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:47,059
the hottest to like greens of blue or

175
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,790
red or something probably blue two three

176
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:52,989
four or maybe whites please stop easy so

177
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:55,789
yeah bounce the blue one two three four

178
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,799
green I think Green is the lowest I

179
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:59,839
think white is the hottest that would

180
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:03,698
make sense so let's try one two three

181
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:08,379
four blue white one two three

182
00:11:03,698 --> 00:11:12,639
or oops that wasn't bad push all right

183
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:14,499
so blue now there's a session to the

184
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,568
other one if you hit it like twice you

185
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:18,100
do it twice it'll burn for like 12

186
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:21,248
seconds yeah

187
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:24,129
nice so I just hit twice well first

188
00:11:21,249 --> 00:11:27,308
we'll put it in there and ideally it

189
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:31,600
just falls off the scooper right yeah

190
00:11:27,308 --> 00:11:35,558
yeah you gotta aim it down like you

191
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,819
can't be smoking with a straight out so

192
00:11:35,558 --> 00:11:41,738
I'm missing a piece here

193
00:11:36,818 --> 00:11:45,668
ah did you screw it up you just screw it

194
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:47,709
down if you push and then the white part

195
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:50,409
will push it ah it did yes that's

196
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:51,578
another new feature they didn't push up

197
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:54,938
so you gotta put a little pressure on it

198
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:57,899
yeah very cool all right so two times

199
00:11:54,938 --> 00:11:57,899
we're in session

200
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:23,200
definitely able to taste it I think

201
00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:25,689
hitting it twice a second hit might be

202
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,420
better yeah

203
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:30,220
don't we'll hit I what double tap it and

204
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:33,009
then just just rip it you know slowly

205
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,420
and long with the whole time but that

206
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:38,009
was full flavor in that first in the

207
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:41,110
first rib though for sure it's not like

208
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:46,090
heating up a rig and hitting that but

209
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:48,550
definitely got the taste you might see

210
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:51,790
you might see more smoke I think it got

211
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:53,199
some more smoke coming out yeah that

212
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:57,939
wasn't like a full job oh yeah pretty

213
00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:00,250
tasty for sure Cheers we have the GMO

214
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,170
turf in there feel like some pens I just

215
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,500
get like a super burnt profile I was

216
00:13:02,169 --> 00:13:06,490
like better than I expected

217
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,360
there's a little part it's still a

218
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:13,779
little bit on here and didn't it yeah oh

219
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:17,409
yeah it's like pretty you've got most of

220
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:20,500
the dab I guess right yeah it did most

221
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:29,230
of it fell off yeah see there's a third

222
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:31,179
hit to it and I was a good little bad

223
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,820
dude especially if you're just like

224
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:37,739
chilling out somewhere in need of

225
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,740
discreet discreteness you know

226
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:48,880
at the soccer field you know on the

227
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:52,750
sideline kids soccer game while they're

228
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:56,350
eating sliced oranges got bad calls I oh

229
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:57,700
come on walk away or that pair is being

230
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:03,149
an asshole across the way you're

231
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:05,259
drinking a beer next year so I think

232
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:06,970
forever that was like that was gonna fat

233
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:08,950
dab or a small dab it was a kind of

234
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:10,360
medium yeah yeah yeah I guess you could

235
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,879
put a little bigger one in that amazing

236
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,519
and then you'll get yeah cuz that wasn't

237
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:17,019
a that third hit kind of taste but it

238
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,689
wasn't I could definitely taste like

239
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:21,549
some right to it for sure wasn't like

240
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,279
the hit you want and then you cue it

241
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:25,778
after every dab and I guess if you're

242
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:27,879
gonna switch it up but if we're gonna do

243
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:36,759
a little more DML that's true yeah your

244
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:38,919
dad I'm down it's my very favorite yeah

245
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:42,549
it's my first wash the GMO too and it

246
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:46,569
does yeah oh yeah I guess it yields like

247
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:47,979
I mean like people would like maybe one

248
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:51,400
of like you know run it for like

249
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:55,149
hydrocarbon - Oh true um mica probably

250
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:56,588
yeah actually I'll do this one but yeah

251
00:14:55,149 --> 00:15:01,750
yields better for solving less than it

252
00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:04,660
does for like yeah yeah as much as I've

253
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,740
never made it with anything about water

254
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:08,289
hash but that's what I've heard

255
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:17,350
nice yeah this is definitely a bigger

256
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:19,838
dab right I hear it grows pretty yeah so

257
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,089
talk about the great lake as a nonce

258
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,820
packed full so yeah I wonder that's not

259
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:27,730
how it's gonna handle that one the

260
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:31,150
growth of the GMO netwo yeah but like in

261
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:33,039
the living soil and kind of like your

262
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:35,439
way of growing like yeah you're you're

263
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:37,179
close to the LA scene right and you're

264
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,040
close to the Santa Barbara scene and I

265
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:41,919
was saying neither like la is indoor

266
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:44,230
hydro a lot totally it's so ran a barb

267
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:47,319
is like like even the like a lot of the

268
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,159
big green houses are all like cocoa and

269
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,440
stuff like that

270
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:53,439
yeah it's definitely a pretty rare thing

271
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,170
to like see living soil cultivation down

272
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,200
here and just like how

273
00:15:55,169 --> 00:16:00,659
not like sustainable like biodynamic

274
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,759
regenerative mindset because like most

275
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:05,819
people yeah exactly like in LA or

276
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:08,129
growing in door they're growing not in

277
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,649
soil they're they're not doing it with

278
00:16:08,129 --> 00:16:12,750
that intention and yeah same with Santa

279
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:13,379
Barbara like a lot of that cultivation

280
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,000
up there

281
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:17,838
like you said it's in cocoa it's not

282
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,610
it's not with like the mindset to be

283
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,670
doing good for the earth as well so I

284
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:25,589
feel pretty like just stoked to be doing

285
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:27,509
that around here and trying to like

286
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:31,199
spread that awareness and movement and

287
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:33,299
whatnot so yeah I just CC you feel

288
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:36,629
pretty good about yourself I I'm still

289
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:38,729
doing it yeah it feels much better to

290
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:40,708
not be like throwing away so many

291
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,480
rockwool cubes after every run and just

292
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:46,078
like how with this one you smoke people

293
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,350
out in this market are they like that's

294
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,879
pretty fuckin yeah they do seem to

295
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:52,740
notice a difference so like wow that was

296
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,990
very clean like the high is very clean

297
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,149
it was very smooth and ladies are indoor

298
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:00,600
smokers yeah they're people who are like

299
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:02,129
smoking there used to like everything

300
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,169
most of the stuff that they're finding

301
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:05,970
around here is indoor you know it's

302
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:07,230
hydroponics so it is they kind of notice

303
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,539
that difference when they see it I think

304
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,759
this is ready I found my friends like

305
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:13,709
noticing a huge difference maybe like

306
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,660
coughing but how's it going man oh good

307
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:17,730
good this and that I told my have

308
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,470
something like ah I'm coughing I'm only

309
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,120
smoking right now well what are you

310
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,600
having been smoking on they tell me what

311
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,149
it is

312
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,889
again it's in my step like oh dude way

313
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,559
more amazing they they say they could

314
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:31,860
take the big difference like be more

315
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:33,869
clearly but in your hash yeah it's just

316
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:36,899
my hash Mike and so that implies your

317
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:40,589
sourcing from like someone who grows

318
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:44,100
like he does cuz I think yeah endure and

319
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:46,859
he claims be organics you know okay yeah

320
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:49,740
I don't know the full details there but

321
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:51,808
uh yeah so I would imagine even more

322
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,419
sourcing from a guy like and you the way

323
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:54,779
you're growing regenerated yeah way

324
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,850
better

325
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:58,558
the proof is definitely in the pudding

326
00:17:56,849 --> 00:18:00,719
you can see that when you're washing

327
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:03,899
like look at this is super clean leaving

328
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,610
no residue you know I'm not sure up the

329
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,019
heat how was that that was good dude I

330
00:18:05,609 --> 00:18:08,609
got a really tasty dub off that that's

331
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:10,619
all I don't know I feel like

332
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:12,629
I might have heated it late though I'm

333
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:19,199
not sure I just pressed it twice and

334
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:24,420
then started ripping it yeah so go up so

335
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:27,779
what consistency like you can smoke this

336
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,279
out of that but like at what consistency

337
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:33,839
do you think you can't really use that

338
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:38,279
anymore for ash maybe the temple balls

339
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:40,980
maybe you know you're not gonna smoke so

340
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:42,720
we're lower melt like a fire like a

341
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,789
four-star Mel might be a little hard to

342
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,620
clean anywhere in there I think this

343
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:47,609
would be their third haze so yeah I

344
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:49,979
think there's enough for another little

345
00:18:47,609 --> 00:18:51,959
Ripper in there so just hit it twice

346
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,539
right you can put me twice already just

347
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,669
hold it I just thought Oh long as you

348
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:58,859
want to hit it for you no okay hitting

349
00:18:56,669 --> 00:19:00,179
it because twice as 12 seconds or

350
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:01,558
something something like that yeah it

351
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:09,059
just eliminates you having to hold it

352
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:10,889
down yeah okay I give this one a pass

353
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:13,379
it's a little better hey hold more you

354
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:16,919
know cuz the one before it held less and

355
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:19,799
I took own part is bigger yeah the

356
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:22,200
bucket I guess is this is a lot bigger I

357
00:19:19,798 --> 00:19:23,940
would say double the size we definitely

358
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,580
just put a good-sized dab in there for

359
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,710
sure let's say now now there's some in

360
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:31,289
there still so and it's oh fuck yeah you

361
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:39,140
can take another head out yeah or if not

362
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:39,139
again let's keep in rotation right yeah

363
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,950
very cool

364
00:19:46,638 --> 00:19:55,918
all right so we like that yeah not bad

365
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:59,100
and it has a charging to write an easy

366
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,419
charger yeah yeah I like that part it's

367
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:05,240
somewhere in there right yeah yeah that

368
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:05,240
thing so it's like standard right USB

369
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:13,798
yeah yeah this so you can you a twist on

370
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,829
yeah yeah but at my point is that's like

371
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:19,888
a standard thread which is a good thing

372
00:20:16,829 --> 00:20:21,898
sure it's not like a proprietary like if

373
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:25,648
you lose it you got a yeah I can only

374
00:20:21,898 --> 00:20:26,939
buy ours oh you think you can be able

375
00:20:25,648 --> 00:20:29,398
you can use other charges with the pen

376
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,850
if you do lose this I think so

377
00:20:29,398 --> 00:20:38,839
that looks pretty standard like with

378
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:43,368
other cigarette with other vape carts

379
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:48,449
when are you finding every shop nice

380
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:51,359
perfect not bad alright so what would

381
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:55,399
you want puff co to improve on with the

382
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:58,740
peak like if you could give them some

383
00:20:55,398 --> 00:20:59,609
constructive feedback damn that's a good

384
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,419
question

385
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:08,128
I feel like they've done a really good

386
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:10,190
job to be honest um like maybe the only

387
00:21:08,128 --> 00:21:13,798
thing they could do would be like

388
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:15,538
include a quartz atomizer like a quart

389
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:17,220
not of course atomizer a quartz bucket

390
00:21:15,538 --> 00:21:19,288
instead of just having the ceramic

391
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,999
bucket I know

392
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:22,740
I mean I've dabbed off the quartz ones

393
00:21:20,999 --> 00:21:24,929
and I definitely think they taste better

394
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,538
it'd be sweet to have like a puff Co one

395
00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:30,269
because not every quartz bucket like

396
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:34,200
aftermarket like fits well on these so

397
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:37,980
other than that like everything's pretty

398
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:40,769
awesome I've had this for like almost 16

399
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:47,099
months now and you model it really well

400
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:49,528
thanks man but uh I was telling him like

401
00:21:47,099 --> 00:21:51,868
I haven't I barely clean it like the

402
00:21:49,528 --> 00:21:54,329
atomizer he gets pretty gunked-up and

403
00:21:51,868 --> 00:21:55,829
like I leave it in my hot car well I

404
00:21:54,329 --> 00:21:58,048
mean while I'm working and stuff and

405
00:21:55,829 --> 00:22:00,240
like it's never never failed me I've

406
00:21:58,048 --> 00:22:03,269
just had to replace the little $39

407
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,620
miser so loosely maintained yeah loosely

408
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:07,500
maintained so I'm pretty stoked on the

409
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:09,419
I'm the puff co it's very cool it's not

410
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,490
like I'm taking it for every dab but I

411
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:14,130
like that when you show me what you

412
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:16,500
carry around in your bag um here you

413
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:18,600

00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:50,970
hash especially um so yeah there's that

489
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:53,289
and then we have some strawberry banana

490
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:57,220
this is probably my favorite strain in

491
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:59,889
my variety of cultivars that I grow do

492
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:02,170
you like it as flower - um I honestly

493
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:04,450
don't really like smoking flower that

494
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,580
much okay just because when I first

495
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,170
started using cannabis like I got right

496
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:10,539
into concentrates right away it's like

497
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:12,460
the the flower smoke is like a little

498
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:16,809
like gnarly for me but I still love

499
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:21,460
smoking it from time to time like I know

500
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:23,500
yeah yeah but I'll still be stoked on

501
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:25,210
some like song foul rips you know I got

502
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,059
a little bong sovereignty and stuff to

503
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:30,650
rip out of here

504
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:32,569
there once am I on this yeah well you're

505
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,759
smoking a lot of good hash it's like I

506
00:26:32,569 --> 00:26:37,609
don't know it's it's different when

507
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:41,269
you're it's so goodbye like it's

508
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:45,409
different though I have my favor hold on

509
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:47,539
one second I have a height like my fair

510
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,610
share of years of smoking ripping flower

511
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:52,490
me yeah yeah like just today I try to

512
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:54,469
rip a fat bowl right like I used to I

513
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:56,450
got halfway through I had to stop but

514
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,279
he's in hospital I feel you I was like

515
00:26:56,450 --> 00:27:00,920

for the beginning of the day and then

520
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,180

522
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:18,440
the dabs it's like even more smooth you

523
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:20,059

get the better full flavor yeah and it's

538
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,900
not that harsh and it's kind of hard to

539
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,900

like it in flower for a man cuz like the

558
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,370
reason why I don't think I really like

00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:39,740
flowers cuz there's no like there's

560

amazing flower around I

561
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:44,120
but there's no like true like like

562
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,459
living soil like consciously grown

563
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:48,889
flower and like the rare north yeah I

564
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:51,110
know the rare time that I've seen that

565
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:52,880
around here like one of my my buddies

566
00:28:51,109 --> 00:28:55,279
ogre farms like they do like an indoor

567
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,350
living soil garden like it was a while

568
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,569
back there Gorilla Glue was like some of

569
00:28:57,349 --> 00:29:02,149
the like cleanest it was like I was like

570
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:03,678
smoking like a hash table smoking the

571
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,269
flour it was like and I know that

572
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,860
quality is out there and I will like

573
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:11,750
happily smoke that all the time in labs

574
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:14,889
I had a buddy that bought some of their

575
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:17,869
stuff and I tried their flour and

576
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:21,170
actually smelt the way yes I'm not a

577
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:24,079
proper yeah so really they're doing like

578
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:25,700
where they run where Colorado yeah well

579
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,470
no no there but what about it I assume

580
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:29,720
you got it in California not yeah

581
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:32,089
there's they have a few dispensaries out

582
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:34,339
here they drop off this one was I think

583
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:37,039
they don't put a safe port and pour any

584
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:39,129
me that's where my friend got it and I

585

00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:09,979
your genetics yeah

617
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:11,988
for each okay all so far um so as you

618
00:31:09,979 --> 00:31:14,080
continue down okay well this is where I

619
00:31:11,989 --> 00:31:18,350
got it from for sure right this is a

620
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:23,329
exotic yeah so I'm so just real quick so

621
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:25,358
the creme de GMO the GMO I got it's a

622
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:28,368
clone only so I got that from ogre farms

623
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:31,608
he was kind enough to let me grab that

624
00:31:28,368 --> 00:31:33,738
from him and then the other two the

625
00:31:31,608 --> 00:31:36,199
cookies and cream and the cream D GMO

626
00:31:33,739 --> 00:31:38,419
were grown from seed from me there's

627
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,669
like two different phenotype creme de

628
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:43,519
menthe in there so you were breeding and

629
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:45,288
basically I was at you bred yourself um

630
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,079
I didn't breed it because it's just like

631
00:31:45,288 --> 00:31:50,298
a mixed water but I did Fino hunt them I

632
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:51,829
just taught the seeds and and found like

633
00:31:50,298 --> 00:31:54,710
my two favorite fie nose out of like the

634
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:56,418
12 that were growing and washed the only

635
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:59,298
the two and like just dried the others

636
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:03,440
for flour and whatnot and then the

637
00:31:59,298 --> 00:32:06,558
strawberry banana this was I got from a

638
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,048
clone the live rosin I grew from clone

639
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:11,058
from cloneville I got like I kind of

640
00:32:09,048 --> 00:32:13,819
took a chance on this clone I wasn't

641
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:16,220
super familiar like how this Fino washed

642
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:21,138
most strawberry bananas do great for

643
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:35,989
solvent list aim it this way yeah but I

644
00:32:21,138 --> 00:32:38,358
grow a lot of it yeah it was an it's an

645
00:32:35,989 --> 00:32:40,009
amazing cut yeah it's a great one for

646
00:32:38,358 --> 00:32:41,960
hash I'm super stoked on the Terps it's

647
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:44,179
very like strawberry dominant for sure

648
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:50,288
so there's the live rosy right away yeah

649
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:53,989
yeah and then the melt is right here

650
00:32:50,288 --> 00:32:57,499
first wash 90 you to 159 so there's like

651
00:32:53,989 --> 00:32:59,749
the 90 and 120 bag in there I feel like

652
00:32:57,499 --> 00:33:02,450
that strawberry banana is very potent

653
00:32:59,749 --> 00:33:04,339
kind of like a GMO yeah the melt I

654
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:06,590
prefer it way over the bras like the

655
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:08,148
nozzles great but like the metal is just

656
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:11,628
we'll talk the press some jobs out of

657
00:33:08,148 --> 00:33:15,229
this so there's those two and then we

658
00:33:11,628 --> 00:33:17,990
have straight GMO this is just some live

659
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,909
rosin right here that's for my light DEP

660
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,669
these other two strains were actually

661
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:25,220
just full-term from this year

662
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:27,620
voltar mating like yeah yeah

663
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:29,929
so this is really light depth in in the

664
00:33:27,619 --> 00:33:31,308
hoops right yeah I got two hoop houses

665
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:33,710
that I did light that over the summer

666
00:33:31,308 --> 00:33:39,859
and then I did some other just full term

667
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:42,649
full season was like oh yeah it's um

668
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:45,439
pretty coastal coastal yeah so it's like

669
00:33:42,648 --> 00:33:48,109
cool and then like cool nights like hot

670
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,759
days it's pretty we had a pretty warm

671
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:52,579
summer it gets pretty warm where I'm at

672
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:55,069
actually but in the wintertime it's like

673
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:57,470
a drastic change like warm days cold

674
00:33:55,069 --> 00:34:00,079
nights it's not crazy humid we're pretty

675
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:02,659
dry but it's definitely more humid than

676
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:04,249
like the San Fernando Valley and places

677
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:06,289
like that in my opinion so is there

678
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:08,329
stuff that you tried to grow there that

679
00:34:06,288 --> 00:34:10,668
you're like this doesn't like this

680
00:34:08,329 --> 00:34:14,539
climate and other stuff you're like yeah

681
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:17,239
for sure like um it's like I definitely

682
00:34:14,539 --> 00:34:18,739
I definitely selected it down to four

683
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:20,989
strains but there's a lot of stuff that

684
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:22,818
I had to wean out like there was like

685
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:24,828
this lemon cake that didn't do very well

686
00:34:22,818 --> 00:34:26,418
oh is that something that you know has

687
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:29,690
done really well somewhere else

688
00:34:26,418 --> 00:34:31,969
I don't yeah and it's a lot of it's just

689
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:35,418
like yeah like all grow things that I

690
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:36,949
maybe feel like they take longer to veg

691
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:37,789
or they're a little harder to grow if

692
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,678
they're worth it

693
00:34:37,789 --> 00:34:41,449
for hashing because everything I'm

694
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,990
growing is for hash like I'm growing for

695
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:48,108
resin not flour so that's okay to me but

696
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:50,418
like there's definitely strains that are

697
00:34:48,108 --> 00:34:52,639
just like completely like you know a

698
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:53,989
Miss but you have to have those losses

699
00:34:52,639 --> 00:35:00,019
to like find the gems

700
00:34:53,989 --> 00:35:02,209
so yeah it's hard to find a podcast did

701
00:35:00,019 --> 00:35:05,300
you say you're growing and like raised

702
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:07,490
beds or pot sir yeah raised beds okay so

703
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,250
they're uh just homemade raised beds

704
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:12,739
with wood like four by four there are

705
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:14,449
three by twelve and then I have some

706
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:17,209
four by eights as well for like three

707
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:19,789
and H or something um I'll put so

708
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,420
there's actually three by six beds

709
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:21,650
there's four

710
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,510
so they're like next to each other

711
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,420
making them 12 feet long and I'll either

712
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:28,940
do two plants by like 10 plants per bed

713
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,829
or I'll sometimes do three but I've been

714
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,679
kind of trying to do less plants as of

715
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:35,599
recently and just get them larger so and

716
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:38,629
so the soil you're putting into these

717
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,309
raised beds where's is it local is it

718
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:43,460
are you building it up with stuff yeah

719
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:46,160
so I'm building soil um a lot of people

720
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:48,920
are familiar with build a soil calm so

721
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:51,949
they have multiple recipes I use like

722
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,170
their number one recipe so I use I

723
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:55,759
didn't use their ingredients I use like

724
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:58,430
locally sourced ingredients like a

725
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,900
locally sourced my compost might say you

726
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:02,480
want to buy like what they're showing

727
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,849
right in there they're wrestling yeah I

728
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,548
use their recipe and just sourced all

729
00:36:04,849 --> 00:36:10,730
those ingredients locally and then like

730
00:36:07,548 --> 00:36:12,409
all the dragon Earth fly medicine group

731
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:14,838
is like very influential in the garden

732
00:36:12,409 --> 00:36:16,429
too and like I use they're huge on

733
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:20,000
native soil because that already has

734
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:21,919
like the intelligence of your area right

735
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,929
so anytime I'm building soil I always

736
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,349
like to add some of my native soil in my

737
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:29,318
yard and like I hope at some point you

738
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:32,990
shouldn't need to buy anything from

739
00:36:29,318 --> 00:36:35,058
right tackle is to be like now how

740
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:37,608
sustainable yeah and now I have that

741
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:39,019
soil training wheels come off exactly

742
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:40,788
yeah

743
00:36:39,018 --> 00:36:43,308
this so it's just like it doesn't happen

744
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:44,630
overnight but every step you take like

745
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:46,548
it's just gonna get better and better

746
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:50,000
and like it's so amazing after each

747
00:36:46,548 --> 00:36:52,130
round yeah yeah it's like it's my first

748
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,048
year of doing like full no-till full

749
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:57,829
living where it's like we're not buying

750
00:36:54,048 --> 00:37:00,409
any new soil or putting like worms yeah

751
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:02,450
so we didn't add any worms um but we

752
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:04,009
like do methods to like attract worms

753
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:06,500
like there's like an avocado method

754
00:37:04,009 --> 00:37:08,150
where like you can cut up an avocado and

755
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,920
lay it on the bed and it'll be like a

756
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:12,710
breeding ground and like an attraction

757
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,108
for for worms can get into the raised

758
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:16,880
bed yeah so though cuz my braised bed

759
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:19,969
you like connected to the ground yeah

760
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:22,548
yeah so they'll call come up but

761
00:37:19,969 --> 00:37:23,959
sometimes like I have indoor moms that

762
00:37:22,548 --> 00:37:25,849
are living soil and they're just

763
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,940
containers so those I will have to add

764
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:31,099
worms separately but yeah it's crazy

765
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:33,610
anyway people come in and really like

766
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:35,710
are you like composting on site or

767
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:38,140
we have a compost pile on site we have

768
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:40,210
like a Hugo Hugo culture if you're

769
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:41,710
familiar with that to you yeah there's

770
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:45,190
like a little spot on the side it's just

771
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:47,079
like such a rich area yeah you can see

772
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:49,360
take like you dig a hole you put like

773
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:51,759
logs and stuff in okay and then you

774
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:54,400
cover that yeah and then that's tough

775
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,560
break like think of how nutrient-rich

776
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,099
like if you walked through a forest like

777
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:02,019
smell rotting log yeah that's what

778
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:04,029
you're planting your plants is - yeah

779
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:06,039
and they're just like this is amazing

780
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:07,780
yeah and that stuff keeps breaking I've

781
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:09,550
seen it yeah that was the name of it

782
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,590
I've seen like pictures of that stuff

783
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:13,480
right yeah I like slowly breaks down so

784
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,920
you're doing that with a portion of what

785
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,559
you're growing not all of what you're

786
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:21,940
drying yeah we're like I'm planning on I

787
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:27,070
keep saying we but it's just me yeah my

788
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:29,200
team of two hands but uh we yeah next

789
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:30,880
for next year's season I'm like building

790
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:32,409
Hugo's right now and stuff this is the

791
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,720
time of year to like be building soil

792
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:36,339
and like beep referent preparing for

793
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,469
everything to be breaking down and

794
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,510
getting ready for next year so I have a

795
00:38:38,469 --> 00:38:42,099
couple spots that I want to like do some

796
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:45,280
more new Hugo's and then I have the

797
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:47,469
other spot so very cool yeah yeah I'm

798
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,510
pretty stoked on on this coming season

799
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:56,559
even though it's like a ways away but

800
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:59,050
it's coming I only have between my two

801
00:38:56,559 --> 00:39:02,759
greenhouses it's only about 400 square

802
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:05,320
feet of canopy and I have another like

803
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,300
300 square feet of like full-term

804
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:10,030
growing space basic so if we're talking

805
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:12,310
craft you would fit that definition yeah

806
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:15,519
a very small batch craft for sure yeah

807
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:17,139
very good craft yeah thanks man yeah I'm

808
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:22,539
saying what do you think of the quality

809
00:39:17,139 --> 00:39:24,849
of this small batch craftsman thinks as

810
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:26,920

813
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:32,740
today at all nope though we still have

814
00:39:30,909 --> 00:39:34,960
plenty flavors to try I know yeah that's

815
00:39:32,739 --> 00:39:38,529
I think I use this over here a little

816
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,550
closer right as you show it I should be

817
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:41,550
trying Yeah right

818
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:47,269
yeah so that was a strong animal we got

819
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,880
the crÃ¨me de GMO yeah we did the normal

820
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:52,099
GMO this is some normal straight GMO

821
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,660
melt right here this stuff is pretty

822
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:55,309
special I feel like it's some of the

823
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:57,049
melty it's like hash I feel like I've

824
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:59,539
washed it's kind of like a soil it's

825
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:02,450
pretty nice pretty noise yep I'm pretty

826
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:04,639
hyped on that so this way check that one

827
00:40:02,449 --> 00:40:06,829
I don't want to compare to the GMO right

828
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:08,719
yeah yeah that's all the melt in the

829
00:40:06,829 --> 00:40:09,380
rosin yeah yeah that's what I came from

830
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:18,980
right right

831
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:20,900
that was that yeah well this it's all

832
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:24,108
melted in here now but this is the hash

833
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:26,960
that makes the rosin so this is your GMO

834
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:29,420
rosin yeah GMO and this is second press

835
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,460
rosin so it's not like top notch it's

836
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:33,800
new usually the fresh the first press is

837
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:36,829
a little a little bit you know why this

838
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:39,200
is this is second second press yeah Wow

839
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:41,358

841
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:45,079
press it on the press yeah that's your

842
00:40:43,699 --> 00:40:47,629
first press and then you repress that

843
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:50,569

more impressive thanks man

846
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:56,358
it's not like I feel like a lot of us

847
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,369
like you do with his hands tied behind

848
00:40:56,358 --> 00:41:01,098
his back right like he's gonna yeah if

849
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:02,450
not the best material material well no

850
00:41:01,099 --> 00:41:04,609
it's like a lot of guys don't do the

851
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:07,009
second press they they'll press it once

852
00:41:04,608 --> 00:41:07,338
and then that bags done yeah it goes

853
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,680
away

854
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:14,320
yeah and I got it I'm like hard times

855
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:14,319
like I need to smoke I pull out a bag

856
00:41:14,858 --> 00:41:18,739
rosin you have ten bags the sonic we're

857
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:20,539
pressing every little well like I'll put

858
00:41:18,739 --> 00:41:22,579
like all the bags together at the end of

859
00:41:20,539 --> 00:41:24,469
my pressing session and press it and

860
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:26,329
like that'll just be what I'll dab out

861
00:41:24,469 --> 00:41:27,980
of off of like the peak for a couple

862
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:29,960
days there's nothing you know and it's

863
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,150
still of quality like I'm not pressing

864
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,389
like super high and I'm not pressing for

865
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:35,930
a long long time so there is still some

866
00:41:34,389 --> 00:41:37,489
press depends

867
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:39,108
yeah yeah but I feel like I'm definitely

868
00:41:37,489 --> 00:41:41,209
getting the majority I like there's only

869
00:41:39,108 --> 00:41:43,190
two grams of second press from like

870
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,720
because you know 100 grams of first

871
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:46,250
press if you didn't go full crazy

872
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,799
pressure on it you know like you ain't

873
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:50,309
yeah halfway and not to owe it right

874
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,670
press coupie fire

875
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:59,459
this fire yeah it's Sunfire right bring

876
00:41:53,670 --> 00:42:00,479
your press right it's heavy but like no

877
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:02,368
I didn't bring it

878
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:03,598

879
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:05,789
we have that guy there

880
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,068

that out right I'm super high as I'm

882
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:11,998
sure you are too but you've used those

883
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:17,728
before yeah it's easy plug and play for

884
00:42:11,998 --> 00:42:19,169
sure I have some flour actually do we

885
00:42:17,728 --> 00:42:22,498
have anything like a bags

886
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:24,239

887
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:28,759
all that stuff right there right hey

888

00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:38,130
and they kind of go kind of cool let's

890
00:42:33,748 --> 00:42:44,098
just plug it in and see any hashish the

891
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:46,858
press see what happens here we move

892
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:49,170
beside some of this glass yeah why don't

893
00:42:46,858 --> 00:42:52,528
we we can actually maybe take that stuff

894
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:53,849
off the table okay right cuz that we

895
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:56,009
just put the whole thing up there right

896
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:56,729
check this guy was it beveled like that

897
00:42:56,009 --> 00:43:05,909

898
00:42:56,728 --> 00:43:06,948
oh it's a hat Oh put this stuff like

899
00:43:05,909 --> 00:43:11,368
over here

900
00:43:06,949 --> 00:43:20,579
okay so pretty much as heavy as the

901
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:24,568
other one that's good these two plugs

902
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:28,109
back here I mean pretty simple yeah

903
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:29,548
that's what I figured that's a lot of

904
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:30,869
buttons or anything there's not a lot of

905
00:43:29,548 --> 00:43:35,818
wires hanging on the back here that it's

906
00:43:30,869 --> 00:43:37,528
got two two wires basically that has

907
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:44,429
like your thermocouple in there and your

908
00:43:37,528 --> 00:43:46,170
heating elements plates this is kind of

909
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:48,650
cool so you know I kind of bring my

910
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:48,650
finger on it

911
00:43:52,019 --> 00:44:09,639

don't know it's just all so it's like a

933
00:45:18,099 --> 00:45:22,960
very time-consuming to make I feel like

934
00:45:20,019 --> 00:45:24,789
it's like you have to press prep so much

935
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:31,510

shunned upon now in a way not really

944
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:53,800

00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:38,200
yeah my buddy how's that yeah they do

972
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,300
very good tutorials and videos you know

973
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:42,669
nice for teaching yes getting started

974
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:45,010
and they did this bottle textile for

975
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:47,500
this kind of situation where you're kind

976
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:51,010
of doing smaller presses you know right

977
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:56,469
and the way they fold the bag they

978
00:47:51,010 --> 00:48:00,250
invert the corners and then they fill it

979
00:47:56,469 --> 00:48:01,509
up you know once you pre pack it yeah

980
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:05,880
hopefully this is how they have it

981
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:05,880
worked out should slide in here right

982
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:10,150
but they they have a pre press like that

983
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:11,400
where it kind of works perfectly with

984
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:12,930
their bags

985
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,269
so let's see how this one works out but

986
00:48:12,929 --> 00:48:17,998
this way when it smashes down it's like

987
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:20,639
a cylinder it makes a good puck so it

988
00:48:17,998 --> 00:48:22,169
has a nice tight surface area word so

989
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:25,288
there's like a method to folding it in

990
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:27,980
like this yeah interesting so let's see

991
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:29,970
how this is gonna work but it's find out

992
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,778
anyone ever told you you should be a

993
00:48:29,969 --> 00:48:36,808
hand model

994
00:48:30,778 --> 00:48:39,838
I should probably cut my nails body out

995
00:48:36,809 --> 00:48:43,559
of the shot right hands just these man

996
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:45,900
hands yeah so let me grab some flour you

997
00:48:43,559 --> 00:48:48,710
don't have a scale usually like and I do

998
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:52,619
yeah right

999
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:59,159
see yeah yeah this cherry punch looks we

1000
00:48:52,619 --> 00:49:00,390
go yeah nice oh they all think is it

1001
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:02,848
enough I mean this probably enough to

1002
00:49:00,389 --> 00:49:06,268
press but I get probably small price out

1003
00:49:02,849 --> 00:49:11,789
of one of those yeah let's see how it's

1004
00:49:06,268 --> 00:49:17,699
dosey doe goes no see yeah a little

1005
00:49:11,789 --> 00:49:19,829
endured Oh see this come off I think it

1006
00:49:17,699 --> 00:49:24,838
just lays out yeah okay I wasn't using

1007
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:29,839
as a tray we'll see let's go raw yeah I

1008
00:49:24,838 --> 00:49:29,838
think these were all like 2.6 oh

1009
00:49:30,349 --> 00:49:34,619
definitely done smokes are you saying

1010
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,670
this stuff you brought yeah I'll press

1011
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:37,470
and look it saved

1012
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:41,210
we could try pressing one of those you

1013
00:49:37,469 --> 00:49:41,209
want to we're gonna start with that yeah

1014
00:49:42,139 --> 00:49:51,318
so where'd this come from

1015
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:51,319
this came from the indoors of Ojai

1016
00:49:53,210 --> 00:50:05,130
undisclosed location see this is super

1017
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:11,309
dense some good rosin yeah so there to

1018
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:12,960
get 3.8 3.8 right there so I compared to

1019
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:15,720
the one you use how would you describe

1020
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,088
this like in terms of the price yeah

1021
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:22,379
functionality is very the same you know

1022
00:50:18,088 --> 00:50:24,690
pretty much so I mean it's pretty pretty

1023
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:28,050
straightforward you know you

1024
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:32,130
the bottle jack press the plates up here

1025
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:35,310
I like how he has the so on one does

1026
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:38,250
this is that thing like the mat like can

1027
00:50:35,309 --> 00:50:39,119
you do your own this one's all manual so

1028
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:41,369
you have the manual

1029
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,588
that's what I'd rather have that yeah I

1030
00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:46,289
kind of die I want to learn kind of just

1031
00:50:43,588 --> 00:50:47,909
how to like manually work it uh-huh

1032
00:50:46,289 --> 00:50:49,889
and I like this too because you feel it

1033
00:50:47,909 --> 00:50:51,299
you get you kind of feel it tightening

1034
00:50:49,889 --> 00:50:52,920
up as you press it and you know when

1035
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:55,650
it's too much is you know you don't want

1036
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:59,579
to blow out but I like this easily

1037
00:50:55,650 --> 00:51:02,430
quickly manual mine I like having mine

1038
00:50:59,579 --> 00:51:04,560
out of this area you know it was back

1039
00:51:02,429 --> 00:51:06,659
here oh yeah so that can kind of stand

1040
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:10,969
right here get it up in here it's like

1041
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:13,230
but you know this is cool

1042
00:51:10,969 --> 00:51:18,209
so yeah I've been to the releases here

1043
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:21,539
as a quick turn and it drops it down you

1044
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:23,880
turn the right way it must be down ya

1045
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:26,130
know so I when I was trying to figure it

1046
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:28,019
out I like unscrewed that completely and

1047
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:29,730
I was looking in there as I did it and

1048
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:31,619
this oil started shooting out and I was

1049
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:33,740
like ah fuck and I quickly screwed it

1050
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:39,869
back in Oh interesting

1051
00:51:33,739 --> 00:51:43,439
we're good here I should loosen this

1052
00:51:39,869 --> 00:51:45,960
it's just not turning the and maybe

1053
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:51,240
because I completely unscrewed it could

1054
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:52,260
be I don't think I'll be able to get it

1055
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:55,318
release back down

1056
00:51:52,260 --> 00:52:00,720
the press yeah is there like something

1057
00:51:55,318 --> 00:52:03,358
wrong I think so it can't know I've

1058
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:05,269
never used one of these rosin these are

1059
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:08,639
one of the og ones huh

1060
00:52:05,269 --> 00:52:11,099
what is that nob supposed to do release

1061
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:15,000
the press release release the plates

1062
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:16,500
down gotcha cuz it should you should be

1063
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,630
able to loosen it see I'm loosening it

1064
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,519
but the nuts coming off with it and it's

1065
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:27,300
not moving the threaded bowl

1066
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:29,460
yeah you know so I think it's like if

1067
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:32,960
you had to if we took this off we could

1068
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,960
probably loosen it ourselves

1069
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:40,040
yeah you see that he's gonna come off

1070
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:41,389
yeah that was fall off yeah and if you

1071
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:43,039
just keep tightening he's just gonna go

1072
00:52:41,389 --> 00:52:46,039
in there yeah I just tightened up

1073
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:47,389
against the metal yeah cuz if we could

1074
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:49,639
tie in it and that thing supposed to be

1075
00:52:47,389 --> 00:52:52,309
like you could pull it out or you lift

1076
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:54,079
it up did you really just loosen it like

1077
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:58,369
right now it's super it's like yeah

1078
00:52:54,079 --> 00:53:04,039
tight backfield is cranked yeah it's not

1079
00:52:58,369 --> 00:53:05,840
loosening the plates yeah because this

1080
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:10,880
because the bolts on the wings of this

1081
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:16,220
one this won't do anything I know see

1082
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:18,140
this so what if we did press a we just

1083
00:53:16,219 --> 00:53:19,879
won't be able to release it at all yeah

1084
00:53:18,139 --> 00:53:25,879
oh we couldn't get it in there and you

1085
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:31,460
just press forever that's interesting

1086
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:33,890
how they have this no cuz this isn't

1087
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:35,510
moving this is what a when you and when

1088
00:53:33,889 --> 00:53:38,539
you in screwed it you loosen this bolt

1089
00:53:35,510 --> 00:53:39,830
why I wonder if I just get a something

1090
00:53:38,539 --> 00:53:42,139
to grab on to it

1091
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:44,000
yeah we could definitely tighten and

1092
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:47,569
loosen it but then we're gonna ruin

1093
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,789
these threads so we're gonna leave you

1094
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:51,890
with a little cliffhanger until the next

1095
00:53:49,789 --> 00:53:53,779
time we all get together we're not going

1096
00:53:51,889 --> 00:53:56,358
to review the rosin press today because

1097
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:57,800
when I first got it and I was playing

1098
00:53:56,358 --> 00:54:00,980
around with everything before I even

1099
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:03,109
plugged it in I basically unscrewed this

1100
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:04,369
thing till it popped out and as I was

1101
00:54:03,108 --> 00:54:07,159
peeking in here

1102
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:08,990
I saw the hydraulic fluid starts

1103
00:54:07,159 --> 00:54:12,289
squirting out and I freaked out and I

1104
00:54:08,989 --> 00:54:14,569
quickly twisted it back the bolt back in

1105
00:54:12,289 --> 00:54:16,369
but I had twisted it and I didn't

1106
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:18,440
realize it and so we were shooting and

1107
00:54:16,369 --> 00:54:22,820
we finally turned the thing on that it

1108
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:25,159
was off thread so when we're trying to

1109
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:27,950
twist this thing it wasn't grabbing the

1110
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:30,618
bolt to twist it and what this bolt is

1111
00:54:27,949 --> 00:54:33,858
is the release valve so that when you

1112
00:54:30,619 --> 00:54:36,050
press and once you're done pressing to

1113
00:54:33,858 --> 00:54:38,480
release it you just twist it like a

1114
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:42,560
quarter turn counterclockwise and the

1115
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:46,920
plates come apart so we will review it

1116
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:51,239
very soon but let me just quickly show

1117
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:53,599
you so what I did to fix it was

1118
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:59,489
basically put this thing on its back so

1119
00:54:53,599 --> 00:55:01,530
that when I unscrewed the bolt so the

1120
00:54:59,489 --> 00:55:03,169
hydraulic fluid would not come squirting

1121
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:06,359
out so basically what I did was i

1122
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:11,548
unscrewed the bulb and then I screwed it

1123
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:15,889
back in so it's I guess threaded or not

1124
00:55:11,548 --> 00:55:15,889
off thread whatever the word for that is

1125
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:33,920
now actually I don't even need to plug

1126
00:55:20,068 --> 00:55:33,920
this in to show you so basically this

1127
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:46,380
sorry all right here we go

1128
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:59,009
so now take two so now this is screwed

1129
00:55:46,380 --> 00:56:02,450
