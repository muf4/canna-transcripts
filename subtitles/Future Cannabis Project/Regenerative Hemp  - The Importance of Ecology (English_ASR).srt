00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:20,639
which is a certified organic farm along

24
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,938
with the plant which is a recreational

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,618
marijuana farm we're located in outside

26
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:28,529
of Eugene Oregon in the farming

27
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:31,019
community of Junction City and we manage

28
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,140
about a hundred acres of ground that

29
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:37,289
includes forests woodlands riparian

30
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,868
zones wetlands and a heck of a lot of

31
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,368
class one farm soil we generally have

32
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:45,688
about twenty to thirty acres in

33
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:47,670
production annually and we employ 18

34
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:50,578
people year-round including five

35
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,019
families and over the years we've

36
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:56,849
developed a style of farming that

37
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:59,039
incorporates cannabis into its long term

38
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:01,048
fertility programs soil building program

39
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,700
and crop rotation program and we've had

40
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,670
a lot of success having that be one of

41
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:10,509
our key crops intermingled amongst our

I'm a permaculture designer I've spent

53
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:43,180
my time and career applying permaculture

54
00:02:39,908 --> 00:02:45,719
designed to cannabis cultivation my

55
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:50,200
passions really just evolved into

56
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:54,400
working how I can to scale endure and

57
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:56,919
full Sun operations really so my work in

58
00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:01,659
the hemp I was a certified hemp farmer

59
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:04,719
in 2016-2017 out of Colorado and ran

60
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:06,609
that farm for a year went to scale we

61
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:10,030
had to pull out of the drought back I

62
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:12,819
think is 2017 2018 we had a really bad

63
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,400
drought in Colorado and I was yeah it

64
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:17,469
just caused a lot of farmers to pull out

65
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,200
some not to be very successful as a

66
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:22,299
result of that so finding a problem out

67
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:23,949
of that solution I built that supply

68
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:25,870
chain management company I referred to

69
00:03:23,949 --> 00:03:28,238
and we've been just working with farmers

70
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,250
to help them solve problems in the

71
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,480
movement of their hem one way or another

72
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:37,000
from biomass flower post or find goods

73
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:41,108
seeds and really helping educate farmers

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,959
who are both you know conventional

75
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:45,669
farmers shifting crops conventional

76
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,098
farmers just looking at shift organic

77
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:50,079
and then working with organic farmers

78
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:52,209
looking to shift beyond to regenerative

79
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:56,739
agricultural practices so thanks again

80
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:59,620
for being here hey everybody I'm Daniel

81
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,459
Richardson co-owner and CEO of Lane

82
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,789
Creek em company

83
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:06,810
we're in Jackson County Oregon and we

84
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:11,168
got a 40 acre spread down there and

85
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:14,889
we're growing an acre of hemp in like a

86
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:17,139
two acre cultivation zone growing it in

87
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:21,280
Hyuga berms and you

88
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:23,639
a very intensive perennial eyes system

89
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:29,528
no store-bought nutrients whatsoever

90
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:32,650
we're managing you know like nine cows a

91
00:04:29,528 --> 00:04:36,310
bunch of sheep a bunch of a bunch of

92
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:39,038
livestock and rotating them around and

93
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:42,629
just trying to work work with the land

94
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:45,938
and create nutrient basis in that way

95
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:49,240
and yeah it's been a really really

96
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:52,270
exciting project and just getting into

97
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:56,829
the into the roots of of the land and

98
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:59,620
and what you know what land Stewart can

99
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:03,068
really do on a piece of property with

100
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:06,668
the right ingredients with great Sun

101
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:09,278
great water great soil and animals and

102
00:05:06,668 --> 00:05:12,519
humans like how that symbiotic

103
00:05:09,278 --> 00:05:15,069
relationship happens and yeah just

104
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:18,818
trying to do our best in this tumultuous

105
00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:22,900
hemp scape which has been a really

106
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:25,088
really interesting project and super

107
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:28,299
excited to see where it goes but yeah

108
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:32,168
just trying to you know lead by example

109
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:35,110
and just ensure that we're building top

110
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:37,209
soil and that we're keeping fish happy

111
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,669
and we're keeping wildlife happy and

112
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:42,878
we're just trying not to grow fence

113
00:05:39,668 --> 00:05:46,478
defense and understanding that you know

114
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:49,658
then the network of fertility is so you

115
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:53,438
know it kind of circles around us as the

116
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:54,759
land steward as the human but you know

117
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,278
you have to you know this whole

118
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,778
regenerative model is different for

119
00:05:57,278 --> 00:06:01,718
everybody and you know it's just like

120
00:05:58,778 --> 00:06:04,028
it's this mindset of you know you have

121
00:06:01,718 --> 00:06:08,228
to compromise some profit and you have

122
00:06:04,028 --> 00:06:10,629
to compromise some of your needs to you

123
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:13,329
know to to allow your land to thrive and

124
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:16,629
just trying to create you know nucleuses

125
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:20,528
of of fertility and you know linking

126
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:22,689
them up and you know that's where you

127
00:06:20,528 --> 00:06:24,430
know systemic fertility really comes

128
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:26,680
from so we're just trying to you know

129
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:29,139
like I didn't grow up doing this I was a

130
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,860
heavy civil construction background and

131
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:32,569
got into the farming world

132
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,230
so now I'm going down this path and it's

133
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:42,589
just it's a it's a great canvas to work

134
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:45,170
with for the first time probably in over

135
00:06:42,589 --> 00:06:51,589
two hundred years North America seeing a

136
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:54,740
huge increase of young farmers young

137
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:58,099
farmers are very interested in buying

138
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:01,129
land they want to know how to farm it in

139
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:04,330
a way that's responsible because hemp

140
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:06,769
and cannabis has got their attention and

141
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:08,060
this is really exciting and I believe

142
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:17,060
that we have this wonderful opportunity

143
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:18,649
to give you know to hire and and and

144
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:22,009
give alternatives and be more creative

145
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:24,429
two big AG and while this plant is an

146
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:27,680
incredible regenerator it is a

147
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:31,480
remediated can feed the world it can

148
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:35,689
give fiber to us and give us medicine

149
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:40,550
there is still as this hemp industry

150
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:43,610
ramped up there is a lot of people doing

151
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,490
it's still big AG style and there's some

152
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:49,129
real problems and I wanted to talk a bit

153
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:51,050
about those and and go through and you

154
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:53,149
all tell me about the solutions that you

155
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,110
have for them and one that we're seeing

156
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:58,939
is thousands of acres underneath plastic

157
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:01,370
mulching is what they call it which is

158
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:03,500
basically planting the plants and

159
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:07,579
putting layers of plastic over thousands

160
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:10,160
of acres and that's not going to

161
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:12,379
regenerate the land or the waterways at

162
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,160
all it's a horrible environmental

163
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:18,469
disaster so it's our responsibility as

164
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,330
regenerative hemp farmer's to change

165
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,850
that reality and get the education out

166
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:27,289
so I'd love to hear from you all about

167
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:32,540
some really good solutions to that well

168
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:33,860
that'd be that being said for us I feel

169
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,959
like a lot of people in this room that

170
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:39,919
probably have experience or have

171
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:41,540
dedicated their lives to ganja what it

172
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,949
was like for me you know as a teenager

173
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,639
and learning how to grow crops and

174
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,640
learning how to

175
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:49,129
we'd looking to like people that were

176
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,710
older for us to have success we were

177
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:54,200
told you couldn't get chunky killer

178
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:58,129
yields of sticky buds without using

179
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,660
bottle synthetic nutrients or once you

180
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:01,309
have spider mites the only way you're

181
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:02,929
gonna get rid of him was avid or

182
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:03,529
FloorMate or whatever other toxic

183
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:06,289
bullshit

184
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:10,730
was being pushed on people so that being

185
00:09:06,289 --> 00:09:12,189
said not one to to go down that road we

186
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:15,139
would have our pen and paper and

187
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:17,270
listening to our elders who were able to

188
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:20,600
pull off killer ganja without using any

189
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:22,549
of those inputs so I'm seeing the same

190
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,830
thing happening in with plastic right

191
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:26,750
now where people are being told that the

192
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:30,200
plants won't size up in time or you

193
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:32,210
won't be able to manage weeds or water

194
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,400
retention whatever the reason is and I

195
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:37,340
can tell you from experience and with

196
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,840
lots of crops over the years that the

197
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,990
Willamette Valley is not an ideal

198
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,610
climate to grow cannabis you have to you

199
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:45,200
have to be on it and there's a lot of

200
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:47,180
nuances that that are the difference

201
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,940
between make and break and you do not

202
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:53,750
need plastic mulch to go killer high

203
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,810
quality cannabis hemp CBD any of it so

204
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,730
we have found a really good alternative

205
00:09:55,809 --> 00:10:03,319
I'll just kind of nuts-and-bolts our

206
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:05,779
style we I think that to start off in

207
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,840
any industry especially farming

208
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:11,959
especially cannabis starting small is

209
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:14,180
key learn your plants learn your crew

210
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,620
learn your land get it all work together

211
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:18,620
there's no rush

212
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:20,810
anytime I jump ahead and try to grow two

213
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,700
acres at onions versus one I get

214
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:24,649
tennis-ball onions instead of softball

215
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:30,920
sized onions it's the same exact thing

216
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:33,049
for cannabis that being said I think one

217
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:34,699
person with a strong back and a strong

218
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,829
will with a green thumb

219
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,920
can manage about an acre is the

220
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:42,200
threshold hands-on especially when it

221
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,899
comes to weeds which while on the topic

222
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,640
of plastic mulch we're a bit bigger than

223
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:50,990
that we did about twelve and a half

224
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:53,210
acres of high CBD this year in one two

225
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,029
quarter acre to half acre two-acre plot

226
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,870
Saul kind of scattered around our

227
00:10:55,029 --> 00:11:00,470
chessboard overall

228
00:10:56,870 --> 00:11:02,899
our properties and just nuts and bolts

229
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:05,720
how we got it done some of it was direct

230
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:08,240
seeded some of it was transplanted then

231
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,700
after the first round of weeds come up

232
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,549
when the plants are established we come

233
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:18,320
through with hoes wheel hoes hand weeds

234
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:20,149
secondary first of us we're slightly

235
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,129
mechanized so the old-school tractors

236
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:24,169
like the allis-chalmers G's and the farm

237
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:26,480
all cups these things were built to last

238
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:28,189
forever and then multiple functions but

239
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,710
will come down and literally drive on

240
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,170
our tractor and knock down the weeds in

241
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:35,300
row with basket leaders we come by a

242
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:37,429
second time with the finger weeders

243
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:39,829
which will smother the in row weeds and

244
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:42,289
then our crew just comes through pans

245
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:44,450
and hoes like the ground troops knocking

246
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:48,079
back with the with the tractors couldn't

247
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:50,778
knock down then if we could we can time

248
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,150
and right and and and timely cultivation

249
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:54,889
is key in any farming operation the

250
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:56,360
second round we can get away with no

251
00:11:54,889 --> 00:11:58,250
hand weeding and just have our finger

252
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,740
leaders just smother the in row weeds

253
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:02,360
and then we follow that up with a

254
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:05,330
combination of cover crops

255
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:10,190
ideally grass a rye grass or an annual

256
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:11,810
grass and we we're really digging a New

257
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:13,880
Zealand white clover for ganja in

258
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:16,849
particular the reason I like the white

259
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:18,350
clover is that it grows really short so

260
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,430
it doesn't kind of choke your understory

261
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:24,950
canopy and also it is more drought

262
00:12:22,429 --> 00:12:26,719
tolerant so we water it in overhead and

263
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,350
once it's established it can take foot

264
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,540
traffic

265
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:32,420
so in our Isles we can walk all over it

266
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:34,278
and it won't we won't smother it and it

267
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,909
can take less irrigation and it'll still

268
00:12:34,278 --> 00:12:38,600
thrive

269
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:40,879
then we find if you can get that clover

270
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,399
not turned until the following like late

271
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,470
spring early summer when after its

272
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:48,379
flowered the amount of nitrogen boost

273
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:50,480
you get from flowered New Zealand clover

274
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:52,759
is choked you can't even believe how

275
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,320
much it builds up your soil so those are

276
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:57,528
all alternatives not only are we

277
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,589
creating an environment for beneficial

278
00:12:57,528 --> 00:13:03,708
insects and habitat and choking out all

279
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:06,920
the competing weed species but we're

280
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:08,779
also creating a natural living mulch

281
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:10,309
that's an alternative to plastic mulch

282
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:12,620
and in my

283
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:15,589
my experience I think gives you a much

284
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:18,528
superior end product and we're building

285
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:21,470
soil exactly and and one more thought

286
00:13:18,528 --> 00:13:23,600
the grass come combined with the clover

287
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,370
the reason for that clover is a lot

288
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,839
slower to germinate and a lot of times

289
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:29,089
your next round of weeds will just choke

290
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,920
it out where your grasses can kind of

291
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:32,900
come up immediately and choke out all

292
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:34,278
the invasive weed species that were

293
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:37,519
already there and all your broadleaf

294
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:40,159
grasses grasses and weeds and then after

295
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,899
that's established you mow that back and

296
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,179
your clover comes through and then by

297
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:46,370
this time of year all you see is fields

298
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:54,250
of clover thank you

299
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:58,100
thank you Matt appreciate that so I

300
00:13:54,250 --> 00:14:00,440
think to to address the plastic mulch

301
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,389
thing you know we really just have to

302
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,930
ask ourselves what problems are farmers

303
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:08,000
having with you know the approach to

304
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:11,239
setting up farms and and most of the

305
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,470
time what I found you know I work

306
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:18,919
directly with and oversee probably about

307
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:22,399
13 14 farms all over the country and a

308
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:24,740
lot of them are art and and this is by

309
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,449
nature of just the the demand for the

310
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,509
market hopping into the season in the

311
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:31,100
spring they're they're seeing the

312
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:32,779
dollars they're seeing the green rush

313
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,460
they're seeing the need to just get to

314
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:37,179
heart get to market gets market get

315
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:39,470
plants in the ground and they're they're

316
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:41,959
ultimately missing the boat on the

317
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,790
reality that to go towards for example

318
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,389
an organic no-till methodology which is

319
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:50,149
a great solution for you know broad

320
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:52,939
scale hemp cultivation that's on

321
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:54,500
relatively flat land they're they're

322
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,380
missing the boat on planting those cover

323
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,360
crops in the fall so really one of the

324
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:01,009
best advices that I have the people that

325
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,690
are looking to get into farming or

326
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:05,659
looking to really get into this large

327
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,820
scale organic no-till thing with with

328
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:11,028
regeneration as as sort of the long

329
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:14,420
long-term end goal it's really to start

330
00:15:11,028 --> 00:15:18,350
your design work you know June August

331
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:21,240
September of the year before work with

332
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:24,028
with land where you're able to

333
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,149
to have fallow fields where you're able

334
00:15:24,028 --> 00:15:29,399
to to leave places for plants to

335
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:30,990
continuously occupy the ground because

336
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,059
you know at the end of the day the the

337
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,399
big take away with cover crops is that

338
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:37,769
you really want to treat them is is with

339
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,740
as much love as you do you know the the

340
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:44,490
crops that generate your your your sort

341
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,720
of primary source of income again if we

342
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,240
look through the lens of permaculture

343
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,089
and you know different sustainable and

344
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,009
regenerative methodologies simply you

345
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:57,120
know sourcing your livelihood off of one

346
00:15:53,009 --> 00:16:01,559
plant one stream of revenue and on a you

347
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,230
know sort of financial monoculture begs

348
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:05,869
the question of you know whether that's

349
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,580
holistic in and of itself so assuming

350
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:10,370
you know we have the ability to do the

351
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,930
right kind of design work the foresight

352
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:16,320
to be able to start designing the year

353
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:19,469
before you know the concept and and it's

354
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,330
going to vary from region to region but

355
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:25,080
the the general concept is you're

356
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:27,750
planting a hairy vetch awry somewhere

357
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:31,170
depending on your zone from is as early

358
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:33,299
as end of Aqaba end of august to

359
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:36,419
generally you know no later than October

360
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:39,569
15th you're planting a type of cover

361
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:42,328
crops that are that are really going to

362
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:44,550
grow up over winter and then you know in

363
00:16:42,328 --> 00:16:46,109
the fall or in the spring you're going

364
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:48,120
to use certain implements that are

365
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:50,639
designed that have been designed by the

366
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,950
Rodale Institute and if anybody really

367
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,919
wants to go deep into organic no-tell it

368
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:57,899
suggests you really studying the the

369
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:00,059
work that the Rodale Institute has put

370
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:01,470
out there they have free designs for

371
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:04,078
what are called roller crimpers which

372
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:07,049
are the basis for how to actually create

373
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:10,318
long-term mulch for these organic

374
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:12,419
no-till systems which again technically

375
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:15,599
speaking they're not no-till right so

376
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:17,339
most no-till farmers are doing single

377
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,958
passes at the beginning of the year you

378
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:21,088
know and then they're doing another pass

379
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,209
to harvest at the at the end of the year

380
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:26,250
so as you as you sort of look at the

381
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,529
season on the cycle you're planting your

382
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:30,630
cover crops in the fall you're buying or

383
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:32,808
you're buying or you're making what's

384
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,600
called a roller crimper which

385
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:39,619
you know is there is the idea of taking

386
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:43,339
you know a rye grasses and with this

387
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:46,099
really a big metal cylindrical tool

388
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:48,648
excuse me a cylindrical tool with what

389
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:50,569
they call a chevron pattern you're able

390
00:17:48,648 --> 00:17:52,189
to actually roll this this thing

391
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,499
typically you put it on the front of the

392
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,538
tractor and this is in the spring so

393
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:58,399
again I'm trying to keep the cycle going

394
00:17:56,538 --> 00:18:01,579
but you plant it in the fall in the

395
00:17:58,398 --> 00:18:03,138
spring you plan on rolling and crimping

396
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:05,449
your crop so you put this roller crimper

397
00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:07,998
on the front of the tractor and then on

398
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,490
the usually you have to do two passes

399
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:12,950
usually you'll plant four generally

400
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:16,339
speaking a winter rye and then a hairy

401
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:19,369
vetch the first pass the the Rye will go

402
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:21,079
down and then generally speaking

403
00:18:19,368 --> 00:18:22,638
sometimes the hairy vetch will pop back

404
00:18:21,079 --> 00:18:24,499
up say if they do another pass with the

405
00:18:22,638 --> 00:18:26,329
roller crimper and on the back of the

406
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:28,548
tractor is where your you're planting

407
00:18:26,329 --> 00:18:31,668
implements are planted so the idea is

408
00:18:28,548 --> 00:18:33,589
that the roller crimper rolls the the

409
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:35,240
res whats called residue to the ground

410
00:18:33,589 --> 00:18:37,339
and then on the back of the tractor

411
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,368
they're basically disc cutters that

412
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:41,808
split the residue spread it apart spread

413
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:43,628
it apart just enough for you to be able

414
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:46,668
to get a cutting or seed start in there

415
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:48,138
and then behind the tractor on that same

416
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:51,769
implement you're running behind and

417
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:53,798
planting accordingly so I think the

418
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:56,388
that's one solution for broad scale

419
00:18:53,798 --> 00:19:00,079
agriculture you're able to certainly

420
00:18:56,388 --> 00:19:01,908
reduce your passes and when it comes

421
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,038
down to it if you have the ability to do

422
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:09,528
the foresight and design should

423
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:12,368
eliminate at scale plastic mulch also

424
00:19:09,528 --> 00:19:16,220
the big takeaway for organic no-till is

425
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:17,148
most of it isn't necessarily organic so

426
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,548
you got to make sure that you're

427
00:19:17,148 --> 00:19:21,859
following a biological pathway to it a

428
00:19:19,548 --> 00:19:24,918
lot of organic no-till farmers are still

429
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:27,558
spraying or organic or no-till farms or

430
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:30,919
spring glyphosate sd4 and all sorts of

431
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:31,970
chemicals herbicides on there thank you

432
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,100
that's awesome

433
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,200
and Daniel can you maybe add maybe

434
00:19:34,099 --> 00:19:37,178
weight kind of

435
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,630
foods you might be able to plant within

436
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:43,090
your you know a part of your system yeah

437
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:46,330
absolutely you know in any fertile

438
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:49,658
environment there's going to be a lot of

439
00:19:46,329 --> 00:19:52,689
growth and in you know in our like firm

440
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:56,019
no-till environment we're you know come

441
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:58,058
grass season it's just unbelievable what

442
00:19:56,019 --> 00:20:03,220
happens in those Hyuga berms I mean we

443
00:19:58,058 --> 00:20:06,398
got chest-deep grass by 420 and you know

444
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:09,120
trying to to deal with all that and like

445
00:20:06,398 --> 00:20:12,839
you know you're you're looking at this

446
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:15,908
you know this gardenscape that you're

447
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:18,970
approaching to plant your your annual

448
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:22,028
into and it is just fully thick with

449
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,889
with annual grasses and perennials but

450
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:28,388
that's a great thing you know you just

451
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:31,629
have to manage those properly and so we

452
00:20:28,388 --> 00:20:34,298
do a lot of like just stepping on the

453
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:38,350
grass and just like getting what was

454
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:40,509
that word you use the well the residue

455
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:42,730
the residue thank you that's I didn't

456
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:46,269
know that one yeah making the residue

457
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:48,159
and you know so you're prioritizing you

458
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:50,710
know you're pulling up annuals and

459
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,380
you're chopping dropping all of your

460
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:57,639
perennials to just create space for for

461
00:20:53,380 --> 00:21:01,450
your annual but we have a ton of

462
00:20:57,638 --> 00:21:06,099
potatoes and onions and garlic in our

463
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:09,519
system because everything's got to eat

464
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:12,668
we have a lot of rodents we have a lot

465
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:15,038
of you know moles and voles and all of

466
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:17,169
these things and everything everything

467
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:21,519
needs to eat so we found that potatoes

468
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:24,820
in with with the hemp has been a

469
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:27,720
lifesaver they come up and they create

470
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:29,168
this this great canopy loving potato

471
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,419
what's that

472
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:32,500
we love potatoes oh my god they're just

473
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:33,940
delicious too

474
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,339
it's like they're everywhere it's like

475
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:39,580
Lou I'll take some of that onions

476
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:42,609
everywhere so it it's a it's a fabulous

477
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:46,109
way to to just you know think about it

478
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:48,750
you know mulch for us is is

479
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:52,169
yeah his is grass and is material that's

480
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:58,170
grown ideally right right in place we do

481
00:21:52,170 --> 00:22:00,929
import a lot of rice straw and wood

482
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:03,480
chips we run a lot of wood chips and

483
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:06,840
just to squelch those springtime grasses

484
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,960
to like create space to plug your your

485
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:12,178
annuals in and as the summer extends

486
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,269
then you know those annuals are I'm

487
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:17,790
sorry those those grasses you know

488
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:20,429
become less prevalent but and in the

489
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:23,519
spring you know you got a you've got to

490
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:26,669
do your due diligence to get those to

491
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:29,069
get those grasses down I love it and

492
00:22:26,669 --> 00:22:31,950
you're able to use fungi and garden

493
00:22:29,069 --> 00:22:34,230
giant says to eat those grasses and that

494
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:36,090
creates a filter so all the water that's

495
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,160
coming over the ground is filtered

496
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:41,279
through that system and so you're a

497
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,509
positive impact on the environment David

498
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,359
you have a something you want to add to

499
00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:52,099
that yeah our approach unlike a

500
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:55,490
production foods farm is we initially in

501
00:22:52,099 --> 00:22:58,740
cannabis days or medical days we would

502
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:00,960
are you first year we would do cannabis

503
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:05,099
in a greenhouse and follow up the second

504
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,660
year and one thing that about cannabis

505
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:09,119
versus a lot of other crops it's it's a

506
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,860
really it's a heavier feeding crop so

507
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:12,178
it's kind of once it gets rolling as

508
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:14,308
most of you guys know what kind of gets

509
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,809
that feed me Seymour vibe you can throw

510
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:21,119
everything at and it's gonna love it up

511
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:22,649
that being said whether your whatever

512
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,058
your agricultural practices are if

513
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,620
you're building your own fertility and

514
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:28,440
having your own animals for manure and

515
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:30,959
doing green manures and composting or

516
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:34,350
you're bringing in amendments and inputs

517
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:38,130
ideally regionally if not locally for

518
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:40,199
ganja and cannabis and hemp it's all the

519
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,940
same plan obviously we're really

520
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,610
throwing everything we have at it so

521
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,710
then year three and year four where we

522
00:23:44,609 --> 00:23:49,409
initially had those things planting

523
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:51,779
other food crops we finally get really

524
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:54,029
high yields really bountiful crops that

525
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:56,668
are super healthy with zero additional

526
00:23:54,029 --> 00:23:58,109
inputs so it's a rich you know Kelly

527
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,930
talking about a lot of young folks just

528
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:01,209
getting into farming

529
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,799
for the first time and cannabis bringing

530
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:04,870
them in the farm it's a really good

531
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,210
first year crop and as most people know

532
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:10,169
here you know the whole philosophy

533
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:13,390
behind crop rotations is the different

534
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:15,400
different families of crops have

535
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:18,009
different disease pressures different

536
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:20,290
pest pressures and uptake different

537
00:24:18,009 --> 00:24:22,420
nutrients from the soil so the mono

538
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:25,149
cropping system where as far as you can

539
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:27,550
see having a crop growing year after

540
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:29,110
year the same crop an inch eventually

541
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,700
those depletions are going to lead to

542
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:33,250
imbalances and that's where the heavy

543
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:35,410
artillery of fungicides and fumigants

544
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:38,289
and insecticides come into play but

545
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:39,850
smaller scale so as much diversity as

546
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:41,409
you can and just having this giant

547
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:42,759
chessboard where you're playing a shell

548
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:44,920
game with the pests and diseases

549
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:47,410
cannabis is a really good first-year

550
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,360
crop to segue into other food production

551
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:51,880
and we've had a lot of success with it

552
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:53,769
that was kind of my lord to get into

553
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,810
hemp to begin with and seeing that we

554
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:58,029
could have kind of bigger tracts for

555
00:24:55,809 --> 00:25:00,990
bigger other tracks down the road and

556
00:24:58,029 --> 00:25:04,930
kind of have bigger squares on our

557
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:06,700
chessboard if you will and also one

558
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:08,500
thing I wanted to add is that with

559
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,120
plastic mulching we're really looking at

560
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,740
mono culturing like you all we're

561
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:13,750
talking about in poly culture is

562
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:16,420
incredibly important right now as we're

563
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:18,009
looking at the hemp aphid anybody who's

564
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,950
growing hemp or anybody who's growing

565
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:23,140
cannabis is starting if you if you

566
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:26,259
haven't had this pest in your garden you

567
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:28,540
will it's coming for you it's here it's

568
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:31,660
here to stay it's incredibly healthy and

569
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:33,670
and our cannabis populations are feeding

570
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,440
them we need to be very vigilant and

571
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:37,870
taking care of them and one way that we

572
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,330
can do that and it really is the only

573
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:42,969
way to do that is through polyculture is

574
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:45,460
inviting in massive amounts of predators

575
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:47,259
to take care of those aphids they're

576
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,600
really delicious they're soft they're

577
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:51,220
sweet they taste like cannabis if

578
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,409
they're sucking our cannabis plants

579
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:56,470
they're super nutria t'v and there's a

580
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:58,779
massive amount of predator bugs that

581
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:01,690
live on all of our pollinator plants

582
00:25:58,779 --> 00:26:03,819
that love to eat them up so and I wanted

583
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:05,559
to move right into a big question about

584
00:26:03,819 --> 00:26:07,480
hemp right now and regenerative hemp

585
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:10,269
which seems to be the really hot topic

586
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,058
is scaling you know there's this

587
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:13,220
conversation

588
00:26:11,058 --> 00:26:14,839
no you can only scale this many acres

589
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:17,450
and be regenerate over you can only

590
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:21,189
scale this many acres or what do you all

591
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:26,480
feel about what's scalable in your eyes

592
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:30,038
for regenerative hemp I would say you

593
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,599
know ultimately if you can have

594
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:34,429
everything coming off your farm I mean

595
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:36,619
that would be the ideal situation where

596
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:39,259
a portion of your farm was wild a

597
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:42,798
portion of your farm made hay a portion

598
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:45,558
of your farm had weeds and grew

599
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:47,538
you know nutrients for any teas you

600
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:51,408
might need or different mulches or maybe

601
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:55,158
it's flowers for the pollinators and in

602
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:58,429
my perfect scaled world the farm is part

603
00:26:55,159 --> 00:27:01,970
of an intact environment where there's

604
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:06,139
trees around there's birds flying

605
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:09,019
through you know there's flowers

606
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:12,109
happening and in that the hemp is

607
00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:17,179
thriving and it's filtering the soil and

608
00:27:12,109 --> 00:27:19,490
I think that can be done you know to put

609
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:22,970
a number on it who knows you know 10 to

610
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:25,609
20 acres or anything I there are some

611
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:27,769
really good examples out there of you

612
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:29,928
know seven hundred and thousand acre

613
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:32,149
plots where they're you know doing

614
00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:34,369
roller crimping stuff and and I think

615
00:27:32,148 --> 00:27:38,449
that can be really beneficial I think I

616
00:27:34,368 --> 00:27:40,849
think anyone is trying to who's enabling

617
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:42,679
the environment to thrive while they're

618
00:27:40,849 --> 00:27:44,859
creating medicine you know that's gonna

619
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:49,240
be beneficial but I think in large-scale

620
00:27:44,859 --> 00:27:51,918
production we should probably do rows of

621
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,339
flowers through it you know we should

622
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:58,038
figure out ways to do like one row of

623
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:59,658
hemp and maybe berries through you know

624
00:27:58,038 --> 00:28:01,460
or some you know just alternate your

625
00:27:59,659 --> 00:28:03,440
crops throughout the thing because that

626
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,538
diversity really is gonna help you with

627
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,590
the hemp aphids so that's what I'm

628
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:12,230
thinking at the moment well for me I

629
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:15,678
feel like it has a lot to do with your

630
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:18,069
your location you know for example the

631
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,028
amount of tomatoes you can grow in in

632
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:21,558
Quebec is not going to be the same

633
00:28:20,028 --> 00:28:23,990
amount that you can grow in Southern

634
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:24,589
California the eastern shelf of Colorado

635
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:27,528
this

636
00:28:24,589 --> 00:28:30,349
is a lot more appropriate for scale but

637
00:28:27,528 --> 00:28:32,210
I also think that you know the economy

638
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:34,099
of scale has everything to do with your

639
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,140
experience and the crew that you're

640
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:37,879
working with so you know if you have a

641
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:39,320
dream team crew of experienced people

642
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,850
that working together for a long time

643
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:43,428
and you're appropriately

644
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:45,439
you know small-scale mechanized I think

645
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:47,179
the sky can kind of be the limit as long

646
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,080
as you're saying principals don't get

647
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:51,140
compromised

648
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:53,418
the larger you get in size and I think

649
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:55,850
one really good thing that kind of tying

650
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:59,509
the the what is regenerative when it

651
00:28:55,849 --> 00:29:02,658
comes to scale and what you were saying

652
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:07,220
about the the planning ahead and the

653
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:09,620
season ahead I think a good mantra for

654
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:12,980
any business and especially in farming

655
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:15,019
especially in cannabis farming one thing

656
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:17,149
that I like to think of is the the seven

657
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:20,839
P's if you haven't heard of this the

658
00:29:17,148 --> 00:29:23,349
seven P's is prior the proper planning

659
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:26,569
and preparation prevent piss-poor

660
00:29:23,349 --> 00:29:31,759
performance so if you can have your

661
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:33,918
seven P's in line with your principles I

662
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:36,589
am of the opinion that the sky's the

663
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,049
limit because really in shifting the

664
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:41,480
paradigm for a utopia with a lot of

665
00:29:39,048 --> 00:29:43,250
little micro farms every they're over

666
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,769
there and then the people that have the

667
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:48,589
biggest impact that are that are taking

668
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:50,658
the most acreage up you know even if

669
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:52,069
it's a watered-down USDA version of

670
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:54,409
organic first of what we think is

671
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:57,109
organic these big players that's that

672
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:58,940
many less millions of barrels of shit

673
00:29:57,109 --> 00:30:01,250
that they're putting in our environment

674
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,500
waterways every year so the balance of

675
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:06,409
us finding new solutions without

676
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:09,099
alienating the bigger growers is is part

677
00:30:06,409 --> 00:30:11,840
of the work we have to do they might be

678
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:15,740
yeah I think that that's a great point I

679
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:18,589
was just speaking to a colleague and

680
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:22,460
just to convert our our ability to

681
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:25,788
convert farmers from heavily chemical

682
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:27,919
glyphosate ridden parcels to you know

683
00:30:25,788 --> 00:30:30,440
more conscious cultivation simply by

684
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,028
shifting one crop in their in their

685
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:35,659
lives you'd be surprised at how quickly

686
00:30:32,028 --> 00:30:37,069
a corn farm Oh will will grow will shift

687
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:39,680
their crops grow

688
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:41,359
without pesticides simply because you

689
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,640
know they're seeing the market value of

690
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:45,169
this crop so I think the conversion rate

691
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,970
is super-important I mean we're talking

692
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:49,550
two hundred and eighty five thousand

693
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:51,620
acres that were licensed this year up

694
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:53,599
from seventy eight thousand last year

695
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:56,209
you know and so when we start talking

696
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:57,289
about regeneration we need to start

697
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,539
really talking about carbon

698
00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:01,609
sequestration and the lack thereof in

699
00:30:59,539 --> 00:31:04,819
the way that we're farming this

700
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:07,939
reductionist style cannabinoid paradigm

701
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:11,349
which is not the way our forefathers and

702
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:13,309
and and our ancestors thought about that

703
00:31:11,349 --> 00:31:17,029
you know when we're talking about

704
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:18,649
asexual propagation feminization however

705
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:21,139
it's done I think no matter what we're

706
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:23,060
we're playing God in a certain way and

707
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:26,300
when we start to create these single

708
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:28,549
lines of revenue that alone

709
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:30,500
I think begs the question of of really

710
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:33,230
how can we get to the endpoints that are

711
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:36,440
on both and that are on both sides of me

712
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:38,420
here I think regeneration is a process I

713
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:40,519
think we have so many lifetimes of work

714
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,440
to do that if we ever get satisfied or

715
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:44,569
comfortable with how regenerative we are

716
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,160
I think we're fucked and I think the

717
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,169
reality is that we need to keep pushing

718
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:51,350
the edge keep pushing ourselves forward

719
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:54,380
and modeling people like this to to look

720
00:31:51,349 --> 00:31:56,509
to examples and solutions scale is the

721
00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:00,290
name of the game right now we can't keep

722
00:31:56,509 --> 00:32:02,059
up with the the good intentions and and

723
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:04,039
the conscious farming we can't keep up

724
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:06,379
with the scale at which people are

725
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:09,579
tilling I mean I'm talking 13 passes a

726
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:12,890
year imagine 13 path plus right I mean

727
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:16,549
unconventional farms it's it's to a

728
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:18,710
point where the to keep it simple I

729
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:20,180
think we just have to you know ask

730
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:22,279
ourselves how much carbon are we were

731
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,930
really sequestering period and then go

732
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:26,240
from there start reverse engineering it

733
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:29,990
but perennial eyes systems true

734
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:32,299
industrial hemp for fiber food fuel oil

735
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,950
you know that's that's I think what's

736
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:36,259
gonna really push everyone to a more

737
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:38,360
regenerative twenty-five thousand uses

738
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:40,750
for this plant which is not what we're

739
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:44,689
doing right now so no well said none

740
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:46,750
scales of a really tricky one it depends

741
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:48,519
on your end goal and

742
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:53,400
you know like they've said your location

743
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:56,889
super important I watched a balloon

744
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,890
absolutely deflate around us in Southern

745
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:00,210
Oregon it was it was hard to watch

746
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:04,350
[Music]

747
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:08,970
you know scale is a super tricky one

748
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:13,359
if you know if the sky is the limit that

749
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:16,740
that's great but you know you know we

750
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:19,509
need to really step back and like

751
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:22,720
understand what our needs are from this

752
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:24,819
plant and utilize its potential but you

753
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,670
know it has so much great potential hemp

754
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:28,659
has this unbelievable ability to and you

755
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:30,400
know if we're gonna grow it in the

756
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,660
Emerald triangle and we're gonna service

757
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:37,330
you know a huge portion of the world

758
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:39,460
then it could be really intensive on on

759
00:33:37,329 --> 00:33:42,159
our watersheds in our topsoil and if

760
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:45,640
we're if we're if we're growing an

761
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:47,710
annual on plastic mulch and we're not

762
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:51,340
remineralizing the soil in a proper

763
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:54,779
manner it's gonna be bad you know so we

764
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:57,759
have to we have to really think about

765
00:33:54,779 --> 00:33:59,740
what we're doing here and you know the

766
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,839
beautiful thing about like Kelly said

767
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:04,900
you know all these young people are not

768
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:08,769
necessarily young but just we have a new

769
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:10,898
seed we have a new ability to to take a

770
00:34:08,769 --> 00:34:12,429
great we have a great opportunity in

771
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:14,799
front of us and it's like where are we

772
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:18,789
gonna go with it like literally where

773
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:24,730
are we going with it we have a chance to

774
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:27,340
be very cognizant of our impacts or we

775
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:30,490
could just be profit mongers and just

776
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:33,309
keep planting way more than we have any

777
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:35,229
idea what we're gonna do with it and you

778
00:34:33,309 --> 00:34:37,929
know that's not necessarily that's what

779
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:39,820
happened but there was portions of that

780
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:42,389
that happened and people really got

781
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:45,399
humbled this year and I hope that we all

782
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:48,340
just can be transparent with each other

783
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:52,029
and communicate and be honest with what

784
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:54,280
our scale really needs to be it's it's

785
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:58,550
important if if you don't have anywhere

786
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:00,080
to put it probably shouldn't grow it so

787
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:01,940
I mean it's just it's it's kind of

788
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,250
common-sense stuff but it's very

789
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:06,380
exciting to get into it it's very

790
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:09,170
exciting to get into it it's a it's a

791
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,700
great opportunity but like and just

792
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,960
because you're neighbors running mulch

793
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:14,899
doesn't mean you have to

794
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:18,619
so let's communicate and and let's just

795
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:21,680
be honest with you know you know what

796
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:24,079
what we need from this plant and it's

797
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:27,139
it's definitely a balance and we're

798
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,569
teetering so we need to we need to be

799
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:33,109
careful yeah and I think it's really

800
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:36,920
interesting that you know we don't have

801
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:38,930
an idea of what successful scaling is

802
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,530
because anything in our recent history

803
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:44,269
has not shown successful scale you know

804
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:47,240
big agriculture the way that it is right

805
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:49,849
now is not successfully scaling anything

806
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:51,769
the food is beginning depleted our

807
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:55,159
waterways you know all the things that

808
00:35:51,769 --> 00:35:57,139
we know about and the other thing that I

809
00:35:55,159 --> 00:36:00,049
was thinking is that as far as scaling

810
00:35:57,139 --> 00:36:05,629
goes I really like the idea of many

811
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:09,550
farmers big land you know one farmer you

812
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:12,140
know 15 25 acres and a whole lot of

813
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:14,660
collective people working together and

814
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:18,199
and this is a model that I think could

815
00:36:14,659 --> 00:36:20,960
really keep intact integrative systems

816
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:23,419
that are you know more diverse with

817
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,860
nature on the next question that I

818
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:27,769
wanted to ask you well we really don't

819
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:30,800
have a lot of time and this is such a

820
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:34,610
hot topic that I feel like it actually

821
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:38,420
could be another hour to two hours which

822
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:41,180
is seed feminization and now hemp has

823
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:44,269
forced us to look at you know when we

824
00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:46,369
talk about scale feminizing seeds and

825
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:48,619
there's people feel a lot of different

826
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:50,000
ways about it so I thought I wanted to

827
00:36:48,619 --> 00:36:52,339
bring it up to you all we don't have

828
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,469
much time and maybe we could give some

829
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:58,370
food for thought or even ask a question

830
00:36:54,469 --> 00:37:01,069
if we don't have answers to this what I

831
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:03,589
know about it is that silver Theo

832
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:05,539
sulfate is one of the common compounds

833
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,119
used to make feminized seeds and it is a

834
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:08,940
talk

835
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:10,980
a compound and if overused can get into

836
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,778
the waterways and and I think that in

837
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:15,389
our farming what we do with the pure

838
00:37:12,778 --> 00:37:18,150
certification and all the farms that we

839
00:37:15,389 --> 00:37:19,980
work with is we just don't want to

840
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:22,410
support through our actions any use of

841
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,909
any harmful compounds and so if that's

842
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,828
gonna be a harmful compound we don't

843
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:27,629
want to use it

844
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:30,809
feminization really isn't a regenerative

845
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:32,460
practice because it's feminized you know

846
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:34,680
it's not something you can breed with to

847
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:38,039
move forward so that part right there

848
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:41,068
you know genetically may not be the best

849
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:44,278
thing but efficiency wise you know in a

850
00:37:41,068 --> 00:37:46,288
field setting I think feminization can

851
00:37:44,278 --> 00:37:50,369
make a lot of sense it is a way of

852
00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:52,528
stabilizing genetics for medicine which

853
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:55,259
is ultimately going out to the

854
00:37:52,528 --> 00:37:58,380
betterment of people and that's really

855
00:37:55,259 --> 00:38:00,449
important to us with the Dragonfly

856
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:02,130
arthritis and pure certification we had

857
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:04,018
an amazing gathering at the heartwood

858
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,119
sanctuary this last weekend

859
00:38:04,018 --> 00:38:09,298
and we are working on putting together

860
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:12,539
some guidelines on what we think is

861
00:38:09,298 --> 00:38:14,009
regenerative for hemp and feminized seed

862
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:16,349
as part of it and one of the things we

863
00:38:14,009 --> 00:38:18,778
talked about was if we did use feminized

864
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:21,660
seed on our land that maybe we still

865
00:38:18,778 --> 00:38:24,088
kept a portion of our land for regular

866
00:38:21,659 --> 00:38:25,798
seed breeding and that regular seed

867
00:38:24,088 --> 00:38:28,558
breeding and having you know the ability

868
00:38:25,798 --> 00:38:30,748
to breed is really really isn't you know

869
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:32,670
important for our future and with the

870
00:38:30,748 --> 00:38:34,949
laws changing which is a whole other

871
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,960
hour and another subject with you know

872
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:38,248
what how do we even plan for hemp in the

873
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,838
future when we don't know what the

874
00:38:38,248 --> 00:38:42,808
government's gonna do in another six

875
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:45,298
months that's kind of ridiculous and and

876
00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:47,519
also there's a ratio of CBD and THC that

877
00:38:45,298 --> 00:38:49,858
went with these new laws changes

878
00:38:47,518 --> 00:38:52,738
everything but um seeds is really

879
00:38:49,858 --> 00:38:54,538
important to consider and just we've

880
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:56,278
come up you know with the concept of the

881
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:57,720
seven we didn't come up with the concept

882
00:38:56,278 --> 00:38:59,940
but we resonate with the concept of

883
00:38:57,719 --> 00:39:01,379
seven generations so you know if you're

884
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:05,880
gonna use feminized seeds you should

885
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:07,950
maybe offset at some some other way well

886
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,410
I think see breeding in general is a hot

887
00:39:07,949 --> 00:39:12,389
topic because on the ganja scene if it

888
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:14,368
doesn't fill up the whole room when you

889
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:15,808
crack the jar and test over 25 percent

890
00:39:14,369 --> 00:39:18,150
you toss it

891
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:19,810
so we're quickly becoming like the Amish

892
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,820
with our whole gene pool

893
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:25,179
so it's gonna be a slippery slope with

894
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:27,400
in the hip game as well but at the same

895
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:32,319
time we're hemp's in its infant stage

896
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:34,930
and any farmer or any business you know

897
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,940
getting on the board and just even the

898
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:38,889
very basics of making ends meet and

899
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,309
being able to continue to do what you're

900
00:39:38,889 --> 00:39:42,879
doing

901
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:45,219
as your systems improve then you then

902
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,650
it's every farmer or every person's

903
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:49,480
responsibility to keep paring it down

904
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:52,269
and keep getting better at it with less

905
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,309
inputs so I think it's too early the

906
00:39:52,269 --> 00:39:57,610
jury's still out on the feminized

907
00:39:54,309 --> 00:40:00,929
hempseed game and I think that as this

908
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:05,740
as the industry evolves and breeding

909
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:07,989
evolves because cannabis and al-khansa

910
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:11,709
cannabis hemp it's all in its infant

911
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:15,519
stage as far as stable F ones across the

912
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:18,190
board so as it unfolds we'll learn but I

913
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:19,869
think it's too early to say you can do

914
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:21,579
this and you can't do that because it's

915
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:25,690
it's hard enough to just get out on the

916
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:27,849
field as it is right now I think I think

917
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:30,340
that make that's a great point quick

918
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:32,139
flash back I mean feminized seeds in

919
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:36,730
general in the hemp industry are a

920
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:39,849
relatively new thing and I think the the

921
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:43,420
reality is we've seen it as as one of

922
00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:46,599
the unique tools to scale and I think if

923
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:49,090
we start looking at the way for personal

924
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:51,969
heroes of mine such as Mark shepherd

925
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:54,820
Eric tones Myer Darren Daugherty I think

926
00:40:51,969 --> 00:40:57,159
if we ask them if feminized seeds are

927
00:40:54,820 --> 00:41:00,940
good beef could fit into regenerative

928
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:03,250
agriculture I mean I venture to say they

929
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:08,039
probably would just start laughing and

930
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:11,110
so I think in general is feminization

931
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:14,440
something that we find in nature I can't

932
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:17,289
exactly point to a place you know in

933
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:19,420
terms of ethylene blockers that are used

934
00:41:17,289 --> 00:41:22,360
to achieve feminization they're about

935
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:25,990
eleven known ethylene blockers the one

936
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:30,039
that Josh was talking about at the MSDS

937
00:41:25,989 --> 00:41:32,409
is 24,000 milliliters per liter for it

938
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:34,809
to be quote-unquote toxic to invite

939
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:38,559
so I think the levels to which people

940
00:41:34,809 --> 00:41:40,420
are applying these these compounds to me

941
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:43,029
a second whether they're using them or

942
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:46,150
not using feminization as sort of a

943
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:47,700
leverage point to regeneration or you

944
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:51,389
know if they're able to do things

945
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:53,889
without feminization so for me if I can

946
00:41:51,389 --> 00:41:56,589
grow crops without that kind of

947
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:59,529
technology that's my preference I think

948
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:03,430
for farmers that you know have a desire

949
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:05,950
a need and ability to scale it's been

950
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:10,769
it's been really the solution for

951
00:42:05,949 --> 00:42:15,579
acreage 10 20 40 acres and above so I

952
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:19,780
hope to see feminization become a safer

953
00:42:15,579 --> 00:42:23,079
process but I think anything anything to

954
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:25,480
keep CRISPR tech sir tech any any of

955
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:27,940
these genetic editing and genetic

956
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:31,300
modifying technologies out of these gene

957
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:34,090
pools is to me first and foremost I

958
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:39,820
think that's it's a big deal so thank

959
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:43,590
you a great point yeah there's something

960
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:47,320
systemically uncomfortable for me about

961
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:49,690
the fact that I save seed from every

962
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:53,350
other thing on my farm but every year we

963
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:55,269
we have to buy new hemp seed so but it's

964
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:57,519
just the climate that we're in and you

965
00:42:55,269 --> 00:42:59,349
know where it's brand-new we're all

966
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:02,289
moving forward and we have great

967
00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:03,639
momentum in an awesome direction so at

968
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:06,699
this point there's something

969
00:43:03,639 --> 00:43:11,019
uncomfortable about that portion of it

970
00:43:06,699 --> 00:43:14,309
for me but I know that we have so many

971
00:43:11,019 --> 00:43:16,630
good minds and so many good hearts

972
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:19,889
putting energy in in really good

973
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:24,180
directions that I'm confident that

974
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:26,889
there's a future for us growing hemp

975
00:43:24,179 --> 00:43:29,109
it's I'm trying to make it like

976
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:30,879
one-sixth of what I think about and I'm

977
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:34,450
trying to diversify my farm and

978
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:37,900
diversify my my financial landscape

979
00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:40,409
because it could just go like that and

980
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:44,170
then all of a sudden it's it's no longer

981
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:45,759
not necessarily viable but just hard to

982
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:48,460
prioritize so

983
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,440
I'm excited that we're all pooling

984
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:52,599
together and we just we need to continue

985
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,179
to unify and and and use our resources

986
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:57,309
and and just keep moving in the right

987
00:43:55,179 --> 00:44:00,940
direction thank you and I would add

988
00:43:57,309 --> 00:44:04,059
ultimately you know using male and

989
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:06,130
female regular seeds is is the ultimate

990
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:08,440
goal and there are field test kits that

991
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:11,858
farmers can get and it does make sense

992
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:14,318
you to start you know all your male and

993
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:16,719
female you know regular seeds and then

994
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:19,599
sex test all of them and do and then in

995
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:23,439
that you can do a mega phyno hunt and

996
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:25,720
and really in hemp has shown us CBD is

997
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,000
the talk right now but CBG has been

998
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:31,750
grown this year and maybe it's CBD V

999
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:34,690
next year and THC V that the hemp has

1000
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:37,000
the ability to harbor cannabinoids and

1001
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:40,059
then that you know brings on the subject

1002
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:42,639
of hemp as industrial hemp or hemp as

1003
00:44:40,059 --> 00:44:45,579
cannabinoid him and that's a further

1004
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:47,710
discussion another our discussion but

1005
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:49,630
you know cannabinoid hemp is what we're

1006
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:51,579
really interested in because of the

1007
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:54,940
medicinal qualities in it but we really

1008
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:58,599
also need to really promote an embrace

1009
00:44:54,940 --> 00:45:01,260
fiber hemp and seed hemp and hemp seed

1010
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:04,059
as a food is a phenomenal thing and

1011
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:08,079
being able to create hempcrete and

1012
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:11,140
plastics and even biofuels from hemp is

1013
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:13,359
something that is extremely important to

1014
00:45:11,139 --> 00:45:15,460
us and i really have an issue with

1015
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:19,298
clear-cutting and logging in the

1016
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:22,000
mindless devastation of the forest when

1017
00:45:19,298 --> 00:45:25,719
we can grow hemp for fiber to replace

1018
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,818
cellulose on the market i

1019
00:45:25,719 --> 00:45:29,709
I want to go crazy over certain things

1020
00:45:27,818 --> 00:45:33,009
you know and that's one of them so I you

1021
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:36,010
know let's let's figure out ways to have

1022
00:45:33,010 --> 00:45:39,430
hemp farming work together you know I

1023
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:41,319
don't think that fiber and an industrial

1024
00:45:39,429 --> 00:45:43,210
hemp needs to be grown maybe in the same

1025
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:44,980
place as that medicinal hemp has grown

1026
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:50,318
and as a community maybe we can create

1027
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:51,909
maps for that so is there any questions

1028
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:53,090
in the audience that we had I know we

1029
00:45:51,909 --> 00:45:54,829
don't have time

1030
00:45:53,090 --> 00:46:01,510
is there any other quick questions

1031
00:45:54,829 --> 00:46:05,269
anyone had really quickly elevation

1032
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:11,480
resulting without us use subsurface trip

1033
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:14,110
what do you guys know of that use can

1034
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:17,240
you repeat the subsurface drip systems

1035
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:20,150
for him which would help believe you

1036
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:23,179
yeah I'm relatively familiar and it

1037
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:26,809
doesn't work I mean yeah I got a friend

1038
00:46:23,179 --> 00:46:29,809
in Greeley Colorado that did 68 on 68

1039
00:46:26,809 --> 00:46:33,049
acres I think there were seven zones all

1040
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:37,849
sub irrigation using net afem it's a

1041
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:41,030
company that you know so I mean the

1042
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:43,730
logic that the technology if you can

1043
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:45,950
afford the 3500 bucks an acre whatever

1044
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:48,170
it is to set it up I mean he's seen

1045
00:46:45,949 --> 00:46:52,159
incredible success with it allows for

1046
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:55,400
the plant to achieve really the same

1047
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:58,279
successes you know the ideas that they

1048
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:00,349
bury large pipes of sub irrigated piping

1049
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,810
under the ground and then the plants can

1050
00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:06,230
go down fetch the water through

1051
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:08,630
capillary action it will rise but it

1052
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:11,630
mitigates the weed pressure in a way

1053
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:13,190
because there isn't top-down watering so

1054
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:16,579
for example one of the big problems for

1055
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:18,139
with with pivots is that you're watering

1056
00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:20,480
your weeds just as much as you're

1057
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:21,889
watering your your hemp right so if

1058
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,590
you're working with sub-irrigation

1059
00:47:21,889 --> 00:47:27,199
you're not giving the competitive

1060
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:29,390
advantage that weeds might have if they

1061
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:32,509
were you know if they had access to the

1062
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:34,809
abundant amount of water that said it's

1063
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:38,300
a very mechanized farm certified organic

1064
00:47:34,809 --> 00:47:40,639
three people harvest 68 acres so it's

1065
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:44,630
not exactly your model for regeneration

1066
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:47,839
or necessarily that paradigm but yeah

1067
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:50,769
and one of the one other thing of the as

1068
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:52,990
far as on no plastic film

1069
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:55,599
to understand that there's still a lot

1070
00:47:52,989 --> 00:47:58,959
of fossil fuel input for cultivation of

1071
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:02,980
an acre and the continued tractor work

1072
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:05,139
it's needed and additional people so the

1073
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:13,510
energetic the energy embedded needs to

1074
00:48:05,139 --> 00:48:15,159
be looked at as well not just just you

1075
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:18,190
know we can do away with a lot of stuff

1076
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:20,409
irrigation if we are properly doing

1077
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:24,429
mulching and we're properly doing cover

1078
00:48:20,409 --> 00:48:26,318
crops we can really and even even

1079
00:48:24,429 --> 00:48:28,960
tractor work all of that can be really

1080
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:31,779
mitigated by you know using more natural

1081
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:34,480
systems and you know we we're gonna have

1082
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:36,609
to wrap it up I really thank you all for

1083
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,199
coming out today this is an incredibly

1084
00:48:36,608 --> 00:48:41,139
important topic we've barely even

1085
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:43,088
scratched a surface on a multitude of

1086
00:48:41,139 --> 00:48:45,548
issues that need to be discussed in hemp

1087
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:48,699
and like Josh was saying earlier this is

1088
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:50,619
cannabis this is you know an important

1089
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:52,989
plant that's here to save the planet

1090
00:48:50,619 --> 00:48:55,599
it's here to save communities and I

1091
00:48:52,989 --> 00:48:57,399
think that the more that we have these

1092
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,260
community discussions and the more that

1093
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,539
we work together as communities is the

1094
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:03,190
more that we can bring up the evolution

1095
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:04,920
of this plant and the evolution of our

1096
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:07,358
own species as humans on the planet

1097
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,250
thank you all so much for being here

1098
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:13,929
today

1099
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:17,079
[Applause]

1100
00:49:13,929 --> 00:49:17,078
thanks guys
