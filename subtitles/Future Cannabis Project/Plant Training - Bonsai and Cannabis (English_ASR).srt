1
00:00:04,669 --> 00:00:09,888
we loved rowers and we loved the growth

2
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:13,439
from the amazing cannabis plant to

3
00:00:09,888 --> 00:00:15,899
bonsai trees we and the bonsai trees are

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,439
a real passion we travel around with a

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,028
group of friends and we learned it we

6
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:23,100
are involved in that community and I've

7
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:24,899
taken what I've learned from bonsai

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,028
though they're different animals and

9
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:30,000
some degrees into the cannabis industry

10
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:33,960
and it's all about learning to train the

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,780
plant and about how to get what you want

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,000
and how to manipulate that so can you

13
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,340
start with bonsai and talk about like

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,808
the art of training a bonsai tree

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:50,460
absolutely so a bonsai tree starts off

16
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:54,929
it can be in a tree that you pull out of

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:01:00,448
a ground or I have trees as old as 250

18
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:04,650
300 years old and we begin to train

19
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:08,640
bonsai by changing the root structure

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:11,728
and you can start bonsai from trees that

21
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,099
are out in nature all the way to from a

22
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:17,069
nursery plant you can go to your local

23
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:18,750
nursery and buy a a tree will do

24
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:24,000
different types of grafting techniques

25
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:27,509
were will graft a black pine on to a red

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,478
pine routing system for example to try

27
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:33,140
to change the dynamics or the genetics

28
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,900
of the tree if you will

29
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:37,540
we'll do air layering to take let's say

30
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,640
you have a larger tree and you want to

31
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,320
get the top of it we can air layer it to

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,560
get roots growing out of that and then

33
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,699
cut that off and make a whole new tree

34
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:54,740
out of it so you can actually have two

35
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:55,939
trees so the first thing we want to do

36
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:59,689
is we want to make sure that the tree is

37
00:01:55,939 --> 00:02:01,939
healthy so and made sure that it's in

38
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:04,579
good soil we would take a tree and move

39
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:06,319
it into a bonsai soil which is typically

40
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:08,449
a combination of akadama

41
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,729
and lava maybe some pumice depending on

42
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:12,739
the species of the tree so once we know

43
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,259
that the tree and the roots are healthy

44
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,570
and happy and it's thriving then we'll

45
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:19,399
begin to train the tree so there's

46
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:21,259
there's different levels of training so

47
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,629
when we first get a tree depending on

48
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:25,789
the age we want to get some movement in

49
00:02:23,629 --> 00:02:27,650
that trunk we want that tree to look we

50
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:30,199
not want to manipulate that tree to look

51
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:33,560
old and gnarly and and like it's been

52
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:36,379
through you know maybe an avalanche or

53
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,969
animals have fallen on it or it's just

54
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,609
it's just really struggled through its

55
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:42,500
life maybe it's a a winced wet style

56
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:48,320
that's been on the top of a mountain and

57
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:50,629
the wind is blowing it over so getting

58
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,699
some initial styling or initial movement

59
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:55,969
into the trunk to give it something

60
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:58,310
interesting to look at in bonsai we are

61
00:02:55,969 --> 00:03:00,800
masters of manipulation we'll take a

62
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,719
tree that's maybe or a plant that's just

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,700
a few years old and try to make it look

64
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:07,219
like it's fifty or a hundred years old

65
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:09,979
and in some cases the trees are if we

66
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:12,349
get a tree from the Colorado mountains

67
00:03:09,979 --> 00:03:15,039
from a specific geological formation

68
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:18,500
called a fin where there's there's a

69
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:21,169
dried-up riverbed on top and then

70
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:24,340
underneath it is a live riverbed and in

71
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:27,079
the wintertime that riverbed that

72
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,689
freezes shears off the roots and it

73
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,330
naturally divorce those plants or Rocky

74
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:34,159
Mountain junipers or that those types of

75
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:36,469
species that come from the wild those

76
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,569
those are called gamma dori trees

77
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:40,879
and they're really spectacular trees to

78
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:43,310
work on and to to Train they have such

79
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,829
history I have a Colorado blue spruce

80
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:49,430
that's about this big that's 250 years

81
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:50,990
old and to think that that was born

82
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,960
during the time of the revolution

83
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:58,250
there's a lot of respect and that I give

84
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:01,520
to these trees and the bonsai is it's

85
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:04,610
kind of the art of it's it's man's

86
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:07,280
idealistic idea of what a tree would

87
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:10,940
look like and we want to pay homage and

88
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,009
respect to that so in the beginning we

89
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:16,699
get the tree will give it some movement

90
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:26,209
into the trunk and then as it as it but

91
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:28,969
how are you doing that are you like yes

92
00:04:26,209 --> 00:04:32,000
yes all of those things will use a wire

93
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:35,600
is very common to use if wire isn't

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,759
enough we will use tie rods we will we

95
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,470
get kind of medieval with these

96
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,500
sometimes we will do what's called

97
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:47,180
raffia we will wrap this up with a plant

98
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:50,209
torture like dungeons yes sir yeah well

99
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,829
we'll wrap it up with a little bit and

100
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:54,060
we're still trying to reach that point

101
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:58,529
you and the wife too behind closed doors

102
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:00,780
as probably a good idea I guess it's so

103
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:04,639
the tools you're using you're starting

104
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:07,709
to talk about them yes so we will we do

105
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:11,250
wiring techniques we will do grafting

106
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:13,229
techniques we will carve out parts of

107
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,329
branches to get them to bend and turn

108
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,620
and manipulate them it might literally

109
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:18,689
carve through the bark

110
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,030
yep yep you can there's one technique

111
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:24,029
where you'll actually cut a wedge out of

112
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:25,349
a trunk and then bend it over to get to

113
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:28,500
get that movement in something that's

114
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:30,270
older so the tree is large and thick and

115
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,620
it's not going to move we have

116
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:37,439
techniques for doing that it'll

117
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:40,050
basically scar yeah so that cambium

118
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,060
layer will reconnect if done now are you

119
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,740
protecting it like are you rubbing

120
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,550
anything to protect it from pathogens

121
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,780
exactly so that's a really good question

122
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,980
so we will do that well we'll put

123
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:55,109
depending on the technique that you use

124
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,930
we'll put we use different types of pace

125
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,300
that that keep any kind of pathogen or

126
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,220
insects or anything out of there well

127
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,810
it's a cutting paste typically and

128
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,240
there's different types of pace that you

129
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:10,889
use for different species of trees we

130
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,750
buy specific bonsai pace Azalea for

131
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:15,060
example they love really acidic stuff

132
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:18,209
they use a different type of pace than a

133
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,829
conifer and you weren't joking when

134
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:22,348
you're like we get medieval with these

135
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:24,149
here basically it's not like like with

136
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:27,089
cannabis I feel like people are more

137
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:30,109
gentle in their or tomato plants you're

138
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:34,158
not like snapping stocks and

139
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,900
right right so we we will we we Bend

140
00:06:34,158 --> 00:06:38,319
these things around we carve out large

141
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:42,799
branches and turn them we wrap them with

142
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:45,229
raffia and duct tape or electrical tape

143
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,430
to get them to move and to keep them

144
00:06:45,228 --> 00:06:48,589
healthy when you when you do that

145
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,120
because you really don't you want to

146
00:06:48,589 --> 00:06:52,399
push the tree but you don't want to kill

147
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,098
them you want to give it every chance it

148
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,628
can so we do these techniques over a

149
00:06:55,098 --> 00:06:58,579
long period of time if we're going to

150
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:00,530
meal and move a large branch we might

151
00:06:58,579 --> 00:07:02,060
move in an inch one day and then next

152
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:04,568
month we'll move in another inch and

153
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:11,348
then maybe two years we'll move it again

154
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:14,449
between the wire and the rebar and the

155
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:16,310
different types of materials that we use

156
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:20,180
we have different clamps that will we

157
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:23,478
use to bend a tree will literally tie a

158
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:26,269
branch down to pull it down to make it

159
00:07:23,478 --> 00:07:29,329
look like it's it's aged so if you can

160
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:31,218
imagine a new tree the branches kind of

161
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:33,438
grow up they grow like this on an old

162
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:35,810
tree they grow I don't know if you can

163
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,180
see this but they yeah they sag from the

164
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,009
weight they sag from the foliage mass

165
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,569
and that's what shows the difference

166
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:43,569
between the old and the new trees

167
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:48,259
so you're trying to make a young tree

168
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:51,810
look

169
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:53,879
exactly it's like a Hollywood studio

170
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,009
that takes a kid and tries to make them

171
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,959
look like sure so there's a there's

172
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:00,870
another technique we use called ginning

173
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:04,739
or Shari where we'll take some bark and

174
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:08,220
we'll strip out some some bark to prove

175
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:11,220
to show the inside of the tree and then

176
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:13,590
we'll we'll treat that with a sulfur too

177
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:17,880
to make it look white to make it look

178
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:20,939
like it's weathered or aged we'll take a

179
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,620
branch may be it may be a branch dies or

180
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:24,538
during the during a tour we have a

181
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,579
branch that doesn't really fit our

182
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,709
design will strip all the leaves off of

183
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:31,948
it strip all the bark off of it and then

184
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:34,079
you have this really gnarly interesting

185
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:36,778
feature that will we'll put on a tree I

186
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,960
have in my Colorado blue spruce I was

187
00:08:36,778 --> 00:08:42,778
telling you about earlier about there's

188
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,120
a mark on it about this big where a

189
00:08:42,778 --> 00:08:46,889
hundred years ago a porcupine was

190
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,820
nibbling on that and he would keep that

191
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:54,088
wound open for years to to just feed off

192
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:55,890
the SAP or lick up the SAP and now

193
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:58,290
there's this really cool disc feature

194
00:08:55,889 --> 00:09:00,720
that's on on that tree that you can see

195
00:08:58,289 --> 00:09:04,049
the open the inside of the tree if you

196
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,778
will as you come from the bonsai world

197
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:09,349
into things like to me I mean tomato

198
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:11,778
plants or cannabis plants kind of water

199
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,590
what are some of the nuanced differences

200
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:16,750
and what

201
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:18,879
from here perspective that's a really

202
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,970
good question so some of the

203
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:27,820
similarities in the training aspects are

204
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:30,070
going to be every plant has hormones

205
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,750
called auxins and these auctions are

206
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:35,528
basically what tell a plant to grow up

207
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:38,320
and those are in what we do with with

208
00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:40,689
grow bonsai trees and with cannabis as I

209
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:45,220
like to lay those those growing tips

210
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:48,100
down so redistributes the auxin hormone

211
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,680
profile so now we have more grow sites

212
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,830
here here here and here rather than just

213
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:55,899
straight up we lay it down and in bones

214
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,420
ends that's going to grow this exactly

215
00:09:55,899 --> 00:10:00,519
exactly so in bones eyes we create these

216
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:02,829
pads these beautiful pads that show

217
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:05,829
layered pads that that give us the

218
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:07,509
artistic look where in cannabis we have

219
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,750
all those extra bud sites that create

220
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:13,299
the beautiful flower that we like have a

221
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:16,690
tomato versus cannabis one year one year

222
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:19,838
trainee and Sumida as far as cannabis

223
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:21,550
actually they're quite similar obviously

224
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,430
the the fruit is different the fruit on

225
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:27,399
a tomato kind of hangs down where the

226
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:31,239
fruit on a cannabis will grow more

227
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:35,500
straight up but we would train it in a

228
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,970
very similar area so we want to I like

229
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,720
to lay the plants down and do what's

230
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:44,769
called low stress training there there's

231
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:47,379
what they call high stress training or

232
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:50,549
where they actually will swish the

233
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:53,139
cambium layer and bend the plant over

234
00:10:50,549 --> 00:11:04,359
that and it creates this knuckle as it

235
00:10:53,139 --> 00:11:07,600
reproduces the the cambium as a tomato

236
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:10,028
plant so as a tomato plant I want to

237
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,850
take and I want to train this I want to

238
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:14,799
bring these up and this is what changes

239
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:18,189
that auxin profile I was talking about

240
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:21,278
so as I bring these these leaves up and

241
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:24,730
this allows it to get so the the camp

242
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:26,828
the the hormone auction isn't here but

243
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,740
when I lay it down and now it begins to

244
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:32,588
transfer that hormone to different areas

245
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,769
of the plant as this plant grows I will

246
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:40,480
train this down here I will bring this

247
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:42,459
under here and see these buds here so

248
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,319
now more light gets into the bottom of

249
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:46,629
this this plant the same thing with

250
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:49,269
cannabis we get better light penetration

251
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:51,129
if this was if this were to be grown

252
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:52,720
taller these tomatoes would come up

253
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:55,720
higher

254
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,000
Lia's would so each one of these leaves

255
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,278
are going to be a basically a solar

256
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,429
panel for this plant and we want we want

257
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:07,389
to give it that so we're going to let

258
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:09,458
these all of these leaves come up

259
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:10,789
through here and then encourage these

260
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:13,909
flowers to grow

261
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:15,980
so as this plant grows this this these

262
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:18,049
flowers will come out here these flowers

263
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:20,480
will come here this plant will do the

264
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:22,219
same thing we will bend this down into

265
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,889
here what you want to do with this right

266
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:29,600
I would want to get this underneath here

267
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:33,500
and we can do that by I just put this in

268
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,909
here to hold this up these have actually

269
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:45,049
grown a little bit since we've been at

270
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:46,459
the show in two days yeah right so we'll

271
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:48,709
Bend this out here and this will

272
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:51,500
encourage us as this grows this will

273
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:53,210
come up in this area now I'm gonna put

274
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,899
this back in here with this wire to hold

275
00:12:53,210 --> 00:13:02,780
it in place we use a lot of wire in

276
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:06,799
bonsai - so I'll grow this up and as

277
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:10,579
this this this terminal flower here I'll

278
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:12,729
train to come up into this area and the

279
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,980
other thing that this doing this

280
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:18,170
increases the air flow in your plant so

281
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,970
increasing your air flow increases your

282
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:23,149
nutrient uptake which gives you better

283
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,139
flowers it reduces things like powdery

284
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:27,509
mildew

285
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:29,759
absolutely good very good point passed

286
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:33,090
and you can get to the plant easier you

287
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:36,029
can it's easy one of the things in both

288
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:38,790
bonsai in cannabis and in life in

289
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:41,519
general and I'm learning or trying to

290
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:43,079
learn to observe and the first thing I

291
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,639
do in the morning with my bonsai trees

292
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,770
and even my cannabis I grab my cup of

293
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,379
coffee and I go out I just look at the

294
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:53,939
plant I look at its health I look to see

295
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:56,070
if there might be any insects or or any

296
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:59,370
kind of diseases so that I can react to

297
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:02,190
that quick and and we have a tree that's

298
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,440
worth thousands of dollars for the

299
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:06,480
cannabis plant that's worth thousands of

300
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,630
dollars we we want to take pretty good

301
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,430
care of it so learning to observe and

302
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:13,080
understand and know you're the plants

303
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:14,219
that you're dealing with makes all the

304
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,139
difference in the world plus it's just

305
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,980
fun it's just fun getting out in the

306
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:22,220
garden having a cup of coffee and just

307
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,870
looking at the beauty of nature and

308
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:28,110
sometimes it's it's it's kind of

309
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:30,529
therapeutic it's really it's really a

310
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,529
passion

311
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:38,529
when you're watching people like start

312
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:38,529
trying to use like

313
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,919
so if you everybody remembers the movie

314
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,899
Karate Kid that's kind of where bones I

315
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:50,379
was really initiated or people learned a

316
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:52,629
lot he said let the let the birds fly

317
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:55,330
through and I think one of the common

318
00:14:52,629 --> 00:15:01,480
mistakes is we try to put too much into

319
00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:04,300
it into an area so by by removing areas

320
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:08,860
that don't matter or are not either part

321
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:11,769
of the design and bonsai or by keeping

322
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:16,509
your plant so that light can get into it

323
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:18,850
keep it cleaned out that allows those

324
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:22,149
that airflow that allows you want to

325
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:24,509
give things we want to get the absolute

326
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:24,509
ly

327
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:30,399
every area has taken advantage of

328
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:32,470
absolutely

329
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,399
so for example if this was a cherry

330
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,930
tomato plant they get really dense and I

331
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,490
might I might actually clean some of the

332
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:42,729
foliage out at that point I might

333
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:45,549
actually clean out some of the extra

334
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:47,800
buds or actually to clip it out of there

335
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:49,659
yeah and and to control the growth so if

336
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:53,559
I've got something like maybe hanging

337
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:55,240
off here that's doing a gonna reduce the

338
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:57,609
light I might actually clop clip that

339
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,620
out or I would retrain it or move it up

340
00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,919
to an area that doesn't have as much

341
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,919
growth
