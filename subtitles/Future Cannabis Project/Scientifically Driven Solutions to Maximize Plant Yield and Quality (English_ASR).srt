1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,400
I want to get the Cliff Notes version

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,740
for all of us who missed your

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,839
presentation okay what did you want a

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,940
clue study here so what was the title of

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,579
your presentation a scientifically

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,160
driven solutions enhance canvas

7
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:25,559
production and I say with confidence and

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,089
precision and what I think about how I

9
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:32,820
structured this was kind of holistically

10
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:34,738
conceiving the whole grow operation the

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,210
whole grow environment in terms of an

12
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:41,218
ecological ecosystem you know and in

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,359
nature which was my training and I

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:44,429
didn't think I'd ever do anything

15
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,460
besides natural ecology as a microbial

16
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:48,628
ecologist learning about plant my

17
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,189
interactions and I did a lot of climate

18
00:00:48,628 --> 00:00:52,019
change studies where we look at the

19
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:55,589
environment you know this is traditional

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,690
ecosystem sciences well I love taking

21
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,420
that concept and putting it into the

22
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:02,939
grow room and I tell everybody you know

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,739
there's only one thing you have to

24
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:07,500
control in precision agriculture and

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,240
it's everything you know it starts with

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,728
plant genetics it starts us off with

27
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:14,459
plant genetics and then I give the

28
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:16,200
simple 11 parameters for success you

29
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:18,688
know and the very last one I talked

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,939
about the very bottom is soil microbes

31
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:22,919
you have energy and you have temperature

32
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:26,548
and you have airflow and you have

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,379
humidity and you have co2 any up oxygen

34
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,500
in the rites of sphere below ground and

35
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:33,509
hydrology and in room temperature and

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,159
nutrients and then and then there's

37
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,879
microbes and the fascinating thing about

38
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,829
is treating that as an interaction of

39
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,469
ecology and you better understand what

40
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:44,309
all of them doing if you tweak anything

41
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:44,789
you're gonna have to change everything

42
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,299
else

43
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,710
it affects yeah

44
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:49,179
and I so this you're gonna appreciate

45
00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:52,178
this you know the typical phenotype

46
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:53,710
formula P equals genetics plus

47
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:55,359
environment plus the interaction of

48
00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:57,218
genetics times environments closest

49
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,618
standard error variability over time I

50
00:01:57,218 --> 00:02:01,298
present that my talks in terms of

51
00:01:59,618 --> 00:02:02,679
precision at precision agriculture

52
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:05,130
because it's basically the same thing

53
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:09,459
you start with genetics and then the e

54
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:10,840
is everything else everything including

55
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:12,700
nutrient inputs and you have to dial in

56
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,549
all those things so this is huge bucket

57
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:16,628
and then dialing in that interaction

58
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:18,640
right and making sure those right

59
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:20,169
genetics are right for your environment

60
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,149
because not all genetics were meant to

61
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:23,679
grow up here I talked about that so

62
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:27,239
because there's the photosynthetic

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,610
equation too that comes into yeah and so

64
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,489
conceptually the the growers that are

65
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,630
newer or like ah it's beautiful and kind

66
00:02:33,489 --> 00:02:36,730
of daunting because you're like oh I

67
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:38,409
have all this stuff but once you know

68
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:40,539
the picture you know the buckets that

69
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:42,400
you can start working on and then I kind

70
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:44,889
of transition that to talk about the

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,870
importance of microbes playing that very

72
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:48,909
very small part in that ecosystem which

73
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,340
is a huge part and I talked about some

74
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:53,019
of the challenges in nature and nutrient

75
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,420
use efficiency Xand how you can actually

76
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:56,769
maximize the success of plants and I

77
00:02:55,419 --> 00:02:59,708
kind of talked about how you know as a

78
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:01,239
matter of fact no plant in nature exists

79
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,459
without plant microbe interactions why

80
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,959
is that you know they support the

81
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:06,519
success of life when I talk about the

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,920
human microbiome how we know now

83
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,209
microbes support all our health the same

84
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:12,789
thing for plants and every other life

85
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:15,549
and so you put microbes in the concept

86
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:18,280
of that bigger picture of cultivation

87
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:20,409
and then you understand how we can start

88
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,439
formulating microbes with precision and

89
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:25,299
confidence so growers can use these in

90
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,530
precision agriculture settings so you

91
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:28,000
know what they do we're talking about

92
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,799
targeted function we're talking about

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,259
ethics C we're talking about things like

94
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,150
shell flap also all these things but if

95
00:03:32,259 --> 00:03:36,578
you can do that and then you can show

96
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,139
the results not only from a scientific

97
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:39,760
point of view from a microbial

98
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:44,439
ecologists point of view if I started

99
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:46,750
like realizing my purpose and impact of

100
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,039
bringing nature and natural processes to

101
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,169
agriculture but we're doing it

102
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:52,000
sustainably not only because of the

103
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:53,319
nature of bringing nature to agriculture

104
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,259
but because we're doing it profitably

105
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:58,449
and you can't do a lot of things with

106
00:03:56,259 --> 00:04:01,060
success in the market unless you bring

107
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:04,030
profit to your end-user but if you can

108
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,909
align profit with sustainability you

109
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,140
really have a true sustainable

110
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:10,359
technology and so that's kind of the the

111
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:12,639
big picture of the talk and we go into a

112
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,980
lot of details about end data and you

113
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:18,298
know our publications and so it's about

114
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:20,980
fitting that one soil microbial piece

115
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,479
into the puzzle that's probably of

116
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,270
everything else in that in that

117
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,129
ecosystem is not necessarily well

118
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:29,680
understood it's more and more inner-city

119
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:31,990
to talk about the living soil concepts I

120
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,420
just went up to the lift show in Canada

121
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,069
and you know who doesn't have a million

122
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,629
square feet up there now I mean

123
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:39,189
literally almost every girl I went to

124
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:41,379
it's a ridiculous and some of those

125
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:44,379
facilities are turning the whole million

126
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:47,980
into a living soil grow I'm like what

127
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:49,839
that's awesome I can't believe it and

128
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,340
that's changing really yeah change very

129
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,189
very quickly and you're an organic

130
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:55,629
grower you understand that until you

131
00:04:54,189 --> 00:04:57,339
understand it's not like plugging

132
00:04:55,629 --> 00:05:00,550
synthetics in it's a little bit of a

133
00:04:57,339 --> 00:05:02,109
process in a learning curve and you can

134
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,699
reap the benefits and rewards on the

135
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,439
back end if you can go through that

136
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:07,389
learning stage right yeah and get to

137
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,040
know yeah what you're working with and

138
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:10,629
yeah how to put it all together like you

139
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,060
were saying and all the little factors I

140
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:14,889
feel like everyone assumes oh yeah it's

141
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,389
just oil microbes they just put it in

142
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:18,759
there it's like well what does each one

143
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:21,699
of those microbes do specifically in

144
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:23,589
your soil biosphere what other microbes

145
00:05:21,699 --> 00:05:25,750
or bacteria is that interacting with

146
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,969
it's causing this to happen and it gets

147
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,829
very intricate it's in it and it's

148
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:31,810
harder to measure because they're

149
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:34,180
they're microscopic and so you're

150
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,110
looking for responses when you're adding

151
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,150
and so you really have to have

152
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,379
confidence with manufacturers and make

153
00:05:37,149 --> 00:05:40,278
sure they've done their diligence and

154
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,949
you still have to be diligent to do

155
00:05:40,278 --> 00:05:44,269
diligence as a grower but I put it in

156
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:47,059
concepts of things that you can measure

157
00:05:44,269 --> 00:05:49,608
like think about if you turn your grow

158
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:52,719
room temperature down 10 degrees or up

159
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:55,038
10 degrees your plants respond to that

160
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:57,079
absolutely or if you change your lights

161
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:59,149
you know does that change everything

162
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:01,069
from a low intensity to line to a high

163
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:03,829
intensity yes or what if what if you

164
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:06,079
double the co2 in a room what happens

165
00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:08,658
you have to change everything else well

166
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,338
the the microbial component is the same

167
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:12,199
thing there's a little more finesse and

168
00:06:10,338 --> 00:06:13,968
microbes don't help with any of those

169
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:17,478
macro environmental conditions you have

170
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:19,848
to get that right but it allows younger

171
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:21,318
growers to fix a lot of problems if

172
00:06:19,848 --> 00:06:23,808
there's some nutrient lock out and

173
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,519
really add that component which isn't as

174
00:06:23,809 --> 00:06:27,229
measurable except for on the back and we

175
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,119
see significant increases in quality and

176
00:06:27,228 --> 00:06:30,829
yield you can maximize what I think the

177
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,989
phenotypic potential of plant because

178
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:34,579
you're maximizing the overall plant's

179
00:06:32,988 --> 00:06:35,899
potential to be healthy

180
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:37,879
through those right and healthy

181
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:40,038
rhizosphere interactions and nutrient

182
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:42,829
uptake and then we've also talked to

183
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:45,528
many growers who are completely maxed

184
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:48,679
out they've dialed in the room perfectly

185
00:06:45,528 --> 00:06:50,988
and there's that one missing component

186
00:06:48,678 --> 00:06:52,698
and also it's that catalyst just to up

187
00:06:50,988 --> 00:06:55,428
it to the next level and they're not

188
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:58,218
seeing the same Delta or increase in

189
00:06:55,428 --> 00:07:00,018
yield as the newer growers but they're

190
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:01,308
getting that extra 5% that they never

191
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,499
thought they could achieve they're

192
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:06,559
getting that little bit extra yeah yeah

193
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:08,719
and that that top 5% is a hugely

194
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:10,899
difficult percent to get because they're

195
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:13,579
really pushing the plant and being

196
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:15,709
precision and so I love thinking about

197
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:17,329
using nature and natural processes and

198
00:07:15,709 --> 00:07:19,788
microbes in general with precision

199
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:22,369
that's a new concept yeah to bring them

200
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:23,789
together to create something that is far

201
00:07:22,369 --> 00:07:25,350
superior than

202
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:29,210
anything you can trade before then yeah

203
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,390
yeah so I geek out on you can tell me

204
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:33,689
yeah

205
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:35,729
microbes rule the world yeah it's

206
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:40,199
absolutely true you ever done any

207
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:43,140
research or has anybody on like light

208
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,810
and microbes because I think I'm like

209
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:48,060
sunlight and then indoor lights and then

210
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:52,560
I also think of life effects the plan

211
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:55,079
which exudes you know - it sends a

212
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,519
sugars to attract the right microbes but

213
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:03,209
then also certain microbes react - right

214
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:05,129
so so I don't think about that latter

215
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:07,649
part as much as I think about that first

216
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:09,930
part and you think about the response

217
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:11,310
you can't measure anything directly and

218
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,620
it's very challenging because you're

219
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:16,379
dealing with microscopic life but if you

220
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,870
can improve the energy and the resources

221
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:20,699
you're gonna improve the photosynthate

222
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,530
and if you improve that food source

223
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,930
increase of food source squirted into

224
00:08:22,529 --> 00:08:27,449
the rhizosphere priming basically sugars

225
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,939
you're gonna maximize or improve and

226
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:31,979
increase the microbial diversity -

227
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:33,509
microbial activity and so you have to

228
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,750
measure that over a period of time it's

229
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:38,939
I wrote some papers early on was it was

230
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:41,039
called I called it BPM I for the study

231
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,080
it was called visualizing plant microbe

232
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,079
interactions where I had four different

233
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,720
grasses and an invasive grass cheatgrass

234
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,300
and I did an infield experiment in a

235
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,149
greenhouse experiment and over time we

236
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:55,769
would look at how different grasses this

237
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:58,799
is an example in the same environment

238
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:00,899
the same climate might differentially

239
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,240
influence the rhizosphere microbiome and

240
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:05,100
the hypothesis was that maybe cheatgrass

241
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,560
which is an invasive grass that's taken

242
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,120
over the u.s. it was planted naturally

243
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,279
because it was a fast growing grass it

244
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,779
turns out like every other biological

245
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,029
transplant that it wasn't that great of

246
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:16,919
an idea cuz it's too aggressive it dies

247
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:18,089
quick you know the story but I thought

248
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:21,539
maybe

249
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:23,220
cheatgrass as a hypothesis is even more

250
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:25,919
successful because they can nurture a

251
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,840
specific rhizosphere microbiome to

252
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,459
enhance nutrient cycling to make them

253
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:32,580
more competitive so that was the basis

254
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,680
of that study and it turns out the study

255
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,200
supported that published in soil biology

256
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,489
and biochemistry and that's an example

257
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,080
where we just started thinking about the

258
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,149
plant by itself from these different

259
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,030
cultivars or species being able to

260
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:46,379
influence that and it's very difficult

261
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:48,179
to measure that because you have to

262
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:51,120
measure it over time and it takes a lot

263
00:09:48,179 --> 00:09:52,559
of finesse a lot of methodology and

264
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,720
we're equipped to do that but it takes a

265
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:57,659
lot of destructive harvesting also so it

266
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,279
takes a real experimental design to get

267
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:03,329
to that resolution and a lot of its

268
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:05,819
quality and so the questions I actually

269
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:08,070
initiate tons of hypotheses and the

270
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,100
research isn't very well established yet

271
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:13,379
on those exact mechanisms just like any

272
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,820
other ecology system you we should do

273
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,320
plant microbe interactions in a whole

274
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,230
series of global climate change

275
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,420
experiments we would have rain out and

276
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:24,300
we would have extra rain and we have a

277
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:26,159
heating patch in co2 in this space study

278
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:28,769
in Wyoming it was awesome super geeked

279
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:32,219
out a lot of money went into that trial

280
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:33,659
and then do you have to measure all

281
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,670
these variables separately and put them

282
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:37,139
together in modeling and then modeling

283
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:41,219
is slowing this together and there's a

284
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:44,490
level of error and so there's such a

285
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:46,350
huge road ahead of us and really

286
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,519
understanding how those interactions and

287
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,279
that's the biggest challenge alone

288
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,860
network and network analysis is a new

289
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:55,350
tool that comes up to allow us to

290
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,700
understand more real time what those

291
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,340
responses that you're talking about

292
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,020
Peter are but tying those together is a

293
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,710
very challenging thing for scientists

294
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:08,319
right now

295
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:11,230
you guys have an R&amp;D capability what in

296
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:15,320
the past let's say four years are some

297
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,789
of the things you've researched and what

298
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,500
or the results so that's a great

299
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:20,360
question and here's what we're here is

300
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,299
where it distinguishes at some point

301
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,490
fundamental research program and Applied

302
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,990
Research Program and we had to bridge

303
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,120
the gap and it's a very painful thing to

304
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,889
do for any scientist you know you want

305
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,959
to ask questions from the very beginning

306
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:34,430
and follow it through all the way and

307
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,049
you're never going to get to the end of

308
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:37,939
what really matters you make these

309
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:40,189
assumptions that oh I saw this little

310
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,870
mechanism early on implanting and then

311
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,730
you make this bold statement in academia

312
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:45,230
and so that of course is going to lead

313
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,750
to increase plant health quality and

314
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,550
yield but you're not measuring often

315
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:51,078
plant health quality and yield and we

316
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:53,120
realized at the very end when you talk

317
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:55,309
to farmers and farmers want to see plant

318
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,440
health quality and yield data that if

319
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:59,778
you're gonna turn your science program

320
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,579
into an applied science program you

321
00:11:59,778 --> 00:12:03,708
better provide that data for the farmer

322
00:12:01,578 --> 00:12:07,578
and you do that by completely flipping

323
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:09,888
your train of thought and you you take a

324
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:12,799
leap of faith that what you're doing is

325
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:14,480
is interacting with the plant the way

326
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,838
you think you know it is from your

327
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,310
expertise and years of study that you

328
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,290
measure plant health quality and yield

329
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:22,969
and then you start reverse engineering

330
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:25,458
what those mechanisms are and you

331
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,889
measure a couple along the way but the

332
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:30,049
details are very involved and it takes a

333
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:34,068
lot of time and a ton of resources and

334
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:37,338
so we pour focus on early on and now on

335
00:12:34,068 --> 00:12:42,019
our early research programs the needle

336
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:44,750
that moves the influencer hurdle for

337
00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:46,519
farmers if we have a rooting agent for

338
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:48,769
an example or a microbe that we think is

339
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:52,220
going to interstate rooting there's a

340
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:53,929
lot of mechanisms into that but what I

341
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:55,610
want to know for sure is this rooting

342
00:12:53,929 --> 00:12:57,169
increase and you know I can measure

343
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:00,230
mechanisms and a thousand different

344
00:12:57,169 --> 00:13:02,659
samples and never get to that but if you

345
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:04,730
measure a thousand samples for increased

346
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:07,100
root growth and then you find that

347
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:09,620
increased root growth and then you

348
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,170
okay what's happening here and you start

349
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,450
making hypothesis there and measuring

350
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:17,299
certain things in the next study and you

351
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:19,340
know we've just had this huge R&amp;D team

352
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:21,649
for the last 18 months and we're talking

353
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,750
year's five-year study your disregard

354
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:25,279
spider webbing off and all these new

355
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:27,049
directions and it's like well this is

356
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,370
happening over here and this is going on

357
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:30,019
at the same time right here we should

358
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:32,509
probably both look at both of these

359
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:35,210
laughs and then it takes that then the

360
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:37,549
fundamental aspects of the science kick

361
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:39,290
in and yeah and then then as a

362
00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:41,779
co-founder of a company unfortunately be

363
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:44,539
like wait a minute we have our metric

364
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:47,299
for success we can't understand all the

365
00:13:44,539 --> 00:13:48,889
mechanisms right now we have a company

366
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:52,009
we have a scientific company and we're

367
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:54,139
measuring repeatable and results we have

368
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:55,639
to do that and we have to measure and it

369
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:57,500
makes my policy to make sure we know

370
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:01,370
some modes of action but to know the

371
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:04,009
complete sequence of interactions and

372
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:06,289
and chemical synthesis or chemical

373
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:08,960
interactions and signaling that make

374
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:12,589
that happen it's not economically

375
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,389
feasible at the company private company

376
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,550
level and that's what you do all day

377
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:18,620
long in academia you never get to that

378
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:22,009
end game but you geek out on the details

379
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,960
yeah yeah all what he was saying tied

380
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:25,580
right back into how effectively the

381
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,889
nutrients can make their way into the

382
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,240
plant and how effectively you know the

383
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:31,159
environment is allowing for

384
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,980
photosynthesis to take place between

385
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:36,860
chlorophyll and a and B production and

386
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,930
yeah carbohydrates and all that there's

387
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,779
a hundred parameters you have to measure

388
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:43,429
to get it to get a chance and a snapshot

389
00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:46,490
of what's going on and you got to

390
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:49,309
remember if you collect data at day five

391
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:51,649
of a plant growth in day ten and day 15

392
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:55,099
in day 20 you know you have one snapshot

393
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:58,759
at one time of the day and then things

394
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,620
happen on a daily cycle not a weekly

395
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:02,149
cycle and so there's all these

396
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,529
assumptions you have to make even when

397
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:04,789
you're collecting the psychological data

398
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:08,120
at that level

399
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:10,789
yeah so another random questions if you

400
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,570
took a gallon of super-happy microbes

401
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:16,909
and put half in a living soil

402
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:21,160
environment

403
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:23,870
you put into like synthetic fertilizer

404
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:27,079
what what's going on with

405
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:30,590
are those ones just totally unhappy so I

406
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,970
would say a general statement absolutely

407
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,769
and they'll tell you why because they

408
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,050
haven't evolved in that environment you

409
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:37,610
know if you take microbes directly from

410
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:39,049
soil we could do this tomorrow I can go

411
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,009
show you how to grow microbes and we'll

412
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:41,899
grow a bunch of them from whatever

413
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:43,939
source you want I'm an expert of growing

414
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:45,350
microbes and we take them directly from

415
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,390
soil and we grow them pretty quickly

416
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:49,070
that first growing event

417
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:51,500
you're gonna lose over 50% of the

418
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,760
microbes that exist in that soil because

419
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,639
you put them in an environment they

420
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:57,620
haven't been able to evolve into and you

421
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:59,149
have to ease them into any new

422
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,919
environment and so you've knocked out

423
00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:02,419
50% this general you know I haven't

424
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:05,449
counted but I've experienced this before

425
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:07,490
and so you're only capturing the readily

426
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:09,140
culturable microbes that will grow in

427
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:11,210
two or three day period not that grow

428
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:13,100
over a 10 day period or not that can't

429
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:15,950
grow well or just got over competed so

430
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:18,080
you automatically biased that and then

431
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,940
you separate those it will grow them up

432
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,639
and we put half in a living soil

433
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:25,130
environment and half in a salt high salt

434
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,250
environment what you're gonna have is a

435
00:16:25,129 --> 00:16:29,629
living soil environment that more

436
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,389
naturally mimics a soil condition though

437
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:33,860
they're from and so in general

438
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:35,689
hypothetically this is hypothesis most

439
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,279
of those microbes are much more those

440
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,650
microbes will survive in that soil

441
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,209
because that's an environment that

442
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:43,819
mimics their environment that they

443
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:47,830
evolved into initially the other half

444
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:50,120
they just got put in a very

445
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,530
environmentally stressful environment

446
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,960
and you're going to knock out probably

447
00:16:51,529 --> 00:16:55,819
90% of them that's one of the findings

448
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,129
that we found when we are culturing

449
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,720
microbes and talking to farmers before

450
00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:02,509
we started our R&amp;D back in the

451
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,309
university when I heard from a farmer

452
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:05,869
that he loved the idea of using

453
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:08,990
precision microbes like we were

454
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:11,239
hypothesis in creating and that the only

455
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,130
way that he was going to use them

456
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,349
because he couldn't make a special trip

457
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,959
over his field to apply to the field too

458
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:19,579
much fuel too much cost he couldn't

459
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,890
change a thing so he was going to take

460
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:23,078
any microbe that I gave him and dump it

461
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,600
in a hot fertilizer

462
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:27,849
and spread it at the same time I had an

463
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,980
aha moment I thought whoa

464
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:34,750
I don't think microbes can do that and

465
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:37,089
the truth is most of them can't so you

466
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,250
have to understand and that's why I love

467
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:41,740
what we've done with mammoth pee we

468
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:44,019
understood that going into the R&amp;D not

469
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,319
after the fact and we understood that we

470
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:49,808
need to evolve microbes to be able to

471
00:17:47,319 --> 00:17:51,819
withstand that environment or weed them

472
00:17:49,808 --> 00:17:53,319
out through selection before we took

473
00:17:51,819 --> 00:17:56,200
them to market because then they

474
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:58,869
wouldn't be a viable product and so if

475
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:02,370
that if that kind of told the story most

476
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:06,189
microbes can't survive any transplant

477
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:08,489
some can and very very few can bridge

478
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,490
that gap

479
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:12,778
yeah

480
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:21,920
I think what

481
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:21,919
okay fun yeah thank you
