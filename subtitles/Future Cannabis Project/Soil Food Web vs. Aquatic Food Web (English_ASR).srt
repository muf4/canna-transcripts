1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:11,349
[Music]

2
00:00:11,388 --> 00:00:16,169
hey I'm see you and raise me with potent

3
00:00:13,859 --> 00:00:18,239
ponics I do a lot of work with aquaponic

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,460
cannabis production and we're here with

5
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,879
Chris Trump to talk about how you can

6
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,990
utilize Korean national farming and

7
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,000
lactobacillus ferments to improve

8
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:28,979
aquaponic clothes fish production and

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,868
plant production via cannabis or

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,058
vegetables so why don't you tell

11
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:34,109
everybody a little bit about what

12
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:36,019
lactobacillus for men is before we get

13
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:41,488
into how it helps local parks

14
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:45,090
so yeah lactobacillus is this family of

15
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:46,589
microbes that really does all kinds of

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:49,200
things in nature you're outnumbered in

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,300
your body ten or a thousand to one and

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,730
seventy percent of the microbes in your

19
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:56,459
body that you rely on for nutrients in

20
00:00:53,729 --> 00:01:00,358
your gut is lack Peaks like the gas of

21
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:03,058
bacteria and so it's reasonable and

22
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,670
understandable that the digestive system

23
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:08,129
of a plant is similar as we find all

24
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:12,240
these interconnectivity in nature so

25
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:15,599
yeah it's um it's the cultivation of it

26
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,459
to have a high density serum of lactic

27
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,250
acid bacteria is what we're using in

28
00:01:17,459 --> 00:01:22,530
farms tell everybody why it is that

29
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,170
you're an expert on Korean natural

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,939
farming you're pretty much the biggest

31
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,439
expert that speaks English as far as I'm

32
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:33,569
concerned yeah is by necessity we we

33
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:39,469
farmed 700 acres of macadamia nuts in

34
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:42,118
Hawaii and there was there was nobody

35
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:45,090
holding my hand through it so it was a

36
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:48,810
lot of learning through trial and error

37
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,149
and it's it's been a blast

38
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,359
so we now farm exclusively with Metro

39
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,879
farming on 700 acres of macadamia nuts

40
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,578
organically certified and this is

41
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,920
organically certifiable quick plug to if

42
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:04,109
you're doing natural farming and want to

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,820
mess with certification don't try and

44
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:10,020
teach your certifier what natural

45
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:13,129
farming is and don't try and go to USDA

46
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:16,610
and define terms and create a new system

47
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:19,310
you're making plant-based compost or

48
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,770
actively aerated compost tea there's

49
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:25,069
there's all kinds of regulations in

50
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:29,360
place it's solid it's simple it's a few

51
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:32,599
simple steps just a little protection

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,470
for us if you start making up term so

53
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:38,719
you might run into problems absolutely

54
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:39,919
so I've been after meeting Chris and

55
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,520
hearing about all the awesome stuff he

56
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:44,839
does I started using different aquaponic

57
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,159
components or I'm sorry different Korean

58
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,439
national farming components in

59
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,060
aquaponics and what that allowed us to

60
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:51,979
do with specifically with lactobacillus

61
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:54,920
allows us to eliminate the fish waste

62
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:57,199
and parts of the system where it gets

63
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:58,909
passed the filter it also helps

64
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,310
eliminate pathogens in the system by

65
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:03,169
eliminating them by consuming them um it

66
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,420
also helps mineralize the fish waste a

67
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:08,119
lot faster and also increases fish

68
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:09,349
growth so it overall there's a study

69
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,400
it's going to be coming out later this

70
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:12,349
year through the university of kentucky

71
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,610
state there's a really awesome guy over

72
00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:15,439
there named joe pate that helped put a

73
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,910
lot of that research together and

74
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,889
they're gonna it's gonna talk about how

75
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:20,750
it increases fish growth rate by fifteen

76
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:22,039
percent and in plant growth rate on

77
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,750
average by eighteen percent and it's

78
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:25,639
gonna be really really awesome so you

79
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:29,449
can take things like lactobacillus or

80
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,949
even WCA to provide bioavailable calcium

81
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:34,519
or all different types of things

82
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:36,139
everything but basically FFA so you

83
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,850
don't intimidate the fish too much or

84
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:43,099
FAA I'm sorry just to make sure that you

85
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:45,049
don't use the fish stuff but everything

86
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:47,629
else from Korea national farming can be

87
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:50,719
used in aquaponics and greatly benefit

88
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:52,549
the aquatic food web as well as the soil

89
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:56,479
food web and really help people on both

90
00:03:52,550 --> 00:04:01,189
ends I would mention I would probably

91
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:05,539
avoid liquid IMO or IMO in aquaponics I

92
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:07,520
think that the soil microbes as if

93
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:09,979
you're really trying to induce introduce

94
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,710
a lot of them can mess with your ear

95
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:14,569
balance and actually I think I've told

96
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:17,449
you this before I had a commercial

97
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:21,159
aquaponic system hooray just baby

98
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:23,979
romaine four chefs in Kona in Hawaii and

99
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,590
the one I ran into some walk eNOS when

100
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:30,129
adding IMO I was playing with all of it

101
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:33,939
la be fpj all these things were just

102
00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:37,120
awesome but IMO cause some just just

103
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:38,709
strange things so I think like you said

104
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,860
and you've talked a lot about the

105
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:44,379
aquatic food web being pretty uniquely

106
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,600
different from the soil food web and I

107
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:48,279
just I think respecting that

108
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,010
understanding that nature has those

109
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:53,169
lines here's where water is your soil is

110
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:54,849
and there's a little bit of crossover

111
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,350
but there is a pretty big difference

112
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,720
what what kind of things are different

113
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,550
what have you experienced so I found

114
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,230
that things certain minerals will

115
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,400
oxidize a little faster and maybe need

116
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:05,230
to be supplemented a little more often

117
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:08,560
things like iron would be the biggest

118
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:10,000
example but aside from that just with

119
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,379
aquaponics we can run much lower

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,329
nutrient levels so have lower

121
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:15,040
bioavailable in nutrients because we

122
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:17,740
have a wire biodiversity so we have

123
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,760
different multiple different microbial

124
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,530
chains that are making things

125
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,360
bioavailable and when you combine that

126
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,919
with a something called a dual root zone

127
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,020
which is a method that I talked about

128
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,730
regularly where we have this terrestrial

129
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:29,859
soil layer and living soil and all the

130
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:30,910
wonderful things that all of a lot of

131
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,350
the other speakers here at the

132
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,689
regenerative conference are speaking on

133
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:36,189
can survive and thrive and benefit the

134
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:37,719
plant and the upper half of the root

135
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:39,100
zone then we have a layer of burlap just

136
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,990
to keep that soil from getting down

137
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,910
below and then below that way over there

138
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,170
of hydrogen we get flood and drains and

139
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,420
it allows us to have all the aquatic

140
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:48,699
microbes and the fish waste and all of

141
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,500
those microorganisms that are aquatic li

142
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:51,939
based and allowing them to break down

143
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,160
nutrients in a whole different way along

144
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:56,079
with the fish waste so it really

145
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,970
and usually the fish waste is their main

146
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,129
mineral source so this allows us to get

147
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:01,900
70 to 90 percent depending on strain in

148
00:06:00,129 --> 00:06:03,399
the nutrient base and having very little

149
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:05,109
supplementation that we only need to

150
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:07,179
provide with the soil zone which if

151
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,069
you're doing living soil requires next

152
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,930
to no supplements so as long as we have

153
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:12,519
an iron rich soil zone or or other

154
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,870
things we can use all the Korean

155
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:17,589
national farming methods in the soil

156
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,180
zone even FF FA or FAA or I'm sorry

157
00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:23,709
whichever one I've had one too many

158
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:25,810
joints today I'll admit it but as long

159
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:27,149
as you you can use all those in the soil

160
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,040
layer

161
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:30,479
and it really can make a difference and

162
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,040
you can use all the practices if you're

163
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,480
a soil grower and hybridize that and

164
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:36,240
really increase production especially

165
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,069
for veg or clone production and even get

166
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,418
enhanced our different terpene profiles

167
00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:41,759
as well if we're trying to really change

168
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:44,959
up the terpene files for your resin

169
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:49,409
production and in your own hash making

170
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:51,509
have you ever messed with red soil so I

171
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,160
did some red soil work in Jamaica but

172
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:54,810
nothing here in the States I did a lot

173
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,300
of work with green sand which is high in

174
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,918
iron in silica just because iron and

175
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,840
silica or two things were often lacking

176
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:03,000
in the water part of an aquaponic system

177
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,649
because it oxidizes or in Silica's case

178
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,110
isn't super highly bile available to

179
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:10,138
begin with so that might be an

180
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:13,319
interesting study I wonder if you mind a

181
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:15,900
bunch of red soil and used it as that

182
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,519
soil layer I wonder how that might

183
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:21,269
offset some of that increased

184
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:24,240
oxidization and in imo for one of the

185
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:26,639
things that I didn't teach it in my

186
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,728
videos but is a component is you can

187
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,699
bring in red soils like a 25% when you

188
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:35,610
make IMO for and it's so that you have

189
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,409
that increased mineral content as you

190
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,600
apply it for plants but I wonder if you

191
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:42,180
made like that whole layer red soil

192
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,370
that'd be fun that's cool what you're

193
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,959
doing with the with the soil layer not

194
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:49,110
anything I ever messed with I did the

195
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:54,329
floating floating rafts and but I loved

196
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:58,169
we had lava rock in our in our worm bed

197
00:07:54,329 --> 00:08:01,288
you know biofilter and lava rock broke

198
00:07:58,168 --> 00:08:03,269
down so fast in the aquaponic system it

199
00:08:01,288 --> 00:08:05,579
just became this powder oh it was it was

200
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:09,180
incredible nothing you you would get on

201
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:10,199
an on the soil grow the microbes will

202
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,329
just plow right through it in an

203
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,668
aquaponics system and really unlock and

204
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:16,288
make those minerals bioavailable we

205
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:19,109
found I've done a bunch of side by sides

206
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:20,099
and with dwc or the floating rafts we

207
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,288
found that you don't really get the

208
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,669
proper bud formation that's why you

209
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:25,800
don't really see if you look at all the

210
00:08:23,668 --> 00:08:27,538
commercial aquaponic producers that are

211
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,759
that are growing THC can invest in

212
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:31,288
particular all of them have a soil layer

213
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,668
in the upper half of the root zone and

214
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:34,229
that provides us a space for micro

215
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:35,549
Raizel fungi all the terrestrial

216
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:37,379
microbes that really help with

217
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,509
phosphorus potassium and other

218
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:41,220
micronutrients bioavailability

219
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:42,629
give it a time-release area so the plant

220
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,580
can adjust it you know it's gonna have

221
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:46,200
the bulk of its nutrients built from the

222
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,879
fish but it has the option of choosing

223
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,920
nutrients from that soil zone as well

224
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:52,200
and the plant knows better than any of

225
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,849
us ever will with any supplementation it

226
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,980
can pick and choose whichever group

227
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,480
whichever store it chooses the shop at

228
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,710
it can pick and choose to get its

229
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,680
nutrients from so that allows us to

230
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:04,170
maximize the bioavailability and there

231
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:06,659
was a study done by NASA when they did a

232
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:08,610
bunch of bioavailability research with

233
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:11,339
aquaponic farms where they tried to see

234
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:14,009
okay which microbes are responsible for

235
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,240
the the nutrient processing and nutrient

236
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:17,309
cycling of different nutrients nitrogen

237
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,350
phosphorus potassium blah blah blah blah

238
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:21,179
and what they found across all those

239
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,009
different farms over 50 different farms

240
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:24,359
is none of them were identical all of

241
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:25,980
them were completely different and when

242
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,240
they tested a group of soil to try and

243
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,950
figure out the same type of microbes in

244
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:31,860
soil and they compared the two data

245
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,360
sheets the aquaponic system was even the

246
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,610
worst aquaponics system compared to the

247
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,259
best soil system was a hundred and sixty

248
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,570
seven percent more bio diverse in terms

249
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:42,720
of number of different species when they

250
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:45,090
did genetic testing to see just biotin

251
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,879
abroad biodiversity so your aquatic

252
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:50,070
biome is how he has more players in its

253
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:52,200
nutrient cycle than even the soil web

254
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,460
does now I'm not sure if you go up maybe

255
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,660
up to the redwoods and you find

256
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,519
something that's ten thousand year old

257
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:58,949
old growth that might be different but

258
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,750
we're talking a normal average garden in

259
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:05,850
someone's home or in a normal average

260
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:08,610
commercial system the idea of diversity

261
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:10,800
is really the key and in natural farming

262
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,600
that's that's what we're focusing on

263
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,129
taking all these collections from

264
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,180
different times of the year or different

265
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:21,450
places around your area the idea is that

266
00:10:17,179 --> 00:10:24,599
nature's so capable of finding a balance

267
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:28,710
if they have diversity but it's it's

268
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:31,050
like who who wants to you know be in a

269
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:35,820
town with no doctor you know like you

270
00:10:31,049 --> 00:10:37,919
need the parts of a community to work in

271
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,160
community and we don't even I was

272
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:43,139
talking with some friends we we have no

273
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:46,649
idea how microbes work in community

274
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:48,220
where we barely even have the tools to

275
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:52,269
look in the window and we have

276
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:54,720
and so what we do know is that nature

277
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:58,210
can balance itself so if those

278
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,660
indigenous microbes or the microbes that

279
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:03,129
belong in that place are introduced

280
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:05,289
they're gonna find balance and they're

281
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:07,509
gonna work together and all you're gonna

282
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:10,419
get is benefit in production and disease

283
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:12,960
resistance and it's it's a lot of fun

284
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:15,519
and and so yeah maybe we'll have a

285
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:17,620
biodiversity competition between the

286
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:29,980
aquatic food web and the I guess your

287
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:36,750
study already did that that yeah I like

288
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:36,750
this we'll play with this cool yeah yeah

289
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:42,100
so the University of Hawaii actually did

290
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,450
over seven years of testing in aquaponic

291
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,970
systems sometimes intentionally

292
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:47,200
introducing pathogens some you know and

293
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,399
then other doing all different kinds of

294
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,050
experiments with pathogens and they

295
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,879
found things like Pythium and other

296
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:54,579
pathogens in a healthy aquaponic system

297
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:56,710
are simply out competed by by other

298
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,270
microbes that either consumed or there's

299
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,430
not enough metabolites that they need to

300
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:02,110
feed on to colonize to the point where

301
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:04,479
they start to threaten other you know

302
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,970
other microbes in the system so if you

303
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,740
have a really bio diverse oil or really

304
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,570
bio diverse aquaponic system whichever

305
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:13,240
one it is be the soil food web or the

306
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:15,280
aquatic food web it's going to eliminate

307
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,870
most of your pathogen issues not all but

308
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,970
a vast majority of them will be

309
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,889
eliminated automatically and that's and

310
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,170
that's where you know the the organic

311
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:24,819
hydro guys and aquaponic guys and the

312
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:26,439
soil guys really any you know can focus

313
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,890
on banding together and we're not that

314
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,570
different

315
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:30,399
we're both against chemical cannabis

316
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,930
we're both against pollution pot you

317
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,209
know we can work together and really

318
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:36,879
push you know organic as a whole you

319
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:38,470
know any food wherever the aquatic food

320
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,240
web and and something that's you know

321
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,009
great to see everyone kind of getting

322
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,600
together where a lot of people saw each

323
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:45,399
other maybe didn't get along quite so

324
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,259
low and when everyone thought eh well

325
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,509
that's not organic because it's not soil

326
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:53,799
well it's just using a different food

327
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:56,860
web that's all yeah yeah and yeah

328
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:59,000
there's um so for me I feel for the

329
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,250
farmers that are using

330
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,559
chemical fertilizers that there's many

331
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:05,509
that would like another way but it's

332
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:08,719
scary there's there it's there's some

333
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:12,560
risk involved in making a shift and so I

334
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:15,110
just I think that if if it's kind of not

335
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,838
like hey bad on you but kind of an

336
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,539
invitation like hey check this out so I

337
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:24,860
like that were for something you know

338
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:28,129
for learning to farm another way that's

339
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:33,050
both profitable and productive you know

340
00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:35,000
and probiotic yeah my goal and like soil

341
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:37,639
farming soil is hopefully to like

342
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,169
sequester carbon and to create the

343
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:46,100
enhanced you know the environment and

344
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:48,799
maybe remediating you do while using for

345
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,778
Mary products absolutely so and for

346
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,778
aquaponic systems right now on average

347
00:13:50,778 --> 00:13:56,149
for both lettuce and cannabis for every

348
00:13:53,778 --> 00:13:58,759
10,000 square feet of canopy we averaged

349
00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:00,470
around to one ton or two thousand pounds

350
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:02,060
of soil production that we get composted

351
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,069
through the vermicompost of the fish

352
00:14:02,059 --> 00:14:06,438
waste and by the plant material so we're

353
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:07,789
actually generating nutrients rich soil

354
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:09,679
that we can either use for our own

355
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:11,509
projects for other parts of the farm if

356
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,370
we're doing a fully sustainable farm or

357
00:14:11,509 --> 00:14:15,259
even providing it for our our neighbors

358
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:17,179
that are doing regenerative no-till soil

359
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:18,528
or other things like that it's extremely

360
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:20,149
rich and it gives them something that

361
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:21,799
you know they can come and buy from your

362
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:23,720
farm and it's a value added for you on

363
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:25,490
your cannabis grow or use it on your own

364
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,500
user for your top of your door your dual

365
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:29,620
root zone pots and you know you utilize

366
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,058
that for your own for your own systems

367
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,188
incredible incredible biomass I

368
00:14:32,058 --> 00:14:36,620
developed a whole worm system because I

369
00:14:34,188 --> 00:14:39,528
had to have somewhere to put all these

370
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,389
root balls and you know as I cut my

371
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:44,028
lettuce it's it's amazing how much

372
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:46,730
biomass you can make in roots and and

373
00:14:44,028 --> 00:14:49,250
how good that is for making soil like so

374
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:51,319
it's like the best high quality compost

375
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,708
and you bring worms to bear on that and

376
00:14:51,318 --> 00:14:56,568
it's a lot of fun you can also use those

377
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:58,128
same cuttings if you'd cut a big fan of

378
00:14:56,568 --> 00:14:59,740
Dubya and hissing cockroaches they

379
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:02,300
provide a much more nutrient balance

380
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,799
waste than even worms do I know a lot of

381
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:05,719
people don't like creepy crawlies but a

382
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:07,639
two inch band of azulene and on the top

383
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,550
of any plastic container will contain

384
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:10,709
them

385
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:12,659
throw a heat pad in there like a CD heat

386
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:14,849
pad and they will breed like crazy they

387
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:15,929
are super easy to raise will consume

388
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,690
anything and a great for feeding

389
00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:24,239
chickens or fish or anything else on the

390
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:25,740
yeah good in milkshakes but uh you know

391
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,450
they're looking at things and trying to

392
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,980
close your loops you know even with with

393
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,509
your new your nutrient supply with the

394
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,100
fish and the fish food can be a great

395
00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:33,439
way even if you're doing sustainable you

396
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,060
can just raise a bunch of fish as

397
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,709
aquaculture mineralize their fish waste

398
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:39,299
and use it for your soil you don't even

399
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:40,949
have to have it be an aquaponic system

400
00:15:39,299 --> 00:15:42,240
and still get benefits of it you can

401
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,690
also take that same fish waste and

402
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,149
ferment it with lactobacillus or in an

403
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:49,800
FPGA and and allow those same microbes

404
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:53,940
to get even more mineralization in an

405
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:57,179
entirely different way machu picchu for

406
00:15:53,940 --> 00:16:03,329
for this where did where was the like

407
00:15:57,179 --> 00:16:05,129
ding moment of soil and water the ding

408
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:06,539
moment was so we were trying to figure

409
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:08,610
out how to go walk cannabis in

410
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:11,759
aquaponics and we tried straight media

411
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:13,709
beds we tried dwc and it wasn't working

412
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,689
and i was trying to figure out how can I

413
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,578
get like a mineral retention layer on

414
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:18,930
the top part of the pot or it's

415
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:20,399
somewhere in the root zone so I could

416
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:23,159
have some kind of supplements we first

417
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,078
we tried a bunch of sea sponges in the

418
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:27,480
top part almost like a more organic

419
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:29,759
rockwool and put the plant in there and

420
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,610
that kind of worked and then I met a

421
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:34,289
gentleman from Serbia and he had an idea

422
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,990
of doing the soil on top he did it with

423
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:38,129
cucumbers so I did that and tried that

424
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:40,230
with the cannabis and it worked really

425
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:42,480
well and he was doing just maybe like a

426
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:45,060
15% soil layer on the top and that

427
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,730
didn't seem to be quite some enough so I

428
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:49,588
split it down to 50% and that seemed to

429
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,789
work really well and then by setting the

430
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:52,430
flood and drain timers a little more

431
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:54,750
often so you get the diaphragm action

432
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:56,609
and how would I do a root zone is is a

433
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,649
pot and the top half again is soil

434
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,449
separated by a layer of burlap halfway

435
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:02,220
down and the hydrogen in the bottom with

436
00:17:00,448 --> 00:17:03,659
a bunch of holes or a basket bottom pot

437
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,250
so it allows the water to flow in and

438
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:07,049
out and when the water goes up it

439
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,759
flushes the air up through the soil and

440
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:10,349
when it goes down it pulls fresh air

441
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:12,808
back down through the soil and into that

442
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:15,328
root zone so gives you a rapid gas

443
00:17:12,808 --> 00:17:16,980
exchange and rapid microbial growth and

444
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:18,959
allows you to supplement the soil zone

445
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,019
separately from the water zone and get a

446
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,589
lot of control in a very organ

447
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:26,329
like way that's right but what cool

448
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:28,849
technology and what else can we come up

449
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:32,179
with in the next 10 years if we stop

450
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:35,299
focusing on Frankenstein you know

451
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:40,220
chemistry and and start start looking at

452
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:43,519
how to use just physics in nature to to

453
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:45,980
benefit farmers to reduce labor and and

454
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,799
I mean they're they're making cool

455
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,950
robots and whatnot but as we understand

456
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,349
the interconnectivity of microbial life

457
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:57,470
and make use of it I think I think the

458
00:17:54,349 --> 00:17:59,779
sky's the limit to the work that you're

459
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:02,089
doing and I think taking and isolating

460
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:03,769
different groups of microbes from KNF or

461
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:05,299
taking groups of microbes from different

462
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:07,250
parts of the world that have work

463
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:08,930
similar to KNF and figuring out how they

464
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,519
make certain things bioavailable and

465
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:12,080
then I think that's the future of

466
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,329
products for the soil industry and

467
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:17,149
everything else both both you know for

468
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:18,679
modeled and and just methodology and

469
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,210
because it allows people to take a field

470
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,519
they've been fertilizing for the last 80

471
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:24,019
years and unlock all that there's a ton

472
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,970
of there's more nutrients they need for

473
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,889
the next 500 years sitting in that field

474
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:29,299
but if they have the right microbes it

475
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,950
unlocks it especially with all the work

476
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:32,720
that you do and on a wonderful microbe

477
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,009
do you teach everyone how to do and it

478
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,420
teaches everyone how to unlock the

479
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:36,980
potential of that field that's already

480
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:41,029
sitting there it just isn't in a

481
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:44,029
bioavailable form yeah you take I mean

482
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:45,889
we actually just did this so we we farm

483
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:48,079
700 acres of macadamia nuts we had a

484
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:51,830
neighbor who had just kind of I guess is

485
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:53,629
a hobby farm he's well off and lost

486
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:56,059
money on it for years but he just would

487
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:58,700
dump endless amounts of chemical

488
00:18:56,059 --> 00:18:59,929
fertilizer on there and finally he you

489
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,220
know knocked on her door and said hey I

490
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,470
don't want to find this anymore will you

491
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,779
guys lease it from me and and run the

492
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:09,170
farm and so we went in and the first

493
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:12,019
year applying microbes everything just

494
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:13,940
yellowed you know it was just and I told

495
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:16,220
my family to expect that I was actually

496
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,080
not directly involved in beginning that

497
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,809
my team who's running our natural

498
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:22,699
farming now began that project and I

499
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:25,519
said you're gonna have a drawback in the

500
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,410
first year just as the trees have to

501
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:31,190
learn a new way to eat their roots all

502
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:33,980
have to change and so the trees in the

503
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:38,120
first year of introducing Mike

504
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:41,839
had to literally shift their their their

505
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:44,898
root zone and but now this were near to

506
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:46,369
of that and the trees are beautiful my I

507
00:19:44,898 --> 00:19:48,138
was asking my brother I was like hey

508
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:49,609
take me soil samples from this place I

509
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:51,648
want to see what's changed and he's like

510
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:55,129
no I don't think we need to bother this

511
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:58,729
place is so pretty and and productive

512
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:01,039
and so it's it's been really cool to to

513
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:06,110
watch those changes but we literally

514
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:08,148
have a mine of mineral there and salts

515
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:10,788
that that these microbes are all just

516
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:14,239
gonna be pulling on making available and

517
00:20:10,788 --> 00:20:15,888
kind of redeeming the the ground for for

518
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,509
I don't know how many years we're gonna

519
00:20:15,888 --> 00:20:19,398
benefit from that so yeah you're right

520
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:22,069
it's I mean it's really what we'll deal

521
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:24,079
with a hard pan you know it's it's the

522
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:26,689
microbes that mine the salts in the

523
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:29,210
first place it's really awesome it's

524
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:30,860
wonderful all the awesome work and all

525
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,840
the great videos you have on your

526
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:34,158
YouTube channel and all the classes and

527
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:35,659
stuff you put out it's really really

528
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:49,709
great

529
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:49,709
