work together and um provide some uh

28
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:26,560
collaboration so we can make sure we get

29
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,159
the system done right um as a part of

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,879
the association we've uh created 12

31
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,079
major points that we are looking to uh

32
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:37,679
focus on um I'm only going to talk about

33
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:39,679
four today um but to uh to highlight we

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,720
really want to uh emphasize the

35
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,399
importance of one system so medical and

36
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,879
recreational coming together and we

37
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,399
think that will um ease in the ability

38
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:51,640
to uh become

39
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,840
compliant so um one of the first items

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:58,439
is um the importance of a phas in with

41
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,600
the licensing uh program so uh Lori Ajax

42
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:04,359
mentioned this earlier as well but the

43
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:06,718
ability for a um licensed business to

44
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:08,919
also be able to work with unlicensed

45
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,079
businesses for a set amount of time and

46
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:13,639
that will just allow the industry to um

47
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:16,760
get going and won't uh won't bring

48
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:19,399
things to a complete standstill um the

49
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:23,159
other item is uh the thresholds for

50
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:26,000
ownership So currently Mera um has 5%

51
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:29,159
ownership uh we'd like to see that um

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,878
come up to where prop 64 is with the 20%

53
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:34,479
ownership um the concern there is with a

54
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:37,079
5% ownership component there will only

55
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:38,959
be or there'll be a restricted access to

56
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,920
Capital um and that could potentially

57
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,479
stifle growth for our new growing um

58
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,399
industry and also could uh could present

59
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,238
problems for publicly traded companies

60
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,920
if 5% is that threshold for ownership

61
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,480
they may be coming in and out of

62
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:56,518
compliance um uh as a publicly traded

63
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,280
company um so we'd really like to see

64
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,640
20% on that ownership component and then

65
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,000
um also we' like to um see the

66
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:07,798
elimination of the Cross licenser uh

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,840
lure restrictions with mcrsa um to allow

68
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,879
vertical integration like just like we

69
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,239
see it in prop 64 that's been proposed

70
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:18,598
there um so MRSA is restrictive and um

71
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,519
prop 64 has that uh vertical integration

72
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,798
component um and then uh finally the

73
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,080
last issue and this one um is of the

74
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,239
utmost importance to me personally and

75
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,400
to um the groups we represent is uh

76
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,158
distribution

77
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,840
and so um we would like to see the uh

78
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:38,719
the distribution component that's

79
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:41,400
brought up in uh prop 64 um uh versus

80
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:44,519
the one that's in Mera which requires a

81
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,000
third-party independent um distributor

82
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,840
as a manufacturer a large component of

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,840
my business and really of the way that

84
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,239
the industry is operating right now

85
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,878
allows for both manufacturing and

86
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:59,000
distribution um so we're we're uh

87
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:01,719
definitely concerned that um restricting

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,120
the amount of distribution licenses just

89
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,039
to those who are solely doing

90
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,400
distribution um could have serious

91
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,959
implications on the industry and uh

92
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:14,599
specifically around um uh Innovation and

93
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,598
kind of the uh entrepreneur

94
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,759
entrepreneurialism so we would like to

95
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,918
be able to bring products see products

96
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,520
brought to Market um through

97
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:25,799
manufacturers cultivators um everybody

98
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:29,079
having access points um in terms of

99
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:32,000
distribution so thank you thank you

100
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:34,519
please Mr Stevenson I will I wish to

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,918
speak about a few topics one is multiple

102
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:40,959
permits Under One Roof also known as

103
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:43,240
collocation uh definition of premise

104
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:47,000
also suitability also known by some

105
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:49,319
cities as Equity based permits um modify

106
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
the closed distribution model under the

107
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:54,159
Mera and allow for both third party

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,160
Distributors and licens inous

109
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,520
Distributors owned by licensed

110
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,400
cultivators manufacturers Andor

111
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:03,918
retailers and eliminating cross-

112
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:06,159
licenser restrictions in the Mera by

113
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:10,599
allowing vertical integration as

114
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,479
currently authorized by prop 64 um my

115
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,840
name is Keith Stevenson I am the owner

116

and is the longest running dispensary in

121
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:30,240
Oakland as a former resident of Los

122
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:32,800
Angeles I went to a

123
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,478
aviation maintenance college and became

124
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,478
a licensed technician for United

125
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,680
Airlines for 17 years before two hiip

126
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:41,879
replacement surgeries forced an early

127
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,319
retirement which led to my involvement

128
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:46,399
in the medical cannabis industry I

129
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:49,160
started Purple Heart from the ground up

130
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,519
and currently have 26 employees I am the

131
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,439
textbook definition of a small business

132
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,198
owner I am fortunate that unlike some of

133
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:58,439
my colleagues I have not been

134
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,639
incarcerated nor do I have a criminal

135
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:03,000
record I am also so fortunate that the

136
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,000
Cannabis industry has given me and has

137
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,918
opened many other doors that would not

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,279
have happened in other fields before I

139
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:13,079
give my input on a path forward in the

140
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:15,598
new cannabis world I would like to thank

141
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,800
Miss Ajax and her staff as I was the

142
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:19,319
second dispensary they visited and I

143
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,439
appreciate their efforts to make

144
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,439
themselves accessible and learn about

145
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:27,000
the and learn about my industry while

146
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:28,800
distinctions between the medical and Adu

147
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,519
adult use cannabis Frameworks are

148
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,319
important discrepan discrepancies

149
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,839
between the two Frameworks will

150
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,199
complicate implementation for state and

151
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,959
local agencies and make compliance more

152
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,598
difficult for

153
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:45,279
lenses with that stated key points

154
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:48,038
include multiple permits Under One Roof

155
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,439
also known as collocation multiple

156
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:53,159
permits Under One Roof is helpful to the

157
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:55,199
geographic Fabric and Zoning of cities

158
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,680
this maintains the composition of

159
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,919
businesses in certain hubs helps create

160
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,400
natural clusters and has benefit icial

161
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:05,000
to Public Safety as the businesses are

162
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,159
easier to monitor whether it's a dense

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,918
urban city or smaller rural City

164
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,360
consolidating various usage and permits

165
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:17,359
into one location is a better use of

166
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,720
space as an example a medical excuse me

167
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,879
as an example a medicinal cannabis

168
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,720
campus similar to what biotechnology

169
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:29,160

significant impact on local

182
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:02,878
that multiple licenses both Medical and

183

non-medical be permitted on one premise

184

this model will allow cannabis

businesses to relocate to locally

disproportionately punished by the war

Thomas um we think all four of your

260
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,679
committees need to play a very important

261
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,319
role in this going forward my name is

262

from LA to Humble my comments today

268
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,879
focus on closing the gap between mcrsa

269
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,600
and prop 64 first and most cannabis

270
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,120
cultivation is agriculture and should be

271
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,560
regulated by the department of food and

272
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,120
agriculture Cher cabayo your presence

273
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:40,039
today and your committee's attention

274
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,240
here is is a great uh breakthrough in

275
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,958
this policy area and I'm going to

276
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,560
primarily direct my comments to you and

277
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,518
and vice chair matthus though he stepped

278
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:49,199
out of the room first and foremost one-

279
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,879
siiz does not fit all for cultivation

280
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,360
licensing both prop 64 and mcrsa in uh

281
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:58,480
have tiered licenses mcrsa contains

282
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,039
Cottage specialty small and medium to

283
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,639
ensure that regular requirements and

284
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:04,199
fees are appropriately scaled to the

285
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,959
size of the grow prop 64 creates all of

286
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,320
these licenses with the exception of the

287
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:10,359
cottage cultivation license additionally

288
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,920
prop 64 creates the type five unlimited

289
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,440
scale license in 2023 when it comes to

290
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:17,559
cultivation licenses we have two

291
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,040
recommendations and a word of caution we

292
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:20,518
would like to ensure that the type 1C

293
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,078
Cottage cultivation license is carried

294
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,959
from mcrsa into prop 64 we would like to

295
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:27,319
restrict the type five license created

296
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,879
in prop 64 at least until such time as

297
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,800
the federal government authorizes out of

298
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,799
states sales word of caution California

299
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:35,559
is already overproducing cannabis going

300
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:37,479
bigger isn't going to make regulating

301
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:39,159
any easier we recommend that this

302
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,519
legislature maintain limits on the scale

303
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:43,480
of each grow while continuing to ensure

304
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,600
unlimited licenses will be available for

305
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:48,000
small and Specialty Growers when it

306
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,199
comes to hemp proposition 64 is a big

307
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,039
step forward hemp is a huge opportunity

308
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:53,879
for Farmers with lots of flat Acres

309
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:55,599
marginal soils and who might have some

310
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,159
issues with water if they need a

311
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,199
resilient crop that can be used for a

312
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:00,879
lot of different things this is the

313
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:02,759
answer however there are some very real

314
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,198
challenges both legal and operational

315
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,480
and we encourage the convening of an

316
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:06,799
informational hearing focused

317
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,079
specifically on implementation of

318
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:11,039
measures related to hemp it really is

319
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:13,439
that big for our Farmers there's a

320
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,759
critical code section in the MPR mcrsa

321
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,000
that was emitted from prop 64 BMP code

322
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,720
section 19328 establishes restrictions

323
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,958
on the types of business licenses that

324
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,560
an entity May hold simultaneously

325
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,479
because the section was omitted it prob

326
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,278
64 opens The Floodgate to consolidation

327
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,560
and conglomeration we call on the

328
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:30,759
legislature to correct this with

329
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,359
legislation our Growers are especially

330
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:35,120
vulnerable and we do prefer the 5%

331
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,759
threshold for cross ownership we would

332
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,320
like to note that agricultural co-ops

333
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:40,039
and existing code are a great way to

334
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,600
achieve efficiencies and onboard

335
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:44,240
investment Capital without pushing

336
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,560
independent businesses out on the flip

337
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,759
side there's a critical section that was

338
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:49,958
included in prop 64 but omitted from

339
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,958
mcrsa we strongly encourage the

340
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:54,559
legislators to include the prop 64

341
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:56,319
residency requirements in the mcrsa

342
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,399
ensuring that California businesses have

343
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,120
adequate time to meet the requirements

344
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,799
before the the flood of outof State

345
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,039
interests moves

346
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,399
in unfortunately prop 64 and mcrsa both

347
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:08,919
agree in the emission of a critical

348
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,399
license type non- storefront

349
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:11,919
dispensaries when we talk about

350
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,679
balancing between access and

351
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,519
neighborhood impacts delivery services

352
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,278
are a critical component over the last

353
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,759
year we have worked through with local

354
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,759
government and law enforcement there is

355
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:23,079
no known opposition to these Provisions

356
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,879
at this time they are included in AB 64

357
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:26,719
we strongly encourage the establishment

358
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:30,759
of a non- storefront dispensary license

359
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,839
in both prop 64 and MCR

360
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:36,720
SAA oh the marijuana tax included in

361
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,440
prop 64 is hugely problematic we

362
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,240
recognize that changing the tax language

363
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,639
is going to be very difficult though the

364
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,680
task is simple conform the marijuana tax

365
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,560
as closely as possible to AB 2243 and SB

366
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,039
987 that were deliberated by your

367
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:52,078
legislature last

368
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:54,039
year specifically a very high concern we

369
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,359
think that the cultivation tax could be

370
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:57,879
a barrier for entry for as many as 75%

371
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,039
or more of the state's cultivators if

372
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,799
not clarified the proposition is

373
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:04,319
inconsistent in describing when the

374
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:05,919
point of tax is due when the product is

375
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,560
harvested when the product leaves the

376
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,439
cultivation site and when the product

377
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:11,838
enters the commercial Marketplace that

378
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,920
is a huge discrepancy in code I've been

379
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,040
a grower all of my life I know that

380
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,278
Harvest is a long process times are

381
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:19,599
tight money is tight we need to shift

382
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:20,720
that burden to the point where the

383
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,440
product enters the commercial

384
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,079
Marketplace or else we just won't be

385
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,759
able to make ends

386
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:29,399
meet that's all I got for today

387
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,399
everything you've heard from from the

388
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,440
local perspective from law

389
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:38,000
enforcement uh from what the agencies

390
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,399
are doing I mean do you agree not agree

391
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,159
I mean obviously there's still policy

392
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,159
issues that we need to discuss whether

393
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:47,559
it's Transportation or um cultivation

394
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:50,120
sizes or potency for instance but in

395
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:52,359
terms of the coordination and the work

396
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,399
together you do you feel like that's

397
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,278
fruitful it's working it's not working I

398
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:00,720
mean how are you seeing this with your

399
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,720
daily businesses

400
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:08,799
sure so um I would say overall we've

401
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,839
been engaged uh multiple times by the um

402
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,639
regulatory bodies so we've met a few

403
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:13,920
times with the health department um

404
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,919
we've been to a few of the stakeholder

405
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,919
meetings that Lor has put on so um I

406
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:21,318
would say overall input we've been able

407
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:23,599
to um Define some pretty clear channels

408
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:26,000
for giving input and it seems as though

409
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,399
you know we're we're in February here so

410
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,799
we have a lot of work that still needs

411
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:33,000
to be done but I would say we're on the

412
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:34,958
path to getting there um a full

413
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,198
implementation of the system in January

414
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:40,359
still seems difficult there's obviously

415
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:43,120
a lot to be um accomplished but uh I

416
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:45,919
think that the uh industry is very

417
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,078
willing to participate and um and kind

418
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,919
of people's hearts are in the right

419
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:53,198
place um the industry is very patient

420
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,879
focused um and so uh the with the best

421
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:59,000
intentions I think I think we'll get

422
00:16:54,879 --> 00:17:00,278
there so I I'll I'll reiterate um that

423
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,519
and say that you know our experience

424
00:17:00,278 --> 00:17:05,240
with the agencies has been um fantastic

425
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,880
you know this has been a seemingly

426
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,199
hopeless and impossible task from the

427
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,240
time you guys set out to write the

428
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:13,120
legislation took years to get to the

429
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,439
Breakthrough that the mcrsa was um the

430
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,239
reason that I maintain maintain hope and

431
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,798
confidence that this will get done is

432
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,480
because of the coordination we've seen

433
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,119
between the agencies because of their

434
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,000
access because of how uh available they

435
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:28,038
have been and so I speak very highly of

436
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,319
the work that they've done it has to be

437
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:32,000
noted that in the absence of Regulation

438
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,639
there are a number of business models

439
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,279
that have grown up that maybe aren't the

440
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,960
the the way that the state would would

441
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:39,918
like to see our Marketplace move forward

442
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,679
and so there is tremendous strain

443
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,960
particularly as those business models

444
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,640
are disrupted and so we are trying to

445
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,160
work through those tensions our

446
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,919
organization has taken the approach of

447
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,759
just tracking as closely as possible

448
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:52,360
with non-traditional allies local gov

449
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:54,519
law enforcement and really trying to

450
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:56,319
present not just a unified industry

451
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:58,038
perspective but a unified stakeholder

452
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,798
perspective and you know it's slow it's

453
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:02,519
tedious but the agencies are giving us

454
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:05,240
hope and confidence at this point okay

455
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:07,079
I'd like to say personally um I think

456
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,640
it's incredible what the state agencies

457
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:12,000
have been able to do in a collaborative

458
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:15,960
effort my initial irritations were with

459
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,519
the Boe just trying to pay taxes I was

460
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,360
bounced around from Oakland to San

461
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:23,200
Francisco to San Jose and you know

462
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:27,279
you're talking about carrying large sums

463
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,880
of money only to pay a bill and now that

464
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,639
the state has taken appropriate actions

465
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,320
and saying hey this is one of the

466
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,600
Premier issues that we've got to deal

467
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:39,079
with is intake of the revenue I think

468
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:43,639
that the fact that the state has come

469
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:45,918
together and and worked across board

470
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:48,360
with all the various entities have shown

471
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,080
a willingness to get this thing done for

472
00:18:48,359 --> 00:18:53,839
now you take into consideration where

473
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:57,319
you have Mera and miss a jaxson her

474
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,759
staff and others were working towards a

475
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:03,038
common goal and then you then you

476
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:05,279
interject proposition 64 as I would say

477
00:19:03,038 --> 00:19:07,240
the gold post has been moved and they

478
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:09,440
are and the state agencies are still

479
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:11,000
doing a phenomenal job and working

480
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,919
together and seeing this through it's

481
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,279
you know just dealing with Merc alone

482
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,720
was

483
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:22,440
a insurmountable task and then you add

484
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,200
to that and you exacerbate it by adding

485
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,759
prop 64 and you know I read these

486
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:31,360
articles and it's these articles are

487
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:34,879
somewhat written in a in a unfavorable

488
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:36,959
manner towards uh the state agencies as

489
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,679
well as the legislators and I just want

490
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,200
to know from someone that's inside of

491
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,519
this looking out that I understand what

492
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,400
you're dealing with and I I appreciate

493
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:51,158
the work that everyone's doing

494
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,200
together thank you let me um ask uh

495
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:53,799
because you know some issues were

496
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,720
brought up and with your associations

497
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:59,000
and with your businesses you know

498
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:03,279
concentration in certain areas

499
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:05,000
um Edibles was another one and you know

500
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,480
just the public safety aspect how are

501
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,079
you guys dealing with those what are the

502
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,558
discussions you're having with folks uh

503
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:12,399
not just in your associations or things

504
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:13,960
that you're hearing I'm you know like

505
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,400
most people if you're in the in the

506
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:18,840
world everyone's talking in in that kind

507
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,280
of industry or in that world so how are

508
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:22,279
you dealing with those

509
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,720
issues well when it comes to issues of

510
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:29,600
of having product

511
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,720
and when the language which takes place

512
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:36,199
next year uh January 1st we test all our

513
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,319
products to the level uh that we're

514
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,840
comfortable with and it's higher than

515
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,558
what the state probably would ask for so

516
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:45,319
the inventory that we have on hand I

517
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:47,839
believe that we will be in a position to

518
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:50,399
continue to sell that inventory however

519
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:53,359
based on what I'm hearing from the state

520
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,360
we we'll probably limit our purchasing

521
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,959
power or abilities in the fourth quarter

522
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:00,599
and and kind of just let everything

523
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,600
bleed out

524
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,759
you know I'll point to the um over

525
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:08,879
concentration issue um and and raise one

526
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:10,480
of our membership's uh primary concerns

527
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,400
which is under concentration and

528
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,960
ultimately I think the best way of

529
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,120
ensuring a balance between neighborhood

530
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,759
impacts and access is to make sure that

531
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,879
there's one or two stores everywhere and

532
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:23,038
there's not two dozen stores anywhere

533
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,799
and so you know I I definitely defer to

534
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,240
the league of cities in that regard with

535
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:30,200
the local control issue we are we are

536
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,079
definitely encouraging folks to um be

537
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,919
very mindful of their communities for

538
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,879
example in Sacramento we supported a

539
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:39,159
Community reinvestment Fund that is a

540
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,159
voluntary 1% um down in in your District

541
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:42,840
particularly Mr Ridley Thomas uh we are

542
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:45,278
working with folks on measure M to

543
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:47,918
ensure those considerations are included

544
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:49,720
in the postmeasure D framework too many

545
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,200
of these businesses in any one place and

546
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,240
not enough in another place there's sort

547
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,080
of flip sides of the same problem and

548
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,278
what we'd like to get to do is get to a

549
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:59,399
point where you know things are are well

550
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:00,880
regulated um

551
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,600
and you know not banned and not

552
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,520
concentrated ultimately hit that hit

553
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:06,399
that nice Middle Point again just

554
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:08,759
working as closely with the league with

555
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,679
the with cesac with rcrc with the

556
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:12,400
various stakeholders who really know

557
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:14,360
more about those topics and trying to

558
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,600
track very closely with them as we move

559
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:19,599
forward thank you

560
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:22,759
please um for when it comes to um Public

561
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:25,798
Safety for Edibles um earlier Dr Karen

562
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:27,558
Smith from the dph um was speaking about

563
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:30,200
the threshold set by the food

564
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:32,440
manufacturing industry indries and um

565
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,159
cannabis manufacturing can get right on

566
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,720
board with most of those um what's being

567
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:39,679
done in the in the rest of the world um

568
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,319
so we need thresholds so we need

569
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,919
thresholds for pesticides we need

570
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:45,519
thresholds for microbiological

571
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:48,320
contaminants that will also um potency

572
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:50,639
as well so um that will M maintain

573
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:53,079
consistency and potency from product a

574
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,520
to product Z batch after batch year

575
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:58,000
after year um but that responsibility

576
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:00,599
should um be shifted to the manufacturer

577
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,240
that's also how it's done um in the in

578
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:05,038
the rest of the world um and with

579
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,798
regular food manufacturing um so license

580
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,079
holders will need to be hold uh held

581
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:12,480
accountable for those um thresholds and

582
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:14,720
for meeting those um also I think a huge

583
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,519
area for um to show kind of how

584
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,240
responsible the industry is going to be

585
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:21,278
is in marketing and advertising and

586
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,319
under no condition do any cannabis

587
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:26,079
operators want to see their products

588
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:28,200
consumed by children that is bad for bad

589
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:31,000
for consumers bad for business bad for

590
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,038
the industry as a whole um so nobody

591
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,519
nobody wants that um so part of the work

592
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:37,119
that we've done with the manufacturing

593
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:38,480
committee is um come up with some uh a

594
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,599
code of conduct for marketing and

595
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,159
advertising and it's um borrowed from

596
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:44,839
the distilled Spirits Council um and it

597
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:46,480
just talks about what we're not going to

598
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:49,158
do basically so we're not going to show

599
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,960
people um overly impaired we're not

600
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:53,760
going to print um you know uh Santa

601
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,278
Claus on our marketing materials it's

602
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:59,119
very basic but very thorough um points

603
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:01,599
and um I think it's there's a lot of

604
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:04,399
Education that we need to do uh among

605
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,038
the consumer base um but there there is

606
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,400
certainly a responsibility on the side

607
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:10,119
of the manufacturer to not make products

608
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,759
that are attracted to children but we

609
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:13,479
also need to educate consumers on where

610
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:15,919
to store them for example so they need

611
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,079
to be Out Of Reach of children and kids

612
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,880
need to know these products in this

613
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:23,519
package or in this child resistant um

614
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,278
exit bag for example these are not for

615
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:26,480
kids these are for parents um and I

616
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:28,960
think once we start having those

617
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,640
conversations uh we'll be well on way to

618
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,079
resp I think that's what Dr Smith had

619
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,640
said was uh opaque uh you could see the

620
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,678
product and then the child

621
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,278
resistant uh features that are

622
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,519
accompanied with them um we are running

623
00:24:40,278 --> 00:24:45,159
short on time thank Mr chidley Thomas I

624
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,079
would argue that there's no such thing

625
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:49,240
as underc concentration in these

626
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:51,639
businesses it's probably not even

627
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,359
legally defined and I'll take the two

628
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,840
that would be in the mer Park and give

629
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:59,278
them anywhere else anywhere else

630
00:24:56,839 --> 00:25:01,480
literally and while you say that the

631
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:03,720
local governments are experts they're

632
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,440
not they're simply stakeholders the

633
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,839
experts are the people who will bother

634
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,038
me in the middle of the night when these

635
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,798
businesses are

636
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:14,839
overrun particularly the dispensaries

637
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:16,679
now it's not the whole supply chain and

638
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:20,639
this is something that the voters in

639
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:23,080
their wisdom decided to embrace and many

640
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,559
members of this legislature support but

641
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:28,639
it is

642
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:31,720
unacceptable if this system is so porous

643
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,559
that it allows for substantial

644
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,440
concentration and I will blow your phone

645
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:39,678
up as it happens one thing I would think

646
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,159
that you can help us with in Los Angeles

647
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,038
in the immediate notwithstanding measure

648
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:48,159
M will be whether or not we can get the

649
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:51,359
unlicensed businesses or these different

650
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:54,000
business models to quickly come into The

651
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:56,759
Marvelous Light

652
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,038
and the there are there's only so much

653
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:01,079
that local government the community

654
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,200
groups that the Press can do the

655
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:04,879
industry is going to have to step up so

656
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,960
that's I'm not necessarily asking for a

657
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,278
response but with due

658
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,360
respect because of how overc

659
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,038
concentrated it becomes there will not

660
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:15,479
be many of these facilities in the

661
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:18,119
Palisades and I'm quite sure I didn't

662
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,720
look at all how it passed but it passed

663
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,558
a little higher on the West Side than it

664
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,038
did in South Los Angeles it passed in

665
00:26:21,558 --> 00:26:27,839
South Los Angel y all did a good

666
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:30,480
marketing job but um there's it's just

667
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:34,158
not even it's not even comparable what

668
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,679
happens to miss Nook from the industry

669
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:38,278
Association to this legislator's years

670
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:39,798
it sounds like that you're arguing in

671
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:42,398
your opening statement for Less

672
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:45,599
regulation that's unacceptable that will

673
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:48,239
not be something that will hunt now

674
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:51,038
Oakland is different from Los

675
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,640
Angeles the Bay Area was much more

676
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:56,720
accepting a various types of marijuana

677
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:58,240
being distributed in your areas good for

678
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,079
you good for the people that you work

679
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,880
work around that's not the same in Los

680
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:06,599
Angeles nor will it be tolerated when

681
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,760
things like cash uh carrying businesses

682
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:12,879
get robbed stores get broken into and we

683
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:14,679
have a concentrations of individuals who

684
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,640
are trying to access these Services if

685
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:19,080
they're not using one of the mobile

686
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,720
distribution services so it's a little

687
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:22,599
different uh the argument that you bring

688
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,079
but

689
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,879
regulation in and of itself and the

690
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:29,359
reduction in regulation is an

691
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,720
unacceptable argument for this type of

692
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:35,079
Industry so I would caution that as you

693
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,640
come and testify and your industry

694
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:39,678
Association that you pay your membership

695
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:43,240
dues and you employ Advocates to Market

696
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:46,320
on reduced regulation is an unacceptable

697
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,359
argument it doesn't even stand to reason

698
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:50,038
because of things like being able to

699
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:51,839
test whether or not somebody is

700
00:27:50,038 --> 00:27:53,480
intoxicated yeah and I that's not even

701
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,119
the word Mr Ridley toau us things that

702
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,798
we discussed in the earlier panel I get

703
00:27:56,119 --> 00:28:01,518
but Mr chairman to be clear this spoke

704
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:04,000
to that in her opening that they wanted

705
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:06,599
essentially in a condensed version of

706
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,480
that reduced regulation or the state to

707
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:10,639
appreciate that the uh indust the

708
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,440
industry is needed to mature that's an

709
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,679
unacceptable argument that is really an

710
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,120
unacceptable argument the best case

711
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,399
scenario for this would be something

712
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,599
like three tiers where wholesale retail

713
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:23,719
and distribution are separate and do not

714
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,678
have ownership states and capital

715
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,720
frankly will come to the market Capital

716
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:30,399
will come to those businesses and just

717
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,839
because you want to profit from one part

718
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,439
of another maybe some something which

719
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:36,319
you have to give up for being in this

720
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,320
industry is to not be able to have

721
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:40,879
different parts of the supply chain but

722
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:43,519
to me that is an unacceptable argument

723
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,440
to have reduced regulation and what is

724
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:49,519
essentially a a nuisance

725
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,720
industry and I refuse to allow us to

726
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,120
normalize this discussion and it is

727
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,079
different for different areas that's all

728
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,639
I have to say Mr chairman so I think uh

729
00:28:55,079 --> 00:29:00,158
you've made your your point and where

730
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,240
you on these issues and um I think when

731
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,640
Miss noblick I think it was was talking

732
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,880
earlier it was about the different

733
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,960
tiered sections for

734
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,080
transportation um I'm trying to figure

735
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:13,079
out just for

736
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:15,678
clarification are we moving you're not

737
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:18,199
asking for Less the way I heard it was

738
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,640
not less regulation but that we mooved

739
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:24,278
to a regulatory body within the scheme

740
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:27,320
workk of the two propositions that have

741
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:29,720
passed and I think that's kind of where

742
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:32,240
we're at yeah yeah I I'll I'll just

743
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:35,079
respectfully um clarify what I meant to

744
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,399
say there so I think that um the two

745
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:38,960
points I was trying to make was that

746
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:41,278
businesses that don't have a license

747
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,278
will be able to work with businesses

748
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:45,880
that are getting up to speed or I guess

749
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:48,599
those that have licenses and those that

750
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:52,278
don't have licenses will be able to work

751
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:56,199
together for um for a set amount of time

752
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:58,919
um but I think where I misunderstood is

753
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,960
um in allowing of a vertical integration

754
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,600
was it potentially that so um we just

755
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,880
prop 64 allows for vertical integration

756
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:09,158
so um we're not suggesting that we go

757
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,840
outside of either of those two systems

758
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:16,080
but that we uh bring Mera closer to what

759
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:18,038
we're seeing in prop 64 so um I don't I

760
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,599
guess I'm I think we need I think our

761
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:22,158
industry needs regulation um you could

762
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:24,719
take a look at my business we've been

763
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,960
operating as though we've had regulation

764
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,919
for six years we test all of our

765
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,840
products as um Keith had mentioned they

766
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,640
do as well we test all of our products

767
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:36,439
for food safety um for microbiological

768
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,679
contaminants for potency and um I can

769
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,640
sit here and tell you very uh honestly

770
00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:43,159
that I fully believe that we need Safe

771
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,960
products out there and we need to make

772
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:49,080
sure the right players are operating in

773
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,919
the right way so um by no means do I

774
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:53,918
think the industry needs to continue how

775
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:56,600
it's been because um we're we've grown

776
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,559
up past that and it's time to it's time

777
00:30:56,599 --> 00:31:02,038
to adopt sensible responsible regulation

778
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:04,678
so respectfully chair brief comment

779
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:06,240
related to vertical integration and and

780
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:08,840
and the independent mandate for

781
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,638
distribution um and to be clear uh chair

782
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:13,000
Ridley Thomas our organization did not

783
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:14,759
support prop 64 for some of the very

784
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,359
reasons I think that you point out we we

785
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:18,519
think it relaxed regulations too quickly

786
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:20,319
of course there's a concern about

787
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:22,519
regulatory capture from the government's

788
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:24,319
perspective our our concerns are more

789
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:27,599
focused on on Market capture but they

790
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:31,240
are are very similar uh pieces of the

791
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:34,359
same issue um you know we we don't see

792
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:36,240
prop 64 as relieving the Mandate for a

793
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:38,398
license distribution tier in the supply

794
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,919
chain we simply see that it's allowed to

795
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:43,000
be cross- licensed with other lenses

796
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,200
this will in effect create uh one of the

797
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,839
worst outcomes whereby well- capitalized

798
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,600
well positioned businesses will be able

799
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:50,439
to vertically integrate realize those

800
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:52,240
efficiencies and and gain a competitive

801
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,080
advantage while the smaller most

802
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,679
vulnerable businesses particularly The

803
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,519
Growers will continue to be left working

804
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:01,559
with an independent distrib because they

805
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:03,720
simply can't afford to cross license the

806
00:32:01,558 --> 00:32:06,200
micro business does uh license type that

807
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:09,038
was created by prop 64 does create some

808
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,360
relief to this but at the end of the day

809
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:14,519
um what we want to be very careful about

810
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:16,079
is that as we ease regulations which I

811
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:18,798
think you know some stakeholders are are

812
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:20,000
certainly calling for um we don't want

813
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:21,679
to do that in a way that it

814
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,839
disproportionately benefits well

815
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,240
capitalized businesses that that if we

816
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,319
if we do ease those restrictions but

817
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,079
it's a very high financial burden we

818
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:31,200
produce some of the worst outcomes

819
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:33,319
possible and so just wanted to be um

820
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,519
attentive to that issue we do tend to

821
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:38,480
prefer the more regulated framework in

822
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,319
the mcrsa as a starting point and as we

823
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,399
get our bearings as a Marketplace as we

824
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,000
figure things out and have better data

825
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:45,239
then we can move forward into a more

826
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,880
relaxed

827
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,359
framework all right thank you and I know

828
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,960
uh everyone's working hard to create

829
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,599
that regulatory scheme workk and

830
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,880
framework for us to to operate off of

831
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:57,278
we'll continue to have additional

832
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,760
hearings to talk about some of these

833
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:00,440
things and I know we'll be debating some

834
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:02,638
of these policy areas in terms of

835
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,320
vertical integration Transportation

836
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:07,038
tiered not tiered system uh in the near

837
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:09,119
future as we continue to move forward

838
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:10,319
and I know I believe each of the chairs

839
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:11,759
have probably talked to each of the

840
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:13,319
Departments as well and a number of the

841
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:16,278
stakeholders that continue to come into

842
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:17,879
our offices on these issues so um

843
00:33:16,278 --> 00:33:22,720
definitely looking forward to those

844
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:24,360
discussions but Mr wood just just just a

845
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,319
comment kind of a clarification you know

846
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:29,839
when mcrsa was put together one of the

847
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:32,200
reasons that we looked at at limiting

848
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:35,519
vertical integration was was the desire

849
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,360
to keep businesses smaller um and so I

850
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,359
you know grandfathering in existing

851
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:40,759
businesses that are vertically

852
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:42,398
integrated isn't isn't an issue for me

853
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:44,319
what I'm concerned about is the Mega

854
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:46,879
business that comes in grows in an

855
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:49,319
unlimited scale or limited only by

856
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,200
geography or water or whatever at huge

857
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:54,038
scales that that that can then um test

858
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,679
their own products manufacture their own

859
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:57,879
products and sell their own products in

860
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,840
their own stores I don't know of any

861
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,200
other industry out there that does that

862
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,879
certainly not you know at that at the

863
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,720
scale which that and so that's one of

864
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,280
the concerns that after hundreds of

865
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,320
hours of deliberation with the

866
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,800
legislature we chose to do it a certain

867
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:15,399
way so obviously we see we see a

868
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,480
conflict we see a conflict here um

869
00:34:15,398 --> 00:34:22,199
distribution from the the legisl legisl

870
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,199
perspective was a tax collection Point

871
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:27,319
primarily a tax collection point so what

872
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,439
I don't what I didn't see in prop 64

873
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,838
which I still failed to see is how we're

874
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,800
going to reconcile that because how are

875
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:36,519
we going to collect the taxes which was

876
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,079
a big Push by the Coalition of of how we

877
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:40,878
were how this was going to play out well

878
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,240
for California billion dollars in taxes

879
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:44,878
where are we going to collect those

880
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,039
taxes without some sort of a component

881
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:49,398
related to distribution or testing or

882
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:51,599
something so how that all comes together

883
00:34:49,398 --> 00:34:54,078
so that the promise of the taxes for the

884
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,119
legislature to protect kids to to

885
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,760
protect the environment to to protect

886
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:00,519
against the black market is actually

887
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,440
realized so we'll see how all of this

888
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:05,280
all of this plays together um but you

889
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,440
know certainly from a business

890
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,160
perspective the concept of unlimited

891
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,760
vertical integration I think um there's

892
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:14,799
there's a challenge there that that

893
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,320
certainly is in in in huge conflict with

894
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,440
with what the legislature envisions so

895
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,800
we'll see how it plays out yeah we

896
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,599
probably could have a whole hearing just

897
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,760
on

898
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,000
that just on this this one topic Mr

899
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:28,040
Stevenson please and let's move on yes

900
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:33,280
when we speak of vertical integration

901
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:35,599
one of my most expensive um line items

902
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,519
in our budget is purchasing cost of

903
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:39,519
goods if I'm able

904
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:46,119
to produce the majority of the things

905
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,240
that I need inh house that allows me to

906
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:51,039
be a much more fiscally responsible

907
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:54,399
business and I operate under the premise

908
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:57,639
that when I initially started doing this

909
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,760
people went to jail so as the indust

910
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:02,039
industry has chosen to grow up and

911
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,880
expand I've been forced to grow my

912
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:07,239
business which you know either I can do

913
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,800
it if I want or I don't have to I'm

914
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:13,959
choosing to do it what I do not want is

915
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,240
for the Legislative Assembly to limit

916
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:19,000
the size and growth of my business I'm

917
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:20,759
not concerned about anyone coming from

918
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,199
outside with unlimited amounts of money

919
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,960
I'm not consider I'm not concerned about

920
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:28,399
any multi- conglomerates because as long

921
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,318
as there's a a a federal State issue

922
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,838
they're not going to come into the space

923
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:34,199
I don't anticipate these businesses

924
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:37,159
coming to the space for at least 10

925
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:39,519
years Mr really Thomas and Mr soles you

926
00:36:37,159 --> 00:36:42,598
come from areas you represent areas that

927
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:45,159
have high unemployment I'm I'm very

928
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:47,400
aware of your area Mr really Thomas I

929
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:49,879
grew up in South Central Los Angeles

930
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:53,119
this is an emerging Paradigm an emerging

931
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:56,680
market that has the opportunity to

932
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,400
gainfully employ those individual who

933
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:01,598
are unemployable

934
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,440
I asked you to look at this in a

935
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,640
different light I understand what you're

936
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,400
dealing with in the LA the issue in La

937
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:12,639
is not with the industry it's the lack

938
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:15,039
of oversight by the city of Los Angeles

939
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:17,920
we don't have those issues in Northern

940
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:20,759
California so when you guys and I'm not

941
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,599
being gender specific when you all look

942
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:28,040
at this business model I want you to

943
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:31,240
look at it with a clear concise

944
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:33,599
state of mind that this has been that

945
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:35,959
this has been permitted since

946
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:40,559
1996 and it's time for the industry to

947
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:42,639
grow up and please do not limit Me by

948
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:45,000
legislative

949
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,480
laws thank you thank you thank you guys

950
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,358
for your comments and for being here

951
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,280
obviously like I said we could probably

952
00:37:48,358 --> 00:37:52,119
have a hearing just on this and we will

953
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,200
have an additional followup hearing

954
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:56,079
because I know there are other

955
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:57,960
associations and alliances and whatnot

956
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,720
that weren't able to be on this agenda

957
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,440
because it was already packed uh you

958
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:04,480
know we started working on this hearing

959
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,920
last year right after the proposition

960
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,440
passed so uh we'll continue to hold hold

961
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,760
another one um as we can as we move

962
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,400
forward for this upcoming year and then

963
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:18,359
obviously we'll do the oversight as

964
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,119
legis as a legislators in coming years

965
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:21,318
to see how everything is going along but

966
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:23,090
thank you guys for your testimony and

967
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:29,239
thank you for being here
