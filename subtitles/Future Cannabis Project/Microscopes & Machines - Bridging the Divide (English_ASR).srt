1
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:15,079
so I I could start with with one answer

2
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:17,359
and that is that to give you an example

3
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:20,179
we often say well let's let's give this

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,130
product for pain but we really do need

5
00:00:20,178 --> 00:00:24,768
to be more specific when we talk about

6
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:27,618
pain what kind of pain are we talking

7
00:00:24,768 --> 00:00:30,439
about is a chronic pain is it the acute

8
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:31,820
pain so to just say pain is not enough

9
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,420
so that that's number one the other

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:38,689
thing is we need the tools to to measure

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,850
the outcomes that we're looking for so

12
00:00:38,689 --> 00:00:42,769
before we even talk about the products

13
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,420
that will ultimately end up being in the

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,160
patients hands I think we have to

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,520
carefully select what it is that we're

16
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,679
looking for and to just say patients

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,780
with pain or to patients with

18
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,460
Alzheimer's disease or to Parkinson's is

19
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,050
not enough I think we have to be very

20
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:59,030
clear about what the outcomes are that

21
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:01,578
we're looking for and from that

22
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,920
potentially will stem the development of

23
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:05,780
new cannabis products yeah I think also

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,719
part of it it lies for example the

25
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,829
National Academy of Sciences report

26
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:11,530
which basically said there are only

27
00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:14,509
three indications that there's

28
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:17,000
conclusive or strong evidence one was

29
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:19,250
chronic pain and I agree out with Pierre

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,280
over there that we paint as complicates

31
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,319
neuropathic SFM spasticity due to

32
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,180
multiple sclerosis and our Germany

33
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,489
particularly kicked chemotherapy-induced

34
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,799
the rest were considered low level of

35
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:33,709
evidence there is a kind of there's a

36
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,670
tremendous unease by physicians to

37
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:37,709
prescribe for other than the

38
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,259
three those big three at the moment we

39
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:41,969
are all accumulating data he is I am on

40
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,890
some of these lesser indications like

41
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:46,438
Parkinson's pharmaceutical companies are

42
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,329
looking at it but in the absence of data

43
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,118
their physicians don't feel comfortable

44
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,069
at this point we got to generate more

45
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,659
data and a lot of the things we heard in

46
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:56,699
our section was trying to do

47
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:59,820
observational studies try to do

48
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:03,840
registries try to collect more data that

49
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:09,478
would be indirect evidence to then lead

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,610
to further clinical trials relating I

51
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,350
see the issue with not being more

52
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,049
medical products in the market in the

53
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:20,340
cannabis States as being a problem of

54
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:22,769
education and economics most most

55
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,659
doctors and patients in the medical side

56
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:28,319
of cannabis don't know what to ask for

57
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:31,739
and the economics right now favor adult

58
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:35,759
use products so in in the world that we

59
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,560
live in economics drives most things the

60
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,298
only other alternative is demand from

61
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,370
patients but when patients don't know

62
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:43,680
what they don't know and what they

63
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,000
should be asking for there isn't going

64
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,879
to be the creation of the next

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,400
generation of medical products but I

66
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,849
think it's it's it's meetings like this

67
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,950
where you have have both folks that have

68
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:57,509
the capacity to create new products and

69
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:59,369
the researchers who know how to

70
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:01,039
determine whether they're effective is

71
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,299
where we're going to get to the next

72
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:06,539
generation of medical cannabis based

73
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:08,310
products but the things that were are in

74
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:11,519
our way are the economics of the

75
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:15,689
cannabis industry because so I'm from GP

76
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:18,239
Sciences we we grow and we extract new

77
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:20,549
make products both in Nevada which is

78
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,109
now an adult use market and in Louisiana

79
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:28,049
which is a medical only market for now

80
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:30,930
and what we're seeing at least in Nevada

81
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:33,209
is that a lot of the people who are

82
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,099
producing product and a lot of the

83
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,200
dispensaries that are that are

84
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:39,358
delivering products the patients have

85
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,310
put have sort of downplayed the

86
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:43,049
importance of having medical products on

87
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,729
the shelf at all and so that's a real

88
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:46,319
barrier if you're talking you can

89
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:48,810
innovate all you want but if no one will

90
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,389
put it on the shelf and no one knows

91
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:53,280
it's better you'll never sell it if I

92
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:55,529
get into it I mentioned in might to an

93
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,969
earlier talk in our panel in microscopes

94
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,300
we talked there are three parts of

95
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:02,189
education one is but tenders are not

96
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,350
educated a recent study showed 90% of

97
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:06,389
them have had no real education we need

98
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:08,489
to certify them physicians we talked

99
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:11,159
about in our panel before they're not

100
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,890
educated either UCLA we tried developing

101
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:16,649
a physician manual and then thirdly

102
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:18,839
consumers and many of us are have

103
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,909
similarly gone into a dispensary it's

104
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,319
like a night it is a jungle who what is

105
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,020
going I don't know what it was what it

106
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,849
is and if I get a blue dream in this

107
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:29,039
dispensary it's not the same as the next

108
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:31,080
so I think it's very confusing so we

109
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:54,840
need to be have some better labeling

110
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:56,370
would help education as well it's kind

111
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:58,739
of like a vicious circle because you've

112
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:00,689
got a customer base that only knows

113
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,180
enough to buy high THC stuff because it

114
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:06,329
gets you the highest and then that

115
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,280
drives the growers to grow only to see

116
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:09,689
heavy stuff and therefore the minor

117
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:13,019
cannabinoids have suffered for all of

118
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:15,360
that are there labeling issues regard to

119
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,469
minor cannabinoids that's a question see

120
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,610
certain ranges are there not on the

121
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,380
label how do you know they're there yeah

122
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,280
I mean Colorado they're on the label but

123
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:21,029
they're not on the label here in

124
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:23,129
California

125
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,809
and you know why is it what's the

126
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:26,699
concern for the manufacturing viewpoint

127
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,530
the way it's not on our label but what

128
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:30,269
are the concerns is there because you

129
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:32,879
have to ask say for it what's the

130
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:35,939
problem it's really actually comes down

131
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,250
to the the the legislation cited because

132
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,019
they actually only allow you to place I

133
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,759
mean I guess you could put an extra

134
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:43,620
sticker on the package that has that

135
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,860
says that which I think smart companies

136
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,228
do that yeah you have to prove what you

137
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,990
put on your label yeah right you have to

138
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:52,689
prove it

139
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:55,180
so I guess people are more comfortable

140
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:58,149
with just dealing with THC and CBD

141
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,920
because of the error bars involved on

142
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:03,009
some of these smaller amounts of

143
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:06,790
cannabinoids so what we're doing at

144
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:09,849
jetty is we're actually looking at types

145
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:12,310
of plants that will yield higher yields

146
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:15,280
of the minor cannabinoids everybody

147
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:18,069
knows about CBG heme we're currently

148
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:22,209
working with Doug's Varon and trying to

149
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:24,969
get a very high THC V product out there

150
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:26,680
and you know when we're gonna go ahead

151
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,060
and label this I'm not gonna sit there

152
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,910
and talk about the probably talk about

153
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,589
the cbn content because I really don't

154
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,710
want to worry about the analytical

155
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:38,199
numbers failing my THC v product which

156
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:40,779
is what we're going after because my my

157
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,490
cbn counts off so so does that mean we

158
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:44,679
need legislation to actually be more

159
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,840
transparent at this point I I think they

160
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,060
need to just I mean the labeling

161
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:51,639
requirements are really so if you look

162
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,680
at the number of fails last year but so

163
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:55,990
this was reported between when his first

164
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,139
implemented between the August or July

165
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:01,329
1st August 29th four times the number of

166
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:03,339
failures so there are ten thousand

167
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:04,899
roughly some samples submitted there

168
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:07,899
were twelve hundred failures because of

169
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:10,149
labeling because the testing didn't

170
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:13,659
confirm the label the next most was

171
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:16,779
pesticides at 400 so as a manufacturer

172
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:18,490
out there it's a big risk because if you

173
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:21,819
fail labeling I believe you only have

174
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:23,410
two chances to remediate and when they

175
00:07:21,819 --> 00:07:26,019
do the testing your stuffs already in

176
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,970
the device so it's really not very much

177
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:30,430
fun to have someone come tell you hey

178
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:33,220
why'd this fail for pesticide here's all

179
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,629
these vials you know what am I gonna do

180
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,140
act like it's a Greek Wedding and start

181
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:37,139
crushing them all

182
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:41,110
[Music]

183
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:58,189
that's I mean that's that's kind of the

184
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,480
concern and you know I mean just in

185
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:05,449
general yeah that's kind of a concern

186
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:08,120
packaging costs money right and you you

187
00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:09,529
really would so consistently I can

188
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,500
produce the same amount roughly the same

189
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:13,789
amount each TV and TV every time but for

190
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,680
me to start worrying about all the other

191
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,720
little blips and I mean they're they're

192
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,670
not unimportant little blips but they're

193
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,130
not on our or marketing right we're

194
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:26,780
selling to a market was on th TV I'm not

195
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:29,089
selling you 22 1 th TV CBN and and so on

196
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:31,219
so forth so yeah it testings a problem I

197
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:33,529
wish they would lay office right on this

198
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:36,290
aspect I think what they're concerned

199
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:37,668
with is overdosing in I think it's a

200
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:39,889
dosing I think what they're concerned

201
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:41,149
with this dosing I I can't I don't know

202
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:42,979
what they they were thinking when they

203
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:44,230
wrote the wrote the law but that's

204
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:47,720
that's my best guess

205
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:49,430
so as someone who has health regulators

206
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,680
who are trying to decide how to set

207
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:53,599
limits for testing one of the things

208
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,269
that I think is unanimous is that most

209
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,340
regulators want to do right but they're

210
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:00,829
so overwhelmed because they just don't

211
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,960
understand what they understand that

212
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:04,790
there's economic importance to not

213
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,889
overburdening the industry with too much

214
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:09,589
testing but they also want transparency

215
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:12,919
for patients so the regs are a whole

216
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:14,300
other level of complications that are in

217
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,219
place that are going to make it harder

218
00:09:14,299 --> 00:09:18,469
to get more complicated medical

219
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,060
formulations to patients but it's some

220
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,620
you know anything worth doing is usually

221
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,839
hard right so doesn't mean we shouldn't

222
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,399
do it but right now we can't look to our

223
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:28,570
regulators to help because they're

224
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,569
barely keeping up as it is

225
00:09:28,789 --> 00:09:31,849
[Music]

226
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,349
[Music]

227
00:09:47,539 --> 00:09:52,230
we need to we heard the terms earlier

228
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,350
today about individualizing therapy with

229
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,970
one term right and then we have another

230
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,120
term which I've used which is micro

231
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,370
dosing so the question I have is if you

232
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,649
have a fixed amount in an edible like

233
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,779
how do i how do I change that dosing for

234
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:09,389
a given patient so clearly any delivery

235
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:12,629
devices such as tinctures or sublinguals

236
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:17,370
which allow me to dose as a physician is

237
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:19,139
an advantage but the way I see the

238
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,539
future of cannabis based medicines is

239
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,860
that we need to start exploring

240
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:23,730
alternative delivery methods because one

241
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,889
of the things that's known about

242
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,470
cannabinoids as a class is that their

243
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:29,250
their lipid their they're like oil and

244
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,310
water right

245
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,330
our bodies are mostly water lipid

246
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:35,789
cannabinoids are lipids and they don't

247
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:38,220
mix so they're the bioavailability or in

248
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:39,990
other words the ability for the active

249
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,519
compounds in cannabis to interact with

250
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,009
your bodies are limited based on that

251
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,990
whole oil and water dichotomy so I think

252
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:47,309
that the next generation of cannabis

253
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,110
based medicines have to take into

254
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:52,709
account that we can do better at

255
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:55,230
delivering at-ats delivery methods that

256
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:57,509
not only will provide consistency and

257
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,370
dosing but higher viable abilities and

258
00:10:57,509 --> 00:11:02,039
so some of the things that are within

259
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,810
reach are things like oral thin films

260
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:06,209
and things that you're sort of on the

261
00:11:03,809 --> 00:11:09,809
periphery of the market that will not

262
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:11,070
only give more confidence on our dosing

263
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:12,929
abilities but also help with this

264
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,090
bioavailability problem the

265
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:18,569
bioavailability is a huge issue if you

266
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:22,860
take oral CBD the oil is somewhere

267
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:25,500
between 13% and 39% bioavailable and and

268
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,000
so there's that great variability but

269
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,340
let's face it it's pretty darn low as

270
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,799
well right up to 39% so what you're

271
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,370
wasting 60% of it that's that's a real

272
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,949
shame

273
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,019
so I agree with you entirely that we

274
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,210
need to look at how we're going to

275
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:42,120
formulate it so that the product is a

276
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,680
lot more available but but just to talk

277
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,120
a little bit more about dosing I mean

278
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,779
we're looking at a whole lot of stuff

279
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:53,429
the milligrams the milliliters the

280
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:55,169
percentage of each etc and I think as an

281
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:57,239
industry we're not going to be able to

282
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:59,299
focus on everything at the same time I

283
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,009
think we're gonna need to prioritize

284
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:04,919
what illnesses for instance we want to

285
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:07,830
look at we need to decide that and then

286
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,779
get it right in that area and from there

287
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,389
I think we can move to a next and the

288
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,889
next and the next but but right now what

289
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:15,360
I'm seeing you know the other day

290
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:18,269
somebody asked me about what what do you

291
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,930
think about CBD and diabetes and my my

292
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:24,299
job I I don't know do you know I don't I

293
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:25,859
don't know but but we really want it do

294
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:27,779
we really want to go there right now

295
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,850
I don't know cuz I think that there's a

296
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:32,339
lot of other diseases I think we as an

297
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:35,220
organization we need to decide where do

298
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:37,379
we want to start start there get it

299
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:41,210
right on this one and move on to the

300
00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:41,210
next one otherwise it's helter skelter

301
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:48,730
I mean hitting a dose is fairly easy us

302
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:52,250
pretty much as simple math and

303
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:53,990
formulation as far as bioavailability is

304
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,730
concerned some of the more water soluble

305
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,850
components may have better affinity to

306
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:02,629
cross some of our membranes and those

307
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:06,290
products are fairly available or can be

308
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:07,909
created as your own product line just

309
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:12,980
quick question that does anyone know of

310
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:15,139
a consistent available dosing device

311
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:18,980
because there's a lot of controversy at

312
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:20,689
ease yes for a year ago about this I'm

313
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,909
just like let's just say you did like a

314
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,440
puff test and measured like you know

315
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:27,319
whatever your device pulled for one

316
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,910
second that you know think about when

317
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,150
you actually take a drop of your vape in

318
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:34,730
when you inhale that vapor majority of

319
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:36,079
it you're actually exhaling so even like

320
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,490
those type of puff tests are like a

321
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,500
tough correlation between what you're

322
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:42,049
actually getting and it's retained in

323
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:47,090
the lungs that's a good option but it's

324
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:48,759
tough I get it that it's easy but but

325
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,589
it's not right because

326
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:52,838
we have to look at the particular

327
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:56,350
indication and we have to figure out

328
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:58,690
what works in for that indication and

329
00:13:56,350 --> 00:14:01,480
and then when I look at everything

330
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,130
that's available he's in Canada I'm

331
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,250
baffled because there are no two

332
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:09,519
companies that have the same kind of

333
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:12,009
product you know the percentages and so

334
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,509
on and and I just simply don't get it I

335
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:14,889
asked for one thing I get something else

336
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:16,958
and I don't really know what my patients

337
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:19,028
ultimately are getting so I think we

338
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:22,500
need to look at the indication try

339
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:27,039
various things lower CBD higher THC

340
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:29,828
micro dosing titrating up etc until we

341
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:32,799
come to a conclusion that hey this seems

342
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:34,539
to be what works best then we can turn

343
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:38,019
to you guys and say can you make this

344
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:40,120
for us that's gonna say so worse pulling

345
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:41,500
the card if you ask me but I don't know

346
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,269
what one of the things that I see when I

347
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,339
look at when I spent a lot of time

348
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:47,649
looking at the randomized

349
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:49,660
placebo-controlled trials that are

350
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:51,669
available I I went and dug deep into

351
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:53,259
myself right and one of the things that

352
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:55,599
is most frustrating to me is that in

353
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,698
most cases were it was a really well

354
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,250
controlled control in that the design

355
00:14:57,698 --> 00:15:02,409
was well controlled the materials that

356
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:05,769
the subjects were given were incredibly

357
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:09,219
uncontrolled and so it's like we're

358
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:10,659
trying to like it's like you've got

359
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,089
those people who are trying to read the

360
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:16,588
tea leaves okay you know so how can we

361
00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:20,199
expect to have interpretability

362
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:22,000
randomised trials if the materials

363
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:24,129
people are given aren't standardized and

364
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,649
dosed a brick properly yeah I think it's

365
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:29,198
it's our job on the machine side to be

366
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:32,039
able to provide very intelligent doctors

367
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:34,629
like yourselves specifically ice

368
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,370
isolated cannabinoids and then we can

369
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:38,828
combine those with maybe some genetics

370
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,419
tests or specific data that comes back

371
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:42,009
from a specific Amla to custom tailor

372
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:43,719
different ratios of these

373
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:44,950
it's both common and uncommon

374
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,840
cannabinoids so that we can actually

375
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,940
specifically target things so it's our

376
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:50,200
job to provide those but but I think we

377
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:52,420
haven't been doing our jobs telling you

378
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:55,060
what we need because we don't know you

379
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:58,229
can't do the research and back to the

380
00:15:55,059 --> 00:16:01,689
economics who pays for this exactly

381
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,740
that's a great point ultimately the

382
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:09,630
money's gonna have to come from

383
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:12,360
somewhere and and the big driver isn't

384
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:17,230
isolated cannabinoids right now it's

385
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:19,180
large-scale its large amounts of oil to

386
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,680
the recreational market so the thing

387
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:39,579
that's driving production right now is

388
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:41,620
not isolation so GP Sciences the last

389
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:44,170
five years has has been doing drug

390
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,429
discovery work and we've funded research

391
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:50,379
at nine different universities through

392
00:16:45,429 --> 00:16:52,149
the world so we agree so one of the one

393
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:53,740
of the first places that we have to

394
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:56,079
start and Travis you and I talked about

395
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,539
this a little bit is so we're giving

396
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,629
this stuff and we don't even know what

397
00:16:58,539 --> 00:17:03,610
the profile is pharmacokinetic lee in in

398
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:05,559
the bloodstream or in the body right so

399
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,809
every drug that's ever been marketed we

400
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:10,328
know the pharmacokinetics we know how

401
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:12,069
its distributed the time course where it

402
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:14,529
goes how it's excreted how it's

403
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:17,078
metabolized we know all of this and for

404
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:18,889
this these products we know none of that

405
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:21,078
so if I'm given

406
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,209
when ml or if I give two or if I give

407
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:26,119
this I have no idea what that looks like

408
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:28,600
from a from a pharmacokinetic profile in

409
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:31,219
the body so how can I expect any sort of

410
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:32,779
pharmacodynamic effect if I don't even

411
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,029
know what it does I don't even know what

412
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:37,490
they're taking is actually you know

413
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:39,558
having a blip in their bloodstream is it

414
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,970
getting to the brain is it so you by the

415
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,428
way I'm not saying to go sample in the

416
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,230
brain but but but you see what I'm

417
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,840
saying is we have no notion of the

418
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,960
pharmacokinetics so how can we possibly

419
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,730
expect miracles to happen until we study

420
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,048
that and a little bit more about that

421
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,370
and I want to blow your mind even

422
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:57,079
further so we spend a lot of time

423
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:59,359
researching complex mixtures of

424
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:01,129
cannabinoids and turkeys and looking at

425
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,339
the pharmacokinetics and how they have

426
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:05,900
if having had multiple things in

427
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:08,089
biological systems changes the curves

428
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,548
and that's it they ought all of it that

429
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:11,839
if you say such if you look at the

430
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,250
pharmacodynamics of each of the

431
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,839
individual compounds and you compare

432
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,380
that to the mixtures are different so

433
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:20,629
and that's but that's both the power in

434
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,700
coal plant medicine but it's also the

435
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:30,559
curse right how do you control the chaos

436
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:33,410
for good how much individual variability

437
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:35,539
did you have within within the

438
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,070
individual compounds it's pretty tight

439
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:39,558
but then you start to do the mixers and

440
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:41,539
there's there's significant differences

441
00:18:39,558 --> 00:18:44,178
we're looking a lot at receptor based

442
00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:46,730
we're doing really detailed sort of

443
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:51,460
receptor based occupancy site stuff to

444
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:51,460
to show how they they change each other

445
00:18:52,410 --> 00:19:00,670
the challenge with science it is

446
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:04,569
specifically for these dogma that there

447
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:07,830
is we're doing it alone that we're far

448
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:07,829
better signs that are

449
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,119
and

450
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:38,099
we would certainly we would agree to

451
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:39,930
that because we we've got our drug

452
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:42,089
discovery program based on complex

453
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,350
mixtures but that said we know that

454
00:19:42,089 --> 00:19:45,089
there will be a day of reckoning when we

455
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:47,159
go to the FDA with a complex mixture so

456
00:19:45,089 --> 00:19:49,169
we spent a lot of time working out for

457
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,940
every individual compound in there what

458
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,830
does the receptor where does it hit how

459
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:54,269
do they affect each other and it's so

460
00:19:52,829 --> 00:19:56,039
much more complicated but at the end of

461
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:57,660
the day when we look at the sort of

462
00:19:56,039 --> 00:19:58,680
potential these are all preclinical

463
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,490
studies when we look at the preclinical

464
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:05,279
studies these mixtures have such great

465
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:07,319
as if there's enough of a difference in

466
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:09,599
the clinical potential that it's words

467
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:10,829
the pain and it's the only way that

468
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,000
we're ever going to the cannabis based

469
00:20:10,829 --> 00:20:13,799
medicines are ever going to live up to

470
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,900
their promise is if we go for complex

471
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:19,230
mixtures in my opinion so I'm gonna I'm

472
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,910
gonna elaborate on that because if you

473
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,069
look at drug discovery traditionally

474
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:24,870
it's really interesting model because we

475
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:27,450
used to get all our medicine from plants

476
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:29,699
and then as chemistry developed we were

477
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,230
able to start figuring out what was the

478
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,150
most important thing in those plants

479
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:36,120
that was doing the thing we wanted and

480
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:38,009
then okay well let's say let's apply our

481
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:40,439
chemical knowledge to it and transform

482
00:20:38,009 --> 00:20:42,059
that thing right and make it even better

483
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,850
okay this is what happened with opioids

484
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:47,490
and so it's a real it's a tug-of-war

485
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:51,059
actually between traditional one

486
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:52,829
compound one drug you know that that

487
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:54,450
kind of thing and then these mixtures

488
00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:56,339
and even when we're talking about a

489
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:57,779
mixture of terpenes I just showed

490
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:00,750
earlier that these mixtures as these

491
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:02,670
essential oils gets ridiculous it just

492
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:07,109
gets absolutely ridiculous and they're

493
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:10,710
not all terpenes and so I don't I don't

494
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:12,689
know if our model so all our science

495
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,890
right now I shouldn't say all of it a

496
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:17,009
lot of our science right now that's

497
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:20,580
funded that's accepted is all based on

498
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:23,039
the premise that there is this magic

499
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:24,659
bullet that is out there and if we just

500
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,720
find that magic bullet it's going to

501
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:31,519
cure cancer and so it's really tough for

502
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,230
us as scientists to take 200 compounds

503
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,569
and by the way when we take 200

504
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:37,759
compounds we have to show that they're

505
00:21:35,569 --> 00:21:40,129
safe we have to show where they go how

506
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:44,119
they're excreted what dose they're gonna

507
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:46,700
be in so so you know these these one

508
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:48,939
compound just one compound can take a

509
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,470
billion dollars to get to y'all and

510
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:54,410
everyone wants to say you know there's

511
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:56,089
some great pharmaceutical conspiracy no

512
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:58,910
it's art it's us it's our regulation

513
00:21:56,089 --> 00:22:01,220
body you know there's no scientists that

514
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:02,390
I know in the lab whoever said boy we're

515
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,210
gonna make a blockbuster we're gonna

516
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:06,440
make some books you know everyone is out

517
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,500
there to help people it's just we're

518
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,019
stuck in this model and so I guess as a

519
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,579
cannabis industry I mean there's a lot

520
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:16,160
of people basically we talked about this

521
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:18,558
who don't want their stuff extracted and

522
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:22,330
heptane or dichloromethane because they

523
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:24,470
believe in green solvents so it's really

524
00:22:22,329 --> 00:22:27,919
it's a really interesting time for

525
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:31,190
Western medicine because we're starting

526
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,650
to try to adapt our roots to what we

527
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:35,179
have become we're trying to say let's go

528
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,040
back to plant medicine and now let's

529
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:40,460
make it fit our new model and that's

530
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,659
going to be hack expensive so I don't

531
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,620
really know what the answer is as a

532
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:47,210
chemist but you know I just wanted to

533
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:50,359
put that out there make sure it was said

534
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:53,450
so as a physician I would feel very

535
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:57,678
uncomfortable starting to prescribe a

536
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:59,420
single molecule because now I think I'm

537
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,100
going down the pharmaceutical route and

538
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,350
if that's the route I'm gonna take I'm

539
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:05,599
gonna say go the FDA route show me the

540
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:07,730
evidence do clinical trials and so on so

541
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,639
for I think I think there is with

542
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:13,870
cannabis medical cannabis Janousek Wow

543
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:18,679
that that that is that magical thing

544
00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:21,500
that the mixture ultimately has a co

545
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:23,120
effect that works and and I'm happy to

546
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,759
try it in my patients and relieve their

547
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,739
suffering I am just not going to go down

548
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,650
the road of prescribing a single

549
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,870
molecule for an indication that I have

550
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,670
no evidence it works for I'm just not

551
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:37,519
gonna go there and I think the industry

552
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:39,380
has to be very careful not to go down

553
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:41,299
that route if ultimately what you want

554
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:44,240
is for physicians to prescribe because I

555
00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:46,909
think we're gonna hit a wall there right

556
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,769
until the evidence is there so just just

557
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:50,600
be careful you may want to go down that

558
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:51,918
route for recreational or other purposes

559
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:54,649
but I think when it comes time for

560
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:58,700
physicians to prescribe the single

561
00:23:54,650 --> 00:24:01,250
molecule thing may fall flat that's my

562
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,740
two cents I think if you're willing to

563
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:07,009
prescribe a broad spectrum and not a

564
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:09,109
nice little it in hairs they're a bit

565
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:11,869
but just because the broad spectrum is

566
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:15,409
no more validated than the isomer right

567
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:18,678
or the isolate right except though that

568
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:20,240
that there is potentially a Co effect of

569
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:22,370
these things on at the cellular level

570
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,160
that I don't know so I'm ignorant

571
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:27,769
I admit it but but it seems to me what

572
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:31,220
I'm seeing is in effect when I give this

573
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:32,539
oil and I don't know what what the

574
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,789
properties are in there and that's why

575
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:36,349
ultimately I'd love to know if if what I

576
00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:38,149
think is working is even getting into

577
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:40,039
the body you know sooner or later we're

578
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:42,050
going to have to you know to do a spinal

579
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:43,460
tap on somebody and get a sample of

580
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:44,839
spinal fluid and find out if there is

581
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,700
anything that's getting into the brain

582
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:48,019
ultimately because here we are talking

583
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,690
about how great this stuff is because

584
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:51,889
it's working on my mom's head and and we

585
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,529
don't even know if it's actually getting

586
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:57,800
into the CSF right the blood-brain

587
00:24:54,529 --> 00:25:00,710
barrier is a very very important feature

588
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:03,168
of controlling the the environment of

589
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:04,700
the brain and we can't take it for

590
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,470
granted that everything is getting

591
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,090
through and particularly in the amounts

592
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:12,250
of we think it's getting through so I

593
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:12,250
mean and I use that just as one example

594
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:20,328
[Music]

595
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:36,099
yeah I think what I'm seeing today is

596
00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:38,048
very optimistic I'm seeing us getting

597
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:40,389
together talking starting the discussion

598
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:42,210
I think we wouldn't have seen this a

599
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:45,190
couple of years ago I mean we've got

600
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,870
highly qualified individuals who know

601
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,250
the chemistry who know how to get this

602
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:49,839
stuff out and now we're getting

603
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:53,230
physicians and we're all at the same

604
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,879
table together talking III think already

605
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,190
we've achieved what I consider to be a

606
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,710
very optimistic future and and I think

607
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:03,640
that this is the beginning of something

608
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:05,590
really great what I what I what I say

609
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,528
and this is as Rock producers we have a

610
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:12,908
lot and a lot of data out there that's

611
00:26:08,528 --> 00:26:14,980
free to us potentially does anybody know

612
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:19,360
pax pax I believe is building a database

613
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:21,190
for people to react to their products so

614
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:23,229
you can go on to their app which it

615
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:26,528
controls your temps and you can react to

616
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:29,409
a product and as a recreational

617
00:26:26,528 --> 00:26:31,599
producers of a product I think it's also

618
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:34,539
an important thing that we also develop

619
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:36,788
some kind of consumer feedback so that

620
00:26:34,538 --> 00:26:39,879
so what's really great about what I do

621
00:26:36,788 --> 00:26:42,788
is I have all the data I have all the

622
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,289
chromatograms of my essential oils of my

623
00:26:42,788 --> 00:26:46,119
kid Adam anoints and they're all just

624
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:48,069
sitting in my shelf to make sure you

625
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:50,319
know what past regulatory compliance or

626
00:26:48,069 --> 00:26:53,200
my curiosity or whatever and now if I

627
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,710
have 17 people come back and say hey

628
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,350
this really helped with my migraines

629
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:01,210
well I have a place to start at least so

630
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:03,459
I think there's a lot of accidental

631
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:05,230
things that can happen out there and we

632
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,360
really I mean we have big data we have

633
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:10,169
the Internet it's all there for us we

634
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:13,689
just have to start giving our customers

635
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:16,960
giving our patients a good way to

636
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:19,120
interact give us data and then sort of

637
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,220
find a good way so that the physicians

638
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:24,939
and scientists studying this can receive

639
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:26,558
that data in a manner that they would

640
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,570
most like to receive there's basically

641
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,220
got to be some collaboration here

642
00:27:28,569 --> 00:27:31,960
between the scientists studying this and

643
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,200
the people creating the surveys in the

644
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,058
software and it's all within reach I

645
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,740
couldn't agree more that the way this

646
00:27:37,058 --> 00:27:39,759
industry will move forward is if the

647
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,920
producers

648
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:44,230
and the researchers are aligned and

649
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,380
communicate and that we get valuable

650
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:49,120
input from patients because that's you

651
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,490
know it's those three parts that are

652
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:52,719
really going to have us have create the

653
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:54,460
next generation of cannabis based

654
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,680
medicines there are more standardized

655
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:58,029
that are easier to dose and they're more

656
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,460
effective and that last piece is the

657
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:02,559
hardest one to get at but I think that

658
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:20,380
with these kinds of dialogues we can get

659
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:22,450
there people are getting relief it works

660
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,340
yeah and significantly cheaper now I

661
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,960
mean it sucks for all of us in the

662
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:28,659
industry who are literally breaking our

663
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,840
bones every day to provide a profitable

664
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:34,440
product but I mean I think in the long

665
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:39,039
run it's more easy access for cheaper

666
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:41,740
patients are going to jail that's I mean

667
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:43,329
that's you know you've I've lived in red

668
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:46,329
states I got my degree in a red state

669
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:48,220
and you know people will do anything get

670
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:50,109
their kids some Charlotte's Web do you

671
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:53,470
know what I mean right in South Carolina

672
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:55,479
so they'll break the law right and you

673
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:58,390
know these these these are felony felony

674
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,769
crimes so I think that's one of the

675
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:02,710
great things I'm seeing right now I

676
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:05,500
don't think we're twenty years away from

677
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:11,620
the end of prohibition anymore so I

678
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:13,279
think we're less than 20 okay let me

679
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:17,309
just see

680
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:18,660
three point two years depends on if

681
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:21,059
Trump gets reelected now I'm not going

682
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,550
to go there yeah I think a couple one is

683
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:25,799
I think the farm bill in December opened

684
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:28,799
up a whole of a whole new window because

685
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:30,779
CBD and CBD from hemp is not the same

686
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,039
thing all around the world so we can

687
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:34,680
start exploring all the different

688
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:36,000
terpene associated with CBD the other

689
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:37,650
thing which brought up in our meeting

690
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,710
with the the fact that there is some

691
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:42,720
willingness now is right now this moment

692
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:45,630
where you can actually start doing some

693
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,490
studies ex-us for some products so i bit

694
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,000
was part of a study with that we started

695
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:50,190
doing

696
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,930
we couldn't get graft-versus-host which

697
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:54,299
really could say some pediatric lives

698
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:56,490
but we could start it in israel and so

699
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:58,740
again when we heard if you can start the

700
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:01,200
study elsewhere you can create the

701
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,430
demand to move it here so temporarily

702
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,620
right now we're in the phase where it's

703
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,850
very difficult to do studies here but we

704
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:09,000
have other ways of starting and

705
00:30:05,849 --> 00:30:11,879
generating research now people have

706
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,859
mentioned education and I think that

707
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,710
place is very important role and I could

708
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:18,599
see a day where we have a medical

709
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,370
conference where people such as

710
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:23,369
yourselves who know the chemistry how to

711
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:25,739
produce it it can come and educate

712
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:27,949
physicians a little bit more about you

713
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:30,870
know what really goes into making this

714
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,370
it's it's it would be important and then

715
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:36,359
to get physicians such as yourself who

716
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:38,369
have in increasing amounts of experience

717
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:41,309
with it and start educating physicians

718
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:44,699
that hey this isn't you know this is not

719
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:46,829
poison this this actually works and and

720
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:48,450
here the chemists and the producers and

721
00:30:46,829 --> 00:30:49,889
the guys who know how to produce it who

722
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:52,980
can tell you about what they're doing

723
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:55,740
and and have an opportunity to network

724
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:57,210
and to understand and to communicate and

725
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,160
I think that would be a long way cuz

726
00:30:57,210 --> 00:31:01,200
certainly in coming here this this today

727
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,970
for me has been in education yeah I

728
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,980
would like to ask whether it's possible

729
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:07,019
for the are machines people to all get

730
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,150
to all the producers as pharmaceutical

731
00:31:07,019 --> 00:31:12,450
companies evolve to get together in some

732
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:13,800
way one to provide easy my patients say

733
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:16,230
what do I look for information about

734
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:18,000
side-effects instead said they say it's

735
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:19,440
a you do the Google search I've got a

736
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,660
million documents I can't figure it out

737
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,610
if there's any one central place that

738
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:25,009
could give information to patients would

739
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:26,869
be really really

740
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:28,670
helpful same thing if we can get

741
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:30,949
everyone to kind of agree black we heard

742
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:33,080
in Canada potentially to have all

743
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,240
multiple parties contributing to it sent

744
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:36,710
general fund to start at least pilot

745
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,180
studies and research that would also be

746
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:42,079
helpful and that's something we could do

747
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:43,910
now so interestingly enough GP Sciences

748
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:46,309
is involved in Louisiana we're one of

749
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:49,190
two commercial producers who was chosen

750
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:51,559
to work with university partners who

751
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:53,690
hold two licenses and so what's unique

752
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:56,029
about the Louisiana market is that they

753
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:57,680
have a pharmacy driven model so instead

754
00:31:56,029 --> 00:32:00,500
of your standard dispensaries they have

755
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:04,070
to have licensed pharmacist pharmacists

756
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:06,410
on staff to counsel patients and going

757
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:08,419
into this market we we we did this on

758
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:10,040
purpose because we think that there has

759
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,539
to be some place where we have really

760
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:13,789
responsible medical markets being

761
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:15,589
fostered and so we've we've worked hard

762
00:32:13,789 --> 00:32:18,619
to try to put together a responsible

763
00:32:15,589 --> 00:32:21,980
advice for the physicians and the

764
00:32:18,619 --> 00:32:24,679
doctors in Louisiana based on the random

765
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,059
base bond evidence-based medicine and

766
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,680
it's really challenging because you know

767
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:30,409
it's in anyone who's looked at those

768
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,660
that that literature it's not robust but

769
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:35,019
we need to have a place to start and the

770
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:37,580
more the information that we can give to

771
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:39,139
pharmacists and doctors and that can be

772
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:41,629
disseminated to the patients and

773
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:43,610
stakeholders we're gonna I think that's

774
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:45,860
how we could potentially get this

775
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:47,299
medical ecosystem around cannabis to

776
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:49,549
evolve but having the right stakeholders

777
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:51,619
it's great that we have producers and

778
00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:54,049
weekend that we have researchers but

779
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:55,250
there's so many parts of the ecosystem

780
00:32:54,049 --> 00:32:57,259
that need to be involved in getting

781
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:59,059
better medicine to patients including

782
00:32:57,259 --> 00:33:01,400
the abominations Louisiana not the only

783
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:02,869
state Pennsylvania oh yeah there are

784
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:06,920
several states now that require a

785
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:10,399
benefit which is a great step yeah right

786
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:12,470
I mean there's I follow Medscape you

787
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,320
know I'm also it was also an MRI tech

788
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:18,529
and so I do like to read what doctors

789
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:21,619
think and Medscape is basically just

790
00:33:18,529 --> 00:33:23,788
kind of a a magazine for doctors and

791
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:25,858
they came out with a list of contra in

792
00:33:23,788 --> 00:33:27,569
occasions in terms of medicines that

793
00:33:25,858 --> 00:33:29,788
aren't compatible with cannabinoids and

794
00:33:27,569 --> 00:33:31,888
so I mean we we definitely have to start

795
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:33,450
with with hooking up you know patients

796
00:33:31,888 --> 00:33:35,699
with that kind of information I don't

797
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:37,379
know if that can happen in the US on a

798
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,509
national level maybe they are neighbors

799
00:33:37,378 --> 00:33:41,459
up the north can help us out building

800
00:33:39,509 --> 00:33:43,499
some kind of government agency that

801
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,720
could give you know Americans with

802
00:33:43,499 --> 00:34:01,349
access to the Internet at least you know

803
00:33:45,720 --> 00:34:04,500
some idea of contraindicated medicine I

804
00:34:01,349 --> 00:34:04,500
[Music]

805
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:11,489
think in the u.s. you need to really get

806
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:13,378
the whole legalization process that I

807
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:15,598
think working on legalization I know

808
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:17,009
there's some efforts but I I think the

809
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,780
big elephant in the room as far as I'm

810
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:24,540
concerned is the the u.s. in being

811
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:27,149
unable to ultimately legalize this let's

812
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:29,369
face it the u.s. is the driver of almost

813
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:32,039
everything medical and and without

814
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:34,169
having the u.s. on board it's very

815
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:36,449
difficult worldwide to really move this

816
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:38,699
beast forward and I think I think in the

817
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,828
next 12 months there has to be a lot of

818
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:43,428
concerted effort on trying to get you

819
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:45,629
know governments and legislators to

820
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:47,250
appreciate the fact that this is here to

821
00:34:45,628 --> 00:34:50,179
stay and we might as well all work

822
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:52,739
together rather than butting heads I

823
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:54,960
mean I think I agree with you I think

824
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:57,449
that for me that possibilities is the

825
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,429
farm bill as I've seen institutional

826
00:34:57,449 --> 00:35:02,098
review boards regulators starting to

827
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:03,509
ease off in the United States and I

828
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:05,818
think there's some options even if we

829
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:08,849
just start with with studies with CBD

830
00:35:05,818 --> 00:35:10,259
alone I'm thrilled that we broke the

831
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:11,910
barrier and we're gonna start doing

832
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:13,740
research that's about to happen in the

833
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:15,868
next 12 months so that's really great

834
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:17,879
and I agree the second thing is the

835
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:19,920
issue about education I think there's a

836
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,480
lot of initiatives right now if we can

837
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,789
convince either state or federal to

838
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,199
start educating people whether it be but

839
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:27,480
tenders whether it be but tenders

840
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:31,279
doctors or patients I'll be thrilled and

841
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,280
I think one of the three is possible

842
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:36,570
you'll see an influx of more diverse

843
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:38,099
cannabinoids which hopefully will fuel a

844
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:40,200
lot of the studies and research that

845
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:45,960
gentlemen and ladies like yourself are

846
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:48,000
doing uh yeah I think we'll see a lot of

847
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:52,440
improvement on the equipment to get to

848
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:56,179
those those cannabinoids so we'll talk

849
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,179
about the hemp industries is that right

850
00:36:00,469 --> 00:36:05,549
the California market needs to stabilize

851
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:06,358
in terms of the cannabis market it's

852
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,580
ridiculous

853
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:10,858
it's the Wild West here went to Colorado

854
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:12,690
and I was just thoroughly impressed by

855
00:36:10,858 --> 00:36:13,409
the first dispensary I went into was

856
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:15,630
Colorado

857
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:18,868
he's like the day the day after it

858
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:20,940
opened and the price is then and then

859
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:22,769
the price is now and also the regulation

860
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:26,400
it was just super early impressed so

861
00:36:22,769 --> 00:36:28,800
California and markets like that need to

862
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,230
stabilize better so that producers can

863
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,820
figure out and also farmers etc

864
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:36,619
everybody can figure out what's going on

865
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:40,609
so I think we're gonna see some more

866
00:36:36,619 --> 00:36:43,530
clarification in what's going on with

867
00:36:40,608 --> 00:36:46,440
new compassionate care laws coming and

868
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:50,160
maybe some modification of tax policy

869
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,470
etc the hemp industry so I would not

870
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:56,309
invest a dollar of my money into Iceland

871
00:36:52,469 --> 00:37:01,259
and I would instead look at distillate

872
00:36:56,309 --> 00:37:03,779
for one reason FDA there is a drug I'm

873
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:08,119
sure you're all aware of it

874
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:12,330
ABBA dialects that's a CBD bass drum so

875
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:15,088
CBD isolate is now competing with a FDA

876
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:18,329
approved drug and the history of these

877
00:37:15,088 --> 00:37:20,489
things aren't good for the the for

878
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:23,150
nutraceutical market however there is a

879
00:37:20,489 --> 00:37:27,009
precedent with a

880
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:29,389
it's called the red rice precedent so I

881
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:32,120
don't remember the exact compound but

882
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:34,069
basically there was a compound that a

883
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:36,500
company from red rice a company patented

884
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:38,480
it through the whole process and got it

885
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,610
through the FDA and they wanted to shut

886
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,579
all these red rice nutraceutical people

887
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:46,490
down and what would've happening is it

888
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:48,409
was proven that well full-spectrum red

889
00:37:46,489 --> 00:37:52,039
rice extract was actually missing Lee

890
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:54,469
used before you major drug and we know

891
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:58,179
that the whole spectrum have backtrack

892
00:37:54,469 --> 00:38:01,129
whatever that means was used before

893
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:03,379
epidemics came out so that's my position

894
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,990
we have to wait for the FDA to be more

895
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:08,390
clear on this I think they really want

896
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:15,589
Congress to go back and define it they

897
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:17,179
really confused they so 2020 we'll see

898
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:19,579
what happens there Democrat Republican

899
00:38:17,179 --> 00:38:23,119
who controls the White House who

900
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:24,170
controls the Congress we'll see I sort

901
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,849
of agree with what everybody else has

902
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:28,579
said is it with respect to in the next

903
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:31,730
12 months I believe the hemp act or the

904
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:33,289
farm bill is gonna really help shape the

905
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:36,650
cannabis industry it's the same plant

906
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:38,269
after all and so we can't we can't

907
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:40,579
assume that things that happen over

908
00:38:38,269 --> 00:38:44,090
there won't affect our industry that

909
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:46,069
said when I think about the most

910
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:48,110
optimistic view for the next 12 months I

911
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:49,460
I'm looking to sort of the global market

912
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:52,400
I think there are places in the world

913
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:54,320
that are more progressive and you know

914
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,360
if we're not careful they're gonna well

915
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,640
some of them already have a lead on us

916
00:38:56,360 --> 00:39:01,099
so I think the global market in the 12

917
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:03,739
the next 12 months is gonna be really

918
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:05,599
moving forward aggressively whereas

919
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:09,909
we're gonna be looking at the details of

920
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,909
the farm bill so this much respect

921
00:39:11,909 --> 00:39:14,980
