[Music]

2
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:11,460
no longer to any the grower communities

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,049
have money go to any grower community in

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,950
the California ask them are you doing

5
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:15,989
well financially

6
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:17,309
tell me anyone raise their hand and say

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,109
yeah I'm doing great I'm making money

8
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,269
like my business is thriving

9
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:22,680
very very few cultivators some

10
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:24,600
distributors are doing well some

11
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,750
extractors are doing well couple stores

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,730
are probably doing well processors you

13
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,349
know that kind of stuff

14
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,909
secondary outside of cultivation the

15
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,250
cultivators show me anybody that's doing

16
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:37,500
well I I take a look at all these

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,340
Canadian companies coming in snatching

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,170
up territory

19
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,180
there's a lot of Canadian investment in

20
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,129
houma County people aren't aware of so

21
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:45,929
if it's heavy here it's heavy everywhere

22
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:47,640
and what they're doing is they're buying

23
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:49,920
up areas that have historical

24
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,259
cultivation sites they're buying up

25
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,510
places that have good brand value for

26
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:57,420
the future of cannabis because they can

27
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:59,039
make a long-term investment we don't

28
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,129
have that ability we have to survive

29
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,269
right now and for me it's easier to get

30
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:09,450
a job and stay poor and keep my farm

31
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:12,658
alive then try to risk running the farm

32
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,030
and lose money or run the farm and

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,280
divert it and have any issues and lose

34
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,400
the permit and navigate

35
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,769
permit again and I'm just like so what

36
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,020
are we doing so I I've made the decision

37
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:26,390
you know years ago that for me the farm

38
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:27,978
was gonna be forever and so whatever I

39
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,570
had to do to keep it alive didn't

40
00:01:27,978 --> 00:01:31,579
forward is what I was going to do and if

41
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:33,500
I could just work on getting the

42
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:35,060
permaculture Gardens put in to where I'm

43
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,340
actually creating a very closed loop

44
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:40,609
system over time and it's happening and

45
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:42,320
then I work on a genomic project where I

46
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:44,478
can figure out how to get one line that

47
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,129
I can build that works at my property

48
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:49,009
that has a quality that I think is good

49
00:01:46,129 --> 00:01:50,269
that I know would be good for time that

50
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:53,118
I have an ability now to be

51
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:55,759
differentiated in the market and if I

52
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,769
can just survive we'll be okay because

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,579
our regional have brand value with the

54
00:01:57,769 --> 00:02:01,489
Appalachians

55
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:02,239
the ability to stamp humble products

56
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:04,189
here is huge

57
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,618
so when Maguire put that in it was

58
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:08,449
brilliant because what it needs to do is

59
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:10,219
give us differentiation so that you

60
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:12,349
can't just say well son grandson grown

61
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:14,359
because really it's not the Sun grown in

62
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:15,680
Texas and Sun grown in Florida and some

63
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,239
ground in New England even though I love

64
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,920
the New England grows and the grow is a

65
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:20,180
killer there's like the Michigan boys

66
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:22,849
the Michigan boys can grow some good

67
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,830
weed they do not have the same ability

68
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:26,209
to grow what we can grow here because

69
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:29,150
we're in California we have different

70
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:32,810
climactic situation so it gives us some

71
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,789
advantages in different ways and humble

72
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,830
has a historic reputation which is a

73
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:39,919
gift to be able to live here and be able

74
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:42,920
to be part of it but you know for the

75
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:46,099
average cultivator oh my god when they

76
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:48,919
stepped into a bear trap and and I'm the

77
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:51,919
average cultivator and and the irony is

78
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:54,949
that they're being held up by sequa

79
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:57,469
environmental review and meanwhile with

80
00:02:54,949 --> 00:03:02,560
those resurgence of prices in the

81
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:02,560
traditional market it seems that there's

82
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:10,069
it could be encouraging I imagine people

83
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:11,870
both going indoors more which is

84
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:15,229
obviously for the environment and also

85
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,930
diesel grows more little Samoa is one of

86
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:18,628
the reasons

87
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,519
people if the Emerald triangle voted

88
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:23,098
against their financial interest and

89
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,200
voted for legalization was because one

90
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:27,628
of the major reasons was they really

91
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:32,009
wanted to stop the environmental harm

92
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:35,250
that they saw the you know the reckless

93
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:37,199
black market growers that didn't care

94
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,120
about the environment so many people

95
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,250
here want that to stop because we do

96
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,420
live in such a beautiful and important

97
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:48,180
ecosystem and so the regulation being

98
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:50,098
what it is it's the good actors are

99
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,919
trying to come forward and get permitted

100
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:55,798
and they're being held back and

101
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:58,590
meanwhile the it seems like the diesel

102
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,840
dope is returning to the hills Oh

103
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,609
guaranteed it's just I remember years

104
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,378
ago I was when I first got to work first

105
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:07,319
went to work in Arcata someone came in

106
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:08,729
to buy plums it was right after the

107
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:10,199
financial collapse the world was

108
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:12,119
crumbling for most people and I looked

109
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,578
at this person I said didn't I see you

110
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,250
on a jury selection for me on a week to

111
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:20,129
trial and they looked at Hara and I said

112
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,819
amazing how now that you have need it's

113
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:24,269
okay

114
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:25,889
well that's called reality and so diesel

115
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:27,930
dope is a reality where if they're gonna

116
00:04:25,889 --> 00:04:30,150
satellite the space so heavy that you're

117
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,670
gonna pick everybody ever Ellen

118
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:34,469
for what he done Duggal homeless what

119
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,430
are you gonna do don't want like what do

120
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,650
you I mean what are you going to do

121
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,569
there is no alternative especially if

122
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:40,109
you have such an investment in what

123
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:42,120
you're doing

124
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,860
and so it's a nightmare because the

125
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,420
whole point about going into into

126
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,129
legalization with Humboldt was to be

127
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,439
able to create all these killer outdoor

128
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:50,879
grows and then in northern Humboldt they

129
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:52,519
could do the indoor operations because

130
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,889
you can't run out there on the coast and

131
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,539
and indoor is a necessary evil in the

132
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:58,829
world of cannabis because it fits in the

133
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,230
model right now and they're even

134
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:02,609
creating indoor Commission's to further

135
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,900
the indoor production of cannabis

136
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,699
because that's how we should produce

137
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:07,500
cannabis because everybody that's got

138
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:09,420
indoor spent huge money on the

139
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,250
infrastructure and that means typically

140
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:14,910
they're tied into bigger operations

141
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:17,879
which can lobby that way the outdoor was

142
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,439
all basically owner operators and to me

143
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,480
it was the it was the beauty of the

144
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,910
industry was all these small individuals

145
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,230
producing really gorgeous cannabis and I

146
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,480
knew that we would never have the

147
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,970
diversity we did prior because it just

148
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,470
doesn't work it doesn't it doesn't work

149
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,140
for the model where you only have a

150
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:36,540
three pounds to sell to the store they

151
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,099
need more or otherwise they they sell it

152
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,530
then there's you're not there they got a

153
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,270
cultivate a million different clients it

154
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:43,949
makes it hard for distribution because

155
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:45,359
they they source it then everybody likes

156
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:47,370
it and they can't get it again then they

157
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,810
get it doesn't work and so that's why

158
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:50,910
the region's had to build multiple

159
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,009
varieties that were licensed that were

160
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,570
patented that were protected and

161
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:56,009
everyone's like free the plant let it

162
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:58,920
run a while but I'm like it doesn't work

163
00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:01,019
like that an Ag it only works like that

164
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,420
in black market AD because there's no

165
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:05,159
regulation but once you regulate it and

166
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,080
you make it so that bigger companies can

167
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,840
enter safely without losing

168
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,089
infrastructure in a raid well there

169
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,339
there's economy escape takes effect that

170
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:15,839
economists scale just means how big do

171
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:19,169
you have to be to play the game here in

172
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:22,310
and what we're finding here is that none

173
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:24,620
of us are big enough to financially

174
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:28,639
survive this

175
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:30,680
and when you are you're paying this much

176
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,180
money for the real estate to put a store

177
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,650
in you're paying this much for the

178
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,220
people you're paying this much for this

179
00:06:33,649 --> 00:06:39,560
your margins are small the the farmer

180
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,330
they build this credible farm they

181
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,459
produce this gorgeous product that then

182
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:45,289
sits at the farm for seven months so for

183
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:48,109
seven months nobody got paid with money

184
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:49,310
come from from my investor let means

185
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,590
he's trying to get back when he gets

186
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,350
paid but you're just basically a worker

187
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:56,750
so you'd almost be better off not taking

188
00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:00,080
the investor keeping the property you'll

189
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:01,459
get a job and hang out for a minute the

190
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,019
number of people I know that have jobs

191
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:05,449
and I was mind-bending where they went

192
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:08,870
and got a traditional job so that they

193
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:10,849
could just stay alive as this thing

194
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,649
sorts itself out because otherwise what

195
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,379
you do is you'll work for a full fiscal

196
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:19,129
year and not getting any money how do

197
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:20,990
you do that it can't be emotional this

198
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:23,509
is not an emotional thing you're in it's

199
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,160
just it's real and so your emotions you

200
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:27,079
know they they're important because it's

201
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,370
what drives you but if you live off of

202
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:31,519
them in a business you're going to die

203
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,560
and this this this is a one-percent

204
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,299
Walmart model and even a lot of the

205
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,939
stores you have to pay for shelf space

206
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,790
so the stores charge the farmer for

207
00:07:37,939 --> 00:07:43,699
shelf space the farmers get charged for

208
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:45,470
every step of the process I looked at it

209
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:47,180
before they ever get paid that's why I

210
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,980
built all the other that's why that's

211
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,019
why I built the other operations was

212
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,759
because I knew that I wanted to be a

213
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:56,629
farmer more than anything because that's

214
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,860
where my my my heart lies if I could be

215
00:07:56,629 --> 00:08:00,439
hit the hill every day I'd be the

216
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,360
happiest I could be but I got into all

217
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:04,879
the other things because I knew that the

218
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,530
farmer and life gets screwed and I knew

219
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,889
that if I didn't have multiple options

220
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:11,389
then I would basically end up losing the

221
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,099
farm into bankruptcy

222
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:14,620
and I didn't want to lose the farm

223
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,660
because I wanted to give it to my kids

224
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,220
so I'm in my 50s for crazy sex I'm not a

225
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,620
kid I've been I've been in the game

226
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,710
since I'm 12 so I got over 40 42 years

227
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,930
of hustling you know 40 41 years of

228
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:29,329
being involved in multiple felon

229
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:32,599
cases everything I name the damn thing

230
00:08:29,329 --> 00:08:34,038
I've been in it so for me the goal is to

231
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,229
be able to take this beautiful piece of

232
00:08:34,038 --> 00:08:37,490
property here and give it to my kids and

233
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:39,710
the only way I could afford to do that

234
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,019
was make it into a farm and the whole

235
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,908
time I was doing it I knew that it was a

236
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:45,169
risk but I knew that if I could just

237
00:08:43,908 --> 00:08:47,958
look at it for a really long-term

238
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:50,269
purpose then it would make that risk

239
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:51,708
something I could understand and I

240
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:54,230
expected to be able to make enough money

241
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:56,329
off the first year of sales to just

242
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:59,509
balance it out but I didn't expect big

243
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:01,459
wealth I just expected balance and what

244
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:03,528
I see is complete in balance and it's

245
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:06,199
mind-bending that it got this bad and

246
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:07,879
the state is so traumatized that they're

247
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,399
talking about sending the National Guard

248
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:12,980
up to you know northern Mendo southern

249
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,839
Humboldt to get her and I don't see them

250
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,370
not doing that I can see the satellites

251
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,200
get them all the information they need

252
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,899
you know it's gonna be a very

253
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,278
interesting DEP season very interesting

254
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,570
because why would you wait for outdoor

255
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:25,189
why wouldn't you wait for the depth so

256
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,600
every because everybody's strategy is to

257
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,580
get quick depth in before that's the

258
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,339
game's over that's when I'd come in and

259
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:33,110
get you why not they're not stupid they

260
00:09:31,339 --> 00:09:34,520
have all the tools and so all of a

261
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,800
sudden everybody is you know really

262
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:38,720
riding on this little moment and it's

263
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,120
pretty scary and so for me I let my

264
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,240
farmstead fallow last year I got hit up

265
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,350
with archaeological reports and by the

266
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,000
time I was going to be able to actually

267
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,490
plant it would have been a longest and I

268
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,409
just said why so I went to proof of life

269
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,019
pictures of me with newspapers and all

270
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:55,610
the growth sites on the farm and that

271
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:58,909
way I had documentation and then they

272
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,620
did satellite confirmation so every 50

273
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:02,509
days they had photos of my farm on

274
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:04,580
satellite and they said hey you never

275
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:08,000
grew and it completely took away that

276
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,379
$20,000 excise tax and because I didn't

277
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,970
cultivate I didn't have to file income

278
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:13,189
tax so I don't have to file but there's

279
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,829
no money so there's more money and not

280
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,660
growing for me personally there's more

281
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:20,028
money and not growing I'd rather lose 15

282
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:21,708
grand a year then lose a hundred grand

283
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:23,539
because I'm gonna have to grow it all

284
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:25,489
out then I'm gonna have to hold it and I

285
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,899
don't have on-site processing so I'm

286
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,000
gonna have to send it to a processor

287
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:29,350
then I'm not the JA

288
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,698
then I'm going to get label then I'm

289
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,870
gonna have to get it distributed then

290
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:34,240
I'm gonna have to wait for the money to

291
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,578
come back and then I'm gonna have to

292
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,889
keep bleeding it out and I'm gonna watch

293
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:41,679
it deteriorate over time because it's

294
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:43,568
going to change you can oxidize so we

295
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,120
don't have this multi-year shelf-life

296
00:10:43,568 --> 00:10:47,828
we're not making concrete block so I

297
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,149
can't just put the Block in the yard and

298
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:51,370
wait until next year when the building

299
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,500
projects jump up if I don't move it it

300
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,990
dipped airier rates and if your label is

301
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,938
on it you look bad because it looks like

302
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,318
you can't grow a good pot and so when my

303
00:10:57,938 --> 00:11:00,818
friends are doing all this am a little

304
00:10:59,318 --> 00:11:02,740
bit work for me in LA I got these older

305
00:11:00,818 --> 00:11:05,378
guys I hang out with in LA that are that

306
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:07,930
are wealthy older dudes and they have

307
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:10,028
time which which wealth gives you and

308
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:12,638
they love to smoke so they go and check

309
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:15,429
out samples of every dispensary there is

310
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,528
they go and look at everything and buy

311
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:18,818
weed constantly and smoking and all the

312
00:11:17,528 --> 00:11:22,509
group of older smokers who are all

313
00:11:18,818 --> 00:11:24,250
affluent a very rare group rare but

314
00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:25,720
because of it it lets me say hey they're

315
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,519
unhappy with everything they touch and

316
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:29,889
so the thing is that that's not build a

317
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,959
brand value you know building brand

318
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:34,120
value you built a brand value when

319
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:37,239
you're in an indoor model in Los Angeles

320
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,039
and you have a supply line that lets you

321
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,649
function because you're in some very

322
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:44,318
trendy spots but how much did it cost to

323
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:45,970
build that facility how long's it going

324
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:48,128
to take you to recover that investment

325
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,019
value how much you actually making as

326
00:11:48,129 --> 00:11:53,079
the operator with investors in the room

327
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:55,659
so yeah you have a piece of equity and a

328
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:57,489
paycheck but the perception that

329
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:59,169
everybody's wealthy here is not true and

330
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,600
the investors are waiting to get paid

331
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:03,159
and most of the operations that I see

332
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,709
that are major on their second or third

333
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:07,120
cultivate or second of third CEO and the

334
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,948
investors are like holy Christ I could

335
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,198
let out ten million already now I gotta

336
00:12:08,948 --> 00:12:13,208
bleed more because they're in the same

337
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:14,859
situation that Ben's a great example

338
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:16,328
I couldn't have more capital even flow

339
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,709
can hundred twenty five million they

340
00:12:16,328 --> 00:12:20,289
raise they're losing a million and a

341
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:21,278
half the month so they're losing a

342
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:22,528
million and a half the more they're not

343
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:24,269
making money

344
00:12:22,528 --> 00:12:25,588
in there there their earnings were great

345
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:27,629
this month yeah a million and a half

346
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:29,219
still under what they should be so any

347
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:31,499
other business in home economy would

348
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:33,329
collapse but because they're so well

349
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:36,509
funded they play the game and ride it

350
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:39,328
out but the bottom line is is that the

351
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:42,449
modeling you're in and I'm not in that

352
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:44,758
model I was I wanted to be I wanted to

353
00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:46,769
be in the 10,000 square foot model I had

354
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:48,989
I got 18,000 a little under half acre

355
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:51,899
for my cap but I want to shrink it down

356
00:12:48,989 --> 00:12:53,189
to ten over the next couple years so

357
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:55,379
that I could just be in that Kraft

358
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:57,448
designation I could have something that

359
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:59,639
I produce that was of a really nice

360
00:12:57,448 --> 00:13:02,158
quality that's shined on my property and

361
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:04,408
I'd be able to overtime push it into

362
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:06,749
this US market because our region would

363
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:08,999
allow it to take place and then it would

364
00:13:06,749 --> 00:13:10,709
it would be a decent income for the farm

365
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:12,689
but it would just be an income it would

366
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:14,488
pay for the farm basically I never

367
00:13:12,688 --> 00:13:17,278
intended to be able to just grow again

368
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:18,809
ever once I once I looked at the future

369
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:20,129
I said none of us I'll ever be able to

370
00:13:18,808 --> 00:13:22,858
do what we did we'll never be able to

371
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:25,709
grow a couple hours a day five hours a

372
00:13:22,859 --> 00:13:28,918
day and have great money and application

373
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:32,008
that's done you're far enough you pour

374
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:33,448
and you're going to struggle and you get

375
00:13:32,009 --> 00:13:35,548
used to it and so you better build

376
00:13:33,448 --> 00:13:39,118
multiple income streams or you're going

377
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:41,578
to go bankrupt and that's terrifying and

378
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:43,109
it's as real as it can be and so for me

379
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:44,758
and then I built as many things as I

380
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:47,038
could build and I'm trying to push as

381
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:49,288
far ahead as I can with every tool I can

382
00:13:47,038 --> 00:13:51,958
the only thing I'm not doing is trying

383
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:53,698
to screw anybody but I'm trying to take

384
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,798
every advantage I can if it's science

385
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:58,108
I'm going to use it if it's common sense

386
00:13:55,798 --> 00:14:00,418
I'm going to use it and when I lay down

387
00:13:58,109 --> 00:14:01,499
the numbers on a piece of paper and I

388
00:14:00,418 --> 00:14:04,489
take a look at it like I'm going to

389
00:14:01,499 --> 00:14:08,220
continent it says there's no money here

390
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:09,989
it is wishful thinking and so I think

391
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,570
the farmers and cultivators you know if

392
00:14:09,989 --> 00:14:14,509
you're in a situation where you

393
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:16,640
a good relationship with some stores and

394
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:18,470
you have convenient processing and

395
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,059
you're able to you know churn a decent

396
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,710
paycheck then you know you go go forward

397
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:24,439
just make sure your product is you

398
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:26,120
clearly understand look at what the

399
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,650
nurseries are selling go take a look at

400
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:30,080
everything nursery online take a look at

401
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:32,090
their catalogs try to get out of those

402
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,370
products because every major

403
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:36,139
manufacturer is using those nurseries

404
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,750
for their products so therefore you're

405
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:40,580
going to see a million pounds of purple

406
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,470
punch you know and it's some of the

407
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,000
vessel I just knocked it because it's

408
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,560
it's so beautiful

409
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,769
it couldn't be any prettier in your hand

410
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:50,479
but it doesn't have a secondary buy so

411
00:14:48,769 --> 00:14:51,980
there's a lot of products like this and

412
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,480
I just use that one as an example

413
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,620
because it's gorgeous but people don't

414
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,139
want to buy it but because everybody

415
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:59,330
knows it's hot it got over produced and

416
00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:01,669
then now it's in your it's in your

417
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,960
arsenal and it's on the shelf it doesn't

418
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:04,939
mean that people want to consume in it

419
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:06,440
just me that's what's there you need

420
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,930
things that when they consume it they

421
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,690
want to consume it again and you need to

422
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:14,419
be able to find who you're selling it to

423
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:16,250
whose the distributor what stores that

424
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:17,449
they sell to the farmer then has to go

425
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,340
to those stores and make the

426
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,930
relationships at the stores know who you

427
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,790
are so they know that your products good

428
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:24,079
you can bring it out with you and smoke

429
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,339
to join with them and say look that's

430
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,660
what I'm selling this is what's there

431
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,670
that's illegal

432
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:30,409
otherwise to rely on all these other

433
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:31,610
people to do the business for you and

434
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:33,620
you're putting yourself at this

435
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,000
incredible vulnerability hoping and

436
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,929
praying that all your pots going to go

437
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,090
and then you're going to end up having

438
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:39,199
to backdoor it and I don't fault you for

439
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:39,680
that either because that's where I came

440
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,350
from

441
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:45,799
so I would I would never afford anybody

442
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:48,230
for trying to survive it's just that god

443
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:50,479
help you you get caught and they take

444
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:53,450
your license because now your property

445
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,860
is no longer licensable like you have a

446
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,900
problem now you're gonna have to go

447
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,940
explain to the BC say hey I know you

448
00:15:56,899 --> 00:16:00,529
caught me selling out the back door but

449
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,550
I want my property to get licensed and

450
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:14,798
I'll just say that we don't want

451
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:14,798
