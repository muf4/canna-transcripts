1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:12,689
[Music]

2
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:29,419
focused on compliance ish sending things

3
00:00:26,469 --> 00:00:30,678
one of my bigger concerns has been the

4
00:00:29,419 --> 00:00:33,619
way people are paying their employees

5
00:00:30,678 --> 00:00:35,479
and documenting that so waging our

6
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:37,609
compliance our people classify his

7
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:39,378
employees versus independent contractors

8
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:41,600
correctly

9
00:00:39,378 --> 00:00:43,399
oftentimes in this industry people are

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,198
labeled as independent contractors or

11
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:48,198
even volunteers when they're really

12
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:51,229
employees so it's been a big hot button

13
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:54,259
issue categorizing employees accurately

14
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:57,409
so can you talk about what you're seeing

15
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:59,750
in the cannabis industry yeah I think it

16
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:02,448
is well I don't think I know it is

17
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:05,180
largely driven by the banking problem

18
00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:07,819
and historically these companies not

19
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,440
being able to run a traditional payroll

20
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:13,279
because they didn't have a banking

21
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:15,769
relationship and a misunderstanding that

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,230
you can't pay employees and cash what

23
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:19,879
you can it's just not done in a

24
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:25,070
traditional business because it's just

25
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:26,479
complicated messy and cumbersome but as

26
00:01:25,069 --> 00:01:28,909
a result of that there was sort of a

27
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:32,120
default to callin people all sorts of

28
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:36,409
things as I mentioned volunteers or paid

29
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:38,630
interns or independent contractors when

30
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:43,369
really the individual was an employee

31
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:45,199
and California law had been a little bit

32
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:47,450
more complicated in years past but more

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,120
recently there was a decision that came

34
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,070
down that simplified it and if you're

35
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,530
controlling the means and manner in

36
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:56,539
which people are doing your work if

37
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,560
they're working on the core business

38
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,240
that you're in

39
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,649
you're a grower of throwing if you're a

40
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:03,228
manufacturer if they're on the floor

41
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:05,599
making products if you're a dispensary

42
00:02:03,228 --> 00:02:07,789
if they're selling products if they're

43
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:11,030
doing your core business and if they

44
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:12,830
don't have a job outside of yours by and

45
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,390
large they are your employees so they

46
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,280
should be treated like employees and

47
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:17,329
really to the point of why labor and

48
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,280
employment lawyers would ever get

49
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,530
involved they need to be paid like

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,900
employees because if you don't pay an

51
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:27,318
employee like an employee all sorts of

52
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,730
really bad things start to happen you

53
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:30,469
may not be tracking their hours

54
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:32,988
correctly or you may not be at least

55
00:02:30,469 --> 00:02:35,509
documenting them you may not be paying

56
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:37,640
them for overtime either eight in a day

57
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:39,889
or 40 in a week you're just paying them

58
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:42,318
some sort of a lump sum per week as an

59
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:44,509
independent contractor that could create

60
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:47,149
liability for not paying all hours or

61
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:49,699
not paying overtime you may not be

62
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:52,159
giving them meal periods or rest breaks

63
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:54,199
or if you are you may not be documenting

64
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,810
that they're doing that again this opens

65
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:58,219
you up to liability and I hate to be the

66
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,019
bearer of bad news but people actually

67
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:01,459
don't tell the truth sometimes and they

68
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:02,810
will stretch the truth when they want to

69
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:04,489
get money out of the business and

70
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,469
they'll say I'm not getting my new

71
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:09,019
period or I'm working off the clock or

72
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:10,129
I'm not being paid off my overtime and

73
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:11,719
if you dream them like an independent

74
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:13,159
contract or you don't have all these

75
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:15,590
documents that you know they would have

76
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,900
for an employee you're sort of left

77
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,250
there saying well yeah but and then of

78
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,730
course going to look at you and say well

79
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,219
prove

80
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:25,429
imitation so those are some of the

81
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:28,430
things that grow a lot of not treating

82
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:32,400
employees like employees and if you have

83
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:34,830
unpaid time or unpaid or underpaid time

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,530
or overtime or people are not getting

85
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:40,500
their meal periods of the rest breaks

86
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:42,390
and you're not giving them an itemized

87
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,650
wage statement that sort of lists all of

88
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,048
the things that are supposed to be out

89
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,909
there these pencil the penalties start

90
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:49,620
mounting under the California Labor Code

91
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:52,680
they get really expensive and it's not

92
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,530
unusual for me to speak to somebody and

93
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,950
say oh we do all this a person $800 in

94
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:01,229
overtime and $6,000 in penalties plus

95
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:05,068
their attorneys fees and people are sort

96
00:04:01,229 --> 00:04:08,128
of shocked to learn that an $800 wage

97
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:10,738
claim can turn into a $15,000 wage claim

98
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:13,048
downtown at that the labor board but it

99
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,700
happens so these are really these can be

100
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:17,280
business killers and you've seen this

101
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:20,788
play out in cannabis businesses yes okay

102
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,589
yep yep without naming companies can't

103
00:04:20,788 --> 00:04:24,478
can you give me an exploit you just

104
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:27,329
mentioned was that an actual case like

105
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,649
it was 800 it turned into 15,000 not in

106
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:30,449
the cannabis space but we've seen

107
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:32,819
something along those lines we've also

108
00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:35,459
seen people that were classified as

109
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:37,829
independent contractors going to the

110
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:39,629
labor board and saying hey I wasn't paid

111
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:41,788
correctly and then go into other state

112
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:44,459
agencies in making claims of

113
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:46,860
discrimination or harassment and the

114
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:49,288
first threshold for those agencies are

115
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,580
going to be well are you employed or not

116
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:52,379
because if you're an independent

117
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:53,728
contractor you're not given some of the

118
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:56,009
same rights that you are if you're an

119
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:57,389
employee and the first thing that those

120
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:58,918
individuals need to do is pierce through

121
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:01,079
that sort of definition or

122
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:03,478
classification and convince the

123
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,918
administrative law judge or a judge that

124
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:07,348
hey I'm not an independent contractor

125
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,299
I'm an employee and because of that I'm

126
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:11,909
protected from discrimination or I'm

127
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,400
overtime wages and they also have a very

128
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,760
difficult

129
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:19,029
job for the candidates employer to

130
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,709
overcome so as an example it's expected

131
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:22,888
that I show up at nine and stay till

132
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:25,870
5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday

133
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:28,689
which is sort of a baseline definition

134
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,430
of independent contractors have choice

135
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:33,610
of one and how and where they get the

136
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:36,009
work done employees are expected to you

137
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,680
know on a set schedule be there and do

138
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:40,360
the work yeah so that's a tradition a

139
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,090
traditional sort of consideration and

140
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,770
there used to be a long list of things

141
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:47,469
that courts would look at and really

142
00:05:44,769 --> 00:05:49,269
grows out of the IRS is definitions of

143
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,370
independent contractors versus employees

144
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:53,439
and a number of cases I sort of adopted

145
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:55,930
them but as I mentioned that the

146
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,600
California courts really simplified

147
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:02,019
things maybe six months ago beginning

148
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,789
part of 2018 and made it much more

149
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:05,319
difficult to treat somebody as an

150
00:06:03,788 --> 00:06:06,909
independent contractor whereas before

151
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:09,099
you would look at hours of work and

152
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,660
equipment used and all of these other

153
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,740
things it's not three factors they call

154
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:16,120
it the ABC test this is that individual

155
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:17,319
are you controlling the means in the

156
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,750
manner in which the individual is doing

157
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:21,300
their job are they performing your core

158
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:23,620
business and do they have an independent

159
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,280
business outside of what they do for you

160
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,840
and if those things aren't being met

161
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,549
they're unemployed it's just that simple

162
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:31,929
so what you were describing where nine

163
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,449
to five you're telling them when to show

164
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:36,519
up where to go to work I do their job

165
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:38,680
that's all you know that that's a

166
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:40,509
quacking duck that that duck is employed

167
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,720
on anything contract workers comp is

168
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:45,430
something that we're increasingly seeing

169
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,560
questions come on I'm not a worker's

170
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:51,220
comp expert but I will I will tell

171
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,228
people in the industry that are confused

172
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,780
that there are workers comp policies

173
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:58,180
that they over for their employees it's

174
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:59,829
mandated that any employer in California

175
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,110
have those they need to have them in

176
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:05,529
place if they don't the penalties are

177
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,848
pretty onerous and again this goes to

178
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:07,869
training your managers or the people

179
00:07:06,848 --> 00:07:09,360
that are sort of at the front line

180
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,370
dealing with the data

181
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,169
alignment issues if somebody comes

182
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:15,240
forward and reports an injury at work

183
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:18,060
you have to take some steps immediately

184
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,800
to preserve certain rights and it's also

185
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,269
the right thing to do but there's

186
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,430
there's a form you need to give to the

187
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:26,008
individual to allow them to make a claim

188
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,918
to identify what the injury is and get

189
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:30,810
them into that process if somebody's not

190
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:32,758
carrying workers comp whether or not to

191
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,468
buy that notice of rights and they're

192
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,020
allowing injured workers to continue to

193
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:39,329
work there's some serious liability that

194
00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:41,399
can that can flow from that and then

195
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:42,839
sort of anecdotally we sort of are

196
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:45,239
interested to watch around the country

197
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:47,878
how certain judges nobody in California

198
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,009
have actually ordered workers comp

199
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:53,158
carriers to pay for marijuana as a

200
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:55,889
treatment for certain injuries so that's

201
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:57,658
something many of our carrier clients

202
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,848
are watching very closely to see if

203
00:07:57,658 --> 00:08:01,528
that's going to explain how to price the

204
00:07:59,848 --> 00:08:03,149
risk and what's going to be available

205
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:05,069
for employees but then also how to

206
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,959
administer it because if you're a

207
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:09,270
worker's comp carrier if you can imagine

208
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,399
you getting premium dollars in you're

209
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:12,750
paying benefits out and somebody says I

210
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,418
want you to pay for some sort of a

211
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:18,810
cannabis derived product for pain

212
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:20,519
medication or something else like what's

213
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,810
the logistics for actually pay for that

214
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:23,878
medicine or are insurance companies

215
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,129
gonna start handing dollars directly to

216
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,408
dispensaries or should they get them to

217
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:31,620
the individuals and the concern there

218
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:33,299
becomes are we effectively engaging in

219
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,879
something that's unlawful by providing

220
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:37,109
money to a claimant knowing that they're

221
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:40,078
going to go use it to buy something

222
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:43,168
that's vitally illegal so it's a bit of

223
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:46,250
a there's a maturation that's happening

224
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:48,569
very quickly tonight I don't know

225
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,610
precisely what it's borne up but I do

226
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:53,459
know that there are people coming from

227
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:55,289
other industries into cannabis that sort

228
00:08:53,458 --> 00:08:57,229
of encounter it outside of the lawyers

229
00:08:55,289 --> 00:08:59,599
on on the ground inside of a

230
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:01,949
manufacturing warehouse I'm saying like

231
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,680
what is this we can't do business like

232
00:09:01,948 --> 00:09:07,528
that which is great there's been

233
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,789
insurance so insurance products come in

234
00:09:07,528 --> 00:09:10,470
and they underwrite and they're

235
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:12,719
identifying some of these things and

236
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,370
saying we can't write insurance unless

237
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,278
you

238
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,889
improve certain things and then folks

239
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:20,169
like myself have become more active and

240
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:22,850
interfacing with the industry and

241
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:25,309
educating them and teaching them all of

242
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:28,220
these sort of things are quickly moving

243
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:31,969
and pushing the industry along to the

244
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:35,480
point where you are getting more formal

245
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:37,180
processes for hiring people people being

246
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,789
reclassified and put into their right

247
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:43,759
classifications people being able to

248
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:45,079
sort of identify a phony termination and

249
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,059
pick up the phone and call somebody like

250
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:50,870
myself before they pull the trigger on

251
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:53,778
it so it's gotten better but but overall

252
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,129
I would say it is no different than

253
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:57,379
anything else it's not because it's the

254
00:09:55,129 --> 00:09:58,909
cannabis industry entirely it's just

255
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:01,879
because it's a new industry a lot of the

256
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:03,469
operators tend to be younger or less

257
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:05,360
experienced or at least they were when

258
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,990
they started first time operators

259
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,820
exactly exactly that they just need to

260
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:13,310
have a focus to those and I the other

261
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:17,450
part of it they that I didn't mention a

262
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:19,719
minute ago is for the last three years

263
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:23,440
the focus has been on regulatory reform

264
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:26,450
having licensing regulations in place

265
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,400
doing what's required to get the license

266
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:30,050
in place and now in a state like

267
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,899
California there's probably a lifecycle

268
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:34,429
like this in every state now that more

269
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,230
and more businesses are sort of over the

270
00:10:34,429 --> 00:10:38,870
hump on getting that license and they're

271
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,339
turning to running their business these

272
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:43,429
things are now getting more attention

273
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:45,770
because they just can't so I would

274
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:47,689
encourage those businesses that are

275
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:50,509
either taking in some private equity

276
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,910
money or doing fundraising or just

277
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:55,189
coming out of the licensing phase and

278
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:56,990
going back to doing their business if

279
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,580
you want to be successful in the long

280
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,990
haul and you want to be attractive to

281
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,360
investors who are going to be able to

282
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:05,600
make investments in your company so that

283
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,600
you can grow be able to demonstrate that

284
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,060
you have solid onboarding processes that

285
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,879
you've got some policies and procedures

286
00:11:11,059 --> 00:11:14,208
in place and that you train to them you

287
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,649
take

288
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,178
serious it's not just a handbook that

289
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:19,999
Dean Rocco gives you and you throw it in

290
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:22,399
a file somewhere and as you go forward

291
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:24,079
and you manage your employees you do so

292
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,089
in a wise way and if you sort of

293
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:28,008
identify that there's some thorny issues

294
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:29,480
you know work with an HR consultant that

295
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:32,509
you can trust or an employment lawyer

296
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,188
like myself and figure out sort of what

297
00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:35,449
the risk management would be as you go

298
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:39,730
through those then you don't have to

299
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:39,729
look over your shoulder too much as you

300
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:52,099
