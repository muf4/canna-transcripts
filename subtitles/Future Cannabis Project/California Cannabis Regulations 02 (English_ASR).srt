2
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:12,150
what happened last Friday just to ruin

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,519
all of our weekends is that the

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,920
Department of Public Health clarified to

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:20,490
somebody that in the new regulations

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:24,600
when they said that the universal symbol

7
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:26,429
has to be printed on if the packaging is

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,410
separate it's a separable from the outer

9
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:30,170
packaging the universal symbol has to be

10
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:34,259
printed on inhalable products

11
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:36,929
parenthetical shatter dab wax things

12
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:38,609
like that so we all went sure okay that

13
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:40,350
makes sense because you we're gonna

14
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:42,659
print it on the little container that's

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,480
holding the shutter dab wax inside of a

16
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:48,619
box got it get it good everybody's doing

17
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:51,869
it and then they said oh no no we meant

18
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:55,979
then it needs to be printed as well on

19
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:59,488
vaporizer cartridges on the vaporizer

20
00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:04,368
cartridge itself calling the cartridge

21
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:06,899
the package of the oil not the thing and

22
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:09,450
many of these guys have already heard my

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,070
rant about the use of an Oxford comma in

24
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,930
the regulations which is in the

25
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:14,789
regulations it says cannabis

26
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,900
concentrates you know suppositories

27
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,229
capsules whatever vape cartridges comma

28
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:23,969
inhalable products a parenthetical

29
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:25,170
shattered a blacks and when they put it

30
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:27,478
in that second part in the regs they

31
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,950
didn't put tape cartridges comma in

32
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:30,959
Haleyville products shattered ad wax

33
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,290
they just put inhalable products

34
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,658
shattered a black and so the argument

35
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,700
happening now is that might be what you

36
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,829
mean but Department of Public Health

37
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,618
that is not what you said and we're

38
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:45,209
trying so hard to read and understand in

39
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:48,599
the English language in the use of

40
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:51,328
commas and all of these things I guess

41
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:53,609
so Julie's get the comma woman and I

42
00:01:51,328 --> 00:01:57,048
love it because I use that argument in

43
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:59,879
our letter and then my argument is that

44
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:05,100
there is a difference between a product

45
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:07,739
and a container of that product I cannot

46
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:08,909
use the oil that is in the pen without

47
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:10,240
the vape car

48
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:14,229
I cannot and

49
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:17,170
the BCC tells me I cannot bulk oil test

50
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:20,679
the oil before it goes in to the vapor

51
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:24,969
cart I must test what the final form of

52
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:27,819
the product so unless the product is

53
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:29,949
both oil and then the container is the

54
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:32,799
vape pen cart which is not at all the

55
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:35,319
way that it is set up in the regulations

56
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,520
then there is no way that that vape pen

57
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:41,799
cart is deemed to be a container and if

58
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,689
I'm gonna get out my crystal ball I'm

59
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,850
just gonna tell you guys yeah that's

60
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:47,650
where it's going yes we're gonna have to

61
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:49,389
put universal symbols on cartridges I

62
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,849
have no doubt they're gonna bring back

63
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:53,739
the little stamp maker is gonna lobby to

64
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:55,199
put the stamps back on the edibles so

65
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,520
you know the difference between a

66
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,530
cannabis chocolate and another chocolate

67
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,570
we're gonna go all the way down the

68
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,490
rabbit hole because especially since if

69
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:05,590
people in Laguna Beach are getting see

70
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,510
ups to open a CBD store and they're

71
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,129
gonna sell vapes guess what your law

72
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:12,219
enforcement is gonna want to know on

73
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:14,019
visual perception is that a CBD vapor is

74
00:03:12,219 --> 00:03:18,219
that a THC vape because now we're

75
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:23,080
starting to fork into CBD good THC bad

76
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:25,629
this is what's happening in the THC

77
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,670
stores but the CBD stores they can just

78
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:30,189
go wherever they want does it matter

79
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:32,709
that they're selling real CBD or snake

80
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:34,840
oil to people that they never mind but

81
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,780
you just go right ahead with the FDA

82
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,370
says that you can't have CBD and food

83
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,849
products but that doesn't seem to matter

84
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,680
in the city of LA where the DCR stay in

85
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:46,989
your lanes sometimes is something I like

86
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,200
to say issued guidance that you should

87
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,939
as a CBD business register so that you

88
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:54,009
can pay the taxes to the great city of

89
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:57,280
Los Angeles what but put yourself on

90
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:58,870
notice ya know this makes sense to me

91
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,000
because it's like okay at a certain

92
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:03,340
point in time you have to know as a

93
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,370
regulator or as a business owner or

94
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,229
whoever is that you start just a rabbit

95
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,270
hole issue here it's like okay so you

96
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:12,889
want to stamp the cartridge with the

97
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:15,409
cannabis warning label and

98
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:17,599
and so people just get covers for them

99
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:21,259
and then we just create another industry

100
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,150
of a cart covers and like you know how

101
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:25,819
easy it is to take a sticker up a glass

102
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:28,750
cartridge yeah and you know just put a

103
00:04:25,819 --> 00:04:31,129
like a slip on over it it's like

104
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:33,980
everything the thing is is that people

105
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:35,810
are gonna use cannabis and people are

106
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,450
going to buy cannabis and people are

107
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,149
going to sell cannabis and so why are we

108
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:43,849
getting caught up in this is not even

109
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:46,719
all of it from the CD pH and the BCC and

110
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:49,879
the DCR there's more information and it

111
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,440
it just creates this where the industry

112
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,600
that is growing the fastest isn't the

113
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:56,810
cannabis industry it's the cannabis

114
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,629
regulation industry and now we went from

115
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,579
a state that did not embrace it to the

116
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:04,759
extent that they should had even though

117
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:07,339
we are the largest producer and now

118
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,839
they're seeing the tax dollar revenues

119
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:11,029
from this and I'm gonna be honest with

120
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:15,349
you on the political side of all of this

121
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:19,069
stuff is there is neither party is after

122
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:21,770
our true like goal here and that when

123
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:23,509
politics get involved it just means that

124
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:26,060
more money goes to bureaucracy in this

125
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:28,459
right now and you know I was excited to

126
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:30,530
see some big wins this year and I know

127
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:32,779
at a moment's notice we could find out

128
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:35,569
that cannabis you know the president

129
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:38,359
said that cannabis is fine now because I

130
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:42,199
mean we here rent more ridiculous stuff

131
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:45,110
every day every day and so you live in a

132
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,449
very volatile industry but that's also

133
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,810
why a lot of us are in it like we can do

134
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:54,379
redundancy other than our records any

135
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,970
other thing back to the inconsistency in

136
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:59,418
the regulations with the vape pen issue

137
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:02,360
is that also there was no reconciliation

138
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:05,060
of the size or the color if you're gonna

139
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,919
put it on a vape pen write that half an

140
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,139
inch by half an inch if you want to look

141
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:11,359
to where gph says well organ does it

142
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:13,490
working gave a very specific I would

143
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,129
dare say one of the best visual guidance

144
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,829
about what they want their packaging and

145
00:06:16,129 --> 00:06:20,360
labeling and they downsize this the the

146
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:23,538
sticker that they would put on a vape

147
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,040
pen cart because it was smaller and DPH

148
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:26,419
has no way

149
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,340
to say that they don't know what is

150
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:30,680
currently happening in this industry

151
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:32,449
they have been to manufacturers they

152
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,220
have been to dispensaries I have sent

153
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:37,610
them pictures on behalf of my clients of

154
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,020
their products to clearer compliance so

155
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,750
when we talk about the inconsistencies

156
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:43,969
in the regulations into Julie's point no

157
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,879
this is where we're gonna end up what

158
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,800
we're fighting over today is the grace

159
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,810
period is the amount of time that it

160
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,490
will take to ensure that they're one of

161
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:55,189
the largest growing segments of this

162
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,230
industry isn't shut out that all the

163
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:59,389
sudden consumers don't get vape pens

164
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:02,540
because there is no access to the vape

165
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:04,819
pen market because no kimono vape pen on

166
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,129
the market today in this state is

167
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:10,250
compliant because we didn't know the

168
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:12,529
intention of of DPH so that's really I

169
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,079
think an important to note when you're

170
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:17,779
looking at this issue is where we're

171
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:20,359
going where we are and why we have to

172
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:23,509
continually fight and on a united front

173
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,120
be consistent in our messaging as an

174
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:28,129
industry because as Brett said you know

175
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,379
the political powers are not there to

176
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:32,240
help us and if we as an industry are so

177
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:35,719
fractured that we're fighting one

178
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,189
another and on some issues some parts of

179
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,660
the industry or aligning with law

180
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:42,469
enforcement and League of Cities and

181
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:46,250
then others are not we we look weaker as

182
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:48,830
the whole and I can't ever say it enough

183
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:50,810
high tides raise all ships and if we

184
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:53,689
want everybody in this industry to

185
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,610
succeed then we have to be kind to one

186
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:57,920
another and not be throwing one another

187
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,560
under the bus when there is more than

188
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,350
enough problems that we can share in

189
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,519
yeah and it is it is important to

190
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:09,530
because we are like you're saying that

191
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:11,389
one of my favorite recent stories is I

192
00:08:09,529 --> 00:08:13,459
don't know if you guys know Cody bass up

193
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:16,669
in South Lake Tahoe who runs a

194
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:19,459
dispensary and recently got elected to

195
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:21,470
his City Council so that's the kind of

196
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:23,479
change when stuff gets interesting is

197
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,150
rather than just say oh I don't know the

198
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:28,939
politicians aren't on our side we can be

199
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:31,729
the politicians that's when the

200
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:33,590
interesting change starts to happen we

201
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:36,379
can show up at the city council meetings

202
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,240
we can show up at the town halls we can

203
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:40,399
take the seats on those advisor

204
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,649
councils and that is how we affect

205
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,849
change is not by sitting around and

206
00:08:42,649 --> 00:08:45,620
complaining and watching what's

207
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:48,970
happening and having it at be something

208
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:51,769
that's happening to us this is a living

209
00:08:48,970 --> 00:09:00,709
evolutionary process that we are part of

210
00:08:51,769 --> 00:09:02,539
and we can change it does anybody have

211
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:06,139
any other regulatory questions when I

212
00:09:02,539 --> 00:09:07,819
gave you a very high level I love her

213
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:09,319
statement here and what she's saying is

214
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,089
something that I harp on all the time

215
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,860
and Pamela you were just discussing here

216
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:15,770
is that like if you see another company

217
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:19,100
that's making a competing product like

218
00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:21,649
no they're not there's enough space for

219
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,509
all of us here everybody has a space in

220
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:26,480
cannabis right now as long as you know

221
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:29,059
you do it within compliance and and it

222
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,580
drives me nuts to see this this breaking

223
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:33,229
each other down and putting each other's

224
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,970
business all out there when everybody

225
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,980
has business everybody's trying to do

226
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,060
their their best and which is

227
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,889
frustrating because we know that they

228
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:42,139
could come back on any of us in five

229
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:45,528
years and say oh well you weren't doing

230
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:46,789
it back then so I appreciate you saying

231
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:48,230
that cuz we do yeah we all need to work

232
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:51,049
together and that's something I say a

233
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:54,889
lot as well nobody in the cannabis space

234
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:57,708
is your enemy is your competition they

235
00:09:54,889 --> 00:10:00,708
are all your allies the fight that we

236
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:03,259
have right now is if the people who

237
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:06,129
built the cannabis industry and are from

238
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:09,620
the industry get to participate at all

239
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:13,309
like my admite perception of the enemy

240
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:15,500
is Pfizer is the enemy it's who gets to

241
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:18,469
do this and that's what we're fighting

242
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:22,009
for that my understanding of prop 64 a

243
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:25,120
deeply imperfect regulatory document was

244
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:28,009
because people were ready to

245
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,320
decriminalize cannabis activity they

246
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:33,049
were ready for social justice and they

247
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,850
wanted to preserve access and those are

248
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:38,059
the things that we are having to fight

249
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:40,879
the hardest for is for those core

250
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:44,389
principles to still be a part of this

251
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:47,620
while everybody's gone into the opposite

252
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:51,949
reefer madness of like corporate money

253
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:54,320
insanity of like how do I race fastest

254
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,329
to burn down all the houses around me so

255
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:59,420
that I can be the first unicorn in the

256
00:10:56,328 --> 00:11:02,028
cannabis space you know and I say all

257
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:04,129
the time I the thing that gets me out of

258
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:07,820
bed in the morning I have so little

259
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:10,669
interest in one guy making a billion

260
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:13,430
dollars in cannabis I have a hell of a

261
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:17,870
lot of interest in thousands of people

262
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:20,778
making having well-paying highly skilled

263
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:24,169
technical jobs lab technicians growers

264
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:26,990
transporters manufacturers reintroducing

265
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:29,629
a viable middle class to American

266
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,250
economy that's interesting to me that

267
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:33,559
gets me out of bed in the morning

268
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,698
because 20 years ago I could live in New

269
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:38,028
York City and work at a bookstore

270
00:11:34,698 --> 00:11:41,539
part-time be an artist and that was that

271
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:44,088
reality that economic reality has been

272
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:48,588
eviscerated from the face of our planet

273
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:51,050
you know that we this is what i view the

274
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:54,500
cannabis industry as is an opportunity

275
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:57,828
to restabilized the economy in these

276
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:00,828
much-needed ways in to treat like the

277
00:11:57,828 --> 00:12:05,059
pain in the suffering the economic pain

278
00:12:00,828 --> 00:12:08,509
the classist pain the racist pain of a

279
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:12,169
nation that was built on suffering and

280
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:16,009
exploitation and we are standing at the

281
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:19,698
crossroads being like ok so it is this

282
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:21,889
gonna be like a cure in a treatment for

283
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:24,919
this suffering of where we came from or

284
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:27,230
is it gonna be the next corporate

285
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:29,509
bullshit that's gonna go the same way as

286
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,250
everything else and continue to add to

287
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:39,559
the suffering of the world and this is

288
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:41,028
the choice that we have to make I think

289
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:44,899
we get to have dinner soon or something

290
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:47,059
right let's do that are there more

291
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:48,379
questions yeah I definitely agree to

292
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:50,028
that I was like our enemies are so many

293
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:52,429
different things but oftentimes our

294
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:55,129
enemies are just is purely judgment

295
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:56,448
judgment of other people's life actions

296
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:59,269
here and it doesn't have to do with its

297
00:12:56,448 --> 00:13:01,669
cannabis or any other thing like that is

298
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:03,089
that humans we need to do a lot better

299
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:05,278
job of not

300
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:07,429
giving a shit what our neighbor is doing

301
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:10,499
as long as they're not hurting anybody

302
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:12,448
then at a certain point in time where

303
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:16,408
we're losing our middle-class economy

304
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:18,598
we're losing our our education all these

305
00:13:16,408 --> 00:13:20,788
different areas is being cycled back

306
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:22,259
into just because it's highly regulated

307
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:24,149
the things that we have to do we're

308
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,649
spending tax money and areas that we

309
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:27,509
didn't think we were being taxed you

310
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:29,038
know they say that here in the US we

311
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:31,288
don't we have cheaper taxes and we have

312
00:13:29,038 --> 00:13:33,119
cheap ourselves like no you pay for it

313
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:34,348
it's in the price of things it's just

314
00:13:33,119 --> 00:13:36,149
going to pay for all these other

315
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:39,719
regulations that take to get you there

316
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:41,489
and we've got to support the consumer I

317
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:44,039
think the consumers the person in the

318
00:13:41,489 --> 00:13:47,369
room they legitimately is the most

319
00:13:44,038 --> 00:13:50,158
marginalized I if you go into a store

320
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:53,759
just to buy an eighth of cannabis it is

321
00:13:50,158 --> 00:13:56,729
upwards of $90 $90 a week

322
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,678
cannabis is taxed at 30 to 50 percent it

323
00:13:56,729 --> 00:14:01,679
is one of the highest tax commodities

324
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:03,988
that there is and higher than cigarettes

325
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:06,418
and alcohol which kill you by the way

326
00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:08,369
and cannabis does not that this is

327
00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:10,438
legitimately medicine for some people

328
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:14,129
that they cannot get and they cannot

329
00:14:10,438 --> 00:14:15,988
afford got vicodin and a hydrate or

330
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:17,999
vicodin and opiates there are five

331
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:20,339
dollars and fourteen cents when you go

332
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:22,019
to the pharmacy so if your medication is

333
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:23,939
five dollars and 14 cents and you'd

334
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:25,558
rather get off of it and get on to

335
00:14:23,938 --> 00:14:29,308
cannabis but your insurance company

336
00:14:25,558 --> 00:14:33,868
won't cover it and it's $90 per 1/8 it's

337
00:14:29,308 --> 00:14:36,988
$100 to get CBD at Lake cannabis CBD AG

338
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:40,729
into one pills are $90 for account of

339
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:43,528
less than 60 it's it's uh it's

340
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:45,179
incorrigible that the industry is out

341
00:14:43,528 --> 00:14:46,798
for this hundred and twenty five million

342
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:49,228
dollar payday that we're bringing in

343
00:14:46,798 --> 00:14:50,759
capital and we're not screaming from the

344
00:14:49,229 --> 00:14:53,099
rooftops that the taxes are too high

345
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:56,009
because there is nobody to sell it to

346
00:14:53,099 --> 00:14:58,919
you if they cannot afford to buy it and

347
00:14:56,009 --> 00:15:01,829
so if you are spending as much time

348
00:14:58,918 --> 00:15:04,739
supporting these legislative efforts

349
00:15:01,828 --> 00:15:07,019
then you will have no market share to

350
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:09,028
speak of because nobody will be able to

351
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:12,028
afford it that's why we've seen the true

352
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:12,639
medical market in cannabis be decimated

353
00:15:12,028 --> 00:15:15,309
I worked with

354
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,500
parents that were already spending $1200

355
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:21,339
a month for their child who has epilepsy

356
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:25,389
and now it's over 3,000 or $3,600 a

357
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:26,920
month when they can find it and it's not

358
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:29,620
the same as it was before

359
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:31,029
and so we've we have lost the medical

360
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,740
market and that's why I got into

361
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:35,079
cannabis like cannabis saved my life I

362
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,269
had epilepsy for years and I haven't had

363
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:42,700
a seizure in four years now because of

364
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:44,590
cannabis and and I forget that at times

365
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,930
like this is why you got into this

366
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:48,820
industry is to help patients and to work

367
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:51,009
with doctors and bringing down stigma

368
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,870
and that is a huge part of what we're

369
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:56,580
still fighting here stigmas going down

370
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:58,570
but at what cost

371
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,900
recreational people can't afford it

372
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:01,450
either

373
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:03,159
and like a medical is so important and I

374
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,259
have migraines so I'm with you bright

375
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:07,419
like I can find my medicine I have

376
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:09,159
clients that I'm able to you know

377
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:11,589
procure product from but that's not

378
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:13,059
everybody's situation clearly but I'm

379
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:15,490
not just talking about medical the

380
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:17,709
medical market is truly suffering but if

381
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:20,259
the recreational market if the adult use

382
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:23,620
market can't afford to pay then the

383
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:25,629
entire system collapses so I sometimes

384
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,399
gets cast in in a way where we're

385
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:29,830
because medical is so important and it's

386
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:32,559
suffering more I want you to understand

387
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:34,840
that if you have no customers the rest

388
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,429
of the supply chain doesn't matter so it

389
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:39,009
is your problem because I have operators

390
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:41,019
that will say or I've heard operators

391
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:43,689
say well that's not really my problem my

392
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:45,549
problem is running my business you have

393
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:47,920
to have a market and we will have a

394
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:50,679
resurgence of the black of the illicit

395
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:54,370
market if we are not careful in

396
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:57,039
protecting the the taxation issue also

397
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:59,440
just you know fun little facts if a city

398
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,959
charges you a tax to operate that is not

399
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,500
then attacks that you assess to the

400
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:08,380
customer that is your tax to operate

401
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:12,940
your business that allows you to make

402
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:15,100
money is I think that's a real important

403
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:17,549
issue that when CDFA comes and starts

404
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:21,159
doing these audits it is actually not

405
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:22,990
lawful to pass on that tax so when you

406
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,040
write a receipt and I have seen this

407
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,500
happen the

408
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:28,720
is a sales and use tax the excise tax

409
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,549
that somehow is applied at the retailer

410
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,680
which its first have already been in the

411
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:36,190
cost of the of the product so you've got

412
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:40,960
sales and use tax excise tax city an

413
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:43,690
additional city tax and then the final

414
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,140
cost that last item that lasts like oh

415
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:49,420
they charge me five dollar five percent

416
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:52,750
gross sales receipts tax that's your

417
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:55,360
company's tax that is not the consumer

418
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,490
tax be forewarned we're gonna see

419
00:17:55,359 --> 00:18:00,279
lawsuits surrounding that either from

420
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:07,299
the public to those operators or fines

421
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:08,879
from CDT FA all right cannabis ninjas we

422
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:14,759

423
