00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,660
now once a good morning to each and

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,640
every one of you to the incredible

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:26,699
organizers the activists the advocates

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,439
the community members the retailers the

6
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,449
distributors the manufacturers the

7
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,820
cultivators to each and every one of you

8
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,488
for bringing this together at this very

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,789
very amazing event now if you were to

10
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:43,259
ask me perhaps 10 years ago that I'd be

11
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:45,390
keynoting an address at the cannabis at

12
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:48,988
a cannabis conference on a haunted ship

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:52,408
I would have asked you to give me some

14
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:54,149
of what you were smoking you know and if

15
00:00:52,408 --> 00:00:56,009
I thought that our former attorney

16
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:57,689
general of the great city of California

17
00:00:56,009 --> 00:00:59,518
would be here also to mr. Bill Lockyer

18
00:00:57,689 --> 00:01:00,838
in the house right over here let's get

19
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:07,049
up for the Attorney General Bill Lockyer

20
00:01:00,838 --> 00:01:08,849
a great businessman himself also to who

21
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:11,459
understands the the incredible benefits

22
00:01:08,849 --> 00:01:13,769
of the cannabis industry for the great

23
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:15,328
city of California in the nation but let

24
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:18,000
me say this we are at a very critical

25
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:20,819
time a very critical moment in our

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,299
nation's history where our essential

27
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:27,298
human and constitutional rights are at

28
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:29,610
stake it's time that we double down on

29
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,469
what we believe that the cannabis

30
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:35,700
industry in California carries the

31
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:39,508
bright green promise of good high wage

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:42,299
paying jobs a boost to our state budget

33
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:45,269
and growth for our local labor

34
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:49,920
organizations right now as we all know

35
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:53,390
as we've known for a very long time the

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,490
federal law puts cannabis on the list of

37
00:01:53,390 --> 00:02:01,349
narcotics right next to heroin as well

38
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:05,069
as cocaine on Schedule one which to me

39
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:08,069
and two I know everybody on this ship

40
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:10,038
right now and everyone across the state

41
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:14,370
of California thinks is utterly

42
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:15,989
ridiculous and observe considering how

43
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,750
many states today have actually

44
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:21,960
legalized cannabis either for medicinal

45
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:26,250
or recreational use and that total today

46
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:28,020
is 29 states across the country as a

47
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,500
result cannabis accounts for more than

48
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,020
half of drug arrests in the United

49
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,590
States now I just want you to let that

50
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:40,380
sink in just for a moment because in

51
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:44,390
2016 alone in 2016 alone there were more

52
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:48,810
than 600,000 people charged with

53
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:50,609
cannabis violations now growing up in

54
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,640
Logan Heights for those who are from San

55
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:56,550
Diego or who live in San Diego I watched

56
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:59,669
the impacts of the United States has

57
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:03,570
failed war on drugs unfold before my

58
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:06,750
very own eyes families torn apart and a

59
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:08,400
promising futures that were cut short as

60
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,610
law enforcement disproportionately

61
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,930
arrested poor people and poor people of

62
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:19,050
color for cannabis crimes my neighbor's

63
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:24,150
my friends even some of my family

64
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:26,670
members our nation's kafka esque federal

65
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,700
laws against us plants or the beginning

66
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:33,059
of an extremely toxic relationship

67
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:35,519
between communities like mine and law

68
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:38,159
enforcement it is time that we put an

69
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,740
end to this unjust practice by electing

70
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,439
real leaders at the federal level who

71
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:51,629
are focused on D scheduling cannabis as

72
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:54,599
we know it today and if you want and if

73
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:56,310
we do want a government that will truly

74
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,900
improve the human condition for all

75
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,150
individuals regardless of who they are

76
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,580
regardless of where they come from

77
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,020
regardless of the hue their skin

78
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,120
regardless of which god they pray to or

79
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,520
who they love or yes even their legal

80
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,960
status if we want a federal government

81
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,240
that truly improves a human condition

82
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,400
for all individuals the rest of the

83
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:16,949
nation as well as our senior senator

84
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,220
from California should join California

85
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:22,769
in pushing for racial justice and

86
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,950
demanding reforms to our broke countries

87
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:28,680
broken cannabis laws system as we know

88
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:30,899
it today now we had a senator who's

89
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,069
going to be here today and we had a

90
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:33,418
conversation where this morning at

91
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:35,550
senator Steve Bradford

92
00:04:33,418 --> 00:04:37,889
I've actually called him Steve EB

93
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:40,139
and he has a measure that is sitting on

94
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:43,199
the governor's desk which is Senate bill

95
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:45,840
12 94 which deals with the issues of

96
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,509
equity with regards to making sure those

97
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,369
individuals who were caught up by the

98
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:52,919
unjust laws and by the scheduling

99
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:54,300
scheduling one of cannabis have a real

100
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,008
opportunity to be entrepreneurs

101
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,020
themselves and have a real opportunity

102
00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:00,509
to be successful in the cannabis

103
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:03,149
industry because for those who may not

104
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:05,610
know I've always been a strong supporter

105
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:08,008
of green energy and that learners should

106
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:10,620
be being clean renewable energy in

107
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:14,669
California today a governor signed my

108
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:17,490
law which puts us on a 100% pathway to

109
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:20,879
clean energy by the year 2045 with the

110
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:24,598
largest economy on planet earth that has

111
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:26,430
legally mandated 100% clean energy for

112
00:05:24,598 --> 00:05:28,379
the great state of California we are

113
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,139
moving this state the fifth largest

114
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:33,750
economy in the world towards a green

115
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:37,620
energy space well we'll have high wage

116
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:39,538
jobs renewable clean energy well it's

117
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,149
not just about green energy in the clean

118
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:45,269
energy space but it's about green energy

119
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:47,399
too in a new renewable space which is

120
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:50,370
cannabis as I know it as we know it

121
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,989
today the twin pillars of an economy are

122
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,899
the fifth largest economy in the world

123
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:59,158
today and think about this we are the

124
00:05:54,899 --> 00:06:04,049
largest sub-national in the world to

125
00:05:59,158 --> 00:06:06,389
legalize cannabis both medicinal as well

126
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,788
as recreational use and we're the

127
00:06:06,389 --> 00:06:12,269
largest economy in the world to commit

128
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:14,579
to decarbonize the grid by 100 percent

129
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:17,189
legally these are going to be the twin

130
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:18,568
pillars if you will of our economy and

131
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:20,699
we need to make sure that we're

132
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:25,348
inclusive but we also need to make sure

133
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:28,348
that Washington DC gets its act together

134
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:30,180
in California we demonstrate to the rest

135
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:33,089
of the world that cannabis can be

136
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,699
legalized and a just safe and profitable

137
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:36,179
way now I know we have a lot more work

138
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,278
to do

139
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,500
starting with working together to

140
00:06:38,278 --> 00:06:42,810
stabilize and strengthen this growing

141
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,278
industry even in a state like California

142
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:48,300
where the rest of the country receives

143
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:49,319
70% of our exports for starters we need

144
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,170
to make sure

145
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:54,329
that existing small cannabis businesses

146
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:56,670
are able to grow and flourish in their

147
00:06:54,329 --> 00:06:59,219
own rights to avoid a hostile takeover

148
00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:02,189
this industry by extremely very powerful

149
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:05,610
corporations we must focus on building

150
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:07,800
solid banking infrastructure so business

151
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:11,250
owners aren't forced to risk their lives

152
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:13,590
every single day carrying thousands

153
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:17,519
hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash

154
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:20,009
just to pay their taxes that's like a

155
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,649
Kafka novel once again we are we have

156
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:29,009
legalized constitutionally through pop

157
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:31,379
64 the recreational use of cannabis but

158
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:35,129
the same time many of your lives are put

159
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:37,680
at risk every single day because the

160
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:41,219
federal laws and we don't allow for the

161
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,090
banking to actually occur now I'll be

162
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,920
your champion and your voice in

163
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:49,229
Washington in the US Senate to put

164
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,480
cannabis on track for for federal

165
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,730
legalization so we can stabilize this

166
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:56,160
industry and put people to work and I

167
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,670
will be your advocate here today have no

168
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,670
doubt about that

169
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:11,949
so as long as it is incorrectly

170
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:13,870
classified as a schedule 1 drug the

171
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:17,530
industry here in California won't be

172
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:19,629
able to stabilize or grow for more than

173
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:21,939
20 years our cannabis industry has been

174
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:25,689
forced to operate as we know in the

175
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:28,449
shadows prop 215 the compassionate

176
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:30,908
caregiver Act of 1996 hoped to change

177
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:34,120
that by legalizing the MIS the medicinal

178
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:36,788
use of cannabis in California but the

179
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:41,110
lack of local cooperation made this in

180
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:43,870
fact to some degree a toothless law even

181
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:45,009
with the passage of Prop 64 the federal

182
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,169
government is still threatening

183
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:50,588
businesses who comply with state law

184
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:53,828
only to get caught in the vise the vise

185
00:08:50,589 --> 00:08:55,720
grip of federal cannabis law enforcement

186
00:08:53,828 --> 00:08:58,539
we have a Department of Justice headed

187
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,519
up by Jeff Sessions who has made it very

188
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,740
clear that he will do everything within

189
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:06,240
his power to shut down the cannabis

190
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:09,250
industry now there is a confluence of

191
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,169
intersectionality on the issue that we

192
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,899
care deeply about the right to breathe

193
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:16,360
clean air into our lungs the right to

194
00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:19,240
drink clean water the right for our

195
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:23,560
families who have been here 10 15 20 25

196
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:25,629
years to be legalized in the greatest

197
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:29,649
country in the world and to not live in

198
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:31,149
fear live in the shadows not knowing if

199
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:33,778
at 4:00 in the morning there'll be a

200
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:38,470
hard knock at the door with ice agents

201
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:41,500
or young children feeling the fear of

202
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,120
anxiety young children not knowing if

203
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,850
their mother's or Father's are going to

204
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,810
pick them up after school I was in

205
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:54,278
Oxnard yesterday at an elementary school

206
00:09:48,809 --> 00:09:58,000
fifth graders 5th graders and these

207
00:09:54,278 --> 00:10:00,850
young boys and girls at this school were

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,480
incredibly precocious so intelligent so

209
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:06,129
smart with huge dreams and aspirations

210
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,709
their parents many of them actually pick

211
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:14,070
strawberries in Oxnard in batura County

212
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:16,089
citrus and Piru Sunkiss lemons oranges

213
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:19,500
limes

214
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:21,639
and they all talked about Donald Trump

215
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,289
and I want to be respectful for any

216
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:27,269
folks here who may be supportive Donald

217
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:29,230
Trump but I don't think there are any

218
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:29,769
always any they'll come out of the

219
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,990
closet

220
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:38,199
you know today but that being said these

221
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:40,389
fifth these fifth graders were so

222
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,390
intuitive to what was happening in the

223
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:47,019
country today and I can say this

224
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:50,139
Republican or Democrat that I Drive a

225
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:53,590
lot of my although I'm a former assembly

226
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:56,049
member the state senator today just

227
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,550
recently until just a few months ago the

228
00:10:56,049 --> 00:11:01,029
leader of the California State Senate

229
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:03,849
your state Senate along with my good

230
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:05,850
friend and colleague the former Pro Tem

231
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:09,009
himself Bill Lockyer it's a very small

232
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:13,060
very illustrious club only handful of

233
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:15,610
individuals who ever held that title I'm

234
00:11:13,059 --> 00:11:16,899
not as political as people think I am in

235
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,610
terms of sitting with political

236
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:21,939
consultants and sitting with pollsters

237
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:24,700
would have you cetera I watch and I

238
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:29,920
watch constituents and the people I care

239
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:32,170
deeply about and on November 9th 2016

240
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:35,579
the day after the election when you saw

241
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:39,879
young kids as young as kindergarten

242
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:43,000
crying crying because who was elected as

243
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:44,590
president I don't recall any children of

244
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,509
any Republican crying when Barack Obama

245
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:49,090
was elected presidents the United States

246
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:51,279
in fact I don't even recall any children

247
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,930
of any Democrat no matter how left how

248
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,629
liberal that Democrat activist may be

249
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:57,639
crying when George W Bush was elected to

250
00:11:55,629 --> 00:11:59,590
the presidency United States but to have

251
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:03,429
children crying not from joy but

252
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:04,990
actually from deep fear who was about to

253
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:06,729
possess the most powerful office in the

254
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,509
world and what it meant for them and

255
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,129
their families

256
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:11,289
when you have young children crying

257
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:13,299
that's what drives me in my

258
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:15,459
decision-making right there so when you

259
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:17,409
have a Department of Justice that seeks

260
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:20,980
to make sure that cannabis stays

261
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:23,049
Schedule one and seeks to divide our

262
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,090
families and to make sure that this

263
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:26,949
industry does not grow and it's not

264
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:28,600
successful and we're not going to do

265
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,550
banking we're gonna make sure you stay

266
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,100
in the most

267
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:34,649
position possible in terms of just cash

268
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,600
only this is why we need the right

269
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:38,129
leadership the right leadership like

270
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,778
with my good friend Reggie Jones soya

271
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:41,189
right here who will be one of your

272
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:43,139
keynote speakers has been a great

273
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:45,660
champion for all of you in our state

274
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:48,000
capital folks like Rob Manta who will be

275
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:48,600
here later on today from oak town from

276
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,370
Oakland

277
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,139
Stevie Brad for who couldn't be here

278
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:53,879
today as well as of Carlotta who

279
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:55,828
couldn't be here at all today as well to

280
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:59,429
folks like roberto

281
00:12:55,828 --> 00:13:02,639
robert garcia that's why elections are

282
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:06,149
consequential they matter they make a

283
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,389
difference let me finish up here in the

284
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:10,740
first quarter of this year alone

285
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:11,429
cannabis brought into our california

286
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,839
state budget

287
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:16,799
sixty point nine million dollars

288
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:19,290
mustachios just rounded office of

289
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:22,229
seventy you know sixty point nine

290
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:24,149
million dollars and we expect the excise

291
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:27,120
tax of bringing more than half a billion

292
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:28,708
dollars by the end of this year we can

293
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,980
invest these critical dollars in

294
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:34,259
improving our education system expanding

295
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,289
law enforcement resources and building

296
00:13:34,259 --> 00:13:39,480
an economy that works for all of us not

297
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:41,699
just for some but for all of us

298
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,889
what we're building here in california

299
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:46,709
could become a model for the rest of the

300
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:49,139
nation we're cutting a path for for

301
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:51,629
other states and our federal government

302
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:54,600
to follow it's time for real leadership

303
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:56,939
and we'll bring this industry out of the

304
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,310
shadows so we can get to work achieving

305
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,770
the economic growth this industry

306
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:04,649
promises because we know that the status

307
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:07,350
quo is not working the same ol same ol

308
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:09,539
is not working the status quo in fact is

309
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,550
too dangerous it's not sustainable and

310
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:14,578
it's a result of weak leadership in

311
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:18,799
Washington DC let me show you this

312
00:14:14,578 --> 00:14:21,659
finally this is why because passing 215

313
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:24,479
medicinal use of cannabis and passing

314
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:27,389
prop 60 for recreational use of cannabis

315
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,970
and everything else that we need to do

316
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:33,778
in California this is why we must remain

317
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:36,060
America's exceptional example a beacon

318
00:14:33,778 --> 00:14:38,850
of hope and opportunity in a very

319
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:41,328
uncertain world that we're not going to

320
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,409
allow as California it's one electoral

321
00:14:41,328 --> 00:14:46,409
aberration

322
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:48,620
reverse generations of progress at the

323
00:14:46,409 --> 00:14:51,778
height of our historic diversity our

324
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:54,149
scientific advancement our economic

325
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:57,360
output in our sense of global

326
00:14:54,149 --> 00:15:01,528
responsibility that's our role to

327
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,750
advocate to agitate to organize to make

328
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:06,179
sure that we are respected and that

329
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:09,059
we're legitimize that we are a true

330
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:10,679
pillar of the economy of California so

331
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:12,750
folks can come out of the shadows and

332
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,458
they can grow their businesses and be

333
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:17,879
successful and we have an inclusive
