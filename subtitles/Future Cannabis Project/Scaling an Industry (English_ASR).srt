1
00:00:08,859 --> 00:00:14,149
processes each one of these guys has

2
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,619
gone through and interesting for a lot

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:18,469
of different reasons we talked earlier

4
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:19,820
about scaling compliance and safety and

5
00:00:18,469 --> 00:00:24,079
those types of things and we've talked

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:26,329
about regulatory aspects of scaling but

7
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:32,358
there's the mechanical side of that that

8
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:34,759
is really cool there was 10 years ago if

9
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:37,399
you asked me how many people were doing

10
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:39,049
large-scale cannabis processing I would

11
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,379
tell you that there is probably four or

12
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:45,108
five people in the world doing that and

13
00:00:42,378 --> 00:00:47,329
that number really hasn't changed too

14
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:49,338
much today most of the extractors and

15
00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:50,478
the distillers and the the people that

16
00:00:49,338 --> 00:00:52,728
are in that industry are really

17
00:00:50,478 --> 00:00:55,219
operating at this very cottage level

18
00:00:52,728 --> 00:00:57,498
still there are some people that are

19
00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:01,189
building massive plants those plants are

20
00:00:57,499 --> 00:01:03,409
processing 5,000 10,000 40,000 pounds a

21
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:05,929
day of hemp and and and cannabis

22
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:09,109
material there's some people out in the

23
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:11,270
US now building hundred thousand pound a

24
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:13,218
day processing facilities and a lot of

25
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:15,649
that innovation a lot of that technology

26
00:01:13,218 --> 00:01:17,538
is being driven by other industries but

27
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:19,670
it's also be driven being driven by

28
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:22,250
people that are in the industry working

29
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,930
from the bottom and facing massive

30
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,299
amounts of bottlenecks and massive

31
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,909
amounts of equipment failures and and

32
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:32,270
it's really changing and and and those

33
00:01:28,909 --> 00:01:34,820
failures are feeding back energy into

34
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:37,489
creation and some of those creations

35
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:39,798
have revolutionized this industry and

36
00:01:37,489 --> 00:01:41,269
really taken us to a new level and and

37
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,890
and people are taking notice and people

38
00:01:41,269 --> 00:01:46,449
are recognizing that you know for the

39
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:49,358
first I guess five last five years or so

40
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,740
there was a huge focus on cultivation

41
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:53,868
now there's not a lot of people buying

42
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:55,670
cultivation farms in fact those are you

43
00:01:53,868 --> 00:01:58,218
know the price of a buying a farm these

44
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,170
days is is dropping precipitously and

45
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:02,390
then there's this huge focus on brands

46
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:04,849
and like oh my god the best new pod in

47
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,978
that and the coolest new strain and and

48
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:08,689
now those things are kind of like yeah

49
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:09,460
they're really cool this third wave

50
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:12,400
that's hitting

51
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:14,560
right now is all about technology and

52
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,900
medical science which is why this

53
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,969
conference exists and so we're gonna

54
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,260
start there and and one of the first

55
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:21,759
things I know cuz it's been an

56
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:25,149
interesting part of my life last four

57
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:28,209
years is what is the the biggest problem

58
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:32,890
that you foresee in scaling operations

59
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:34,120
today and I'll start with Ken I think it

60
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:35,819
kind of actually goes back to what we

61
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,900
were just talking about with Boris

62
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,340
ethanol is a great solvent for

63
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,990
extraction

64
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,640
you can skip a lot of the

65
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,610
post-processing steps if you use the

66
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,139
right conditions but ultimately as

67
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,360
you're using ethanol as a solvent and

68
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:51,069
you're recovering that solvent you have

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,950
to scale up all of the utilities that

70
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:57,189
heat and coincidentally cool that back

71
00:02:53,949 --> 00:02:58,869
into a liquid and you know as you go

72
00:02:57,189 --> 00:03:02,169
larger there are definitely sources like

73
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,879
steam and and and falling film water

74
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:07,119
towers literally just to provide that

75
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:09,370
cooling heat but I think that's gonna be

76
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,599
a pretty big issue that we all bump into

77
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:15,969
if there's not a better solution

78
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:20,439
available no I think one big problem

79
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:22,240
we're gonna have is we have so many

80
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,460
different farmers that we're getting our

81
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,950
material from having a consistency of

82
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:30,120
material and making sure that we we can

83
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:32,829
actually scale these systems to process

84
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,650
several different types of materials

85
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:38,440
that are potentially laden with

86
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:41,500
different cannabinoid ratios and

87
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:45,400
pesticides that we want to remove if we

88
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,650
start just throwing in 20,000 pounds

89
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,129
into a big reactor and somebody says

90
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,930
yeah I'm telling you it's clean well did

91
00:03:51,129 --> 00:03:55,150
they check every single bag that went

92
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,040
into that and those are the it's gonna

93
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:03,300
be really difficult to be able to trace

94
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:07,149
have traceability for every batch and

95
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:10,210
maintain clean material through day to

96
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:14,200
day process when you're pumping out not

97
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:16,060
jars of oil but barrels of it I think

98
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:18,269
one of the issues as well is going to be

99
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,649
you guys hear me okay honest yeah

100
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,199
I think one of the issues also is gonna

101
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,639
be sourcing of that material I mean if

102
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:25,079
you think about how large we're all

103
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,370
going here and there's gonna be quite a

104
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:28,050
few people in this room as well that are

105
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,569
doing you know multiple thousands of

106
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:33,300
pounds a day I mean if you really like

107
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:35,849
equate that to acreage that's so much

108
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,710
biomass and and realistically with THC

109
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,950
and with regulations that are in place

110
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:43,139
now for us to be able to go this large

111
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:45,779
it's gonna be difficult to source that

112
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,879
much and also to you know like what pin

113
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:49,769
was saying with with power I mean we can

114
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,439
pretty much design anything as far as

115
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:54,359
you know availability of condensing area

116
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,579
and things of that nature you know

117
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,949
there's it's applied across many other

118
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:01,139
industries but you know that much heat

119
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:03,689
in the zones that we're allowed to do it

120
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,639
in now and with all this regulation it's

121
00:05:03,689 --> 00:05:10,918
gonna be it's gonna be difficult to be

122
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:13,949
able to scale source P batches and worry

123
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:16,409
about being able to you know have an

124
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:18,839
upgrade of power that you need at the

125
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,270
drop of a hat in an ever-changing market

126
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:25,589
that happens so quickly and you know

127
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:27,719
Edison's two years out ace I'm actually

128
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:31,009
going to have three answers one from my

129
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:34,169
perspective mechanically I think

130
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:35,909
chilling getting those massive chillers

131
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,349
to get pretty clean all down to

132
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,510
temperature at the scale that we're

133
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,790
aiming for is just gonna be it's just a

134
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:43,519
big engineering challenge and it's gonna

135
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:45,720
require some new equipment on the market

136
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,099
that's just a challenge that needs to be

137
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,570
overcome

138
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,160
there's also quality control issues

139
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:53,310
process control issues that know what

140
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,050
talked about that are just gonna be hard

141
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:59,490
for operators like it's gonna begin

142
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:01,079
every day effort to track your material

143
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:05,490
make sure all the processes are as

144
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:08,370
followed get every just all that control

145
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,439
documented and processed and this just

146
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:12,300
work and then there's the last one which

147
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,069
is totally out of my league which is

148
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,439
regulatory compliance because it's this

149
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:18,689
moving thing that there was a whole talk

150
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,029
on two hours ago so I'll leave it down

151
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:24,060
with two that I think that's actually a

152
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:27,179
good transition into what that's going

153
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,860
to do for how we process because if one

154
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,110
of the reasons why we can't scale is

155
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,970
because we can't get things cold

156
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,629
then we're gonna start doing things like

157
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:38,520
finding ways to do it warm you know how

158
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:41,218
can we start extracting with

159
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:44,579
room-temperature ethanol and being able

160
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:45,629
to refine through things like filtration

161
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:48,478
and stuff which is something that you

162
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:51,599
guys know quite a bit about but

163
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:54,060
post-processing is a right but not

164
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,829
not if you can do it without without

165
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,110
media you know like if you can do it

166
00:06:55,829 --> 00:07:02,579
without me well that's a good segue so

167
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:04,468
what are you most excited about products

168
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:06,918
services whatever coming out on the

169
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:09,240
market today don't get any secrets away

170
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:11,519
no my hand it's at it's actually

171
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,650
something that uh I think you guys are

172
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:18,240
working a lot with I think that's insane

173
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:21,689
you wanna we've been working on a

174
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:26,400
membrane recovery membrane recovery of

175
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:29,879
ethanol we've been able to mechanically

176
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,769
separate ethanol from crude oil down to

177
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:35,849
about a five to one

178
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:41,250
ethanol de crude ratio about 150 gallons

179
00:07:35,848 --> 00:07:44,110
on 30 amps 150 gallons an hour and you

180
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:47,310
can clap right there it's okay

181
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:51,420
[Applause]

182
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:55,680
and from there the the distillation of

183
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:57,600
ethanol is really it's not much of a

184
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,519
problem and at that point you don't

185
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,800
really even need to distill your ethanol

186
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:05,759
with that the ethanol is so cheap

187
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,680
there's ways to lauch your ethanol out

188
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,319
and water and basically turn that's and

189
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,269
all you dilute it enough to where it's

190
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,769
just water and then you separate your

191
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:20,009
ethanol and water through maybe you put

192
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:21,750
it in a nonpolar use some some gravity

193
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:24,000
there's there's a lot of different ways

194
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,668
to skin a cat and with that type of

195
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,189
filtration also you can get into removal

196
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:31,740
of fats you can remove a lot of other

197
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:33,870
things from it as well so it's as far as

198
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,509
efficiencies go with large scale and

199
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,460
having to address like the whole cold

200
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:41,460
problem which is the huge issue because

201
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,668
how are you gonna do 5,000 plus pounds a

202
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,089
day

203
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:46,679
with you know well five thousand is

204
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:49,890
probably pretty easy that's my ex but

205
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:51,629
you know multiple tonnes a day you know

206
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:53,970
that's a lot of cold ethanol and then

207
00:08:51,629 --> 00:08:56,269
that's a lot of heat to recover it if

208
00:08:53,970 --> 00:09:00,750
you can address that through filtration

209
00:08:56,269 --> 00:09:02,338
that that destroys that bottleneck I I

210
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,870
do want to interject that it's going to

211
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:05,670
I think it's very interesting that we

212
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,110
have this filtration technology that's

213
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:11,819
coming out that will allow warm

214
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:13,529
processing but also that cold chilling

215
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,600
something even to minus eighty is a soft

216
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:18,059
problem we know how to do that it just

217
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,250
takes electricity yeah and we don't

218
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:21,959
currently have access just to

219
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,159
off-the-shelf machines that do that but

220
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,589
there are systems that have been

221
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:29,539
engineered in industry that do that on a

222
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:34,350
daily basis that's how we get dry ice so

223
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:36,240
we can apply those and it's going to be

224
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,060
interesting to see what becomes the most

225
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,960
cost competitive is it electricity or is

226
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:44,729
it membrane filters and member filters

227
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,960
might have an o2 there but it's gonna be

228
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,000
very interesting to me to see that

229
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,780
yellow or just post-processing throw a

230
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,139
hammer of

231
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:54,419
a solvent and yeah filtration might be a

232
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:59,069
way but differ in any way of processing

233
00:09:54,419 --> 00:10:00,629
and getting a you might just want to rip

234
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,879
absolutely everything out of your

235
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:06,899
material and have a very dirty crude

236
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:11,399
that that you wave a magic wand over and

237
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:13,799
you develop your own methods to to make

238
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:18,029
it a beautiful oil but I've seen a lot

239
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:19,139
of tricks from we didn't know what was

240
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:20,569
gonna happen when we tried that

241
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,860
pesticide remediation that's where

242
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:27,629
that's when people started getting water

243
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,860
clear delta-9 and and so just through so

244
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:33,990
many people working through these

245
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:37,200
problems and trying it at a R&amp;D scale

246
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:40,080
and then open sourcing that bringing it

247
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,240
to the table so like-minded people can

248
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,730
discuss i think that we're actually

249
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,879
going to be able to solve a lot of these

250
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:49,350
problems before there's actually larger

251
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:51,629
equipment companies that are coming and

252
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:57,000
coming in and and taking the space

253
00:10:51,629 --> 00:11:00,389
taking the culture from us where do you

254
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,240
see manufacturing in this space going

255
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:05,580
like what's what's your ideal two years

256
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,399
five years from now what's your ideal of

257
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,590
how this space looks like how much are

258
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,149
we processing every day what kind of

259
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,780
products are we making kind of along

260
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:17,370
those lines

261
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:19,829
I mean if we're continuing down the path

262
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,470
regarding right now it's gonna be you

263
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:24,480
know Matt on a THC side we're gonna be

264
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,100
seeing probably you know you guys are

265
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,800
correct now around 5,000 pounds a day

266
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,960
probably is a feasible scale that also

267
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:34,289
doesn't out scale your supply chain for

268
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,690
for trim and all of that I mean on the

269
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:39,240
CBD front you're probably gonna see CVD

270
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:42,680
isolate prices drop to like dollar maybe

271
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,680
sub dollar in the next couple of years

272
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:47,909
yeah it'll be a competitive environment

273
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:48,930
for sure which is why scaling and being

274
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:50,519
able to do this stuff if in fact

275
00:11:48,929 --> 00:11:54,509
effectively and efficiently is really

276
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:59,850
important I think that isolated

277
00:11:54,509 --> 00:12:01,259
cannabinoids will analogs Pro drugs the

278
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,259
ones that aren't protected by patents it

279
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:06,689
will be pretty big but isolated

280
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:08,279
cannabinoids breaking down the ones that

281
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,740
are already present in the cannabis

282
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:16,850
plant being able to actually reformulate

283
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:21,060
them into to medicine that we actually

284
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:24,090
that the there's actually clinical

285
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:27,179
studies happening in Canada right now

286
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:28,560
that we aren't able to do now but if we

287
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:31,829
start seeing the formulations that are

288
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:34,109
working and Canada we are way ahead of

289
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:37,860
them and manufacturing and if we start

290
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:40,560
isolating these products when when

291
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,960
things start to get a little bit easier

292
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,819
on the regulatory side will will be

293
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:48,780
there with some of the best medicine

294
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:52,140
available at bulk to be able to not just

295
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:53,939
provide it in the United States but we

296
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:57,289
will be the trendsetter again once we

297
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,790
get over those regulatory hurdles I

298
00:12:57,289 --> 00:13:02,969
think as far as production goes I think

299
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:05,009
it's vastly gonna be done by larger

300
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,540
companies kind of I I know it's kind of

301
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:08,639
an industry-wide joke that we're like Oh

302
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:11,279
Marvel you know to me nor Philip

303
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,860
Morris's coming in but I I think that

304
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,419
that is the reality I think that it's

305
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,419
going to break down a lot like beer I

306
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:21,539
think you're gonna see a wide range of

307
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:23,219
products made by two or three very large

308
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:25,079
companies that pretty much pins down a

309
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,610
lot of the market and then I think

310
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,160
you're gonna see kind of like the craft

311
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:31,889
the craft beer aspect of it where you're

312
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:34,889
gonna have you know people like us who

313
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:37,139
are probably you know refused to sell

314
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:38,759
out or you know started a brand and want

315
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,409
to hang on to it or just have a really

316
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:44,399
good product that you know can't be done

317
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:45,480
on a large scale so as far as processing

318
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,699
goes in the future

319
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,320
large scale yeah I think unfortunately

320
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,660
we're gonna have to deal with you know

321
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,000
what we're already seeing happen a lot

322
00:13:51,659 --> 00:13:56,549
of these big players coming in who you

323
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,809
know make a lot of like you know we look

324
00:13:56,549 --> 00:13:59,278
at what they're doing and kind

325
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:01,409
laughs from the sidelines you know like

326
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,778
haha that's dumb cuz I already did that

327
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:05,039
and I know it doesn't work but uh you

328
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:06,600
know here's the deal is that they can

329
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,159
afford to make that mistake they'll

330
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,440
figure it out and they'll just keep

331
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,539
going so inevitably they're gonna get it

332
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,710
right and you know it's not too

333
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:16,019
difficult to figure out how to make

334
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:16,650
distillate so I think that they're gonna

335
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:21,079
be here

336
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:24,149
I think TV and CBD are going to be

337
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:25,500
commodity products I don't I'm not gonna

338
00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:26,879
speculate on the price there's gonna be

339
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,639
big players that pump it out by the

340
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:32,129
literal time but there's also a lot of

341
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,769
room for effectively craft brewers like

342
00:14:32,129 --> 00:14:37,528
there's thousands upon thousands of like

343
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:40,439
different types of wine you there's

344
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:42,539
Carlo Rosa pumping out commodity wine

345
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,120
and there's also room for manufacturers

346
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:46,679
to do craft processes make high quality

347
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,600
products those can be really interesting

348
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,250
to see like who becomes a big

349
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,009
manufacturer but there's also a lot of

350
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,860
room for small efficient players because

351
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:58,259
like beer and wine it's not as high a

352
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,240
margin as what we're used to but there's

353
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:02,279
lots of craft players there's it's a

354
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,230
huge industry to be a small player in

355
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:07,559
those fields you just need efficient

356
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:09,960
equipment efficient ways to produce at

357
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:11,579
those small scales and that equipment

358
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,310
will be available and it's being

359
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:18,690
developed right now at peak you're in

360
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:20,699
range yes what one positive side of the

361
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,620
CVD commoditization at being readily

362
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,660
readily available is the ability to

363
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,600
actually interconvert cannabinoids so

364
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:31,500
taking a kilo of CBD and converting it

365
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:34,500
to CBD using various reactions or CBD to

366
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,389
cbn or THC B or any of those things or

367
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,679
even just synthesis of cannabinoids in

368
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:39,480
general I mean it's well published

369
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,579
people know how to do it I'm not sure

370
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,899
why people aren't doing it yet maybe it

371
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,139
just wouldn't be accepted as well but

372
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:48,179
you'll probably see that in the future

373
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:50,129
what's what's missing from the industry

374
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:51,539
you know we we see a lot of bottlenecks

375
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:53,039
every day we run up against something

376
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:55,319
and then we innovate our way out of it

377
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,990
but right now as we all sit here what's

378
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:00,570
missing like is it is it that you know

379
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:03,269
we we just purchased a centrifugal

380
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:05,590
partitioner and we're kind of staring at

381
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:08,649
it like a big paperweight right now

382
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:11,139
but it is that separation something

383
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:13,240
that's missing that needs to be honed in

384
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:14,860
on yeah I think diversification of

385
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,759
readily available cannabinoids is going

386
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,009
to be huge

387
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,049
same with terpene content I mean if

388
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:21,939
everyone's cranking out 5000 liters a

389
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:23,169
day of distillate or whatever what are

390
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,360
you gonna put in that that actually

391
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:26,500
makes it resemble cannabis right so I

392
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,120
think that's gonna be a big part of it

393
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:31,028
yeah I agree

394
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:36,149
having cannabis based terpene profiles

395
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:38,439
that people actually like that's and

396
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:40,319
developing methods using the solvents

397
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,880
that we have to where we aren't just

398
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,500
thrashing good Terps just because we

399
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,799
need to make a few a few distillate

400
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:50,919
bottles actually developing some methods

401
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:52,419
and saving those those compounds that

402
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:57,729
are more valuable than the cannabinoids

403
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:59,740
right now I think it's not necessarily

404
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:01,120
missing but it would definitely help if

405
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:05,078
there was a lot more cross knowledge

406
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,939
from other industries I mean if you look

407
00:17:05,078 --> 00:17:10,029
at what we're applying to cannabis now

408
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:11,500
that's making huge changes a lot of that

409
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,970
stuff is just exist almost all of that

410
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,410
stuff is existed in other industries

411
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:17,170
it's been right in front of our face the

412
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:21,759
entire time you know so I think it's

413
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:24,730
just being able to have access to well

414
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:26,140
funds to be able to explore a bunch of

415
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,640
other things in order to become more

416
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,860
efficient and processing a lot of these

417
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,320
things because currently right now we're

418
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:33,579
all self-funded you know and it costs a

419
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,909
lot of money when you're wrong

420
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:39,639
and you know it's it's it's not as

421
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:41,679
incentivizing to to take these risks in

422
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,540
order to purchase such an expensive

423
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,120
machine because you think it might work

424
00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:47,379
you know so that being said I think

425
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:50,589
that's kind of something that's missing

426
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:52,929
is some type of research funding for

427
00:17:50,589 --> 00:18:00,250
being able to discover a lot of new ways

428
00:17:52,929 --> 00:18:03,190
to process things to go back to like did

429
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:06,250
the value added of of the like the

430
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:08,200
terpenes and stuff an anecdote from the

431
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,750
petroleum industry is like gasoline is

432
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,410
less than half

433
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:15,809
value of a barrel of oil they make

434
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:18,720
bright products that go into plastics

435
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:21,450
and pharmaceuticals and like everything

436
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,630
that we can't possibly imagine that

437
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:26,880
makes up more than half the value from

438
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:32,040
like the remaining 10% that doesn't get

439
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:33,450
converted to gasoline so like we we have

440
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,829
lots of problems with like okay we need

441
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,120
this size of equipment it needs to be

442
00:18:34,829 --> 00:18:37,169
specialized in that way blah blah blah

443
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:39,719
there's those are all solvable

444
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:41,580
engineering challenges what I haven't

445
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,250
seen anyone really do yet is like

446
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:46,710
separate all the terpenes make it into

447
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,329
these like beautiful profiles find other

448
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,930
uses for them find out therefore my

449
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:54,119
critical uses for them and that's really

450
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,560
excites me to see where the industry is

451
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:57,959
gonna go in that direction one one

452
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,700
request I've got on that we need to

453
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,799
determine what what is it in a

454
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,600
hydrocarbon extract from the terpene

455
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:05,849
perspective that does not come through

456
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,649
with other forms of extraction

457
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:10,379
it's definitely prevalent there like you

458
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,700
can taste it in whatever sauce car or

459
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,530
whatever you're trying out there's

460
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,170
definitely some backbone that is there

461
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:17,759
that we need to profile or determine

462
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,470
what it is so that we can replicate that

463
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,869
on a larger scale because it really does

464
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:24,930
round out the flavor profile of all the

465
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:27,029
other more dominant terpenes yeah I want

466
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,250
a half answer that in that we know it's

467
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:30,809
light terpenes because everything that

468
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,690
I'm going to do Ethne and ethanol

469
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:35,609
extracts we it when you recover the

470
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,470
ethanol all the terpenes that are

471
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:41,639
remotely close to the boiling point of

472
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:43,500
ethanol and lighter go away we still

473
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,360
need to profile those figure out what

474
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,519
those are extract those from the plant

475
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:50,789
save them and put them into flavor so

476
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:54,119
like research is needed and I 100% agree

477
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:58,349
but those lighter beans at least we have

478
00:19:54,119 --> 00:20:00,479
an a category of what they are you

479
00:19:58,349 --> 00:20:03,000
touched on it and in in the distillate

480
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,700
world terpenes are a byproduct a waste

481
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,259
stream unfortunately but there's all

482
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,110
these other waste streams that we

483
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:13,179
haven't even begun to touch there's it's

484
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:17,599
a very fibrous plant there are

485
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:20,600
biofuels and biochar and and and you

486
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:24,459
know a company just reached out to talk

487
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:27,589
about you know turning phileas yes

488
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,899
turning spent pulp material into

489
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:31,579
cellulose to make clothing you know is

490
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:33,048
that something that's missing is that

491
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:35,210
the is that the future as we start

492
00:20:33,048 --> 00:20:37,038
figuring out where that other 50% of the

493
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,929
value comes into play yeah I mean I

494
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:40,460
think so for sure I mean any process

495
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:41,778
you're trying to efficient Nick make all

496
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,308
of your product streams efficient right

497
00:20:41,778 --> 00:20:45,319
I mean to your point like the cellulose

498
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:46,879
if you are an ethanol extractor you

499
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:48,349
could take all of your biomass send it

500
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,940
to some company that has cellulose

501
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:51,230
processing they'll turn it back into

502
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,330
ethanol and sell you that ethanol to

503
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,329
reprocess more material it'd be kind of

504
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:58,609
a good closed-loop oh yeah

505
00:20:55,329 --> 00:21:00,230
yeah and the market is getting more and

506
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:02,990
more competitive we see the prices

507
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,730
dropping so as the prices drop we need

508
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:08,419
to find other profit streams and the

509
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:12,169
other ways to be efficient so we those

510
00:21:08,419 --> 00:21:16,419
profit streams are one thing and also

511
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:16,419
becoming more energy efficient and

512
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:26,538
potentially carbon neutral going towards

513
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:31,298
a carbon neutral a goal it's that way

514
00:21:26,538 --> 00:21:34,548
when you've got every other company that

515
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:39,168
that's that's being protested against

516
00:21:34,548 --> 00:21:40,429
and tearing up the gutter the being

517
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:42,769
thought of it as a bad guy and the

518
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:44,210
canvas guys are finally being taught

519
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:46,638
would call the bad guys just like we saw

520
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,990
up in Northern California you want to be

521
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:51,138
that good guy you want to be the one

522
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:54,259
that's not that's using the best methods

523
00:21:51,138 --> 00:21:57,349
the best practices to create medicine

524
00:21:54,259 --> 00:22:00,408
and not just do it at for the bottom

525
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:03,939
dollar but I think we should have

526
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:03,940
terpene water balloon fights

527
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:10,878
two crucial or you should go dump them

528
00:22:07,278 --> 00:22:13,069
at your local policeman station I'm just

529
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:15,378
kidding um I think it's really brilliant

530
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:18,200
that there's a lot of jobs that can be

531
00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:20,358
created around this you know like I had

532
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:23,840
people ask about creating soap with the

533
00:22:20,358 --> 00:22:24,798
plant fats you know just I think that's

534
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,259
something that's really brilliant about

535
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,700
it is that not only are we taking what

536
00:22:27,259 --> 00:22:30,739
we want off of it but now it's the

537
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,830
creation of new products that can go out

538
00:22:30,739 --> 00:22:35,690
there and you know continue to make

539
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:37,819
money off of the same stuff while doing

540
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:40,970
it efficiently and you know not trashing

541
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:42,858
a bunch of bunch of things yeah it's an

542
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:45,919
if you're gonna be making that commodity

543
00:22:42,858 --> 00:22:48,108
product it's gonna be critical to have

544
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,269
all your waste streams be part of your

545
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:52,519
revenue or at least part of your process

546
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:54,829
like I've been wanting to see someone

547
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:57,079
take the the biomass and just burning

548
00:22:54,829 --> 00:22:58,579
and turn it into steam and use it to

549
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:59,808
power the falling film like that's

550
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:02,918
something I've like wanted to see it in

551
00:22:59,808 --> 00:23:06,729
the very beginning that's a pretty basic

552
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:09,288
hemp clothing would be amazing also

553
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:12,649
terpene water balloon fights approved

554
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:15,048
it's it's interesting that we started

555
00:23:12,648 --> 00:23:16,939
out you know six seven years ago

556
00:23:15,048 --> 00:23:19,069
collecting trim from farms and they call

557
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,229
it their trash right we get it basically

558
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:24,798
for nothing and now we're moving back

559
00:23:21,229 --> 00:23:28,700
into an era of finding other trash you

560
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:30,558
know turpenoid trash biomass trash that

561
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,080
we've we've thrown away and now we're

562
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:36,408
finding different uses for it so I've

563
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:39,319
actually purchased uh I've actually

564
00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:41,599
purchased a pellet Iser and so after you

565
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:44,598
run your product it actually pelletized

566
00:23:41,598 --> 00:23:47,148
this super super well and if there's any

567
00:23:44,598 --> 00:23:51,108
subtle amount of ethanol left over on it

568
00:23:47,148 --> 00:23:52,128
it also burns really really well so this

569
00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:53,329
isn't the same thing that he was

570
00:23:52,128 --> 00:23:55,728
bringing up because I wanted to generate

571
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:58,339
steam in order to do it California

572
00:23:55,729 --> 00:23:59,960
doesn't allow me to do so but if I was

573
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:01,878
in a state that would that would be the

574
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,548
most efficient way of running your

575
00:24:01,878 --> 00:24:07,848
processing plant would just be

576
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:11,749
pelletized your bio your your waste burn

577
00:24:07,848 --> 00:24:13,759
it generate steam distill probably use

578
00:24:11,749 --> 00:24:14,569
some natural water source in order to do

579
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,200
it

580
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:20,599
you know like just thinking here I've

581
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,298
done the math the burning of the biomass

582
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:24,648
provides at least the amount of energy

583
00:24:23,298 --> 00:24:26,808
required to boil all the nothing also

584
00:24:24,648 --> 00:24:31,038
extract it probably two to three times

585
00:24:26,808 --> 00:24:36,138
more so just to say and then you have my

586
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:39,648
Oh char wherewhere where your heads

587
00:24:36,138 --> 00:24:41,869
going we've we've seen a lot of changes

588
00:24:39,648 --> 00:24:45,199
a lot of you consult for other people

589
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:47,148
build equipment for other people what's

590
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,788
next on your plate like well do you have

591
00:24:47,148 --> 00:24:54,288
a five-year plan what's uh what are you

592
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:57,169
trying to tackle next five-year plan

593
00:24:54,288 --> 00:25:00,288
six-month plan maybe try like a two week

594
00:24:57,169 --> 00:25:02,419
dude I mean we're in an ever-changing

595
00:25:00,288 --> 00:25:04,009
tomorrow you know it's it's moving so

596
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:05,750
fast I mean like next thing you know

597
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:08,720
it's like oh wow we just figured out a

598
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:11,359
filter it all out okay you know like

599
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,659
what it's just kind of trying to figure

600
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:19,548
out what's next so well for us

601
00:25:14,659 --> 00:25:22,940
automation it's not here yet but by this

602
00:25:19,548 --> 00:25:24,980
time next year I'm quite sure that we if

603
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,509
not someone else will have completely

604
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,940
automated systems where you press a

605
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:30,769
button you don't have to have like a

606
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:34,190
person that like knows every bit of

607
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:35,720
thermodynamics to be like okay what

608
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:37,429
temperature do I set it at to strip this

609
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,589
terpene how do I get this purity

610
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:42,110
whatever it'll have sensors on it like

611
00:25:39,589 --> 00:25:43,849
the fraction finder that like measures

612
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:46,959
your purity adjust the parameters

613
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:49,418
real-time tells you how you're doing and

614
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,538
tells you if there's any problems and

615
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:55,370
literally texts you like that I think is

616
00:25:53,538 --> 00:25:57,408
the goal for at least our equipment in

617
00:25:55,369 --> 00:26:04,099
the near future and I think other people

618
00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:06,019
will follow that as well I think for me

619
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:07,788
I'm kind of focused on that

620
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:09,138
interconversion of cannabinoids and some

621
00:26:07,788 --> 00:26:10,819
of the wet chemistry you can do it that

622
00:26:09,138 --> 00:26:14,418
one thing I'm kind of curious about is

623
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:16,490
like for example you can Isetta late THC

624
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:17,670
a which is similar to how they convert

625
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:19,789
like

626
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:23,759
[Music]

627
00:26:19,789 --> 00:26:25,769
yeah like how they how they convert

628
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,690
morphine into heroin same chemistry

629
00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:29,849
actually but it makes the the THC

630
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,009
molecule five times more potent so I'm

631
00:26:29,849 --> 00:26:33,089
curious if that same chemistry which you

632
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:34,500
should be able to do the same chemistry

633
00:26:33,089 --> 00:26:38,129
with CBD and actually make it more

634
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,299
bioavailable or resist breakdown as it

635
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,980
travels to deliver because that's really

636
00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:43,259
the big problem that happens with CBD is

637
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,000
that you know everybody thinks it's

638
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:47,369
wonderful we're all consuming a ton

639
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,170
of it but if you were to look at how

640
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:51,329
much what the dose is given in these

641
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:53,190
trials it's far more than anybody's

642
00:26:51,329 --> 00:26:55,409
buying in like a consumer-level dose

643
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:58,920
right so if we can make them more active

644
00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:06,210
in the body I think that's a serious

645
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:07,950
value to all of us I was thinking I

646
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:09,840
really want to stick with the membranes

647
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:13,410
but I want to go a little bit more in

648
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:17,339
depth with it and play with vapor phase

649
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:20,750
membranes and and you look at the

650
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:25,109
potential of separating cannabinoids and

651
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:29,009
and also remediating pesticides with

652
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:31,829
lower amounts of energy and right now

653
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:34,769
chromatography is so hard to scale

654
00:27:31,829 --> 00:27:38,359
there's the separation of molecules is

655
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:42,139
extremely difficult on a large scale so

656
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:45,149
the the hemp industry is going to be

657
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:47,880
burning through a lot of THC unless

658
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:51,509
there's really solid methods out there

659
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:55,410
for for separating these things with

660
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:57,480
lower energy solutions yeah I think

661
00:27:55,410 --> 00:28:00,509
that's what I'm most excited about is to

662
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:03,480
see just large advances in areas of

663
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:05,069
filtration yeah and with the the

664
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,539
pesticides like you're talking about and

665
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:09,509
kind of activating what Jeff is talking

666
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:11,519
about really your best foot forward

667
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:14,339
there is to get yourself an analytical

668
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:17,039
set up and do small micro extractions of

669
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:19,259
your plant material and concentrate that

670
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,789
and test that for pesticides and you

671
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:22,890
know that if that doesn't pop for

672
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:24,420
pesticides in the concentrated form you

673
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,970
probably likely won't see it so you have

674
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:29,659
the choice to either buy that material

675
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:34,460
or not so so a little bit of a wider

676
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:36,139
angle co2 ethanol and and hydrocarbons

677
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,129
are the three ways we're going about

678
00:28:36,138 --> 00:28:39,258
this right now

679
00:28:37,128 --> 00:28:42,589
pros and cons for those different

680
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:44,149
methodologies what scales what doesn't

681
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:46,638
and is there something we're missing is

682
00:28:44,148 --> 00:28:49,308
there is there you know we we're hearing

683
00:28:46,638 --> 00:28:53,508
about water extraction coming on online

684
00:28:49,308 --> 00:28:54,710
and and other tack anybody want to take

685
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:56,269
a swing at some of that

686
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:58,308
yeah the prospect of the biphasic

687
00:28:56,269 --> 00:29:00,589
counter-current exchange is is really

688
00:28:58,308 --> 00:29:02,720
cool the concept of taking a solvent

689
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:04,788
that the cannabinoids are soluble in and

690
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,460
then basically passing them across a non

691
00:29:04,788 --> 00:29:08,990
miscible solvent and transferring the

692
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,778
cannabinoids from one phase to the other

693
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:13,638
and therefore all the nest nasty stuff

694
00:29:11,778 --> 00:29:15,500
like fats and lipids and gross stuff you

695
00:29:13,638 --> 00:29:17,959
don't want stay in the the upper layer

696
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:19,700
or bottom layer depending on what phases

697
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,649
you're talking about and then your camp

698
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,389
nights go you know along to the next

699
00:29:21,648 --> 00:29:28,638
process I think that's pretty

700
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:30,199
interesting for sure there's oil made

701
00:29:28,638 --> 00:29:33,859
from many other plants that are done

702
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,389
without ethanol or I mean if you look

703
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:38,329
there's a lot of them that are done with

704
00:29:35,388 --> 00:29:40,849
pressure they have really high hydraulic

705
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:42,949
screw presses that take out quite a bit

706
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:44,869
of oil from things I've always wanted to

707
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:47,980
play with it's in essence a giant rosin

708
00:29:44,869 --> 00:29:50,329
press pretty much like imagine pressing

709
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,370
hundreds of pounds thousands of pounds

710
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:54,470
all at one time

711
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:57,619
I'm not sure that would work or not but

712
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:59,899
it's fun to think about actually or

713
00:29:57,619 --> 00:30:02,500
maybe not but I'm relatively certain

714
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:02,500
able to work

715
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:13,370
yeah well as far as co2 goes and ethanol

716
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:14,778
and hydrocarbons go I think the only

717
00:30:13,369 --> 00:30:18,528
real way that you could make any

718
00:30:14,778 --> 00:30:23,288
argument for any type of co2 would be a

719
00:30:18,528 --> 00:30:25,759
subcritical like kind of like the large

720
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:27,349
they use them for like washing

721
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:28,879
bulletproof vests and things like that

722
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:31,038
from the military you pretty much just

723
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,929
Huck a bunch of bags in there push a

724
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:35,898
cycle and because it's subcritical it

725
00:30:32,929 --> 00:30:37,519
doesn't really destroy your terpenes as

726
00:30:35,898 --> 00:30:40,038
much as you know super critical would

727
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:42,408
and it you know if you can produce a

728
00:30:40,038 --> 00:30:45,548
crude oil that's okay that way but any

729
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:48,440
type of you know supercritical

730
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:52,490
extraction through co2 I don't think is

731
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:54,950
scalable or responsible to purchase as

732
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:58,399
far as how much bang for your buck you

733
00:30:54,950 --> 00:31:01,038
really get hydrocarbons are fun but I

734
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:05,538
think they're a little bit too difficult

735
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:07,278
to do on that large of a scale people

736
00:31:05,538 --> 00:31:12,079
will definitely disagree with me but

737
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:16,339
that's my opinion I'm gonna agree that

738
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:18,699
the co2 and the hydrocarbons are not

739
00:31:16,339 --> 00:31:21,798
going to be the commodity producers I

740
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,808
think there's definitely room for all of

741
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:26,658
the variants of extraction technology in

742
00:31:23,808 --> 00:31:29,089
in the sort of the petite market but

743
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:30,830
right at least right now until like

744
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:31,308
giant screw presses come online or

745
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:34,220
something

746
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:38,960
ethanol is definitely the bulk commodity

747
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:41,690
driver and that's just how it is until a

748
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:45,259
new technology overtakes it and but

749
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:49,070
there are room for co2 boutique

750
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:50,808
technologies or butane unarguably

751
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:54,379
produces some of the best smelling stuff

752
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:57,379
that I've ever had so there's room for

753
00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:01,039
all the technologies but ethanol is the

754
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,269
bulk driver and there's some loose

755
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:04,368
patents

756
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:07,669
this but I've been wanting to build like

757
00:32:04,368 --> 00:32:10,038
a using an inert sweep gas to basically

758
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:12,139
heat that inert gas flow it through your

759
00:32:10,038 --> 00:32:14,450
stream of material evaporate the

760
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:16,758
terpenes and it's basically in a

761
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:18,379
closed-loop you condense those terpenes

762
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:19,759
in the closed-loop and then you increase

763
00:32:18,378 --> 00:32:20,418
your temperatures until you get to the

764
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:22,548
point of where you're actually

765
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:23,659
distilling cannabinoids and if you could

766
00:32:22,548 --> 00:32:25,489
do that in an environment that actually

767
00:32:23,659 --> 00:32:28,519
didn't combust the plant material you

768
00:32:25,489 --> 00:32:33,709
might actually have a nice little super

769
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:35,509
efficient extraction setup I definitely

770
00:32:33,709 --> 00:32:38,479
agree that ethanol was gonna be the

771
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:40,069
easiest to scale there's plenty of

772
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:41,929
people using their plenty industries

773
00:32:40,069 --> 00:32:46,338
using hydrocarbons but some of your

774
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:48,288
heavy hydrocarbons hexanes mostly but

775
00:32:46,338 --> 00:32:50,208
with those they're still going to be

776
00:32:48,288 --> 00:32:51,979
that extra step of winterization or some

777
00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:55,369
type of fat separate separation that you

778
00:32:51,979 --> 00:32:57,440
have to deal with with co2 I think there

779
00:32:55,368 --> 00:33:01,148
is a lot of utility

780
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,219
just not for extracting from biomass

781
00:33:01,148 --> 00:33:06,678
there I think the co2 has a lot of

782
00:33:04,219 --> 00:33:13,190
utility for post-processing of crude oil

783
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:14,690
for separation of terpenes co2 flash

784
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:17,749
chromatography so you're not dealing

785
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:21,619
with flammable solvents to recover which

786
00:33:17,749 --> 00:33:24,919
is one of the big issues now for the THC

787
00:33:21,618 --> 00:33:27,408
remediation from hemp distillate people

788
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:31,190
are using they're either using large

789
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:35,359
amounts of adsorbent or huge amounts of

790
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:37,190
solvents through rotor crumbs so I

791
00:33:35,358 --> 00:33:39,918
definitely think that there's a lot of

792
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:43,190
utility with co2 but there's not being

793
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:46,038
approached the right way it's mostly a

794
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:47,899
bunch of co2 companies that are seeing

795
00:33:46,038 --> 00:33:50,989
other people putting it putting a

796
00:33:47,898 --> 00:33:53,088
machine out there adding a couple bells

797
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:55,338
and whistles but not really listening to

798
00:33:53,088 --> 00:33:56,928
what we need in the industry a few of

799
00:33:55,338 --> 00:33:59,328
the things that like everybody thinks

800
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:01,820
that co2 turps taste the same and and

801
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:04,578
that's actually not true the the issue

802
00:34:01,819 --> 00:34:07,338
is that most people de carbs are

803
00:34:04,578 --> 00:34:08,838
material before they throw it into a co2

804
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:10,699
machine and so they've just cooked

805
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,449
mostly ropes and it all tastes like

806
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:18,078
hasha

807
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:21,289
so there's a man I think a method would

808
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,690
be to pull a Terp run pull your material

809
00:34:21,289 --> 00:34:26,210
out be carpet or have jacketed jacketed

810
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:28,039
columns that you could heat do your D

811
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:30,260
carb inside after you do your terpene

812
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:33,230
poles these are just small little things

813
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:35,780
that haven't been haven't been utilized

814
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:38,088
by the co2 industry and I think that

815
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:41,990
there will be a lot of utility for it

816
00:34:38,088 --> 00:34:43,039
but not in the processing of biomass no

817
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:45,529
brought up a really interesting point

818
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:48,139
about multistage processing where like

819
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:51,409
you can have I like to pull a Terp run

820
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:54,079
on co2 and then dump it in ethanol or do

821
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:57,858
a screw press and then do a butane

822
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,539
extraction or by using multiple you in

823
00:34:57,858 --> 00:35:01,250
order to get that like those all those

824
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:02,329
product streams and they're in the most

825
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,079
pristine form where they're most

826
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:05,269
valuable

827
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:06,950
you're going to need to Purdue multiple

828
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:08,750
processes and I haven't really seen

829
00:35:06,949 --> 00:35:11,269
anyone do that yet but it's definitely

830
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:14,420
something that's going to be a necessary

831
00:35:11,269 --> 00:35:16,329
step in order for a THC to be like less

832
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,740
than half the value of the whole product

833
00:35:16,329 --> 00:35:20,420
well people are kind of doing a form of

834
00:35:18,739 --> 00:35:23,149
that now like when they're using either

835
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,740
like creating a crude oil from co2 and

836
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:27,440
then they have to winterize and ethanol

837
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:29,449
I mean they're already making steps like

838
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,159
that a little bit but yeah further on

839
00:35:29,449 --> 00:35:32,568
down another weird one that I would be

840
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:35,509
really curious to check out a lot would

841
00:35:32,568 --> 00:35:39,409
be like direct distillation which would

842
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:42,740
be really crazy really crazy yeah well

843
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:45,649
what do you see is a way to do that well

844
00:35:42,739 --> 00:35:48,348
in essence like when you when you burn

845
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:50,750
biomass you can reconvince all that

846
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:51,440
pretty much or it's like it's like a

847
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,510
vaporizer

848
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,809
you know the nitrogen stream comes in

849
00:35:53,510 --> 00:36:01,880
yeah yeah just wreak intensive stuff in

850
00:35:56,809 --> 00:36:03,108
your volcano bag basically yeah all

851
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,730
right thank you so much I want to open

852
00:36:03,108 --> 00:36:06,828
it up for question these guys have a lot

853
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:08,480
of knowledge onstage so if anyone has a

854
00:36:06,829 --> 00:36:10,640
question for one of them raise your hand

855
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:17,800
and we'll get a mic or just yell real

856
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:17,799
loud anybody in the room go ahead

857
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:29,759
what about doing a mechanical separation

858
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,190
to conserve your ethanol beforehand and

859
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:36,900
then utilizing the ethanol or the other

860
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:37,980
processes for your post-processing and

861
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,119
I'm talking about mechanical when I'm

862
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:41,909
talking mechanical I'm talking about a

863
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,279
dry sift or a water hash first and then

864
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:45,899
utilizing the ethanol or you could even

865
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:47,430
like pull the material if it was finally

866
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,990
ground up you could pull it through like

867
00:36:47,429 --> 00:36:50,609
a cyclone separator and all of your

868
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:52,469
fines will actually separate and

869
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:54,539
condense and like a micron screen and

870
00:36:52,469 --> 00:36:56,459
then all of your heavy material where

871
00:36:54,539 --> 00:36:58,230
most of the trichomes and cannabinoids

872
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,599
have been removed would be collected and

873
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,369
basically bags and then you could sell

874
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:03,900
them to another processor to process the

875
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:06,089
lower concentration of cannabinoids and

876
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:07,530
and do exactly like you're saying take

877
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:09,690
that and use smaller volumes of ethanol

878
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:12,690
to extract it to use to answer your

879
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:15,210
questions specifically if you effing all

880
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:17,579
extract like a dry sift had then tried

881
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:21,630
to distill it something weird happens

882
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:23,250
that makes the oil really gritty and I'm

883
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,900
sure there will be a solution to that in

884
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,500
the future which I'm very winterizing it

885
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,139
when you do that

886
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:31,110
I assume so Willy bill did those

887
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:34,679
experiments so I don't have the direct

888
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:36,360
answer but something happens weird it's

889
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:38,239
a solvable problem I'm sure but it

890
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:41,400
hasn't been solved by anyone I know yet

891
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:44,009
yeah I have also not solved it and I

892
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,750
have tried it so I've done it with like

893
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:47,820
a lot of pretty much just like kief like

894
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:48,929
hundreds of pounds of Keef I know quite

895
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,360
a few people who break it down into

896
00:37:48,929 --> 00:37:53,460
ethanol and have success but I just find

897
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:57,240
it a huge bear because it's really

898
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:59,639
difficult to separate out like it just

899
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:02,939
it'll clog any type of filter that you

900
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:05,250
try and use any micron bag that you try

901
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,900
and use it will fill and then just keep

902
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:09,840
full and then you're talking about

903
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,550
longer exposure time of ethanol to this

904
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,550
net and it starts to pull other weird

905
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:20,028
stuff and it's just kind of a nightmare

906
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:21,709
I second that

907
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:25,039
there's a question in the back of the

908
00:38:21,708 --> 00:38:25,969
room why not use isopropyl over ethanol

909
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,679
at room temperature

910
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:29,659
those isopropyl is not pulling some of

911
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:35,869
the same stuff at room temperature the

912
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:37,939
ethanol will namely fats slightly more

913
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:40,789
toxic requires slightly more energy to

914
00:38:37,938 --> 00:38:42,318
evaporate and condense and it likes to

915
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:46,419
stick around a little longer to it's

916
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:46,418
it's easier air it's harder to evaporate

917
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:58,899
to lead down to an extreme

918
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:23,088
that's a great point so I think you're

919
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:24,828
about to tell me to restate okay so what

920
00:39:23,088 --> 00:39:26,509
he's saying is if you're gonna distill

921
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:28,910
it anyway you know the final product is

922
00:39:26,509 --> 00:39:30,380
not gonna have any final solvents in it

923
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:33,649
like isopropyl especially because it's

924
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:35,358
so volatile why would it matter if you

925
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:37,999
just use this often it's a great point

926
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:40,400
you totally can I think from maybe like

927
00:39:37,998 --> 00:39:42,558
a business standpoint you're trying to

928
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,539
market products that are you know a

929
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:46,609
customer base might be paranoid about

930
00:39:44,539 --> 00:39:48,229
how dice are probably using it

931
00:39:46,608 --> 00:39:49,998
regardless if there's zero point zero

932
00:39:48,228 --> 00:39:52,098
percent you've got the test to prove it

933
00:39:49,998 --> 00:39:53,838
the fact that you use isopropyl at all

934
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:56,449
you know they'll throw their hands up

935
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:59,929
that's the only that sunny and and I'm I

936
00:39:56,449 --> 00:40:01,579
don't believe that isopropyl is actually

937
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:03,889
considered one of the non volatile

938
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:05,929
solvents actually it's a here in

939
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:08,179
California I know that I know the

940
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:09,889
ethanol being used has to be food grade

941
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:12,769
anyway so I would imagine that there's

942
00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:15,288
some regulatory issues with it I've also

943
00:40:12,768 --> 00:40:18,668
heard that it pulls slightly more waxes

944
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:21,019
it pulls a few more undesirables and

945
00:40:18,668 --> 00:40:23,449
that's why we've stayed away from it

946
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:25,698
I've only used it on a small scale but I

947
00:40:23,449 --> 00:40:28,249
guess we've just kind of followed

948
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:31,579
followed everybody else's path NOAA did

949
00:40:28,248 --> 00:40:34,218
did did regulation push you towards

950
00:40:31,579 --> 00:40:38,239
ethanol yes

951
00:40:34,219 --> 00:40:40,668
after after it had pushed us away from

952
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:45,559
butane and to limonene for a while and

953
00:40:40,668 --> 00:40:48,918
we went down that rabbit hole it was

954
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:52,729
interesting it worked we did okay but it

955
00:40:48,918 --> 00:40:54,528
took some time to figure out yeah it

956
00:40:52,728 --> 00:40:56,649
goes back to those azeotrope so you're

957
00:40:54,528 --> 00:41:00,199
talking about can you can you talk about

958
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:02,570
limonene recovery using

959
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:07,219
what methodology you use to recover

960
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:10,670
limonene the way I did it was basically

961
00:41:07,219 --> 00:41:12,259
you'd need to ATO tropically distill

962
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:15,769
your ethanol so basically your steam

963
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:18,230
distilling or your limonene crude oil

964
00:41:15,769 --> 00:41:22,429
out by adding distilled water and a

965
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:25,280
rotary evaporator and it can get pretty

966
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:27,230
funky is like you really have to dial in

967
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,760
your parameters have enough water in it

968
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:30,619
because you'll you'll see it distilling

969
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:34,190
perfectly and then you'll see it the

970
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:37,309
craziest bump explosion that that brings

971
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,750
all of you yeah it's crazy volatile when

972
00:41:37,309 --> 00:41:43,099
it's in the presence of water and under

973
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:45,050
deep vacuum but we eventually figured

974
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:46,849
out a way to get most of it out but it's

975
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:48,140
still you're still gonna have a taste to

976
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:50,179
it if you're not just filling your

977
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:54,230
cannabinoids your lab probably smelled

978
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:56,480
so good yes until it mixes with ethanol

979
00:41:54,230 --> 00:42:01,309
and it breaks down into carvone and that

980
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:03,019
smells like black licorice yeah that's a

981
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:06,409
that's a 12-hour rabbit hole to figure

982
00:42:03,019 --> 00:42:09,199
out why your everything your your every

983
00:42:06,409 --> 00:42:11,599
distillate you're doing tastes like

984
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:13,460
yeah it takes like star anis and it's

985
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,839
about a 12-hour rabbit hole on the

986
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:16,699
internet and you finally figure out oh

987
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,769
this converts to this because there's an

988
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:20,599
alcohol involved and lime we need an

989
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:22,429
alcohol at Heat

990
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:24,110
it's a breakdown it turns into Carbone

991
00:42:22,429 --> 00:42:30,859
yeah that's a free one you guys don't

992
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:34,039
have to spend that time the the actual

993
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:41,630
terpenoid isomer is called Carbone or

994
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:45,050
carp Carbone CA are Bo in maybe I'm not

995
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:47,829
a great speller apparently not sure yes

996
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,830
sir the one in the glasses

997
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:52,779
[Music]

998
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:06,660
regulation regulation and livid pick up

999
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:08,519
it it's not allowed in the types of six

1000
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:12,690
license yes I've considered it

1001
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:14,820
yeah it doesn't allow it it's it's

1002
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:16,829
considered volatile solvent and ethanol

1003
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:20,760
is also considered volatile solvent but

1004
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:23,759
the they threw us a bone and decided to

1005
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:31,320
throw that under the umbrella of

1006
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:34,610
non-volatile solvent yes okay regulators

1007
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:37,650
don't know physics they're idiots

1008
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:40,910
but you don't know the definition of

1009
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:43,740
volatile solvent yeah it's defiantly

1010
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:46,909
ethanol is but they decided to not call

1011
00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:46,909
it that so it's easier to

1012
00:43:54,269 --> 00:44:00,119
it definitely pulls fat the colder you

1013
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:02,618
go the less fats it pulls but I'm

1014
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:04,480
there's usually gonna be me it needed

1015
00:44:02,619 --> 00:44:07,960
some winterization unless you're doing

1016
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,059
extremely small-scale extractions you'll

1017
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:12,608
usually pick up some wax maybe not

1018
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:16,059
enough to yeah I mean if for sure pulls

1019
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:18,009
chlorophyll because there's there's

1020
00:44:16,059 --> 00:44:19,389
water that's sparingly soluble in that

1021
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:24,220
so the water that's in it actually does

1022
00:44:19,389 --> 00:44:25,539
pick up some chlorophyll interesting

1023
00:44:24,219 --> 00:44:28,118
enough just answer that question about

1024
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:30,429
ethanol why it got dropped into type 6

1025
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,440
is because all the tincture makers in

1026
00:44:30,429 --> 00:44:34,739
California the small-scale cottage

1027
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,960
people that make small-scale products

1028
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:40,629
used ethanol as their extraction device

1029
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,579
like Rick Simpson oil it's a even though

1030
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:44,890
it's I think assets naphtha though yeah

1031
00:44:42,579 --> 00:44:46,480
but that the same kind of concept where

1032
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:48,069
they the state wanted to give those

1033
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,980
small cottage people a way to extract

1034
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:53,470
without having the safety around a

1035
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:57,960
hydrocarbon any other questions we're

1036
00:44:53,469 --> 00:44:57,959
gonna wrap up in the back there

1037
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,550
[Music]

1038
00:45:17,269 --> 00:45:22,019
what was the first part of question push

1039
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:29,579
your type centrifuge push your type

1040
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:30,030
centrifuge these asking has anyone on

1041
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:34,920
the panel

1042
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:38,450
I used a pusher type centrifuge like III

1043
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:41,490
it's like a continuous feed horizontal

1044
00:45:38,449 --> 00:45:46,858
extrapolate I'd like a decanting

1045
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:50,009
centrifuge but yeah yeah I've heard that

1046
00:45:46,858 --> 00:45:53,809
they leave much way too much ethanol in

1047
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:58,560
the biomass you have to mill down to

1048
00:45:53,809 --> 00:46:00,210
extremely fine fine particle size and if

1049
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:01,769
you don't you'll have flowing problems

1050
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:04,139
and when it's too fine you'll have

1051
00:46:01,769 --> 00:46:07,230
caking issues and you're also breaking

1052
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:08,730
open the cell wall so you're extracting

1053
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,400
a lot of things that you don't want to

1054
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:13,108
extract so I've heard that the people

1055
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,420
that have gone towards the decanter

1056
00:46:13,108 --> 00:46:18,239
centrifuges have actually been

1057
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:19,980
regretting those decisions decanter or

1058
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:24,179
push her type because they are alright

1059
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:28,969
okay push your type centrifuge to give

1060
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:28,969
reference big spinning drum oh yeah

1061
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:34,139
so a lot of those decanting centrifuges

1062
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:36,000
that are being used right now they're

1063
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:38,730
kind of made popular I think probably by

1064
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,929
Deutsche if you guys have all been to

1065
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:45,119
Vegas and stuff you see them on the

1066
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:47,159
floor and anyhow but the reason why I

1067
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:50,670
bring that up is is because that's used

1068
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:51,809
for the coffee industry and yeah well

1069
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:54,690
what I'm saying is is that it's a very

1070
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:56,608
fine material that they use and so it

1071
00:46:54,690 --> 00:47:01,050
doesn't really feed in the same way that

1072
00:46:56,608 --> 00:47:03,719
we feed the pusher type has essentially

1073
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:05,490
a basket very much like the Delta

1074
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:07,139
separator that you're familiar with but

1075
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:09,358
there's actually a like a piston in the

1076
00:47:07,139 --> 00:47:11,219
back that pushes everything forward

1077
00:47:09,358 --> 00:47:13,469
that's stuck to the walls pulls back

1078
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:16,529
allows more material to be deposited and

1079
00:47:13,469 --> 00:47:18,659
keeps pushing it out based on the fact

1080
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:20,519
that basket type centrifuges are the

1081
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:23,989
industry standard I would expect it to

1082
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:30,199
Prohm very well but haven't tried it yet

1083
00:47:23,989 --> 00:47:32,029
bars have you have you tried it alright

1084
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:34,189
the short note on that was didn't work

1085
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:37,460
that's all that self funding that

1086
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:39,320
doesn't mean it won't work though and he

1087
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:42,858
lost apparently a Honda Civic in the in

1088
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:46,099
the trade about $10,000 worth of yeah

1089
00:47:42,858 --> 00:47:49,869
yeah anybody else got a question they

1090
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:53,330
want to pipe in with before you wrap up

1091
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:56,510
amazing coming up next is kind of the

1092
00:47:53,329 --> 00:48:00,440
culmination of today's event and that's

1093
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:03,440
going to be a few of our machine guys

1094
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:06,019
our tech guys on the same stage as a few

1095
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,300
of the doctors that were over in and

1096
00:48:06,019 --> 00:48:10,369
clinical researchers that were over in

1097
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:12,890
the other room and and we're those two

1098
00:48:10,369 --> 00:48:14,358
worlds are now intersecting like I said

1099
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:15,829
before we've we've gone through this

1100
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:17,960
wave of cultivation we've gone through

1101
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:21,529
this wave of branding now we're getting

1102
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:23,990
into this wave of tech and clinical

1103
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:26,720
research finding out why we're dosing

1104
00:48:23,989 --> 00:48:28,909
the way we are why what changes need to

1105
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:31,039
get made to that and what conditions are

1106
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:32,509
targeting and most importantly the one

1107
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:34,759
thing that almost everybody in this

1108
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:36,890
industry forgets the harmful effects of

1109
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,050
cannabinoids on the human body which

1110
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:40,460
come to find out there are some that

1111
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:41,539
people don't talk about so stay tuned

1112
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,230
give a big round of applause to our

1113
00:48:41,539 --> 00:48:46,759
panel

1114
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:46,760
[Applause]
