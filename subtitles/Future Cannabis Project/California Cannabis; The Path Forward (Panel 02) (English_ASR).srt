types of vertical integration want to

16
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:12,780
touch a little bit on that but first I'm

17
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:16,799

27
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,799
required by the university to tell you

28
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:40,408
that I'm not here representing the

29
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,320
university animus because they still

30
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:49,229

in these 14 years we've learned a lot

36
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,909
from the patients who are suffering and

37
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,099
getting better from the medicine and I

38

McGowan I didn't even introduce myself I

55
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:58,768
am the director of Licensing local

56
00:02:56,189 --> 00:03:01,560
licensing and business development at K

57
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:03,959
Street consulting in Sacramento I also

58
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,479
run a Facebook group called California

59
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,299
City and County regulation watch we

60
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,399
currently have 7,000 members that all

61
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:12,959
reside in the state of California that

62
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,650
was important to me when I started the

63
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,709
group that and we debate regulations

64
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:23,159
every day all day it's a very active

65
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,079
busy group you may have to have me add

66
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:26,699
you because I do believe Facebook is

67
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,019
shadow banning my group at the moment

68
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,539
just like their shadow banning the

69
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:35,340
bureau so I don't feel like I'm alone

70
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:36,989
there and I I want to do something a

71
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,669
little bit different I love the way that

72
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:42,090
Laurie ran the panel but I want to talk

73
00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:46,079
a little bit about each of the panel

74
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:48,479
members up here's past the topic today

75
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:50,700
is the path forward and I don't think

76
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,530
that we can actually assess the path

77
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,869
forward without touching a little bit

78
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:59,430
about where each of these gentlemen have

79
00:03:54,870 --> 00:04:01,650
come from so I have heard Don's name in

80
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,680
the marketplace for a very long time I'm

81
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:08,549
definitely curious how you made the jump

82
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:12,359
from being a UC Davis researcher into

83
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:14,040
the cannabis space yeah well you know it

84
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:16,918
was it was pretty simple there was a

85
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:19,379
local entrepreneur that wanted to open

86
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,329
something in Davis we had a mutual

87
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:26,639
friend he approached me hired me as a

88
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:29,370
consultant originally it grew into much

89
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,829
more of an interest for me we got a

90
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:35,519
person reverend dr. kim rhonda cesar

91
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:38,219
involved who's been doing terpene rich

92
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:40,198
herbal medicines for 50 years and that's

93
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,500
basically what cannabis is the terpene

94
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,629
rich herbal medicine you may think of it

95
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,120
differently but ultimately that's what

96
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:51,918
you get and so he was he

97
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,569
is incredibly knowledgeable of how other

98
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:57,569
terpene rich medicinal plants were being

99
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:59,040
used and regulated and tested mostly in

100
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,620
Europe because the United States doesn't

101
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,620
do a whole lot of that and so we set out

102
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,360
with the goal of at that time nobody was

103
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,250
requiring testing there were maybe a

104
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,540
half a dozen testing cannabis testing

105
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,649
labs in the world

106
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:17,160
and our goal was to make sure that every

107
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:19,500
patient and consumer now was able to get

108
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,789
tested medicine that they knew was safe

109
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,699
and effective and had the right stuff

110
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:26,969
one of the early examples that I can

111
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:30,538
tell you we had a mother of one of these

112
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:33,240
uh dravet syndrome children who had

113
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:36,779
figured out that high CBD was working

114
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,340
for that kid she got some stuff she

115
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:40,918
brought it in to us said this is not

116
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,719
working I was told it was high CBD we

117
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,399
tested it there was virtually no CBD in

118
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,080
and it was THC and they were giving this

119
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:50,279
to their kid and that really solidified

120
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,089
it for me Wow thank you and gene

121
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:53,609
Talleyrand

122
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:55,909
I know that I haven't met you until

123
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:59,370
today but I've been sending children

124
00:05:55,910 --> 00:06:00,570
your way because I had heard in the

125
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,918
marketplace that you were one of the

126
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:04,949
very few doctors that would actually

127
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:07,769
recommend to a child so I'm really happy

128
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,329
to meet you and thank you for that and I

129
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:11,509
would love to know like how you made

130
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:14,969
that dive when no one else was

131
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:19,050
recommending the kids wasn't difficult

132
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:22,080
sigh I was trained in family medicine at

133
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:25,410
UCSF so used to seeing kids have been in

134
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,209
the pediatric emergency room and so kids

135
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:29,820
are patients and I was looking at this

136
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:31,439
as I started out and family medicine and

137
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:33,509
kind of transitioned being in San

138
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,579
Francisco to complementary and

139
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:37,259
alternative medicine is there San

140
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:39,569
Francisco's a diverse place the Bay

141
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:42,000
Area's and there's are a lot of people

142
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:45,329
using alternatives to your

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,709
pharmaceuticals and I felt my role as a

144
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:53,069
doctor should be to observe what they're

145
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:53,979
doing and guide them with science rather

146
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:55,719
than say no

147
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:57,750
you have to use the pill or you have to

148
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,120
go to surgery that's the only way here

149
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:04,180
and cannabis was just one of those

150
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,910
things that they were using I became a

151
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:10,300
believer when patients started throwing

152
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:12,370
their opiates away in front of me and

153
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,560
having a struggled with patients seeking

154
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,110
opiates have them throw them away

155
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,860
in front of me just convinced me that

156
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:24,490
this was truly a gift to us and we

157
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:26,710
should exploit it as that and and and I

158
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,410
have a lot of people benefit so I've

159
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:32,469
seen a lot of not a lot you know a

160
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,510
handful of kids go through using

161
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:39,160
cannabis with the ups and downs that Don

162
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:42,849
described and very excited to see more

163
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:45,939
regulation here but also concerned that

164
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:51,310
access has come down so there are

165
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:54,389
patients suffering again Danny this

166
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:57,310
industry is incredibly flexible and is

167
00:07:54,389 --> 00:08:00,550
remarkably able to pivot on a dime when

168
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,439
the regulations changed in 2017

169
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:07,350
prohibiting you're number one at an

170
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:11,500
edible product to the thousand milligram

171
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:14,740
edible you pivoted and and were able to

172
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:17,860
become currently the largest edibles

173
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,900
selling company in the state and I would

174
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:23,620
love to know how you did that

175
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:25,959
it wasn't easy you know everybody's on

176
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,730
an even playing field right now and as

177
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:30,489
hard as it was to see the high potency

178
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:32,710
go away I mean I had you know medicinal

179
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:34,060
patients that were using high potency

180
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:37,450
edibles to do things I get off of

181
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:39,639
opiates and I had you know even kids

182
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:42,910
that you know where we're using this

183
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:44,769
stuff for very valid medical reasons and

184
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,339
I watched these people turn everything

185
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:47,679
around

186
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,960
now unfortunately I feel like they're

187
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,599
kind of forced into an illicit market or

188
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:54,970
or other ways of finding it and even

189
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,210
where so even for some of the veterans

190
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:00,670
that were helped by my high potency

191
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,920
edibles we can't even we don't even have

192
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:04,539
a compassion program that I can give

193
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:07,389
them even a hundred milligram you know

194
00:09:04,539 --> 00:09:09,309
packages so that's a little unfortunate

195
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:12,189
but you know in this industry you have

196
00:09:09,309 --> 00:09:14,139
to be ready to pivot and you know I mean

197
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,390
you do a pivot on January 1st you do a

198
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:17,980
pivot on July 1st I don't know what kind

199
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:21,309
of payment we're gonna do in January 1st

200
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:23,159
2019 but you know you just got to be you

201
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:25,629
got to do your best to be ready for it

202
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:28,750
and same thing like I was saying on the

203
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:30,429
July 1st things you know what everybody

204
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,690
thought was compliant and then turned

205
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:33,939
out wasn't by the time you're putting

206
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:36,370
your 10th sticker on a package to make

207
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:39,010
it compliant you know you're gonna find

208
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:43,659
a way to do it right you know so it

209
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:50,169
wasn't easy but what we did it adapt or

210
00:09:43,659 --> 00:09:52,059
die Andrew I have a tough question for

211
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:53,069
you so I am gonna preface this what did

212
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:55,869
I do

213
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:58,810
okay I'm gonna preface this by saying

214
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:01,840
that I have nothing but eternal

215
00:09:58,809 --> 00:10:04,989
gratitude for Harborside I am a patient

216
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,240
and my father is the one that convinced

217
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,879
me to try cannabis as medicine and he

218
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,129
drove me to Harborside and sign me up

219
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:16,179
for your CBD class almost five years ago

220
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:17,350
and I you know I owe you like so much

221
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:20,319
for that

222
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:24,629
however there's been a lot of industry

223
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:27,730
rumors and speculation about the CDFA

224
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:30,730
issuing their programmatic e NR e IR and

225
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:33,879
2017 contained inside that report was an

226
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,139
implied 1 acre cap on cultivation four

227
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:36,789
days later the state released their

228
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:39,490
emergency draft regulations and the one

229
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:41,589
acre cap language was omitted one month

230
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,600
later your brother published an op-ed

231
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:45,519
and Leafly arguing in favor of large

232
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,070
scale cultivation that an almost read

233
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:52,059
like a confession during the legislative

234
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,990
session of 2017 to 2018 flurry spent two

235
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:54,579
hundred and ten thousand dollars

236
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,549
lobbying the Department of Consumer

237
00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:00,850
Affairs the Department of Food and

238
00:10:56,549 --> 00:11:02,289
Agriculture are besides spent another

239
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,649
two hundred and fifty seven thousand

240
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:07,000
five hundred dollars during that time

241
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:10,720
that's almost a half a million dollars

242
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,899
in lobbying can you tell me how much if

243
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,820
any of that money was used to lobby

244
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:19,629
against the one acre cap in the

245
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,300
emergency regulations well first let me

246
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:23,610
tell you what we've done for small

247
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,528
over the last 12 years of Harborside

248
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,300
because I think a lot of times when we

249
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:30,929
get into the weeds of an issue like the

250
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:32,969
one acre cap and Steve has written that

251
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:35,009
up at and you know I don't have a whole

252
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:39,450
lot to add to his statement on the one

253
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:41,549
acre cap where you know obviously

254
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,019
flourish is our company and it does lots

255
00:11:41,549 --> 00:11:46,078
of different things besides the grow

256
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,879
cannabis but what we've done for small

257
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,939
farmers have been really remarkable over

258
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:53,759
the last 12 years because we've been you

259
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:56,040
know as all of us understand the retail

260
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,078
is the end of the supply chain and in

261
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:00,179
order for the upstream of the supply

262
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,239
chain to be healthy you have to have

263
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:07,559
some powerful engines downstream that is

264
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:09,600
sort of driving throughput right so

265
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,399
we've done an enormous ly good job of

266
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,829
doing that with small farmers to the

267
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,049
tune of about 200 million dollars that

268
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:19,319
over the last 12 years we put in the

269
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:24,659
pockets of small farmers not big farmers

270
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,410
not giant companies not CVS not big

271
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:29,370
tobacco

272
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:33,000
not big alcohol small farmers 200

273
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:34,889
million dollars they've used that money

274
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,559
to grow their businesses they've used

275
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:42,000
that money to help their families raise

276
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:43,559
their kids put food on the table we also

277
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,230
have had a program where we've issued

278
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:50,129
micro loans for over ten years now to

279
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:53,490
small farmers not big farms they don't

280
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:54,929
need micro loans small farmers ten years

281
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,350
ago that's all there was with small

282
00:12:54,929 --> 00:13:00,809
farmers even today most of our cannabis

283
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:04,980
only 10% of our menu is vertically

284
00:13:00,809 --> 00:13:07,769
integrated today so we gave micro loans

285
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,899
to farmers up to $50,000 so that they

286
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:12,809
could improve their farms and and scale

287
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:14,490
up and grow more cannabis for us a lot

288
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:18,899
of those loans were never repaid I'll

289
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:21,149
have I'll let everybody know that did we

290
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:24,179
say there's some conspiracy among fault

291
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:26,820
small farmers to rip Harborside off no

292
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,379
we moved on to the next farm knowing

293
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,629
full well that you're going to micro

294
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:33,509
loan some of those loans are going to

295
00:13:30,629 --> 00:13:35,159
fail not because the farmers trying to

296
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:37,708
screw Harborside

297
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:40,528
it just failed it failed something

298
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:44,159
happened it failed so we didn't get paid

299
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:46,338
back did we stop doing it no still doing

300
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,838
it still doing it

301
00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:52,740
we also had a program where we gave

302
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:55,920
legal protection to small farms not just

303
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:58,409
for transporting transport docks but for

304
00:13:55,919 --> 00:14:00,360
the farm itself to the tune of twenty

305
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:02,179
five thousand dollars if they got raided

306
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,129
and busted we would send Henry

307
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:06,479
Wieckowski down give him twenty five

308
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:11,579
thousand dollars to protect those

309
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:14,819
farmers so Harbor sides done a lot for

310
00:14:11,578 --> 00:14:17,429
the small farmer we don't believe in the

311
00:14:14,818 --> 00:14:19,198
one acre cap I don't think that's the

312
00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:21,508
way to protect small farms and keep

313
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:25,370
arbitrarily high prices in the

314
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:29,278
marketplace you want to help small farms

315
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:32,269
waive the licensing fee for them don't

316
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:35,549
charge them any tax or lower the tax

317
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:37,259
lower these barriers to entry where you

318
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:38,639
have to have a handicap bathroom on a

319
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:40,230
farm that hasn't had a handicapped

320
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,629
person on it for 50 years

321
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:48,480
really let's lower the barriers to entry

322
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:50,850
these let's have a fund I gladly give a

323
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,810
certain portion of every dollar comes

324
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:56,370
across the counter or every dollar that

325
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:59,188
I send to a lobbyist to answer your

326
00:14:56,370 --> 00:15:01,589
question gladly given percentage of that

327
00:14:59,188 --> 00:15:03,870
to a fund that can help small farmers so

328
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:07,370
that they can get licensed or help them

329
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:09,839
if their farm burns down in a fire

330
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:12,539
happens happens a lot right now the

331
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,170
whole state's burning down we haven't

332
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:18,808
taken care of our planet so these are

333
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:20,879
the things we've done yeah where we

334
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:22,860
don't think the one acre cap is the way

335
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,490
to do it

336
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:29,579
did we I have no idea I I don't think we

337
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:33,149
spent any money lobbying that it was not

338
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:36,028
really something on our radar you know

339
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:38,970
these these we are only cultivating on

340
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:43,289
three acres on our farm right now three

341
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:45,750
acres so I think there's more creative

342
00:15:43,289 --> 00:15:47,159
ways for us to empower small farmers we

343
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,960
need a supply chain that has small

344
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:51,329
medium and large producers

345
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,990
so that we can make demand meet demand

346
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:56,940
and that we can have innovation and you

347
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,740
know I've been advocating my entire

348
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:03,000
career for a level playing field for

349
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:04,919
fairness and for small family businesses

350
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,769
to be able to keep buttering their bread

351
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:10,110
with this plant and I absolutely will

352
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:12,299
continue to fight for that in my role is

353
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,519
on the board of directors of CCI a and

354
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:17,009
as a thought leader in the industry and

355
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:21,240
Harborside will keep sourcing from small

356
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:23,340
producers we we value artists and

357
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,210
producers and local producers and we use

358
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:29,730
them a lot so that's a long-winded way

359
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,800
of answering your question I don't feel

360
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:34,680
that the question was answered actually

361
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:37,649
I have no idea if any of that money went

362
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:39,689
I have no idea I don't that's not my

363
00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:41,159
role Harborside or flourish have

364
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,300
anything to do with the one acre cap

365
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:48,740
language being removed from the CDFA ZAR

366
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:55,709
not really no not really

367
00:16:48,740 --> 00:17:00,060
ok Andy yes so when I googled you yeah

368
00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:03,360
the number two results that came up was

369
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:05,549
that you're a San Jose firefighter and

370
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,430
you were raided in Santa Cruz County

371
00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:12,419
Monterey County Monterey County yes

372
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:15,360
in early 2017 correct um I would love to

373
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:18,870
know you're now a large-scale cultivator

374
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:22,829
a nursery owner and edible maker how has

375
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:26,729
that arrest hindered you or helped you

376
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:29,159
to achieve where you're at today well

377
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:32,460
first off it was an arrest but they did

378
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,470
get I did get raided it was right when

379
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:38,549
we were in a big transitional period

380
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:41,430
from small scale cultivation going to

381
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:44,039
large scale cultivation right and it was

382
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:47,340
time for them to knock on some people's

383
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,599
doors who were successful in the

384
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:52,589
industry and who were known in the

385
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:54,240
industry really really what got me in

386
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:56,699
this industry to back it up a little bit

387
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,190
is yeah I've been a firefighter here

388
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:01,590
right here in San Jose downtown this is

389
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,940
this building is my jurisdiction right I

390
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:06,779
know it inside

391
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:12,930
now been a paramedic for 20 years I have

392
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:17,089
never had a serious situation from

393
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:20,460
cannabis 20 years as a paramedic alcohol

394
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:22,949
pharmaceuticals that's why I have a job

395
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,079
okay so that's right that's really what

396
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,340
got me in this industry you know so

397
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:30,569
that's an important thing for everybody

398
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:33,720
to know is 20 years running calls down

399
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:39,659
here in San Jose I remember one person

400
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:42,720
bad experience unedible not Korova right

401
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:47,060
took that patient to the hospital within

402
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:50,880
an hour situation handled right alcohol

403
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:54,210
pharmaceuticals I could go on for ever

404
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,780
in regards to that in regards to me

405
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:59,819
getting raided it really allowed me to

406
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:01,829
take it to the next level you know I was

407
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:05,970
successful moving forward with the whole

408
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:09,750
situation educated myself never had a

409
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:11,339
charge on me I had two hundred thousand

410
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:13,740
square for you to cannabis at the time

411
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:19,799
in Monterey County I was out there

412
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:22,079
alongside with Harborside and we fought

413
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:24,329
that battle you know and coming from the

414
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,730
fire department I always had to hide you

415
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:28,740
know hi you know what's going on here

416
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:31,259
and it really allowed me to take it to

417
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:34,920
the next level be on a panel like this

418
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:41,670
and represent the industry you know in a

419
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:45,690
really positive way and educators a lot

420
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:49,440
of people you know in regards to what

421
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:52,590
happened why did I get raided and how ro

422
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,320
I overcame that you know and it really

423
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:56,759
allowed me to push it to the next level

424
00:19:54,319 --> 00:20:01,379
sounds like we got a new social justice

425
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:02,039
warrior yeah that's well thank you yeah

426
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:04,470
um

427
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:06,869
so everyone here represents some

428
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,970
different facet of the industry and you

429
00:20:06,869 --> 00:20:10,459
know we are in flux at the moment regs

430
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:13,610
are changing day

431
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,529
and I want to know with everyone's

432
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:18,740
experience what has been your greatest

433
00:20:15,529 --> 00:20:21,740
challenge in 2018 2018

434
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:24,440
well category 1 pesticides has been a

435
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:28,250
pretty big challenge not having an

436
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:29,990
action limit setting it as setting the

437
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,339
limits to be the limits of detection

438
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,559
which are going to be different from

439
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:35,899
different labs means that a really good

440
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:39,500
lab with very high sensitivities is

441
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:41,600
going to detect those pesticides at much

442
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,519
lower limits and we have lost customers

443
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,809
that go to worse labs who don't detect

444
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,180
at those limits and I've talked to

445
00:20:44,809 --> 00:20:49,009
several other labs that have that it's

446
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,580
also an issue because at the limit of

447
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:51,440
detection

448
00:20:49,579 --> 00:20:54,799
you have your worst signal-to-noise

449
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,000
anywhere else on your operating curve if

450
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,349
you're operating at your limit of

451
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,839
quantitation you have three or four

452
00:20:57,349 --> 00:21:01,879
times the signal annoys that you do at

453
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,259
the limit of detection so the chance of

454
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,790
making a false positive or a false

455
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:08,150
negative for that matter are

456
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:10,220
significantly less what most and every

457
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:13,660
other analyte on list has an action

458
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:16,400
limit ISO and other accreditation

459
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,950
requires that the lab be able to

460
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,390
quantitate at that action limit and that

461
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,160
means you got to have the right signal

462
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,509
annoys and that's the way to do it and

463
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,460
that's why all the other analytes are

464
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:27,470
doing it and that's the way that

465
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,049
category 1 pesticides should be and

466
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:33,440
we've had battle after battle with

467
00:21:30,049 --> 00:21:36,200
clients and regulators about why that

468
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,990
really doesn't work in this kind of a

469
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:43,430
system and so that's that's probably the

470
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:45,549
the number one that I would list is I

471
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:48,320
think that the state should have

472
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:52,159
regulated the labs prior to regulating

473
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:55,549
the industry at the same time you can do

474
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:58,040
both you know the so regulators are in a

475
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:59,839
tough position right and I understand so

476
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:02,420
the Department of pesticide regulation

477
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,399
really wants to push those limits down

478
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:06,110
as far as they can

479
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,120
testing cannabis isn't the same as

480
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:10,519
testing spinach I'm afraid and so

481
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:13,399
there's a little more dialogue and a

482
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:15,289
little less adversarial attitude would

483
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:19,070
be much appreciated from the labs

484
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:22,210
towards the regulator's for sure but in

485
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:24,299
in in general they're in a tough spot

486
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,470
you know they're learning on the fly

487
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:28,319
they got a lot of people talking in

488
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:31,120
their ears telling them different things

489
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,849
and you know I think we're moving

490
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:37,419
forward in a good way but I'd say that

491
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:45,359
that is probably the the biggest issue

492
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:48,840
that is still on the table okay Jean

493
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:54,849
speaking for the patients I would say

494
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:56,679
their biggest concern is they're happy

495
00:22:54,849 --> 00:23:01,109
that regulation is happening so that

496
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:04,480
they don't buy THC thinking it's CBD

497
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:06,699
theirs they're upset that the shelves

498
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:11,140
were empty July 1st and that the

499
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:13,180
transition wasn't smoother they're upset

500
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,790
that there's a lot of people talking

501
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,170
about billions of dollars and they're

502
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:21,849
suffering and there's no medicine for

503
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:26,470
them it's hard to explain to an elderly

504
00:23:21,849 --> 00:23:30,909
person who's heard about CBD why she

505
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:35,319
can't find CBD on the shelves that's

506
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:37,930
reliable and as she enters into a

507
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:39,730
dispensary the staff knows everything

508
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:45,220
about getting high and nothing about

509
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:49,870
helping her arthritis or her cancer it's

510
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:52,150
tough times for patients but on the

511
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:56,259
other hand it's it's good that we're

512
00:23:52,150 --> 00:24:01,150
regulating good and bad growing pains

513
00:23:56,259 --> 00:24:04,000
yeah Danny I first off would have to

514
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:05,560
defer to like the first panel was

515
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,910
talking a lot about the barrier to entry

516
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:12,339
into retailers and the confusion or what

517
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,230
not of interpretation of the regs and

518
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:17,429
what is compliant and what is not and

519
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:20,860
put a lot of distributors or

520
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:22,720
manufacturers into a position of trying

521
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:25,809
to give almost legal advice to a

522
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:29,019
retailer you know with an asterisk I'm

523
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:31,960
not an attorney so I think that was

524
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:35,410
tough and then at the same time a lot of

525
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:36,009
the the labs you know I mean there's

526
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,450
obviously

527
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:38,950
and turnaround time issues I mean

528
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,170
there's what you know less than 20

529
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:44,140
operating in the state for what are we

530
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:47,890
five hundred or so retailers that's

531
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:49,210
tough and then just the differences from

532
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:51,490
one lab to another you know there's

533
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:53,259
obviously issues with with the standards

534
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:56,230
at each lab is getting as well as the

535
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:58,180
methodology that each lab is using so

536
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,829
you'll have the same exact sample go to

537
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,810
two different labs or the same lab for

538
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:06,039
that matter and get vastly different

539
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:08,710
results so I think that has been the

540
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:10,629
toughest in this kind of transitional

541
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:13,750
period that we're in has been the labs

542
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:18,070
and compliance you know mm-hmm

543
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:21,190
interpretating and ER for retail it's

544
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:24,789
taxes I would say is the biggest pain

545
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:28,269
point for our customers our patients and

546
00:25:24,789 --> 00:25:31,359
and just for for any heavy consumer of

547
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:33,639
cannabis right now the taxes are pretty

548
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,979
brutal and most heavy consumers are

549
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:40,390
probably not in the legal market anymore

550
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:42,400
and that's contrary to what we're all

551
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:45,009
trying to do here so it's been very

552
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,890
counterproductive I think the local

553
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:50,339
people and the local control has also

554
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:53,710
been a big big big problem

555
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:55,419
the League of cities and counties if

556
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:58,539
anybody is here from that group I'm

557
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:02,200
coming after you coming after you anyway

558
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:04,000
knowing you in that fight wrong you

559
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,789
can't have all this power and all this

560
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,920
taxation and then don't license don't

561
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:10,389
create ordinances create these barriers

562
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:13,810
to entries and certainly don't do

563
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:15,610
anything on the enforcement side so I

564
00:26:13,809 --> 00:26:19,480
think that's also been a very big

565
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:21,549
problem and and and there's probably

566
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:26,700
many others I could mention but but

567
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:29,200
those two things have really disrupted

568
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,269
you know I'll mention clones you know

569
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,160
clones the limits on clones of really

570
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:35,410
torpedoed that business for retailers

571
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:38,700
and and that business is either moved

572
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:42,250
into the gray or black market gone b2b

573
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,650
for the most part we're still able to

574
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:48,069
carry a few for the home growers and for

575
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:49,180
the patients and we'll stay committed to

576
00:26:48,069 --> 00:26:50,980
doing that but

577
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:53,039
it's tough it's tough to be in the clone

578
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:56,230
business as a retailer right now

579
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:58,750
definitely I would say from a

580
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:01,509
cultivation standpoint is the unknown

581
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,940
you know we've out in Monterey County we

582
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:06,629
started at a tax rate of $15 a square

583
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:11,110
foot you know a year later drop to 5

584
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:13,750
right but for two years we paid $15 a

585
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:15,429
square foot you know and it really broke

586
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,500
a lot of businesses out here and then

587
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:20,049
all of a sudden it changes to reality

588
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:22,299
but in the first place why did we start

589
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:24,339
where do we get that initial number

590
00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:29,019
right and we had to fight through it and

591
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:31,720
it was tough you know now testing

592
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:34,740
obviously is tough batch testing stuff

593
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:38,170
you know a 10,000 square foot license

594
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:41,710
which produces 2,000 pounds annually

595
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:45,279
we're having to do 50 tests on the same

596
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:48,190
batch that I run my same protocols on my

597
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:50,589
same integrated pest management on even

598
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:54,580
the same strain right and when we're

599
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:58,689
having to test that one batch at 10,000

600
00:27:54,579 --> 00:28:00,970
square feet 50 times it really creates a

601
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:04,860
big bottleneck you know and getting

602
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:10,289
product to market is important because

603
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:13,240
it has a shelf life you know so testing

604
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:17,700
variables airs been tough the unknowns

605
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:23,170
been tough connecting local and state

606
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:26,650
regulations has been tough you know but

607
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:28,990
we're all pushing forward I appreciate

608
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,740
events like this where we can all talk

609
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:32,920
about it

610
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:37,450
Monterey County we got together we

611
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:39,220
showed numbers we trials tributes and

612
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,259
stuff and we had a change which is

613
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,940
important because we don't want to break

614
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:45,160
this business we want to create it you

615
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:49,509
know and really get product to market

616
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:50,830
which is the most important thing so you

617
00:28:49,509 --> 00:28:53,410
know I actually do want a second

618
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:55,058
Andrew's tax comment that is brutal is

619
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:58,450
even from a manufacturer point of view

620
00:28:55,058 --> 00:29:01,329
you know with the local governments

621
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:02,819
taking 10% of gross I mean there's not

622
00:29:01,329 --> 00:29:05,418
too many businesses that

623
00:29:02,819 --> 00:29:11,849
do that and sustain that on top of their

624
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:14,970
license costs and and everything else my

625
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:18,329
biggest concern when the the emergency

626
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:24,058
regulations came out was the July 1st

627
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:26,638
deadline for the M &amp; A marketplace that

628
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:28,168
and I was so hyper focused on that that

629
00:29:26,638 --> 00:29:30,839
I just didn't even see the testing

630
00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:32,549
bottleneck coming as a consultant I was

631
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:35,250
you know really worried that we were

632
00:29:32,548 --> 00:29:36,929
gonna have an oversupply in the medical

633
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,819
market and an under supply in the adult

634
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:42,419
use market since that seems to be the

635
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:44,908
way that this is trending and now my

636
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:48,538
biggest fear is this December 31st of

637
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:51,960
2018 phase 3 testing requirements so

638
00:29:48,538 --> 00:29:54,240
I've been really staying on top of the

639
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:56,220
labs and calling them every week and

640
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,419
trying to figure out where the labs are

641
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:04,639
at currently we have 33 licensed labs of

642
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:11,759
those 33 23 are conducting phase 2

643
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:15,778
testing 11 of those are ISO certified 15

644
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:17,940
of these 33 labs plan to have phase 3

645
00:30:15,778 --> 00:30:19,980
labs by January 1st

646
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,750
some are saying they may do some R&amp;D

647
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:25,259
before then but we are a hundred and

648
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:27,569
twenty-four days we have a hundred 24

649
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:29,788
days left in the year and not one single

650
00:30:27,569 --> 00:30:32,878
lab in the state is currently conducting

651
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:35,158
phase 3 R&amp;D testings so there isn't a

652
00:30:32,878 --> 00:30:38,038
cultivator or a manufacturer in the

653
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:42,000
state at the moment that can try to

654
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:48,058
prepare for this that is my biggest

655
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,099
concern for the next year seeing that be

656
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:52,558
implemented I think is going to be a

657
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:54,089
catastrophe but I also want to know you

658
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:57,058
know if you guys agree with me or if

659
00:30:54,089 --> 00:30:59,638
there's anything else that you fear for

660
00:30:57,058 --> 00:31:03,960
the next year of implementation starting

661
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:07,619
with you well I keep hearing about labs

662
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:09,889
being a bottleneck steep hill certainly

663
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:12,509
is not in a bottleneck right now we

664
00:31:09,888 --> 00:31:14,009
seventy something percent of our tests

665
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:16,650
are turned around in five days ninety

666
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:19,279
nine percent in less than 10 days

667
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:22,320
and we're not turning anybody away so

668
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:24,599
it's but we do not yet have heavy metals

669
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,639
testing and our history has shown that

670
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:28,889
if it's not required by the state nobody

671
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,870
wants to get it tested until well we

672
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:33,690
didn't have we had you know people

673
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:36,029
showing up in June to get ready for July

674
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:38,910
and so we're planning on being ready at

675
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:40,829
least by December for sure but we've

676
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:42,480
only had a handful of people ask us to

677
00:31:40,829 --> 00:31:44,009
do heavy metals testing at this point

678
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,289
but we're looking at it we've so we do

679
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:50,190
heavy metals testing in Maryland and

680
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:51,389
Pennsylvania and Hawaii already so we

681
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:54,539
have the method we actually have the

682
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:56,940
instrument in place a little

683
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:58,109
infrastructure to put behind it but

684
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,759
we're not getting a whole lot of

685
00:31:58,109 --> 00:32:02,219
requests for that and we're not turning

686
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:06,929
anybody away and if you can't wait 10

687
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:09,360
days for your results that's our

688
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:11,759
ninety-nine percent limit but generally

689
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,649
speaking five days seventy percent do

690
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:18,000
you feel that the December 31st deadline

691
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:20,910
should be implemented for Phase three uh

692
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,089
I don't know why you would not if the

693
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:26,550
labs weren't ready you can't you can't

694
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:27,928
handle the entire state what if you well

695
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:30,960
we're not going to be the only people

696
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:32,820
that are doing you know heavy metals for

697
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,690
sure it every lab is in the same

698
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:40,319
situation until it's required and

699
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:42,299
believe me I worked I did testing when

700
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,210
it wasn't required anywhere in the world

701
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:47,519
for many years and you don't sell much

702
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:50,100
testing so nobody was stepping up to pay

703
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,960
extra for pesticide testing at Halon we

704
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:54,750
actually required you to get pesticide

705
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,370
testing we put it in free with your with

706
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,710
your potency test because nobody would

707
00:32:56,369 --> 00:33:00,509
buy it right and we could only afford a

708
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,860
single quadrupole mass spec so we didn't

709
00:33:00,509 --> 00:33:04,049
get the kind of sensitivities you would

710
00:33:01,859 --> 00:33:05,519
need for the limits you have now at all

711
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:07,889
but at least we were doing some testing

712
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,539
on it I and so right now I would say

713
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:11,910
that every lab is probably in the same

714
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:13,889
situation there might be a couple one or

715
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:16,290
two folks that want to do a little R&amp;D

716
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:18,000
testing are you gonna make the outlay

717
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:20,149
for the instrumentation and the people

718
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,589
and the training and the infrastructure

719
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:24,059
when there's only a couple people a

720
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:25,799
month that are even talking to you about

721
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:27,629
it and not much less offering to pay

722
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:30,059
what it costs to do that kind of stuff I

723
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,570
don't know I think there's no reason to

724
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,668
not

725
00:33:30,569 --> 00:33:34,980
implement regulations I've been all

726
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:38,880
about getting regulations in place since

727
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:41,429
the very beginning because you know here

728
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,620
you know what do we know we know that we

729
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:46,080
used to see all the time stuff claim to

730
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:48,778
have high CBD not have hardly any CBD at

731
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:50,519
all we saw that time and time again we

732
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:52,500
had people claiming they're not using

733
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:54,000
pesticides and then we do these random

734
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,929
tests but somebody else is collecting

735
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:00,028
samples in LA basin 45 samples 41 tested

736
00:33:57,929 --> 00:34:02,548
positive for pesticides all right you

737
00:34:00,028 --> 00:34:06,269
tell me you don't need testing testing I

738
00:34:02,548 --> 00:34:07,918
tell you you do I'm just saying

739
00:34:06,269 --> 00:34:09,628
regulations the way to go everybody

740
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,608
needs to be on the same footing people

741
00:34:09,628 --> 00:34:13,259
that are willing to cheat can't get away

742
00:34:11,608 --> 00:34:14,429
with it if people that are willing to

743
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,349
cheat get away with it and the people

744
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:18,659
who aren't willing to cheat are forced

745
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:20,519
to cheat to compete right and so you

746
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,990
drive some people that would do the

747
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:23,730
right thing and to doing the wrong thing

748
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:26,398
because they got to compete with people

749
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:30,510
doing the wrong thing so I I'm a full

750
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:32,608
supporter of regulation okay I am too

751
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:33,480
but you know it's also damned if you do

752
00:34:32,608 --> 00:34:35,250
damned if you don't

753
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,280
from the patient's perspective there's

754
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:42,300
access but the patient also needs to

755
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:44,849
know if there's THC V in the product and

756
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,980
that's not required patient needs to

757
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:49,829
know what terpenoids beta carry awfully

758
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:52,889
nit is an agonist attaches to the cb2

759
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:57,030
receptor it's it's gonna be critical for

760
00:34:52,889 --> 00:35:01,380
medical use not required so there are

761
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:03,630
issues with testing I don't want to

762
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,970
create a bottleneck but we also have to

763
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:09,088
think about the the safety of the

764
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:12,838
patient as well as the efficacy of the

765
00:35:09,088 --> 00:35:16,230
products out there and testing will help

766
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:18,989
us with that so it's important to

767
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:23,369
realize that as part of the MS we move

768
00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:25,979
forward you know I see the January 1st

769
00:35:23,369 --> 00:35:28,410
to phase 3 really that means heavy

770
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,300
metals as far as I can tell you know

771
00:35:28,409 --> 00:35:32,309
from my point of view at least and the

772
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,500
thing with heavy metal is is if there

773
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:36,328
was a lab doing heavy metals right now I

774
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,400
would be there tomorrow because these

775
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:40,710
grow processes are three months well

776
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,150
here's September you know you got to

777
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,800
change things around and most of the

778
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:44,389
nutrients set that I've seen people

779
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,730
using are

780
00:35:44,389 --> 00:35:49,639
heavy and arsenic and I don't know I

781
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:51,769
don't there's no data that I can found

782
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:53,778
about how much arsenic will be left in

783
00:35:51,768 --> 00:35:56,389
the final product at different stages of

784
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:59,630
growing so in my opinion the time is now

785
00:35:56,389 --> 00:36:01,068
to start heavy metals testing and if

786
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:02,450
there's anything I think people have

787
00:36:01,068 --> 00:36:05,119
learned about testing over the last

788
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:08,629
eight months is that you got to be ready

789
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:12,019
and you know if you see shelves are bare

790
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:14,119
January first because you know because

791
00:36:12,018 --> 00:36:17,348
all the all the cannabis had arsenic in

792
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:19,430
it obviously that's an exaggeration but

793
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:21,950
there's a good chance that you'll see a

794
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:24,169
lot of issues and a lot of cannabis

795
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:27,288
being destroyed just like there was July

796
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:29,389
first so please somebody start doing

797
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:31,490
heavy metal testing so do you think that

798
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:33,108
phase three should be implemented yes I

799
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:35,538
do even though I see even though it

800
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:38,719
scares me I agree I wouldn't have

801
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:40,880
changed July first you're not gonna

802
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:43,009
change isn't gonna happen until they

803
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,260
make until they make it you know in my

804
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:48,859
opinion so I definitely do think it

805
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:50,569
should be implemented Andrew you know I

806
00:36:48,858 --> 00:36:53,838
feel that I feel the same way as Danny

807
00:36:50,568 --> 00:36:56,210
and one thing that might help is if if

808
00:36:53,838 --> 00:37:00,139
we can have a little flexibility after

809
00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:02,679
these events occur and give maybe a

810
00:37:00,139 --> 00:37:06,710
little bit more opportunity for for

811
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:11,328
remediation or other solutions so that

812
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:15,170
it's not a total loss for people but I

813
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:17,809
you know I I agree with what Danny said

814
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:22,430
on this and I acknowledge it's hard I

815
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:25,910
mean we don't like it but I do I do

816
00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:28,308
think that looking at both sides of the

817
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:32,838
ledger were slightly better off if we

818
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:34,519
implement yeah definitely testing you

819
00:37:32,838 --> 00:37:36,230
know a positive thing in this industry

820
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:38,088
you know the products these days and a

821
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:40,639
lot of us just education is cleaner than

822
00:37:38,088 --> 00:37:43,880
ever right I mean I've seen it I've been

823
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:45,528
cultivating for twenty years and really

824
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,329
getting out there and the educational

825
00:37:45,528 --> 00:37:51,380
part of it the cannabis is cleaner than

826
00:37:47,329 --> 00:37:53,990
ever we are an enviro organic certified

827
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:56,809
farm you know we have two hundred fifty

828
00:37:53,989 --> 00:37:58,069
four thousand square feet we have clean

829
00:37:56,809 --> 00:38:01,010
practices

830
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:06,350
run organic cultivation practices for

831
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:09,110
ten years and still get dings on testing

832
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:10,940
that don't pass you know and it's

833
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:12,680
inevitable you know I've worked as I'm

834
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:16,730
born and raised in Santa Cruz I work

835
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:18,649
with SC labs since day one you know I've

836
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:22,309
done stuff with Hale and C pill all the

837
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:25,550
above and you know it's it's finding

838
00:38:22,309 --> 00:38:28,909
that fine line inconsistencies you know

839
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:31,250
because it's it's inconsistent right now

840
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:33,500
you know and it's it's a tough position

841
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:36,739
you guys are in you know when heavy

842
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:38,360
metals come to play you know we use an

843
00:38:36,739 --> 00:38:39,769
organic nutrient line which we're gonna

844
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,870
have to regulate that we're gonna have

845
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:43,789
to almost to be honest if you go back to

846
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:45,380
synthetics because that might be an

847
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:48,139
issue that we're considering right now

848
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:50,329
you know some of our teas some of our

849
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:54,259
sprays of bacterias on it that help

850
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:57,289
fight pass tests positive for micro

851
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:59,000
right and we're held to such a high

852
00:38:57,289 --> 00:39:01,400
standard it's like our practices are

853
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,190
changing when we ran enviro organic

854
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,200
certified farm they're getting so

855
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:08,420
strenuous and so strict we might have to

856
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:10,429
back off that a little bit you know

857
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,110
right wrong or and different you know

858
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:14,269
we'll adapt and do what we have to do

859
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:15,289
but we got to take all that into

860
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:17,989
consideration

861
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:21,679
you know the labs are changing we're

862
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:24,349
changing we need some leniency the false

863
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:27,349
positives are there you know from a

864
00:39:24,349 --> 00:39:29,509
cultivator standpoint we haven't in ten

865
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:32,929
years anybody on my farm used something

866
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:38,000
that is on that list but I've had

867
00:39:32,929 --> 00:39:41,809
negative tests okay so for me to lose a

868
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:45,170
batch for that it doesn't make sense

869
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:48,019
there's got to be a better false

870
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:49,730
positive retesting policy because

871
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:51,170
especially for the first year or two

872
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,420
because we're all learning right now

873
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:55,250
every one of us up here even though we

874
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:58,159
have 20 years experience across the

875
00:39:55,250 --> 00:40:00,019
board it's reality it's totally changed

876
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,710
you know and we're trying to be above

877
00:40:00,019 --> 00:40:02,710
board with it

878
00:40:02,889 --> 00:40:10,069
leniency in regards to that is reality

879
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,410
you know the cannabis is clean our farms

880
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:13,269
clean we have this

881
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,489
coming to our farm the county coming to

882
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:17,108
our farm when we get a negative test and

883
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:20,348
we say hey we don't even know what that

884
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:22,808
is there should be a retest policy and

885
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:24,940
not have our cannabis confiscated

886
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:29,619
basically you know and that's something

887
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:31,389
that's that's a reality out there get

888
00:40:29,619 --> 00:40:35,048
that done we gotta get that done you

889
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:38,048
know and so we have advocated we I'm

890
00:40:35,048 --> 00:40:39,548
sorry to cut you off no I'm just saying

891
00:40:38,048 --> 00:40:41,230
it's tight out there you know we're

892
00:40:39,548 --> 00:40:43,030
trying to produce a high quality product

893
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:45,130
we're out there trying our best we're

894
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:50,079
taking it to a whole different level and

895
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:53,108
approach and well III agree I think so

896
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:57,130
the example I like to cite back back in

897
00:40:53,108 --> 00:40:59,318
I don't know 2013 we came up with my

898
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:00,970
super duper residual solvent tests right

899
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:02,739
my volatile organics test that we

900
00:41:00,969 --> 00:41:05,108
started applying we applied it to I

901
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:07,029
don't want to say whose cup it was but

902
00:41:05,108 --> 00:41:09,869
you can guess that back in those days we

903
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:12,789
applied it to a cup there 140 something

904
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:15,940
concentrate samples were submitted and

905
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:18,309
all but three failed and the three that

906
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,289
did that didn't fail where water hashes

907
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,369
right so anybody who was using solvent

908
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:25,028
wasn't getting it out

909
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:27,430
two years later same same cup same test

910
00:41:25,028 --> 00:41:29,289
same number of entries they all passed

911
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:31,058
right once the industry was given the

912
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:32,859
information from testing that they could

913
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:36,069
use they knew it now I'll tell you what

914
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:38,558
we see chlorine chlorines been banned in

915
00:41:36,068 --> 00:41:40,449
the US since 1988 we see chlordane all

916
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:43,089
over the place it's in the soil and it's

917
00:41:40,449 --> 00:41:45,399
in the water we see it at really low

918
00:41:43,088 --> 00:41:48,969
hits but it's above our limit of

919
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:51,880
detection by the rules set in place if

920
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:53,348
we can see it we gotta call it a fail I

921
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,849
don't think that's the way it should be

922
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:56,769
there should be an action limit and

923
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:58,480
anything above that action limit is

924
00:41:56,769 --> 00:41:59,829
failing and everything below is not the

925
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,539
other thing we've advocated for is

926
00:41:59,829 --> 00:42:04,000
multiple testing we actually started out

927
00:42:01,539 --> 00:42:05,680
with two tests and and we were so

928
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,389
pleased except that then we were told oh

929
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,038
no you can't use we're not publishing

930
00:42:07,389 --> 00:42:10,269
that second test that you just look at

931
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:12,700
that make sure it's okay and then throw

932
00:42:10,269 --> 00:42:15,519
it away well you got two tests right

933
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:18,009
first of all you look at a plant an

934
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:19,509
outdoor plant or an indoor plant if it's

935
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:21,490
depending on the lighting but an outdoor

936
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:23,109
plant even in the sunshine the top of

937
00:42:21,489 --> 00:42:25,029
the plant is about 30 percent more

938
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:27,340
potent than the bottom of the plant

939
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:29,260
and so you now you're mixing you got

940
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:33,579
fifty pounds how many plants is that 25

941
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:36,850
there's a huge range of true values you

942
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:39,309
pick out any one bud right so sampling

943
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:43,989
is key but certainly big batches you're

944
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:47,380
gonna have more variability but if we in

945
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:49,479
most testing industries the minimum

946
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:51,599
number of tests you would do on some

947
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:54,010
kind of failure like that would be three

948
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,779
because with three you can get a

949
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:58,990
standard deviation and you can look at

950
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:01,330
the statistics and say am I sure that

951
00:42:58,989 --> 00:43:03,279
this is really over this limit and you

952
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:05,079
can use a statistical test to do that

953
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,660
right and that's the way that's done so

954
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:09,279
I would advocate for a minimum of three

955
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:10,599
tests not people look at me I'm a

956
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,860
testing lab you're just trying to get

957
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:13,539
the money I'm sorry I'm trying to get

958
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:15,460
accurate results right

959
00:43:13,539 --> 00:43:17,289
not a testing lab but our research

960
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:20,530
showed that we needed eight samples

961
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:22,869
forget Oh for the potency yeah for sure

962
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:25,750
because it's so heterogeneous yeah yeah

963
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:32,079
three is the bare minimum but people

964
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:34,869
don't want a paper - oh the only thing I

965
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,279
can say about the thresholds is so a it

966
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:37,690
shouldn't be a limit of detection it

967
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,180
should be an action limit so that's a

968
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:43,929
limit of quantitation at the worst right

969
00:43:40,179 --> 00:43:46,629
but the threshold there is no science to

970
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:49,059
justify the threshold in an inhaled

971
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:51,400
product so people are guessing there's

972
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:54,219
you know the amounts that people consume

973
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,990
are you know I don't know how those are

974
00:43:54,219 --> 00:43:58,029
estimated so these things are estimates

975
00:43:55,989 --> 00:44:00,099
now I don't know how to set those things

976
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:02,680
usually there's data that you can rely

977
00:44:00,099 --> 00:44:06,309
upon in this case there is no data and

978
00:44:02,679 --> 00:44:08,889
so I feel for the people that have to

979
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:11,409
come up with those limits some of them

980
00:44:08,889 --> 00:44:14,079
work really really hard I'm sure all of

981
00:44:11,409 --> 00:44:18,609
them work really really hard but there

982
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:21,849
is this tendency or attraction to just

983
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:24,550
be better safe than sorry set the limits

984
00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:26,559
really really low and not care that that

985
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:28,360
makes it really expensive and it makes a

986
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:30,579
lot of you know it makes it expensive to

987
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,769
do the test it makes it expensive for

988
00:44:30,579 --> 00:44:34,750
the people that are failing right and it

989
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:37,349
makes it expensive for the patient right

990
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:38,960
and is there

991
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:42,730
balancing that

992
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,590
the need for safety and not being sued

993
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:47,389
against you know the needs of a

994
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:48,980
marketplace that has to move forward God

995
00:44:47,389 --> 00:44:51,769
I'm glad I'm not making that decision I

996
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:54,800
gotta tell you and you know along the

997
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:57,889
the pesticide lines I had a lemon poppy

998
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,450
cookie that I had to actually pull from

999
00:44:57,889 --> 00:45:01,339
the market and everything and just not

1000
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:04,819
even put it out I couldn't find lemon

1001
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:07,160
zest to pass a cannabis as a side test

1002
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:08,690
I just couldn't find it I tried sources

1003
00:45:07,159 --> 00:45:11,750
I sourced organic I source everything

1004
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:14,720
and it couldn't pass a cat to pesticide

1005
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:18,199
we've tested the extracted essential

1006
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:21,619
oils of other herbs and found nasty

1007
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:22,879
stuff in it yeah so an extract but the

1008
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:27,889
lemon extract has a bunch of ethanol

1009
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:30,079
left in it so it's it that it the

1010
00:45:27,889 --> 00:45:31,519
standards for lemons are obviously much

1011
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,650
different than the standards for

1012
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:37,940
cannabis and you know this is another

1013
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:40,400
issue right where cannabis is treated

1014
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:42,889
much differently even much differently

1015
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:47,300
than highly toxic substances like

1016
00:45:42,889 --> 00:45:49,549
tobacco and yet and and yet you can't

1017
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:53,120
put lemon zest in the thing and it's

1018
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:56,650
just you know it feels like a quagmire

1019
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:59,059
it is a quagmire it's crazy you know

1020
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:01,880
well I'm really surprised to hear that

1021
00:45:59,059 --> 00:46:04,429
most of you agree that phase 3 should go

1022
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:06,320
into effect and I really hope that the

1023
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:11,690
state gives us at least six more months

1024
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:15,380
to get the labs prepared for this you

1025
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:19,039
know what I feel actually occurred was

1026
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:24,160
the January 1st testing standards were

1027
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:27,230
almost ignored and we had that 2017

1028
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:28,489
clause you know so most of the product

1029
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:32,960
that ended up on the shelves for the

1030
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:35,419
first six months was untested and I

1031
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,369
think that a lot of labs sat around

1032
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:39,440
twiddling their thumbs for that six

1033
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:44,230
months and probably burning capital

1034
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:44,230
because people weren't being for yes yes

1035
00:46:44,889 --> 00:46:49,579
but because the industry wasn't being

1036
00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:52,289
forced to use you and they had this

1037
00:46:49,579 --> 00:46:55,619
loophole and a lot of

1038
00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:57,389
your labs not yourself we're probably

1039
00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:01,139
burning capital that they plan to use to

1040
00:46:57,389 --> 00:47:05,190
reinvest in Phase two testing equipment

1041
00:47:01,139 --> 00:47:06,659
and then Phase two hit and we didn't get

1042
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:09,809
that reprieve from the state I think a

1043
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:13,710
lot of people thought we would and now

1044
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:17,429
what I'm seeing in the industry is labs

1045
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:20,400
that are actually asking their their

1046
00:47:17,429 --> 00:47:23,219
their clients to fund their expansion

1047
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,720
and they I know some people that have

1048
00:47:23,219 --> 00:47:27,299
actually done these deals and they've

1049
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:29,039
said you give me two hundred and fifty

1050
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:31,560
thousand dollars and buy my new

1051
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:33,420
equipment and I will make sure that you

1052
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:37,559
have priority and there are brands that

1053
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:40,530
are signing up for this and you know it

1054
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:42,869
is what it is I know Danny you've been

1055
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:47,400
offered that as well and you turned it

1056
00:47:42,869 --> 00:47:49,679
down and you know being in this type of

1057
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:53,400
environment and understanding like why

1058
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:56,399
we are where we're at I think is another

1059
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:59,570
reason I'm advocating for an extension

1060
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:01,650
you know let the labs catch up the labs

1061
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:03,570
yourself excluded we're sitting around

1062
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:09,329
twiddling our thumbs for six months of

1063
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:11,250
the year I think that waiting for the 33

1064
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:13,889
license labs to actually say that they

1065
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:15,539
have the equipment and are ready but

1066
00:48:13,889 --> 00:48:18,359
also giving the industry another six

1067
00:48:15,539 --> 00:48:22,079
months to utilize some R&amp;D testing would

1068
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:24,570
would would be a good buffer it's not in

1069
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,699
statute I but I still don't know what

1070
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:29,100
the avenue is to sort of advocate for

1071
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:32,250
that but but maybe I'm alone in in

1072
00:48:29,099 --> 00:48:37,110
thinking that this is a solution what

1073
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:39,900
solutions do you see that the state or

1074
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:42,780
the industry could advocate for to make

1075
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:44,760
this next year a little bit smoother

1076
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:48,660
than than what what has occurred in the

1077
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:51,150
last eight months well so first of all

1078
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:56,879
if if you tell me I got to buy my

1079
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:59,730
equipment in November of 2017 or 2018

1080
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,950
and nobody's really going to be required

1081
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:05,519
to buy that test for me until I don't

1082
00:49:01,949 --> 00:49:06,328
know July of 2019 I'm not going to sell

1083
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:08,159
anything that

1084
00:49:06,329 --> 00:49:10,079
so I'm still in the position I've got

1085
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:12,778
the outlays I've got the training of the

1086
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:15,209
people I got the infrastructure I've got

1087
00:49:12,778 --> 00:49:17,579
the lease on the instrument on panel

1088
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:19,919
that and I'm not getting it and that's

1089
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:22,318
why the labs are waiting till right

1090
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:23,639
nobody's asked like I tell you there

1091
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:26,518
aren't that many people asking us for

1092
00:49:23,639 --> 00:49:28,920
heavy metals we were doing some work

1093
00:49:26,518 --> 00:49:30,178
with an x-ray for fluorescence but you

1094
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,528
can't get the right you can't get down

1095
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:34,499
to the right limit so it was only kind

1096
00:49:31,528 --> 00:49:36,478
of preliminary stuff but the icp-ms

1097
00:49:34,498 --> 00:49:38,159
we've got it we're going to get it set

1098
00:49:36,478 --> 00:49:39,928
up it probably will be set up you know

1099
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:41,699
and just a matter of weeks and like I

1100
00:49:39,929 --> 00:49:43,739
said we've got the method operating in

1101
00:49:41,699 --> 00:49:46,108
other locations so it won't take long to

1102
00:49:43,739 --> 00:49:47,699
get it going but if God is there people

1103
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:50,338
that really want heavy metal testing now

1104
00:49:47,699 --> 00:49:52,048
come to us and prepay for your tests I'm

1105
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:53,880
not asking you I think there was a time

1106
00:49:52,048 --> 00:49:55,588
when our sales department was trying to

1107
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,239
work deals with people where they would

1108
00:49:55,588 --> 00:50:05,389
buy their own machine and we'd run it

1109
00:49:57,239 --> 00:50:07,619
for them or something I don't know I

1110
00:50:05,389 --> 00:50:09,088
mean these labs are in the same boat as

1111
00:50:07,619 --> 00:50:10,650
the rest of us we can't just go to a

1112
00:50:09,088 --> 00:50:15,838
bank and get a loan you know what I mean

1113
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:20,880
so I understand you know that I just

1114
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:23,728
wasn't gonna do it well plus kind of

1115
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,380
ownership issues and I don't really know

1116
00:50:23,728 --> 00:50:28,649
what it you know equipment donation

1117
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:35,729
means or if the bureau would not you

1118
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:37,679
know look at that as obviously we're

1119
00:50:35,728 --> 00:50:40,409
here because the 45-day comment period

1120
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:42,929
just ended I'm pretty sure that most of

1121
00:50:40,409 --> 00:50:47,338
you did submit public comments what are

1122
00:50:42,929 --> 00:50:49,858
you hoping and praying that the bureau

1123
00:50:47,338 --> 00:50:52,679
ends up implementing that out of the

1124
00:50:49,858 --> 00:50:55,139
comments that you suggested I already

1125
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:56,910
said the main one which was the category

1126
00:50:55,139 --> 00:50:58,909
one pesticides changed to an action

1127
00:50:56,909 --> 00:51:01,578
limit instead of a limited detection

1128
00:50:58,909 --> 00:51:06,028
that's a big one

1129
00:51:01,579 --> 00:51:09,959
the idea that labs are responsible for

1130
00:51:06,028 --> 00:51:13,170
all label claims in the language of the

1131
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:14,938
law or the regulation I don't know what

1132
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:16,858
that means so if somebody claims that

1133
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:19,170
it's got a calorie count on the label

1134
00:51:16,858 --> 00:51:20,269
are we responsible to verify that the

1135
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:23,630
calorie count is right

1136
00:51:20,269 --> 00:51:25,250
or the niacin levels I mean I don't know

1137
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:27,860
what it's written in such a way that

1138
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:30,380
it's very difficult for the lab so it's

1139
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:31,700
made the labs into the policeman we have

1140
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,990
to look at the label we have to

1141
00:51:31,699 --> 00:51:34,489
understand the label we have to

1142
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:37,159
understand what the terms on the label

1143
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:39,109
are meant to mean and what legal

1144
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:41,509
ramifications there are for making those

1145
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:43,220
claims which claims are you know you

1146
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:46,160
have all of our businesses in your hands

1147
00:51:43,219 --> 00:51:48,349
yeah exactly and we don't want that

1148
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:49,699
right we don't want to be deciding which

1149
00:51:48,349 --> 00:51:52,579
like I don't want to be the time I

1150
00:51:49,699 --> 00:51:54,169
didn't either but we feel like we give

1151
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:55,579
you results you tell us what tests we

1152
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:57,650
want we'll give you the results and you

1153
00:51:55,579 --> 00:52:00,650
verify that your label says what's on

1154
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:02,900
the COA that should not be my job

1155
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:04,400
and I don't want to do it and you know

1156
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:06,440
I'm not gonna be very good at it because

1157
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,630
there's it you could make any claim you

1158
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:11,030
know on there and we're gonna be we're

1159
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:12,920
not we're not in that game so that

1160
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:15,050
what's the second big one other than the

1161
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:18,650
category ones that I I would like

1162
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:20,180
changed for labs multiple tests but

1163
00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:21,619
nobody here wants multiple tests cuz

1164
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:22,730
nobody wants to pay for multiple tests

1165
00:52:21,619 --> 00:52:28,039
you don't want to pay for the tests you

1166
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:31,460
need so you know gene I know you were

1167
00:52:28,039 --> 00:52:33,920
very involved in in issuing comments and

1168
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:36,650
suggestions to the both all three

1169
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:38,889
agencies I assume yes yep yeah

1170
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:41,840
well we were concerned that they were

1171
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:44,319
you know the gathering of data on phyto

1172
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:47,750
cannabinoids and terpenoids

1173
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:50,780
as important and maybe you don't have to

1174
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:52,190
put every single one on the label but

1175
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:54,320
the state should be gathering that data

1176
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:56,990
because they're gonna be kicking

1177
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:59,269
themselves for not doing in the few

1178
00:52:56,989 --> 00:53:03,679
years once we discover that they were

1179
00:52:59,269 --> 00:53:09,460
critical in as medicine and not included

1180
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:14,659
on has something to collect as well the

1181
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:19,970
idea of this that patients who are sick

1182
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:22,159
don't have money and get make them to

1183
00:53:19,969 --> 00:53:25,730
jump extra hoops like get a state

1184
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:28,789
medical card for no apparent reason

1185
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:31,070
pay money for that just just still

1186
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:34,690
trying to figure that one out why why

1187
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:34,690
the state really needed

1188
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:40,849
you know I don't know that there's

1189
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:45,680
necessarily something that I want to see

1190
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:48,079
go through but the eliminating the CRP

1191
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:50,739
packaging thing and requiring exit bags

1192
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:53,119
I think is absolutely ridiculous the

1193
00:53:50,739 --> 00:53:55,999
exit bag requirement is doing nothing

1194
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:57,798
but filling our landfill and nobody puts

1195
00:53:55,998 --> 00:54:00,919
everything back in the exit bag come on

1196
00:53:57,798 --> 00:54:02,778
yeah you know so and in an in reality

1197
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,190
like I don't know anybody that was

1198
00:54:02,778 --> 00:54:05,719
complaining about having to put stuff in

1199
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:07,278
CRP packaging they put took the one

1200
00:54:05,719 --> 00:54:08,568
thing that everybody was cool with and

1201
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:14,119
changed it for some reason

1202
00:54:08,568 --> 00:54:16,538
you know so I would say I mean we could

1203
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:19,039
list 10 million things you know from

1204
00:54:16,539 --> 00:54:22,309
being able to give care packages to

1205
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:24,259
low-income patients again or just

1206
00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:26,089
samples to each other so we can learn

1207
00:54:24,259 --> 00:54:27,798
about each other's products and figure

1208
00:54:26,088 --> 00:54:29,659
out if we want to carry him or not or

1209
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:32,679
how to improve them and give each other

1210
00:54:29,659 --> 00:54:35,929
feedback like any any other supply chain

1211
00:54:32,679 --> 00:54:37,728
but you know generally I want more

1212
00:54:35,929 --> 00:54:40,159
people in the legal market and less

1213
00:54:37,728 --> 00:54:42,649
people in the black market and and that

1214
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:45,139
that's consumers and that's producers

1215
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:48,139
and that's growers and we have to lower

1216
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:51,108
the barriers of entry on both on all

1217
00:54:48,139 --> 00:54:55,068
sides of the supply chain for for all of

1218
00:54:51,108 --> 00:54:58,420
us and whether that be you know making

1219
00:54:55,068 --> 00:55:02,380
sure we are not over packaging things or

1220
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:04,909
making sure that were you know having

1221
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:10,130
different thresholds for testing that

1222
00:55:04,909 --> 00:55:12,558
are more reasonable or whether it is you

1223
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:14,749
know having tax rates that that that

1224
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:17,298
make us feel good about contributing to

1225
00:55:14,748 --> 00:55:19,098
the state into our communities but don't

1226
00:55:17,298 --> 00:55:24,489
cripple our businesses and drie people

1227
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:29,318
underground so and to take something

1228
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:32,199
pretty simple we've made it very complex

1229
00:55:29,318 --> 00:55:35,179
now let's start moving back to simple

1230
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:41,000
and that's going to be a process over

1231
00:55:35,179 --> 00:55:43,889
years of work but you know eventually

1232
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,800
it should be a pretty simple exercise

1233
00:55:43,889 --> 00:55:47,940
for somebody to engage their

1234
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:50,430
endocannabinoid system with external

1235
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:52,679
cannabinoids it should be a pretty

1236
00:55:50,429 --> 00:55:54,449
simple thing to do I mean we got a bar

1237
00:55:52,679 --> 00:55:56,579
over here serving alcohol we don't have

1238
00:55:54,449 --> 00:55:59,250
a bar serving any in cannabis here we

1239
00:55:56,579 --> 00:56:02,369
got a long way to go we got a long way

1240
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:04,710
to go even in our own event yeah and

1241
00:56:02,369 --> 00:56:06,239
these conversations are probably 10 more

1242
00:56:04,710 --> 00:56:08,340
times productive if we could all take

1243
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:10,229
that he has before we come up here and

1244
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:12,000
and talk to each other instead of

1245
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:14,900
drinking alcohol which is gonna make is

1246
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:19,800
probably a little more contentious so

1247
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:21,660
you know so that's the world I'm trying

1248
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:24,420
to create we're trying to create

1249
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:27,179
together and and and and that's what I

1250
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:29,039
would say to that yeah and I agree with

1251
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:31,589
Andrew it's keep it simple you know

1252
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:33,590
we're out here trying to recreate this

1253
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:37,050
industry take it to the next level

1254
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:38,579
create clean products for everybody and

1255
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:40,289
I could tell you right now someone who's

1256
00:56:38,579 --> 00:56:42,269
done this for 20 years we've done that

1257
00:56:40,289 --> 00:56:44,759
you know the cannabis the quality the

1258
00:56:42,269 --> 00:56:46,500
cleanliness it's it's changed and it's

1259
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:49,920
from the mindset of growers whether it's

1260
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:51,570
even the black market unfortunately we

1261
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,460
all know about that but the cleanliness

1262
00:56:51,570 --> 00:56:55,559
is better there and it's better all

1263
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:57,449
around and it's all due to education and

1264
00:56:55,559 --> 00:56:59,519
people trying to get the next level

1265
00:56:57,449 --> 00:57:02,219
but let's not create so many roadblocks

1266
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:04,710
where we can't create this product to a

1267
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:07,709
patient where they can go to a

1268
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:09,889
collective and be able to afford it you

1269
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:13,230
know I was very big in the high CBD

1270
00:57:09,889 --> 00:57:15,389
medicinal products from a co2 extraction

1271
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:17,639
standpoint and I couldn't keep that

1272
00:57:15,389 --> 00:57:19,170
company viable you know and that's one

1273
00:57:17,639 --> 00:57:21,329
thing that gets me is the emails I get

1274
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:24,360
from these patients who relied on this

1275
00:57:21,329 --> 00:57:26,579
product and as we spoke before they

1276
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,559
can't get it there from all up and down

1277
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:31,409
the state wanting to drive to Santa Cruz

1278
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,299
to get that product from me you know

1279
00:57:31,409 --> 00:57:35,219
because they are not able to get it and

1280
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:37,769
that's not our goal our goal is to allow

1281
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:40,409
them to get it give them whatever

1282
00:57:37,769 --> 00:57:44,130
financial assistance whatever we need to

1283
00:57:40,409 --> 00:57:44,670
get them that product because they rely

1284
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,980
on it

1285
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:49,200
they depend on it and we've created

1286
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:52,050
something where it's very hard to get

1287
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:53,449
that product to these patients and I get

1288
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:55,400
there's change

1289
00:57:53,449 --> 00:57:57,798
that'll be a little bit more lenient and

1290
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:59,930
flexible keep it simple until this

1291
00:57:57,798 --> 00:58:02,030
industry is more established because

1292
00:57:59,929 --> 00:58:03,739
we're all learning and me at the farm

1293
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:06,740
every single day right next to

1294
00:58:03,739 --> 00:58:08,659
Harborside every single day

1295
00:58:06,739 --> 00:58:11,209
they're just curveballs thrown my way

1296
00:58:08,659 --> 00:58:13,149
you know it makes the fire service look

1297
00:58:11,210 --> 00:58:15,949
like the easiest job in the world

1298
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:20,298
seriously and I work right here downtown

1299
00:58:15,949 --> 00:58:22,578
you know and it's crazy you know I never

1300
00:58:20,298 --> 00:58:24,889
thought it would be like that you know

1301
00:58:22,579 --> 00:58:26,720
and hey I'm a firefighter and I do

1302
00:58:24,889 --> 00:58:28,879
cannabis I like helping people

1303
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:31,578
you know I've helped a lot more people

1304
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:33,470
with cannabis than the fire service and

1305
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:35,298
people probably don't understand that

1306
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:39,129
and I've been a paramedic for 20 years

1307
00:58:35,298 --> 00:58:43,369
frontline I've had more people than

1308
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:46,190
gratified by the CBD the medicinal

1309
00:58:43,369 --> 00:58:49,369
cannabis than I ever have in the fire

1310
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:50,900
service straight up you know and that's

1311
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:52,700
enough set right there and that's why I

1312
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:54,920
can sit here as a fire captain here and

1313
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:57,858
be like hey you know I can finally stand

1314
00:58:54,920 --> 00:59:02,450
up and have some pride in this industry

1315
00:58:57,858 --> 00:59:04,130
you know and it's real you know and

1316
00:59:02,449 --> 00:59:07,098
we're all here trying to make it real

1317
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:09,309
trying to create it longevity get it to

1318
00:59:07,099 --> 00:59:12,740
the patients and all we're asking is for

1319
00:59:09,309 --> 00:59:15,680
simplicity let's not stereotype the

1320
00:59:12,739 --> 00:59:18,108
industry you know and accept the change

1321
00:59:15,679 --> 00:59:20,779
that's going on and it's not easy you

1322
00:59:18,108 --> 00:59:22,489
know I mean it's I could tell you you're

1323
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:26,298
more than welcome to come to my farm and

1324
00:59:22,489 --> 00:59:29,899
see what's going on but it's it's a lot

1325
00:59:26,298 --> 00:59:33,679
of work you know I mean I can't even

1326
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:36,980
tell you you know even yeah it's you

1327
00:59:33,679 --> 00:59:40,548
could feel me can't wait to go back to

1328
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:42,048
the fire station but you know it's all

1329
00:59:40,548 --> 00:59:44,000
about the patients you know we want to

1330
00:59:42,048 --> 00:59:46,068
keep it real with them and allow them to

1331
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,739
be able to have access to this product

1332
00:59:46,068 --> 00:59:51,429
you know and they don't right now it's

1333
00:59:48,739 --> 00:59:54,939
hard to get it to so we got to fix that

1334
00:59:51,429 --> 00:59:58,940
system you know whatever it may be so

1335
00:59:54,940 --> 01:00:03,190
again the title of this panel is called

1336
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:05,450
the path forward and going into 2019

1337
01:00:03,190 --> 01:00:07,789
right now we're about to wrap up the

1338
01:00:05,449 --> 01:00:10,460
legislative session for the

1339
01:00:07,789 --> 01:00:13,430
any bill that has not passed by Friday

1340
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:15,500
will be dead and we will be revisiting

1341
01:00:13,429 --> 01:00:21,199
you know some of those ones that failed

1342
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:23,150
next year I have what probably is going

1343
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:25,848
to be considered a pipe dream but it's a

1344
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:28,278
dream nonetheless and that is that the

1345
01:00:25,849 --> 01:00:31,849
industry actually works together on an

1346
01:00:28,278 --> 01:00:36,768
omnibus bill you know everybody from

1347
01:00:31,849 --> 01:00:39,318
patients to employers to small growers

1348
01:00:36,768 --> 01:00:42,108
to retailers you know I would love to

1349
01:00:39,318 --> 01:00:44,389
see our industry actually mature and

1350
01:00:42,108 --> 01:00:47,509
stop fighting each other at the Capitol

1351
01:00:44,389 --> 01:00:50,778
I work at a lobbying firm and I've only

1352
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:52,910
worked there for a year now and I don't

1353
01:00:50,778 --> 01:00:56,000
do the state lobbying but I hear all of

1354
01:00:52,909 --> 01:00:59,509
the drama and I really want to see our

1355
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,358
industry actually come together and not

1356
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:04,460
waste their members money fighting each

1357
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:07,818
other I think it just makes us look like

1358
01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:10,338
children and I want to know from each of

1359
01:01:07,818 --> 01:01:13,369
you up here because you all have a lot

1360
01:01:10,338 --> 01:01:16,038
more experience and a lot more time that

1361
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:17,990
you've spent in this industry is this a

1362
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:21,319
pipe dream or can it become a reality

1363
01:01:17,989 --> 01:01:27,318
and if it can become a reality how help

1364
01:01:21,318 --> 01:01:29,719
me yeah I'm going first again okay well

1365
01:01:27,318 --> 01:01:34,579
so pipe dreams are common in this room

1366
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:36,649
I'm guessing I've got a few my own yeah

1367
01:01:34,579 --> 01:01:39,500
so so it'd be nice if everybody could

1368
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:42,019
work together you know unfortunately

1369
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:44,298
politics are politics and when you have

1370
01:01:42,018 --> 01:01:47,209
limited resources and humans competing

1371
01:01:44,298 --> 01:01:48,829
for it's politics and man I stay away

1372
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:52,250
from that as much as I can but I can't

1373
01:01:48,829 --> 01:01:55,250
right so I leave what I'd like to see is

1374
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:58,460
is maybe a little simplification lower

1375
01:01:55,250 --> 01:02:00,230
some barriers I'm also of the opinion

1376
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:02,088
that the barriers now are so high

1377
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:03,230
especially for the small growers they're

1378
01:02:02,088 --> 01:02:06,739
all just going to stay in the black

1379
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:08,869
market and and that's going to be a

1380
01:02:06,739 --> 01:02:10,189
struggle for those that do go into the

1381
01:02:08,869 --> 01:02:14,028
legal market because now you're not I'm

1382
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:17,240
playing on an even playing field I don't

1383
01:02:14,028 --> 01:02:20,509
think that the public is going to you

1384
01:02:17,239 --> 01:02:20,899
know have much appetite for guys in

1385
01:02:20,509 --> 01:02:22,880
uniform

1386
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:24,440
arms with guns busting heads of 20 year

1387
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:26,630
olds again I don't think that's gonna go

1388
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:28,099
down so I don't think you're gonna beat

1389
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:29,360
them into the system with a stick I

1390
01:02:28,099 --> 01:02:31,309
think you're gonna have to lower the

1391
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:33,680
barriers put a carrot out there try and

1392
01:02:31,309 --> 01:02:36,789
get people involved and like you said

1393
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:39,949
have a collaborative I think having the

1394
01:02:36,789 --> 01:02:42,529
having the regulator's and the

1395
01:02:39,949 --> 01:02:43,929
department there are I gotta say there

1396
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:46,430
are some people in some of those

1397
01:02:43,929 --> 01:02:50,569
organizations who are not happy that

1398
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:54,769
cannabis is going this route and I think

1399
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:56,210
that affects how they interact with the

1400
01:02:54,769 --> 01:02:59,750
folks that are trying to make this

1401
01:02:56,210 --> 01:03:01,340
business work and that I think that that

1402
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:08,059
can be done better I think there can be

1403
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:11,600
a more collaborative approach to the

1404
01:03:08,059 --> 01:03:13,940
people who are already in the system be

1405
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:16,190
collaborative and not adversarial to

1406
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:18,050
those people because you're not being

1407
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:19,610
adversarial to the people outside the

1408
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:21,470
system it looks even worse to those

1409
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:25,039
people you see people getting crushed

1410
01:03:21,469 --> 01:03:26,989
and so on publicly or whatever in the

1411
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,460
you know when they're already in the

1412
01:03:26,989 --> 01:03:30,349
legal system and now they're they're

1413
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:31,730
outside of it looking in as an should I

1414
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:33,289
got to pay a bunch of money hire some

1415
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:35,539
lawyers to figure out how to do all this

1416
01:03:33,289 --> 01:03:37,730
pay all these fees and then they're

1417
01:03:35,539 --> 01:03:40,699
going to be calling down my throat in an

1418
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:42,530
adversarial situation when I'm just

1419
01:03:40,699 --> 01:03:44,659
trying to get up and running so I think

1420
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:45,680
the collaborative approach as much as

1421
01:03:44,659 --> 01:03:47,659
possible I think there are a lot of

1422
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:50,919
people in the cannabis industry who do

1423
01:03:47,659 --> 01:03:53,539
have good hearts and do want to do

1424
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:55,610
what's right for the for everybody

1425
01:03:53,539 --> 01:03:57,949
unfortunately you can't do what's right

1426
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:59,930
for everybody so how do you how do you

1427
01:03:57,949 --> 01:04:03,379
find that balance so finding a finding a

1428
01:03:59,929 --> 01:04:06,909
balance somehow is what we've got to

1429
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:06,910
work together on but I agree

1430
01:04:07,389 --> 01:04:14,210
I'm all for unity but I don't think

1431
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:16,730
it'll work unless we're we understand

1432
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:20,360
that there's two consumers here there's

1433
01:04:16,730 --> 01:04:24,320
the recreational consumer who's

1434
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:28,579
concerned about smell and taste and cute

1435
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:32,230
names and there's a radical consumer

1436
01:04:28,579 --> 01:04:38,150
that's concerned about milligrams does

1437
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:39,829
active ingredients consistency if we're

1438
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:41,059
going to work together we've got to

1439
01:04:39,829 --> 01:04:44,359
really see that there's two different

1440
01:04:41,059 --> 01:04:46,519
consumers here and if we can do that

1441
01:04:44,358 --> 01:04:49,369
then yeah we can work together I you

1442
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:53,869
know unity is always best but really

1443
01:04:49,369 --> 01:04:54,349
there are two paths and I agree with

1444
01:04:53,869 --> 01:04:56,930
that

1445
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:58,750
however at the same time I I'm a big

1446
01:04:56,929 --> 01:05:02,269
proponent of all uses medical use

1447
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:04,068
whether you know it or not you know but

1448
01:05:02,269 --> 01:05:05,659
I but I definitely agree there are those

1449
01:05:04,068 --> 01:05:09,318
that you know are looking at one way

1450
01:05:05,659 --> 01:05:13,009
those that are looking at it another can

1451
01:05:09,318 --> 01:05:16,608
we come together I mean yeah

1452
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:17,869
will we you know I don't know I mean I

1453
01:05:16,608 --> 01:05:21,009
don't think I don't think the the

1454
01:05:17,869 --> 01:05:24,500
cannabis user is who voted Prop 64 in

1455
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:25,880
who voted YES on it I think it was non

1456
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:27,170
cannabis users that were probably just

1457
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:30,740
tired of hearing about it on his leave

1458
01:05:27,170 --> 01:05:33,409
but you know the amount of opposition to

1459
01:05:30,739 --> 01:05:35,269
64 IO however felt a little bit

1460
01:05:33,409 --> 01:05:38,328
different I saw it as a step forward no

1461
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:41,869
matter what and you know work out the

1462
01:05:38,329 --> 01:05:43,910
kinks later I think it's gonna be real

1463
01:05:41,869 --> 01:05:45,470
tough real tough to get everybody on the

1464
01:05:43,909 --> 01:05:48,920
same page because everybody's not on the

1465
01:05:45,469 --> 01:05:51,149
same page so yeah I think it can't

1466
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:53,650
happen but I won't hold my breath

1467
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:56,660
[Laughter]

1468
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:58,430
well I certainly hope it happens I think

1469
01:05:56,659 --> 01:06:01,068
it's important for us to always remember

1470
01:05:58,429 --> 01:06:03,858
we're in the same community together and

1471
01:06:01,068 --> 01:06:05,538
we're all on the same team and you know

1472
01:06:03,858 --> 01:06:09,980
what we do there's an element of

1473
01:06:05,539 --> 01:06:12,859
commerce to it and unfortunately we live

1474
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:17,650
in a time where greed is the organizing

1475
01:06:12,858 --> 01:06:22,489
principle and and things are very

1476
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:26,950
competitive and and sometimes that that

1477
01:06:22,489 --> 01:06:30,798
that leads people to treat each other

1478
01:06:26,949 --> 01:06:33,199
contentiously but and it's very hard to

1479
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:35,869
get a state of this size to agree on

1480
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:37,669
anything I mean it's we have one-party

1481
01:06:35,869 --> 01:06:42,260
rule in this state and the Democrats

1482
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:44,298
can't agree on anything so it's just

1483
01:06:42,260 --> 01:06:45,730
very it's very hard time right now for

1484
01:06:44,298 --> 01:06:49,829
unity and

1485
01:06:45,730 --> 01:06:52,929
general in America and I'm hoping that

1486
01:06:49,829 --> 01:06:55,779
cannabis will solve that problem is is

1487
01:06:52,929 --> 01:06:57,569
is the more endocannabinoids systems

1488
01:06:55,780 --> 01:07:00,369
that we can trigger with this plant

1489
01:06:57,570 --> 01:07:02,500
hopefully the more unity we'll get over

1490
01:07:00,369 --> 01:07:07,539
time I mean it's it's the medium is the

1491
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:10,019
message at a certain point but IIIi hope

1492
01:07:07,539 --> 01:07:13,358
we can stay connected to each other and

1493
01:07:10,019 --> 01:07:15,730
care and love one another and treat each

1494
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:18,639
other with respect and disagree

1495
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:22,690
agreeably as much as we can it's very

1496
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:24,309
important yeah that's exactly yeah you

1497
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:28,659
know it's just educating yourself on it

1498
01:07:24,309 --> 01:07:31,269
you know what are the pros and cons you

1499
01:07:28,659 --> 01:07:33,759
know out here is is huge transition you

1500
01:07:31,269 --> 01:07:35,619
know the black market of cannabis a year

1501
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,359
ago to where it's out right now and all

1502
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:38,829
these people including Harborside who's

1503
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:40,599
really set the standard you know and

1504
01:07:38,829 --> 01:07:42,880
allowed us to really take it to the next

1505
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:45,670
level you know me as a small cultivator

1506
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:48,280
in Santa Cruz to where I'm at now out in

1507
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:49,780
Monterey we keep our same practices we

1508
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:51,790
just took it to that level because I

1509
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:53,890
felt like I could help more people that

1510
01:07:51,789 --> 01:07:55,869
way you know and have a larger scale

1511
01:07:53,889 --> 01:07:57,579
farm I go to their farm I know what's

1512
01:07:55,869 --> 01:07:59,410
going on in other practices I know what

1513
01:07:57,579 --> 01:08:01,630
they're doing at that farm and it's

1514
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:03,399
legit you know it's it's a great product

1515
01:08:01,630 --> 01:08:06,640
and if you buy that product I know it's

1516
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:08,320
good you know so it's got to grow

1517
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:10,599
because we have to be able to supply

1518
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:12,490
these guys like the Korova who need

1519
01:08:10,599 --> 01:08:14,650
product you know who need good quality

1520
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:17,559
product and sometimes these smaller

1521
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:18,909
farmers you know he can't go around to

1522
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,859
eight different farms that's when you

1523
01:08:18,909 --> 01:08:23,769
get in consistencies when you can go to

1524
01:08:20,859 --> 01:08:26,500
one farm and purchase and run your your

1525
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:28,750
product line off a farm you're gonna get

1526
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:31,988
more consistent product you're gonna get

1527
01:08:28,750 --> 01:08:34,149
a better quality product you know and

1528
01:08:31,988 --> 01:08:37,000
you can actually you know allow yourself

1529
01:08:34,149 --> 01:08:39,939
to grow and create and take it to that

1530
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,890
next level so there's a place for large

1531
01:08:39,939 --> 01:08:44,199
scale and small scale just like any

1532
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:46,239
business out here you know and people

1533
01:08:44,199 --> 01:08:48,159
need to understand that you know I've

1534
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:49,838
gone both ends of it and I think there's

1535
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:53,199
pros and cons to both of them it's just

1536
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:55,509
really understanding it and no harm no

1537
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:58,599
foul for cannabis you know if I had a

1538
01:08:55,509 --> 01:08:59,560
joint in my paramedic drug box I would

1539
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,850
probably be

1540
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:02,890
number one medicine I could use for

1541
01:09:00,850 --> 01:09:05,109
these patients out here who are taking I

1542
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:07,150
walk into a house and they just dropped

1543
01:09:05,109 --> 01:09:08,410
ten medications on me and that's like

1544
01:09:07,149 --> 01:09:09,729
why are you taking all that well this

1545
01:09:08,409 --> 01:09:11,139
one helps this one but I have to take

1546
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:14,349
this one cuz I take this one and

1547
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:17,020
literally I look at them all in cannabis

1548
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:18,490
could resolve it no harm no foul you

1549
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:21,970
know and I'm not even a consumer of

1550
01:09:18,489 --> 01:09:23,529
cannabis but it's it's there it's real

1551
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:25,810
and people just have to understand it

1552
01:09:23,529 --> 01:09:28,389
and accept it and and the reality is

1553
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:31,440
it's the most beneficial thing out there

1554
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:35,140
and the cleanest product out there so

1555
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:37,299
coming home the paramedic and I think

1556
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:39,010
also along here along your original

1557
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:40,239
question the coming together I think we

1558
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:41,949
do see a lot of people coming together

1559
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:44,139
with a common goal when it comes to

1560
01:09:41,949 --> 01:09:44,920
local municipalities right now and the

1561
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:46,510
reason they're doing that is because

1562
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:48,699
they had to they knew they couldn't

1563
01:09:46,510 --> 01:09:50,409
without getting their local government

1564
01:09:48,699 --> 01:09:52,929
on board with what they were all trying

1565
01:09:50,409 --> 01:09:55,329
to collectively do they can't be a part

1566
01:09:52,930 --> 01:10:00,700
of the regulated market so I did see a

1567
01:09:55,329 --> 01:10:01,750
lot of you know retail alliances and and

1568
01:10:00,699 --> 01:10:03,880
stuff like that

1569
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:05,199
I'm coming together locally which was

1570
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:08,230
good to see so I think on a smaller

1571
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:09,970
scale we are coming together it's just a

1572
01:10:08,229 --> 01:10:13,449
question of if you can go larger scale

1573
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:16,090
than how you know okay well we're gonna

1574
01:10:13,449 --> 01:10:18,279
wrap it up with my questions and we're

1575
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:21,400
gonna open it up to the audience you all

1576
01:10:18,279 --> 01:10:24,130
have to go help make medical cannabis

1577
01:10:21,399 --> 01:10:27,309
work for a number of different reasons

1578
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:30,460
we do have significant health challenges

1579
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:32,500
we have an opioid epidemic medical and

1580
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:35,590
adult use are going to be working hand

1581
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:38,800
in hand the supplies the way things work

1582
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:41,170
the way we interrelate we're working

1583
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:46,060
with the same sort of compounds we just

1584
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:47,770
have different customers so just just

1585
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:50,350
think about that we're gonna be solving

1586
01:10:47,770 --> 01:10:53,500
some big problems here and everybody up

1587
01:10:50,350 --> 01:10:55,660
here as definitely is contributed more

1588
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:58,149
than their fair share in trying to

1589
01:10:55,659 --> 01:10:59,349
accomplish big things so you're a lot of

1590
01:10:58,149 --> 01:11:00,399
this is entrepreneurs we're all trying

1591
01:10:59,350 --> 01:11:02,020
to get our business started we're

1592
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:04,659
frustrated we're all going through these

1593
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:08,200
catch 420s keep moving forward with the

1594
01:11:04,659 --> 01:11:10,779
catch for 20s raise the bar as much as

1595
01:11:08,199 --> 01:11:12,159
you possibly can you're eventually going

1596
01:11:10,779 --> 01:11:13,210
to have patients who are going to be

1597
01:11:12,159 --> 01:11:14,500
relying on you

1598
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:17,948
and that's just the way it's going to be

1599
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:20,469
even if it is the adult use or if it's a

1600
01:11:17,948 --> 01:11:23,729
very significantly serious patient I

1601
01:11:20,469 --> 01:11:25,719
guess my question here is I'm very

1602
01:11:23,729 --> 01:11:26,948
interested in taxes and what we're

1603
01:11:25,719 --> 01:11:28,300
trying to do is we're gonna try to

1604
01:11:26,948 --> 01:11:30,069
figure out how we're going to be able to

1605
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:32,289
subsidize some of these clinical trials

1606
01:11:30,069 --> 01:11:34,448
that we need to do they're very

1607
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:36,658
expensive as a drug developer we have a

1608
01:11:34,448 --> 01:11:38,619
problem with a billion dollars a

1609
01:11:36,658 --> 01:11:40,809
essentially a billion dollars in order

1610
01:11:38,619 --> 01:11:44,140
to develop one drug we now have a broad

1611
01:11:40,810 --> 01:11:48,100
spectrum compound that that is going to

1612
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:51,400
be very much contributing to a reduction

1613
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:54,489
in our healthcare costs overall as well

1614
01:11:51,399 --> 01:11:55,869
as well is really affecting a very some

1615
01:11:54,488 --> 01:11:59,500
crisis that we're doing in health care

1616
01:11:55,869 --> 01:12:01,479
so the question is for each of you given

1617
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:04,210
your experience in the industry what is

1618
01:12:01,479 --> 01:12:08,349
the what do you think will be the best

1619
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:12,609
way for us to bring a bring on the

1620
01:12:08,350 --> 01:12:14,350
doctors bring in our our scientists get

1621
01:12:12,609 --> 01:12:16,029
our get our get our folks that really

1622
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:18,850
have to dial into and take their

1623
01:12:16,029 --> 01:12:21,279
expertise and then come in and help this

1624
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:23,920
field we do have a problem with getting

1625
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:26,738
patients coming into this field and and

1626
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:29,310
and coming into a dispensary and and and

1627
01:12:26,738 --> 01:12:32,369
being able to say yes I need help so

1628
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:34,989
that's really a question that I have

1629
01:12:32,369 --> 01:12:37,569
what do we need to be doing in order to

1630
01:12:34,988 --> 01:12:39,279
make that happen because there's a lot

1631
01:12:37,569 --> 01:12:40,899
of people suffering and they're not

1632
01:12:39,279 --> 01:12:42,519
walking in dispensary and they're not

1633
01:12:40,899 --> 01:12:44,829
accessing this medicine the way they

1634
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:47,520
need to and and and what do we need to

1635
01:12:44,829 --> 01:12:50,800
be doing to encourage that process I

1636
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:55,330
feel like we are doing it currently by

1637
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:56,920
legalizing and making it a little more

1638
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:58,479
socially acceptable even though to

1639
01:12:56,920 --> 01:13:01,270
Andrews point we have a bar and not a

1640
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:04,689
Deb bar it is becoming more socially

1641
01:13:01,270 --> 01:13:07,210
acceptable and I and I feel like people

1642
01:13:04,689 --> 01:13:09,819
are talking about it more than they were

1643
01:13:07,210 --> 01:13:12,100
it may not be where it needs to be but

1644
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:15,729
but I do think that we're on a good path

1645
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:17,320
as however I think the state combining

1646
01:13:15,729 --> 01:13:20,619
medical and doll use was the worst thing

1647
01:13:17,319 --> 01:13:22,869
that possibly could have done so we have

1648
01:13:20,619 --> 01:13:24,939
no medical program and that is I think

1649
01:13:22,869 --> 01:13:27,010
the root of the problem in California

1650
01:13:24,939 --> 01:13:29,049
but as far as getting people to

1651
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:30,460
be okay with using it as a medicine and

1652
01:13:29,050 --> 01:13:33,099
going into a dispensary I think we're on

1653
01:13:30,460 --> 01:13:34,779
that the right path there got to make it

1654
01:13:33,099 --> 01:13:37,000
affordable you know you got to allow us

1655
01:13:34,779 --> 01:13:38,768
to get those products out there you know

1656
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,349
I mean I had to shut down my whole

1657
01:13:38,769 --> 01:13:42,670
medicinal line and all these emails we

1658
01:13:41,349 --> 01:13:44,710
get is people can't afford it now

1659
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:46,779
because insurance doesn't cover it right

1660
01:13:44,710 --> 01:13:50,469
so you got to come in there and pay for

1661
01:13:46,779 --> 01:13:52,000
it right and it's for what it costs us

1662
01:13:50,469 --> 01:13:53,859
to get product to market right now

1663
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,019
unfortunately it takes it out of the

1664
01:13:53,859 --> 01:13:59,098
rain for these patients right where they

1665
01:13:56,019 --> 01:14:03,210
could go get vicodin for a $10 copay

1666
01:13:59,099 --> 01:14:05,199
right so you know it's bang for the buck

1667
01:14:03,210 --> 01:14:06,250
unfortunately that's what drives people

1668
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:09,219
right

1669
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:12,219
you're gonna go spend $60 $70 for a gram

1670
01:14:09,219 --> 01:14:14,288
of high CBD cannabis or you go through

1671
01:14:12,219 --> 01:14:16,868
your insurance Medicare whatever it is

1672
01:14:14,288 --> 01:14:19,809
and here's 30 vicodin just call a phone

1673
01:14:16,868 --> 01:14:22,359
number and get a refill right so it's

1674
01:14:19,809 --> 01:14:24,880
getting that to the collective's like

1675
01:14:22,359 --> 01:14:26,348
the Harborside you know emails all day

1676
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:29,469
every day right now is where's all the

1677
01:14:26,349 --> 01:14:31,989
CBD you know the reason is it takes it's

1678
01:14:29,469 --> 01:14:34,929
very it costs a lot of money for us to

1679
01:14:31,988 --> 01:14:38,288
create CBD it really does I've done a

1680
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:40,059
lot of it you know and unfortunately

1681
01:14:38,288 --> 01:14:42,939
it's too much we can't even get it to

1682
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:46,659
market right now right you know CBD a

1683
01:14:42,939 --> 01:14:51,279
gram is a day supply according to Rafael

1684
01:14:46,658 --> 01:14:52,988
and the children right so $60 a day is

1685
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:54,399
not doable for the patient you're

1686
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:56,828
absolutely right it's got a drop

1687
01:14:54,399 --> 01:14:59,649
tremendously oh yes at the point where

1688
01:14:56,828 --> 01:15:04,538
they are paying 20 cents for hundred

1689
01:14:59,649 --> 01:15:07,058
milligrams that and I think that comes

1690
01:15:04,538 --> 01:15:10,779
from educating the industry and having

1691
01:15:07,059 --> 01:15:14,650
the industry advocate for increased

1692
01:15:10,779 --> 01:15:17,649
grows to reduce the cost the CBD right

1693
01:15:14,649 --> 01:15:20,288
now CBDs more expensive than THC yeah

1694
01:15:17,649 --> 01:15:23,170
but it you acquire more of it than th

1695
01:15:20,288 --> 01:15:24,759
see for the segment for efficacy so and

1696
01:15:23,170 --> 01:15:27,609
we're not going to be able to do that if

1697
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:31,079
we have something like a one acre cap no

1698
01:15:27,609 --> 01:15:36,460
not going to be able to do it I'm sorry

1699
01:15:31,078 --> 01:15:39,559
you're not so I

1700
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:41,868
there's a lot we have to do one of the

1701
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:45,590
things I'll remind folks at least at

1702
01:15:41,868 --> 01:15:48,319
Harborside every product at every ratio

1703
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:50,750
that you could get before January 1st

1704
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:52,309
you can get right now at Harborside you

1705

products are still there yes they're a

1709
01:16:01,609 --> 01:16:08,408
lot more expensive and that sucks but

1710
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:08,408
the product is there ok

1711
01:16:08,679 --> 01:16:14,179
you could come in the harbor side and

1712
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:17,329
you could talk to one of our consultants

1713
01:16:14,179 --> 01:16:22,908
for 3 hours and not buy anything and

1714
01:16:17,328 --> 01:16:25,639
learn anything you want to learn so that

1715
01:16:22,908 --> 01:16:27,229
access is there it's free come in well

1716
01:16:25,639 --> 01:16:28,909
we'll talk to you about cannabis all day

1717
01:16:27,229 --> 01:16:31,428
long we love talking about cannabis I

1718
01:16:28,908 --> 01:16:35,569
will show you lab reports will will give

1719
01:16:31,429 --> 01:16:38,210
you materials from steep hill you know

1720
01:16:35,569 --> 01:16:40,519
it's it's it's all right there the

1721
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:43,039
information is really quite accessible

1722
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:46,790
for patients right now it's confusing

1723
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:49,310
some of it it contradicts each other ok

1724
01:16:46,789 --> 01:16:51,469
but there is there is information that

1725
01:16:49,310 --> 01:16:53,900
was sativa indica I mean I go into every

1726
01:16:51,469 --> 01:16:56,328
store United sativa and indica what is

1727
01:16:53,899 --> 01:17:05,089
that what does that to do with anything

1728
01:16:56,328 --> 01:17:06,349
porno McLean is all content doesn't have

1729
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:12,349
anything to do with the shape of the

1730
01:17:06,349 --> 01:17:13,760
plant right I think every every flower

1731
01:17:12,349 --> 01:17:16,578
you buy should come with a with a

1732
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:19,010
complete terpene breakup the only way to

1733
01:17:16,578 --> 01:17:21,078
know it makes it it looks like you know

1734
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,980
in because that treats you like a sativa

1735
01:17:21,078 --> 01:17:23,569
and vice versa

1736
01:17:21,979 --> 01:17:35,448
you cannot tell by looking at it that's

1737
01:17:23,569 --> 01:17:37,729
my tag yeah next question hi thanks for

1738
01:17:35,448 --> 01:17:39,649
everybody for being here tonight and you

1739
01:17:37,729 --> 01:17:41,569
know teaching us a lot about product

1740
01:17:39,649 --> 01:17:43,279
compliance but I'm actually here tonight

1741
01:17:41,569 --> 01:17:45,908
to talk about a different type of

1742
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:48,920
compliance a bit more important to the

1743
01:17:45,908 --> 01:17:51,289
my right side of the panel here

1744
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,880
that's tax compliance and I think it's

1745
01:17:51,289 --> 01:17:54,429
actually a very interesting thing for

1746
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:57,829
all of us to be thinking about because

1747
01:17:54,429 --> 01:17:59,989
we're the medical aspect of the product

1748
01:17:57,829 --> 01:18:01,510
is extremely important and it was an

1749
01:17:59,988 --> 01:18:04,549
important thing that helped us get it

1750
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:07,070
legalized I think the thing the real

1751
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:09,650
motivator was the money and the revenue

1752
01:18:07,069 --> 01:18:13,009
that the state and the and the cities

1753
01:18:09,649 --> 01:18:15,319
for the for California instance can make

1754
01:18:13,010 --> 01:18:18,590
and as we know that the numbers that

1755
01:18:15,319 --> 01:18:19,880
we're getting are not reaching the the

1756
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:21,319
revenue that they thought they were

1757
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:22,880
going to be getting and I think the one

1758
01:18:21,319 --> 01:18:26,079
thing that it's not being talked about

1759
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:29,119
is the lack of tax compliance by the

1760
01:18:26,079 --> 01:18:31,760
taxpayers within the industry and it's

1761
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:34,179
not due to a lack of trying it's just

1762
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:38,390
that the state has made it so difficult

1763
01:18:34,179 --> 01:18:39,859
to follow the regulations that my

1764
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:42,260
studies have shown at least on the

1765
01:18:39,859 --> 01:18:44,679
dispensary side of things that a very

1766
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:46,969
very very small percentage of them are

1767
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:49,760
calculating their taxes properly and

1768
01:18:46,969 --> 01:18:53,390
it's ending up shorting the cities and

1769
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:56,480
the state might have a question yeah my

1770
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:58,910
question is really about what you guys

1771
01:18:56,479 --> 01:19:00,619
feel about the importance of tax

1772
01:18:58,909 --> 01:19:03,079
compliance because it's not something

1773
01:19:00,619 --> 01:19:07,149
that's being talked about and I'd also

1774
01:19:03,079 --> 01:19:11,000
like to before I finish invite Andrew to

1775
01:19:07,149 --> 01:19:12,198
long beach on the 13th of September

1776
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:17,179
where the League of California cities

1777
01:19:12,198 --> 01:19:19,488
will be meeting further let's go down

1778
01:19:17,179 --> 01:19:20,989
together and be educators love to you

1779
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:23,178
know on your on your tax question I

1780
01:19:20,988 --> 01:19:25,069
think the state kind of put certain

1781
01:19:23,179 --> 01:19:27,469
operators in this position by making

1782
01:19:25,069 --> 01:19:30,710
distributors collect tax for other

1783
01:19:27,469 --> 01:19:33,609
people's businesses and I think a lot of

1784
01:19:30,710 --> 01:19:36,980
people have probably used that as

1785
01:19:33,609 --> 01:19:38,210
capital almost have been basically

1786
01:19:36,979 --> 01:19:40,549
trying to build themselves and bring

1787
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:43,489
themselves to compliance on other

1788
01:19:40,550 --> 01:19:47,690
people's money and they are gonna pay a

1789
01:19:43,488 --> 01:19:50,149
brutal fee for doing so I think it's

1790
01:19:47,689 --> 01:19:52,419
what 50 percent off the top plus another

1791
01:19:50,149 --> 01:19:56,420
ten there's something along those lines

1792
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:58,460
but I I feel for those guys but I do

1793
01:19:56,420 --> 01:20:00,619
kind of think that the way that the

1794
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:02,130
state has laid out a tax and tax

1795
01:20:00,619 --> 01:20:06,159
collection

1796
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:09,789
has kind of made that a reality has made

1797
01:20:06,159 --> 01:20:11,260
that a thing you know yesterday was the

1798
01:20:09,789 --> 01:20:14,619
first time that I actually saw a

1799
01:20:11,260 --> 01:20:17,770
compliant receipt from a dispensary one

1800
01:20:14,619 --> 01:20:20,470
that was charging the tax embedded in

1801
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:24,040
the item and not subtotal into taxes out

1802
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:25,630
at the end and I yeah there is

1803
01:20:24,039 --> 01:20:28,239
definitely a need for tax compliance

1804
01:20:25,630 --> 01:20:30,250
there's also a need for the CDT fa to

1805
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:33,579
actually be transparent with the fact

1806
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:35,949
that they're projections are are are

1807
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:38,590
significantly lower what they're

1808
01:20:35,949 --> 01:20:41,289
reporting is a combination of sales use

1809
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:43,810
tax which was not a part of their

1810
01:20:41,289 --> 01:20:46,659
estimates and if you want compliance

1811
01:20:43,810 --> 01:20:49,840
from our side we need transparency from

1812
01:20:46,659 --> 01:20:50,470
the state side too so you know it kind

1813
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,560
of goes both ways

1814
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:59,199
hi my name is Jim koffice I'm from Santa

1815
01:20:53,560 --> 01:21:02,740
Cruz we were happy to to facilitate

1816
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:06,809
helped facilitate this organ this event

1817
01:21:02,739 --> 01:21:10,989
we're green trade we're a coalition of

1818
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:17,530
mostly small cannabis operators in Santa

1819
01:21:10,989 --> 01:21:19,479
Cruz County to to Jackies a point about

1820
01:21:17,529 --> 01:21:21,309
the ability of the industry to come

1821
01:21:19,479 --> 01:21:23,619
together we've seen it on the local

1822
01:21:21,310 --> 01:21:26,400
level where we for the last year and a

1823
01:21:23,619 --> 01:21:30,869
half two years almost have tried to

1824
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:36,909
bring players together manufacturers

1825
01:21:30,869 --> 01:21:39,309
resellers distributors cultivators it's

1826
01:21:36,909 --> 01:21:41,559
been difficult to show them where their

1827
01:21:39,310 --> 01:21:44,010
shared interests are but we've been able

1828
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:48,250
to do it fortunately or unfortunately

1829
01:21:44,010 --> 01:21:51,840
the shared interest right now is getting

1830
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:54,220
a license and at the local level that's

1831
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:58,300
depending upon your jurisdiction that

1832
01:21:54,220 --> 01:22:02,680
can be even more cumbersome more onerous

1833
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:06,130
than at the state level so I'd encourage

1834
01:22:02,680 --> 01:22:07,860
everybody to pay attention to what's

1835
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:12,190
going on at their in their local

1836
01:22:07,859 --> 01:22:15,399
jurisdiction taking my hat off as an

1837
01:22:12,189 --> 01:22:21,099
industry wrap I'm a 50 year

1838
01:22:15,399 --> 01:22:25,779
consumer and I never had a medical card

1839
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:28,360
I purchased all my cannabis or received

1840
01:22:25,779 --> 01:22:32,880
all my cannabis through what some people

1841
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:37,139
call the illicit market I preferred it

1842
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:39,789
having grown up not too far from here I

1843
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:44,890
prefer to call it the traditional market

1844
01:22:39,789 --> 01:22:49,810
and the tradition that the traditional

1845
01:22:44,890 --> 01:22:54,070
market you know there were some times

1846
01:22:49,810 --> 01:22:58,659
you got bad product but it was all built

1847
01:22:54,069 --> 01:23:01,859
on trust and for the most part you know

1848
01:22:58,658 --> 01:23:05,920
your trust was well-placed and and I

1849
01:23:01,859 --> 01:23:09,339
didn't suffer any major consequences I

1850
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:16,440
don't think from yet you know my

1851
01:23:09,340 --> 01:23:20,640
consumption of untested unregulated on

1852
01:23:16,439 --> 01:23:26,500
licensed cannabis for 50 years now since

1853
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:30,340
January you know the cost of that same

1854
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:35,229
amount of cannabis is is crazy the other

1855
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:37,300
thing is that at age 71 I'm now kind of

1856
01:23:35,229 --> 01:23:42,698
looking at using cannabis for

1857
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:48,010
therapeutic purposes and so for the for

1858
01:23:42,698 --> 01:23:50,469
those uses I do want a tested I want to

1859
01:23:48,010 --> 01:23:53,020
know what the dosage is I want to know

1860
01:23:50,469 --> 01:23:57,750
as much as I can about that I'm

1861
01:23:53,020 --> 01:24:01,929
wondering if there is a if there's a

1862
01:23:57,750 --> 01:24:09,000
conflict between the adult use market

1863
01:24:01,929 --> 01:24:12,250
and the so-called medical market that is

1864
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:14,260
unresolvable I'd like your thoughts I

1865
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:17,859
think there is no medical market right

1866
01:24:14,260 --> 01:24:20,920
now and that's a problem it's all adult

1867
01:24:17,859 --> 01:24:22,630
use right now you know and the medic the

1868
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:26,529
actual medical patients are suffering

1869
01:24:22,630 --> 01:24:28,300
because of it but they can still come in

1870
01:24:26,529 --> 01:24:28,899
if they're over 21 and get the same

1871
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:30,820
products that

1872
01:24:28,899 --> 01:24:34,448
before they're more expensive but 100

1873
01:24:30,819 --> 01:24:36,099
milligrams right capsules and tinctures

1874
01:24:34,448 --> 01:24:38,649
you have to go to capsules and tinctures

1875
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:42,340
yeah right right

1876
01:24:38,649 --> 01:24:46,329
understood that's forcing the medical

1877
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:48,400
patients to go to the traditional market

1878
01:24:46,329 --> 01:24:50,979
yeah that's outrageous that's outrageous

1879
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:52,779
that's crazy that's outrageous

1880
01:24:50,979 --> 01:24:56,649
we're forcing the sickest of the sickest

1881
01:24:52,779 --> 01:25:00,279
people to consume the worst of the worst

1882
01:24:56,649 --> 01:25:05,920
product so we just need universal health

1883
01:25:00,279 --> 01:25:07,920
care for cannabis patients on it yeah

1884
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:11,440
hopefully in our lifetime

1885
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:13,000
hopefully yep well this has been great
