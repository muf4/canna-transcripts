[Music]

2
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:12,989
you're in the middle breaking your the

3
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:16,589
gay people is for the regulations that

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:19,589
comes with cost right but so it's like

5
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:24,539
the lab Martin's just talk about it you

6
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:26,399
know so laboratories so everybody thinks

7
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:30,868
that if you own a lab you make a ton of

8
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:33,719
money no so so you know if you think

9
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:37,500
about how a lab has to run right and

10
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,989
think about what are our primary product

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,730
out people think is a CoA but it's not

12
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:44,369
right it's customer satisfaction right

13
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:47,939
so so we like every other business have

14
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:51,000
to our product is happy customers right

15
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,409
so in order to make a happy customer you

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,100
have to be able to meet a reasonable

17
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:57,029
turnaround time right in order to me at

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,350
a reasonable turn amount of time that

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,460
means you have to build your lab in a

20
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,439
way that you have capacity you know

21
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,659
unused capacity because the moment you

22
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,339
max out your capacity and something

23
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:09,390
breaks your customers are now unhappy

24
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,430
because they're not getting turnaround

25
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,368
time right so so this is a vicious cycle

26
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:17,189
that we go through so if you think about

27
00:01:14,368 --> 00:01:19,650
it from those terms and and what the

28
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:21,658
margin on your unused capacity has to be

29
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,000
to be able to be able to meet that right

30
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,770
so now you're looking at the start up a

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,930
lab you need at least two of everything

32
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:31,469
and two of everything gets you about 50

33
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,479
samples a day right so that's not a lot

34
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:36,030
of money all right

35
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:37,590
so but you know with 50 samples a day

36
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,200
and two of everything

37
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,728
you can keep that many customers happy

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,140
however many customers give you 50

39
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:45,328
samples right whether it's one large

40
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,819
company company or a bunch of small

41
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:50,548
companies right so if you would like to

42
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:52,828
get larger than that oh and here's the

43
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,979
important part two of everything will

44
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:57,059
set you back somewhere between depending

45
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:00,179
on whether you go at high end or low end

46
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,129
equipment a million and a half to two

47
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,079
and a half million dollars right that's

48
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:04,649
just the entry fee to play the game

49
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:06,779
right

50
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,310
that doesn't include building that

51
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,409
doesn't include all the other lab

52
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,030
equipment that needs to be able to help

53
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:15,229
like the pipetters doesn't include your

54
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,969
salaries or anything like that I suggest

55
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:19,500
sure yeah I mean you know you don't want

56
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:22,319
unskilled labour running your machines

57
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:30,780
that cost $800,000 right that's probably

58
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:32,519
a bad idea I know so so you know so that

59
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,370
that's just to get started right so now

60
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,010
if you would like to scale and and and

61
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,659
try to be a a larger player in the

62
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:41,729
industry now you're looking at having to

63
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:44,359
have well let's use steep hill for

64
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:48,188
example our berkeley lab right so I have

65
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,189
[Music]

66
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:56,250
five GL C's another liquid

67
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,379
chromatographs I have another four or

68
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,509
five liquid chromatograph with mass spec

69
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,259
right so you know to be able to do

70
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:04,439
pesticides

71
00:03:01,259 --> 00:03:07,019
I have 7g CLM and gc/ms is to be able to

72
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:10,710
do residual solvents some pesticides you

73
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,790
know so you know I see PMS you need a

74
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,590
few of those right because you need at

75
00:03:11,789 --> 00:03:15,599
least two right as I said you need to at

76
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,400
least two of everything right so so you

77
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,829
know so now you know that's what you're

78
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,719
looking at just and then that's that's

79
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,910
just the chemistry that has nothing to

80
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:26,099
do with microbial stuff and all the

81
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:30,270
incubators and all the stuff for that

82
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:32,400
you know you know and then oh wait we

83
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:34,350
forgot water activity we forgot

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,750
microscopes and cameras for visual

85
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,430
inspection and then you have to have a

86
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,810
quality assurance manual you have to

87
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:46,230
have training programs you have to have

88
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:48,270
so now yeah so now you have to have

89
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:50,579
people who have been trained and are

90
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,830
certified in sampling and it can't be

91
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,180
just any sampling you have to have a

92
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:57,690
statistical sampling plan right it has

93
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,730
to be you know so so you know then you

94
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:03,090
have to have a vehicle right because by

95
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:05,099
law or six right or but cuz by law right

96
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,319
you can't lease the vehicle or rent the

97
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:10,709
vehicle right you have to own vehicle

98
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:14,459
right so that's the BCC regulation so so

99
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:16,620
now oh wait storage we forgot storage

100
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,840
right we tried to get storage cut down

101
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:22,090
to a couple weeks it's 45 frickin

102
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:24,789
business days so

103
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:28,000
yeah so now I had to devote part of my

104
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:30,220
lab to a locked storage facility all

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,050
right so these and because none of these

106
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,840
things were actually considered before

107
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:37,720
the regulations went into play and and

108
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:39,399
as all these things kept piling up they

109
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,490
kept dumping it like at the same spot

110
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:44,109
the labs right so and and I'm not saying

111
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,259
that it was then maliciously right but

112
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,270
it kind of was the oh well that's yeah

113
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:50,860
that's a good spot they have for testing

114
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:55,719
let's let them keep it there at one

115
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:58,060
point they they wanted the batches to

116
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:00,100
actually be held in a facility at the

117
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,228
laboratories we're like whoa dude we

118
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,320
don't even want to keep the XS right so

119
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:06,490
we should sample twice take the one

120
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:08,110
sample with us and leave the other

121
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:12,329
sample lock in quarantine at the

122
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,330
producers because they have its you know

123
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:17,829
where they were smoking yeah they lost

124
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,960
their license or it was like under

125
00:05:17,829 --> 00:05:21,519
jeopardy any those things could ease it

126
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:24,250
was a lab there was a testing lab in

127
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,209
Washington and rather than throw the

128
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,209
stuff away

129
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:30,728
they were cloth you know smoking it and

130
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:34,599
actually it was a lab chain that was in

131
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:37,659
California Lucy playing with the rules

132
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:43,930
Michelle not all labs are you know well

133
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:48,610
so if the state of California thinks

134
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:50,560
that wasn't happening in California they

135
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:53,139
were sadly deluded because there's

136
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,030
nobody so our track and trace system

137
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:57,400
right our track and trace system is

138
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:58,899
still only marginally functional I

139
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,969
believe I mean I believe it is

140
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:02,409
functioning but I believe that the

141
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,780
majority of people are still not on it

142
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:14,979
and without track and trace you can't

143
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:20,138
track and trace you know I mean so yes

144
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:22,209
so you know can they audit after the

145
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:23,410
fact yeah so what we'd you know so but

146
00:06:22,209 --> 00:06:26,138
now here here's the other problem so

147
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:28,389
there's this whole other level of stuff

148
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:29,379
that nobody considered hey how did we

149
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:32,228
get rid of all this kind of this waste

150
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:35,408
from the laboratory okay let's call it

151
00:06:32,228 --> 00:06:38,558
local the local trash pickup

152
00:06:35,408 --> 00:06:38,978
what oh hell no we don't take that keep

153
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:41,679
going

154
00:06:38,978 --> 00:06:42,998
has it's being treated as hazardous

155
00:06:41,678 --> 00:06:46,718
waste and some of the most expensive

156
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:47,349
right so and we have to pay for for

157
00:06:46,718 --> 00:06:49,449
tonnage

158
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:50,949
that's not cannabis before they'll take

159
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:52,809
it it has to be mixed with water or

160
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:54,699
kitty litter and so we have to pay and

161
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:56,199
we have to pay the combined weight not

162
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:57,189
just the way to the cannabis the way to

163
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:59,739
the water in the kitty litter

164
00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:01,929
wow that's a real unintended consequence

165
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:07,168
right there so are you seeing unintended

166
00:07:01,928 --> 00:07:07,168
consequences all over the place yes
