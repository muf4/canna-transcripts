1
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:20,820
so yes we were lucky to park

2
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,789
some really really bright and wonderful

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,768
people who have like 30 plus years in

4
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:28,349
tissue culture and micro propagation

5
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:30,358
that we were able to merge finance

6
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,750
cannabis with to start our tissue

7
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:39,989
culture nursery and kind of what led us

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:41,189
to that was what we saw as a pretty big

9
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:44,369
issue within the cannabis community

10
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:46,859
which was plant quality plant health and

11
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:50,578
contamination whether it's from from a

12
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:52,890
pest or a pathogen level you know we see

13
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,170
we see a lot of that especially in stock

14
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,030
plants and nurseries I'm sure anyone

15
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,010
who's grown plants can tell a horror

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,730
story of getting clones from somebody

17
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:04,259
and then having some sort of bug or

18
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:06,599
disease on them that then spread through

19
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:10,200
their garden and we felt that tissue

20
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:12,569
culture micropropagation was a pretty

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,829
good solution to explore to try to

22
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:18,449
mitigate that problem so kind of with

23
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:19,859
all that said all I'm gonna do just kind

24
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,618
of a quick primer and talk about what

25
00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:24,799
tissue culture is and tissue culture in

26
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:27,509
plants and in cannabis specifically

27
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,960
tissue culture is really basically the

28
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:35,040
process of growing cells tissue or

29
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:38,489
organs in a sterile environment on a

30
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,990
nutrient rich media and that sounds a

31
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:42,089
little bit weird but like if you've ever

32
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:43,530
gone to the doctor and gotten tested

33
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,329
like if you got a sore throat for strep

34
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,159
throat they're gonna swab your throat

35
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:50,218
and they're gonna try to culture it on a

36
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,810
petri dish and that essentially is what

37
00:01:50,218 --> 00:01:55,078
we are doing with plants is growing them

38
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,840
on a petri dish and you have this again

39
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:59,728
aseptic in vitro environment so it is a

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,310
completely sterile environment that

41
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:04,259
we're growing the plants in and there is

42
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,629
obviously a lot of advantages to that

43
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,469
mainly being that the plant is

44
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:12,569
completely contaminant and pathogen free

45
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:15,090
there is also the huge reduction of

46
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:17,430
abiotic stress or you know stress

47
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:21,629
factors on the plants from microbial or

48
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:24,799
or pest pressures so you have this media

49
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:28,439
which consists of nutrients sugars

50
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:30,280
vitamins hormones and that's what we

51
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,709
grow the plant

52
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,840
so I wanted to talk a little bit about

53
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:36,580
tissue culture and the history of tissue

54
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,509
culture in agriculture if you guys are

55
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,550
okay with that and why it's why we think

56
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:44,620
it's a viable process and why it's used

57
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:48,250
because it is used widely in a lot of

58
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:50,650
agricultural crops and processes some of

59
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,719
the main reasons that tissue culture is

60
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,689
is used in agriculture and it's used on

61
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,848
crops from from almonds from grapes to

62
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:59,560
every single berry that you buy if you

63
00:02:57,848 --> 00:03:01,298
buy from Driscoll's every single one of

64
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,030
those plants is grown from a tissue

65
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:05,650
culture plant and the main reason that

66
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,500
you grow these things you use tissue

67
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:11,769
culture excuse me to propagate these

68
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,909
plants is a the plant is extremely

69
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:17,560
difficult to propagate on its own and

70
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:20,459
that means like asexual propagation like

71
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,239
cloning doesn't work have you guys

72
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,459
experienced that with cannabis is

73
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,700
cannabis a hard plant to propagate a

74
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:29,680
sexually no not really in my experience

75
00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:31,780
you know it's pretty it's pretty easy to

76
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,170
root not like some of these walnut root

77
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,789
stocks that you see so we'll circle back

78
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:40,869
to that why it's you know effective in

79
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:42,638
cannabis but the other main reason is is

80
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,849
if you have really really you know

81
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,920
prevalent and virulent diseases that

82
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:50,439
affect plants and you need to ensure

83
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:53,500
that you have clean disease-free pest

84
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:56,650
free plant material for your production

85
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,219
system so some of the big crops that you

86
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:03,280
see tissue culture used widely in our

87
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:06,039
coffee grapes and ornamental crop

88
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,989
orchids orchids are almost impossible to

89
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:10,269
propagate asexually through traditional

90
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:12,400
cloning and the seeds if you ever get

91
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:14,620
viable seeds from orchid will never

92
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,660
produce the beautiful white Phalaenopsis

93
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:19,000
that you buy at Trader Joe's or wherever

94
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,459
else you know similar to similar to

95
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,930
cannabis the seeds that you produce

96
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,879
there if they ever did germinate would

97
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,978
be extremely variable so you want a

98
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,490
sexual propagation and cloning but it's

99
00:04:26,978 --> 00:04:30,609
very difficult to do that tradition

100
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,769
they do that through tissue culture

101
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:36,919
grapes are another big one Valastro

102
00:04:33,769 --> 00:04:39,198
wiped out almost the entire wine

103
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:42,318
industry in Europe that was thousands

104
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,150
and thousands of years old because of a

105
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,750
1/3 like paths that transmitted the

106
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:51,709
virus to these plants verticillium is a

107
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:53,629
huge virus soit's oil virus and pathogen

108
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:56,120
that affects a ton of strawberries

109
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:57,709
throughout California and it can be

110
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,180
passed on systemically through the plant

111
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:01,939
so you need to have ensure you have

112
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,519
clean plant material so these are just a

113
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:07,490
few of the crops that are already tissue

114
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:10,490
culture is widely used in so why why

115
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,769
tissue culture in cannabis again the

116
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:17,090
clean stock material is really important

117
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:21,799
and then the other aspect that we found

118
00:05:17,089 --> 00:05:24,799
that we really weren't as more betting

119
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,098
on as much is the regenerative process

120
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,250
that can happen through tissue culture

121
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:35,240
so we've seen strains 20 30 year-old

122
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:37,639
strains that work pardon me like

123
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,228
so-called Dutta doubt that have gone

124
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:43,400
through the tissue culture process and

125
00:05:39,228 --> 00:05:45,649
then regenerated so this is one of the

126
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:50,569
huge advantages that we've seen from it

127
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:52,310
and it's yeah it's it's it's been pretty

128
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:54,319
pretty interesting we spent about two

129
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:58,189
years a year and a half two years doing

130
00:05:54,319 --> 00:06:01,939
R&amp;D trials with over initially over 25

131
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:04,699
just over 25 strains and we did side by

132
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:06,050
sides from traditional clone through the

133
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:08,780
plants that were gone through the tissue

134
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,360
culture process and grew them out side

135
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:14,119
by side and we looked at things like

136
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,848
number of nodes at day 27 and we looked

137
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,069
at you know overall vigor we looked at

138
00:06:16,848 --> 00:06:21,379
cannabinoid profiles we looked at yield

139
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:22,770
all these things and we're able to see

140
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:26,348
some of the advantage

141
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:29,469
and you know just a circle back a little

142
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:31,269
bit you know the to try to describe the

143
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,039
process a little bit more which is is

144
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:35,439
you know a lot more formative you can

145
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:39,430
see it but you have these plants growing

146
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:41,889
on gel gel it's we call it an agar so

147
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,050
again we're using water with nutrients

148
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:47,319
like you wouldn't hydroponics but we're

149
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:50,379
adding B vitamins we're adding hormones

150
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:52,090
we're adding sucrose to it and you can

151
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:55,349
grow these plants again in this

152
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:58,628
completely sterile environment and

153
00:06:55,348 --> 00:07:02,800
there's lots of different types of

154
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:04,479
tissue culture but they're the one that

155
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,639
we specifically focus on is what's

156
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:12,128
called nodal micro propagation so the

157
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,060
the process kind of looks if I can try

158
00:07:12,129 --> 00:07:16,330
to kind of walk you guys through the

159
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,819
process you have roughly four stages of

160
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:21,639
tissue culture you have initiation or

161
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:24,009
induction which is taking source

162
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,379
material from a mother stock plant and

163
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:28,990
we're gonna sterilize it and we're gonna

164
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:30,968
induce it or you know you know initiate

165
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,139
it into the tissue culture stage so

166
00:07:30,968 --> 00:07:34,149
we're gonna take the plant material

167
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:36,639
we're gonna sterilize it the best we can

168
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:38,888
because again growing inside that tissue

169
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,689
culture tube or petri dish or deli or

170
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,038
whatever you want to call it the only

171
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:45,009
thing living in there should be the

172
00:07:42,038 --> 00:07:47,199
plant so we're gonna sterilize it and

173
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:48,879
we're gonna take whatever organs or

174
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,129
tissues or sections of the plant that we

175
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,278
want and we're gonna stick them into

176
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:56,319
this gel and it's it's it's functions

177
00:07:54,278 --> 00:07:58,389
the same way as soil does it's providing

178
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,939
everything it needs the plant needs for

179
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:03,639
growth but the difference is we actually

180
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:05,918
have very very low hormone

181
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:09,490
concentrations in that media as well

182
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,859
that can steer the plant to do what we

183
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,810
want to do whether we want it to

184
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,150
elongate with oxen whether we want to

185
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,769
branch with cytokinin whether we want it

186
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:19,658
to root again with a different type of

187
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:22,959
oxen and these are all different plant

188
00:08:19,658 --> 00:08:25,839
hormones and then once you have the

189
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:28,418
plant growing actively on a media that

190
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:30,519
you like you can start multiplication

191
00:08:28,418 --> 00:08:32,710
and so we start growing the plants out

192
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:34,179
in media and we start micro

193
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,649
getting them cloning them the same way

194
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,538
you would clone traditionally with

195
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:39,339
cannabis but we're taking very very

196
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:41,710
small cross-sections of the plant and

197
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:44,450
getting it to reproduce and grow again

198
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,750
on this media in a sterile environment

199
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:55,050
[Music]

200
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:58,208
partner also in the gel do we start so

201
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:59,559
so if say you had a plant that you

202
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:01,208
wanted to take in tissue culture you've

203
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:02,349
got whatever strain that is that you

204
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,909
love you've been growing it for a long

205
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:05,170
time and for whatever reason you would

206
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:08,079
like to take it to the tissue culture

207
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:11,889
process we would say bring in like a

208
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,740
medium sized team something that has 40

209
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:15,909
to 50 lateral nodes off of it just in

210
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,129
just I'm just talking about little

211
00:09:15,909 --> 00:09:19,240
branches lateral nodes on it and what

212
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:21,549
we're going to do is we're going to take

213
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,680
all of those little lateral nodes we're

214
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:26,259
gonna take that little cross-section off

215
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:28,750
the stem and we're gonna put it on to

216
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:30,009
probably a dozen different media to see

217
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,958
how it's gonna grow on different ones

218
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:34,088
and these different media have different

219
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:36,009
hormone concentrations and so we'll put

220
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:37,810
it on in the first two to three months

221
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:39,458
is this initiation phase where after

222
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:41,169
we've sterilized it and stuck it on a

223
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:43,329
bunch of different media we're gonna say

224
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:45,519
well god this plant really doesn't

225
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,709
perform with the cytokinin level is high

226
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,120
but it's growing well on this media you

227
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:52,838
can see the plants actively growing

228
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,580
inside this little deli container and so

229
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:56,620
then we start multiplying it on that

230
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,540
media and when I say multiplying that

231
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:00,009
little X pant X plant that's what we

232
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:01,480
call it that's grown in that picture

233
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:03,549
this we're going to take that we're

234
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,990
gonna chop that up again all those

235
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:06,309
little lateral nodes we're gonna take it

236
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,730
off of that little plant we're gonna re

237
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:15,819
stick them this is micro propagation so

238
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:18,430
our plants start out about yay big so

239
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,800
and by the way please since we've got

240
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:22,989
such a small audience which again I'm

241
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,599
totally fine with and happy with is if

242
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:27,430
you guys have questions please raise

243
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,480
your hand and ask them out I'm happy to

244
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:33,578
have this is more of a dialog than me

245
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,769
lecturing to you guys about your culture

246
00:10:33,578 --> 00:10:38,708
so if anyone has any questions please

247
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,939
feel free to reach out but kind of going

248
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,769
back to that process we have this

249
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,970
multiplication we're big building up the

250
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:43,949
volume of the plant material that we

251
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,629
have

252
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,860
then we can start pulling out some of

253
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:49,409
that material and start routing it and

254
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,690
then we're gonna route it pretty much

255
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:54,089
the same way you would root can display

256
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:56,550
it traditionally we're gonna take again

257
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:57,960
our material is just a lot smaller and

258
00:10:56,549 --> 00:10:59,399
we're gonna take this little material

259
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,350
we're gonna stick it in the new media

260
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,459
which has a little bit more I mean you

261
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,560
guys have all probably looked at the

262
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:06,930
back of a dipping gro bottle or a clone

263
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,579
x bottle until three betray ik acid it's

264
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:10,589
a hormone that causes the plant to root

265
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,240
we're gonna stick it in the media that

266
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,500
has a little bit higher concentration of

267
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,090
that and then we're gonna stick it in

268
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,230
the plug we route it in the Nelly pot

269
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,230
it's a peat perlite plug

270
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,059
you
