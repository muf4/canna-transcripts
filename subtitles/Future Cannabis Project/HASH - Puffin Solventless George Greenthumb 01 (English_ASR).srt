1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
[Music]

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:15,000
so I ended up coming up with better ways

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:17,368
of processing what you get like all of

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,278
this rosin here is dry material I only

5
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:22,820
got the one product in here that's fresh

6
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:25,170
frozen that was the Tropicana cookies

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,929
and you're welcome to look at all of

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,840
these right here but yeah but my forte

9
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:33,329
is is dry material you know I like

10
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:35,820
processing live I like squishing it more

11
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,130
that the squish ability on live is great

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,020
you pull like 80% on your squishes means

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,000
live is up we're always talking frozen

14
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,859
fresh frozen lives resin right the name

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,719
is you know yeah like the last one I did

16
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:48,238
was the Tropicana cookies it was a hard

17
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,539
wash because the nubs were you know ice

18
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,609
cubes there you had a saturation time

19
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,799
even just soak them up so they can open

20
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:58,530
up you don't want to over beat them to

21
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:01,439
make contaminations so it's been only

22
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:08,159
cool 3% on the water you can't use the

23
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:10,439
entire the entire plant I use trim all

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,540
of this except for the Tropicana is all

25
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,658
trim material dry trim

26
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,130
cured dry cured trim yeah and like I

27
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,570
said I like doing the process you know

28
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:21,118
but I mean with with the foot with it

29
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:21,899
with the fresh frozen what about the

30
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:24,090
entire plant

31
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,490
I cut the whole plant down everything

32
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,439
except for like major stocks maybe some

33
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:30,509
water leaf yeah didn't like big water

34
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:32,579
leaf that a purple meal for the price

35
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:34,950
like the stem on the leave yes you know

36
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,959
that that's just green that's just any

37
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,799
leaf that looks like it has any first

38
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:39,779
mm-hmm

39
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,400
and you'll notice that on the dry

40
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,009
material when you wash you'll get all

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,509
the actual stocks of your heads to like

42
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,390
you won't get those on the fresh frozen

43
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,890
at all it'll all stay on the plant and

44
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,209
it's actually trippy because you hold

45
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,769
these nubs that look like they're still

46
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:54,449
covered in crystals yeah and there's

47
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:56,009
nothing on them is there any different

48
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:02,969
well you guys were all growing inside

49
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:06,299
when I don't know it's not true no I

50
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:08,788
mean both yeah but like yeah inside

51
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,188
outside you know but and and two totally

52
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,468
different mediums to outside them in a

53
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:15,840
greenhouse with soil and you know a

54
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:17,900
no-till garden and then inside rock wall

55
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,610
and salt

56
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,908
that's all we do is endure Rockwell

57
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:26,239
Saltz very interesting when I used to go

58
00:02:22,908 --> 00:02:28,429
up north and visit with the farmers up

59
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,329
there where they were being taught how

60
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:35,030
to harvest their plants for uh for life

61
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:37,069
present they were being they were being

62
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,019
taught to like harvest like that then

63
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:41,238
these were they were all outdoor like

64
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:43,489
then they would be harvest like before

65
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:46,009
the Sun came up so you say where they're

66
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:47,120
still cold they were they were like I

67
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:48,530
mean that just that's just like a

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,908
helpful thing because the colder the

69
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,250
plain that's easier it is to cut it down

70
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:54,289
yeah just just yeah that's like

71
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,479
preferences yeah and then like in all

72
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:58,400
reality I don't think you're gonna make

73
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,068
much of a difference in that anything is

74
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,180
much more wrong job to be heavier yeah

75
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:03,289
it might even be heavier because you're

76
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:06,379
gonna be a little more water more

77
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:08,298
moisture and it'll be more so I'm gonna

78
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:09,620
be harder to pull when you got you know

79
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:12,109
someone who watered the night that they

80
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,789
cut that's gonna have a higher water

81
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:15,590
content compared to somebody who does a

82
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:17,658
drive back for two days in cuts yeah

83
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,039
like every single plant that I'm cutting

84
00:03:17,658 --> 00:03:20,658
down and turning to fresh frozen has

85
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,818
been starved for like two or three days

86
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:26,239
from water at least so I guess my

87
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:28,848
question is is there any difference in

88
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,878
any way between the different parts of

89
00:03:28,848 --> 00:03:33,259
the plan in yeah of course the bottoms

90
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:37,128
are gonna come out different than the

91
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:39,439
tops you're gonna get more I've done

92
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:41,719
like I've done like a test wash like I

93
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,609
actually brought up the test wash um

94
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:46,039
that I did recently where I just do like

95
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:48,530
a mason jar haha ten fresh frozen grams

96
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:51,560
which would normally be like two two and

97
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,848
a half once dried and then I just shake

98
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,639
the shit out of it in the jar with ice

99
00:03:52,848 --> 00:03:57,858
and water and then I set it on the table

100
00:03:55,639 --> 00:04:00,969
and let's if like a minute I pick it up

101
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:04,489
and with a bomb and I'd done a plant

102
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:06,378
that was the same strain but stunted it

103
00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:07,639
didn't grow well and there was no no

104
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:09,918
yield and then the plant in the back

105
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:11,510
that was super good and grab a nice Cola

106
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,919
then you shake it into completely

107
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:16,939
different outcome so of course the

108
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,168
different you know you know tops of the

109
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:20,029
plant versus a bottom are gonna be a

110
00:04:18,168 --> 00:04:22,459
little different but if you grow proper

111
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,869
you know indoor usually you're not gonna

112
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:27,549
have too many bottoms or what they call

113
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:30,468
larf yeah or whatever yeah you know so

114
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:30,720
it is if the point is to like harvest

115
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:33,120
like

116
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,100
so you get the like though if the Rebbe

117
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,720
you had get the most residents yeah you

118
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,010
want your resin to be like you because

119
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,110
you just want the head you don't want

120
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:42,029
the stock yeah and the heads definitely

121
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,910
get to a certain 1-inch solet's yes yeah

122
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:46,559
but they also explode so you have to be

123
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,910
like careful of that you also don't want

124
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,740
to freeze it too much because sometime

125
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:51,630
freezing it will allow it to explode but

126
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,639
you lose it when it explodes

127
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:54,810
no it's just it comes out differently

128
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,819
through the back because you're using

129
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:00,240
those micron bags can you buy any

130
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:01,949
purpose your bags get gummed up oh and

131
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,780
that's the worst that's that's how many

132
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:05,819
bags are the worst and that's what you

133
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:07,979
call temps make a huge difference I mean

134
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:10,769
two three degree temperatures you're

135
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,330
gumming up and then I've also had the

136
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:14,490
other hand where like some house is so

137
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:16,500
good even in a 65 degree room it's fine

138
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,879
and it's completely fine and then I've

139
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,230
had other hash where it's like 50

140
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:23,579
degrees in the room and you touch it and

141
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:28,710
just turns to glue your back watching 38

142
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:30,509
and stuff melts it's yeah the chemistry

143
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:32,399
of the resin that makes it it's all the

144
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:33,959
yeah it's it's how you grow it it's

145
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:34,949
making sure you thinking care of it

146
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,599
making sure you're not spraying your

147
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:38,639
plants the more and if you're spraying a

148
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,169
plant you're gonna really ruin some some

149
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,519
heads and yeah and on your almost your

150
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:42,779
entire product it's not gonna come out

151
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,490
anywhere near as good as someone who

152
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:46,439
doesn't spray that's the worst

153
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,449
a lot of farmers don't want to be

154
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:50,370
straightforward yeah and then you don't

155
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:51,870
find out like oh hey man do me this huge

156
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,579
favor and like let's make all this great

157
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:55,860
hash together and then they give you a

158
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:58,709
booth product because in all smelly I'll

159
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,419
smell oh yeah I'll be like oh cool I see

160
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:05,189
you guys are using plant therapy that's

161
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:07,049
the the healthy organic spray right I

162
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:08,430
knew it because I asked you guys are you

163
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,319
guys spraying anything and they'll say

164
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,090
no I'll say because it's organic they

165
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,699
don't think it like I'm like you know I

166
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:20,509
honestly I don't agree with spraying h2o

167
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:23,550
or like a high like hydrogen peroxide

168
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:26,219
even on your plants like any water

169
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,168
anything in my opinion is not good for

170
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,330
the that's why you have the humidity the

171
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:32,549
control you monitor your humidity your

172
00:06:30,329 --> 00:06:35,550
VPD you have a person that knows how to

173
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:38,329
do your evaluation is number one so you

174
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,590
guys are on the same page

175
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:41,709
well when you do it for love you learn

176
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:46,810
what works like what does

177
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:49,329
yeah - starts in the nursery the

178
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:52,389
genetics so the pheno hunting the same

179
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:54,069
rockin the the networking of trading

180
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:56,949
cuts and fighting the right genetics

181
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:58,959
starts in the nursery what happens how

182
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,879
you feed it how you treat it how soon do

183
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,758
you send it off to flower how mature is

184
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,800
your bright are you

185
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,860
mature differently so GMOs seventy days

186
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,530
strength early six you guys would be

187
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,180
perfect to run this by I was talking to

188
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:16,359
sunshine Johnson once you know she's a

189
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:21,180
she's uh a dry form or eleven wool and

190
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,180
she supplies for Naja you know

191
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:28,870
relationship and she had suggested an

192
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:31,240
article called the the Grover one who's

193
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:34,300
that that's right sorry the grower in

194
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,829
the hash maker and there's like a lot of

195
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,410
people in this industry where there's

196
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:41,560
like really close relationships between

197
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:44,410
the growers I went it has that with the

198
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,879
fish I won't even buy any type or run

199
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,139
any type of flower that I'm not in the

200
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,000
room able to look at so that

201
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:51,158
relationship they dependably important

202
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,029
yeah I look at it I don't want to get

203
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:54,579
how my problems

204
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:56,439
yeah because I operate that's gonna

205
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:57,189
start to glow well yeah if you're in

206

mystery strains and we'll bounce it I

237
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,820

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,950
different strains where you can and he

240
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:42,740
can recall him Oh our mutual friend Joel

241

he's a glassblower he's also one of the

242
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:54,649
redzone of Josh D he was big part of

243
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:56,870
Josh DS legend oh yeah early 90s they

244
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:59,360
were the ones who brought the OG Kush

245
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,070
yeah oh they brought it to dr.

246
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,629
greenthumb we have the same cup we call

247
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,370
it the Hollywood og everybody calls it

248
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:06,439
their own thing we all share the same

249
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:10,940
comes from the stones don't you ever to

250
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:13,070
call them like ghosts in a dynasty they

251
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,700
were so similar they run him at drops DS

252
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:18,410
over there in Carpinteria still but

253
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:28,670
that's what we did you know you find the

254
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:29,480
fire oh I forgot a whole bunch of crap

255
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:33,740
that I thought I brought

256
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:35,570
but say I have the temperature get over

257
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,799
here and I know forgetting a few more

258
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:40,040
things than I want yeah I was pressing

259
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,779
like shit alright so I can show you the

260
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:45,049
difference between live oppressed and

261
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:47,089
you know regular so this is a this was

262
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:51,319
my live fresh frozen is my first time

263
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:53,360
running real quality nugs like I don't

264
00:10:51,320 --> 00:11:03,200
get the opportunity to process the fire

265
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:08,120
nugs where can I go smell that's

266
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,460
Tropicana and I'd only ran a half pound

267
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,799
it was as well as a thousand grams my

268
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:15,230
buddy was a small garden you know and

269
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:17,479
he's in grams wet yeah so that's why

270
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:20,269
he's telling me it's roughly estimated

271
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:24,500
close to a half pound right fresh frozen

272
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:26,809
pound should be 2250 2250 so yeah this

273
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:30,379
one smaller than 450 so one thousand is

274
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:34,939
smaller then that could help my numbers

275
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:37,189
because no I still base it on a thousand

276
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,710
so even though I only pulled 30 grams of

277
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:41,300
pressable hash I don't count my 160 I

278
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:44,000
don't count yeah I throw that now that's

279
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:47,000
my choice what is your your full spec

280
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,759
that you're pulling well I bet you like

281
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,820
to if it's new material I'm not gonna

282
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,529
just do what I normally do to my other

283
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,180
material that I know already so I'm

284
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:58,250
gonna throw all my bags in I'm gonna

285
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:59,839
throw all my bags in I'm gonna wash one

286
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,919
unit and I want to see what I mean if

287
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,560
it's something you've never done that

288
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:08,779
for okay so you want to meet ya

289
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:10,639
everybody talks the 90 you oh are you a

290
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:11,990
complete opposite hash maker I'm a full

291
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,509
spectrum dude I've all ever did not

292
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:16,250
respect until like anybody who tells me

293
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:18,019
different I'm like cool you don't want

294
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,909
to buy my hash that's completely fine I

295
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:24,889
know I've been doing and I know I make a

296
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:27,079
great product talking about you what is

297
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:29,509
what is different from it's an actual

298
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,040
it's actually a very you know good

299
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:32,240
discussion because not too many people

300
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,789
are talking about it and the ones that

301
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,139
are like it's vague there's nothing set

302
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:38,240
in stone as to what full-spectrum

303
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:40,039
actually means right now the guy that I

304
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,840
took most of my stuff from which was

305
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:42,980
superior salt and list he what he calls

306
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,160
full spectrum is twenty

307
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:49,190
five all the way up to to 1925 one yeah

308
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:51,049
okay Micro all the way up to $2.99 a lot

309
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:54,260
of people would not put those in there

310
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:56,509
however when I run stuff that is so good

311
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:58,939
there's nothing in my 219 there's

312
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:01,159
nothing in my 220 nothing so it doesn't

313
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,720
matter that he is throwing it all in

314
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,828
there in my opinion I understand why

315
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,320
he's like no you pull the whole thing

316
00:13:03,828 --> 00:13:07,309
but it's so little on a good quality

317
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,680
product huh

318
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:12,289
that it's almost not necess and what

319
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:14,778
happens with a mediocre quality product

320
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:16,099
it aside and I like stack a jar of it

321
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:18,379
and then I'm kind of mix it together

322
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:21,500
I'll press it and then I'll turn it to

323
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:23,389
edibles so that's what are you do the

324
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:28,278
it's the freebie you know and the homies

325
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:30,709
come over I mean but it's either I

326
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:32,870
called it a trashy Sh pretty much you

327
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:36,259
know what I mean if it's not pressable

328
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:39,198
and like like you said it's all how you

329
00:13:36,259 --> 00:13:41,088
do your wash though because everybody

330
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,919
does their wash is different everybody

331
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:45,050
says oh you should do you know eight

332
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:46,399
washes yes I used to do eight washes but

333
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:48,169
liked every sure he's different

334
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,179
I don't wash lashes on a certain strain

335
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:51,708
and it's fine now washed for another one

336
00:13:50,179 --> 00:13:53,239
it's already turning green dumps into a

337
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:56,539
chlorophyll and they're like okay can't

338
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,789
go any further right sure right now the

339
00:13:56,539 --> 00:14:01,129
Keith in my experience working with

340
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:04,669
material is you're fighting against the

341
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:06,588
the the agitation the breaking down of

342
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:09,769
material in the chloroform all those

343
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:12,319
things are gonna create contamination so

344
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:14,899
my thought process is do it as fast as

345
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:17,120
possible hurry up and get your wash done

346
00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:19,039
so with the different techniques and

347
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,259
different analyzation zyv managed to

348
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,698
only have to do two washes and I do -

349
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:26,000
five minutes five minutes five minutes

350
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:28,759
and I don't do it in dumps so that is

351
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,639
that's a standard process that's my dry

352
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:34,159
material I have to treat my dry material

353
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:36,019
this way because dry material is easier

354
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,600
to fall apart it's easier to the grade

355
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:40,669
it's easier to not make your watch on

356
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,528
him just dry come out white you know I

357
00:14:40,669 --> 00:14:45,500
mean if you want to have a beautiful you

358
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:48,259
can't have the contaminations but you

359
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,899
also don't want to lose your yield so my

360
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:53,568
whole thing is like okay I need to

361
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:55,850
improve my quality and I want to improve

362
00:14:53,568 --> 00:14:56,610
my yield so and therefore I need to

363
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:59,339
decrease

364
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:02,639
my agitation but do certain things to

365
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:05,820
pull these heads off as fast as you do

366
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,370
what do you use fresh water ice yeah I

367
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:11,370
used washing machine I I have four RV

368
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:13,049
washers I have medea big washing it's

369
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,149
equipment like three of the little

370
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:17,909
washer can have like a better more

371
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:19,860
sensitive like surface if you're gonna

372
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:24,838
use dry material there's all of that

373
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:26,519
matter actually it's not yet that's

374
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,440
great thing so it's not gonna cause more

375
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,970
jamming more or less damage because and

376
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,560
I only washed by hand and I also don't

377
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,480
feed biting me pumps everybody else

378
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:34,799
usually has like a washer like he does

379
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,450
where there's a pump that feeds the

380
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,639
water somewhere everything that I do is

381
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,740
gravity fed I have pulleys in my room

382
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,610
where I pulled it back to the ceiling so

383
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:48,269
you build this system myself yeah it use

384
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,889
a deer carcass toys oh yeah I'm gonna

385
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:52,950
have Amazon well just like what is gonna

386
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:55,078
hold 300 pounds of water and ice and you

387
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:57,930
do it differently or did someone teach

388
00:15:55,078 --> 00:16:00,719
you this process no I've just kind of

389
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:01,948
long it I I evolved over like watching

390
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,690
what was on the internet there's no

391
00:16:01,948 --> 00:16:06,028
freaking information out there no one

392
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:09,120
wants so good so what does that do other

393
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:12,328
people use gravity not medicine away

394
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,549
what additional a traditional ways you

395
00:16:12,328 --> 00:16:16,289
hang the bag a little bag and you wash

396
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:18,299
it by hand can bubble bags is who I

397
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:20,909
watched in Amsterdam and yet I did the

398
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:22,620
drill gone oh and he literally held the

399
00:16:20,909 --> 00:16:25,019
bag up and they said tie them off on

400
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:35,570
poles and let drop drip drip and that's

401
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:38,220
exactly no that takes forever lost to

402
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,540
the pumps in a bright and I don't know

403
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,759
if there's any oil in a pump that's

404
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:44,009
being used yeah I don't know your stuff

405
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,649
contamination the only thing on pumping

406
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:49,019
is my raw water with my RO comes to my

407
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:50,940
pump because it's a 300 gallon or ro

408
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:52,589
tank so I have to pump that out so I

409
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,079
have that being pump which is my clean

410
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:57,480
water and then I have my ways oh you do

411
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:59,759
you dumb-butt puri but I'm done right

412
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,980
this was washer well this is the most

413
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,870
important quality you're going for like

414
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,769
what do you like what do you mean like

415
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:10,559
in regards to the preservation like is

416
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:12,509
it is it like when I walk into a

417
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,389
what am I looking for like if I walk

418
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:18,960
into a nine product is it the purest and

419
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:22,200
product my idea you are want an unhappy

420
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:26,370
sure clean the true essence of the

421
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:28,410
flower with out the carcinogenic green

422
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:30,059
material so I want to understand

423
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:32,040
something backwards intuition it's of

424
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:34,649
that it's rinsing it all out if we're

425
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:36,839
doing it right it's already pure unless

426
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:39,060
you unless you have like cats wandering

427
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:41,159
around your room with hair everywhere

428
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,779
like this is the only way you're not so

429
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,340
but we're rinsing to show me think about

430
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:45,809
that again but what you don't you don't

431
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:47,399
understand yes he's rinsing but then it

432
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:48,599
goes into another filtration bagging

433
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,620
through another filtration back through

434
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:51,599
you know and then you have your hash

435
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:53,549
then you put it in another filtration

436
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,859
bag and then you press it you have no

437
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:58,799
idea how much effort see yeah it's going

438
00:17:55,859 --> 00:18:01,919
through getting into my job for example

439
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:05,069
this Cushman's was uh this is my biggest

440
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:08,970
dumper the mints

441
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:10,710
it blew my mind on how this one put out

442
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:15,600
some of the best I've ever made right

443
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:22,670
there so this is a different texture of

444
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:22,669
the click here's a version of it now

445
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:35,009
yeah I thought what we were talking

446
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:37,829
about are we trying to go with this we

447
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:39,299
were talking about the rinsing and just

448
00:18:37,829 --> 00:18:41,849
how many filtration Baumann

449
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:45,659
oh right that's right yeah so on the

450
00:18:41,849 --> 00:18:49,049
Cushman's okay that one right again I I

451
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:51,870
used to do full spec okay I'm a believer

452
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:54,569
of this full spec I still believe in

453
00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:57,209
like for my personal consumption but I

454
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:58,919
am not the person buying my rosin I have

455
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,960
to remember that you know what I mean so

456
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,410
I have to pay attention to what they

457
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:11,750
want so it's it may be against you know

458
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:11,750
what I believe and it's a challenge

459
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,490
my definition of full spec would not be

460
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,250
what his would be my full definition of

461
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:23,190
a full spec would be first run every

462
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:24,420
single bag the the if we're making

463
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,490
bubble hash

464
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,289
that's a different collection I'm gonna

465
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,799
choose different qualities in that case

466
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:33,779
yeah Rasen I'm looking for certain

467
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:36,359
qualities in that hash and there's I

468
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:39,149
don't want floof I call the stocks floof

469
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:41,099
yeah so I don't want flu fight if my

470
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,050
puzzle screw up your freeze-drying

471
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:44,369
too it's it's it's just it's it's not

472
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:46,200
necessary it doesn't make your end

473
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:47,939
quality product there straws they're

474
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,220
empty straws yeah you know and their

475
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,320
fluids empty taste any and it takes all

476
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,569
my you get a pile of it put it on bags

477
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,609
and squish it you get like nothing comes

478
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:59,159
out yes so you know that there's nothing

479
00:19:56,609 --> 00:20:00,539
is freakin flu contamination your yields

480
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,990
go down you know

481
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:07,230
so this Cushman's best whatever I mean I

482
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:11,339
generally pull pressable hash my goal

483
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:18,480
okay as a keeper is 15 to 20 percent

484
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:20,279
that's I don't want evidence which that

485
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,930
is oh it oh that's see he knows what

486
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:23,490
number see that's where I have a hard

487
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,289
time process which is a perfect which is

488
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,900
what you want anything more is just

489
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:30,210
massive icing on the cake where I have

490
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:33,060
like an outdoor GMO that I run with Al

491
00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:36,440
Gore but greenhouse it's just it's

492
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:41,339
sunlight driven but it's it has indoor

493
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:45,930
you know where I'm removing the elements

494
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:47,519
you know what I mean and that's pumping

495
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:49,320
like seven and a half percent which is

496
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,299
insane which would be like fresh frozen

497
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:53,309
yeah which would literally be like 36

498
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:54,899
percent return which is like impossible

499
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:57,059
you do that an app in your head you're

500
00:20:54,900 --> 00:21:00,870
like how does this pull this nug right

501
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:02,399
here 33% of that nug is all crystal how

502
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:04,079
the fuck is that even possible like

503
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,360
maybe the ruining your head like there's

504
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:09,149
no way and then it does it and it's

505
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:12,059
amazing so there's some there's some

506
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:14,640
strain strain specific very strange

507
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:16,859
specific and I've also noticed soil and

508
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,060
Sun really have a major factor on it

509
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:20,219
especially on the time of the year that

510
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:22,829
you're growing it yeah it is a huge

511
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:25,440
difference so oh yeah your environmental

512
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:27,779
conditions completely if you got your

513
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,090
room hot it's just like the Sun is hot

514
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:33,799
you're gonna have melty heads you're not

515
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:36,539
gonna have the most peak performing

516
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:37,649
trikes you know outdoor farmers have a

517
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:40,259
tougher

518
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:42,360
Challenge outdoor hashish ins their

519
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:45,000
process if it's very outdoor we don't

520
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:46,799
get dust yes there's other processes

521
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,450
that you need to do prior to washing

522
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,750
you've got to wash your material so you

523
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:54,590
can wash it literally I mean everybody

524
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:56,309
background it's like great you don't

525
00:21:54,589 --> 00:21:59,819
it's in the air

526
00:21:56,309 --> 00:22:03,119
they can use those so I got my hat's off

527
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:04,919
to the to the guys who process outdoor

528
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:07,949
on the trail and bring the fire because

529
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,410
that is a challenge in itself where I'm

530
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:12,059
fortunate where the indoor material the

531
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,950
doors are closed we're not allowed to

532
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:16,109
walk in there unless we're supposed to

533
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,120
be doing something in there and that's

534
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:19,769
how you you know you keep a facility and

535
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:23,369
the it's called a control environment

536
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:25,319
control that's exactly right because if

537
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:28,019
you open that door everything changes

538
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:29,609
the air evacuate co2 evacuates

539
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:31,319
temperature rise humidity changes that

540
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:33,259
hot air come round bump pop boom

541
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:36,569
everything is off for the next 3-4 hours

542
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:37,769
so you need to minimize that and people

543
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:39,990
don't realize that they want to bring

544
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:41,339
their homies in and I get invited to

545
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,620
other facilities and they're like

546
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:44,879
Oakland or to come on in and I'm like no

547
00:22:43,619 --> 00:22:46,909
no I'm like you don't know where I've

548
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,910
been

549
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,369
that's what I'm saying like I just came

550
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:53,069
from the street I didn't even change

551
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:57,079
like a lot of grow rooms of different

552
00:22:53,069 --> 00:22:57,079
sizes what do you think is the best size

553
00:22:58,009 --> 00:23:06,509
the size that you can Randle depending

554
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,539
on what you can handle the more you have

555
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:11,460
the more details the more things are

556
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:15,480
gonna go wrong so it just depends on

557
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:18,240
what can you handle my opinion for one

558
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,059
person no more than 20 lights 20,000

559
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,109
watts that's for one guy that's what

560
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,429
you're doing any more than that you're

561
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:26,519
gonna have mistakes you're gonna you're

562
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:30,480
gonna better be right with you better be

563
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:31,859
good no vacations no no your homies like

564
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,650
yeah we're gonna go fishing those good

565
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:36,689
no I have a residue change I have to

566
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,610
learn Amelie you are never ready you are

567
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:43,058
a slave

568
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:46,548
that garden yeah that race-off flood

569
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:49,490
light goes out oh yeah oh shit I left

570
00:23:46,548 --> 00:23:51,289
the RO on mmm hello

571
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,929
you're gonna go now it's turned around

572
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:55,700
dude my arms still over those so the

573
00:23:53,929 --> 00:23:58,429
stupid thing won't close and it just

574
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,110
slowly drips and finally I piped it to

575
00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:01,490
the drain when you go to trade shows now

576
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:03,769
what you see are these like cool

577
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:07,880
automated systems they're selling that

578
00:24:03,769 --> 00:24:10,910
you can use nothing is more reliable

579
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,440
than being there and doing it those

580
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:14,450
things can because I pull touch we gotta

581
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,950
monitor them yeah they real work as long

582
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,380
as somebody's there to fix them then

583
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:20,179
they're not because they do the job but

584
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,790
corrosion happens things get caught in

585
00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:26,410
the line you know that's right yes what

586
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:30,319
about lights lights what about my heaven

587
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:33,950
what about what do you like to use for

588
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:36,079
indoor yeah I'm old-school dude or horny

589
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:39,980
lux's yeah you know everyone's now at

590
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:41,629
the DeVito's forties is that ready are

591
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,308
we gonna heater up or I gotta use this

592
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,230
thing right I'm gonna try it and just

593
00:24:43,308 --> 00:24:46,700
use that yeah yeah but give it about oh

594
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:51,620
you're already working on it thank you

595
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:53,900
sweet yeah it all depends on your

596
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:55,548
communities garage either ceiling

597
00:24:53,900 --> 00:25:00,290
usually it works a little better yeah

598
00:24:55,548 --> 00:25:02,509
I personally based on who was get to

599
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:04,609
work Ross I don't even have the desire

600
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:07,039
to grow at home because the level that

601
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:09,709
I'm able to see these guys perform at it

602
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,558
just like it's like why even try like in

603
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:15,230
my eyes because I'm lucky enough to be a

604
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:20,359
part of this facility every day where I

605
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:23,419
feel well not only that I might grow fix

606
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:25,579
by being a part of their facility so I'm

607
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:28,850
like I don't need a fucking headache at

608
00:25:25,579 --> 00:25:31,220
home so it allows me to dedicate more of

609
00:25:28,849 --> 00:25:34,069
my time to my craft and my growing which

610
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:35,360
if I weren't in that position then yeah

611
00:25:34,069 --> 00:25:40,298
I'd want to definitely grow like I've

612
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:40,298
always grown group go yeah

613
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:56,690
it might be a little whoa you guys have

614
00:25:53,358 --> 00:26:00,528
Meeks yeah it's right there charlie okay

615
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:00,979
my buddy's dude yeah what do you call

616
00:26:00,528 --> 00:26:07,249
this one

617
00:26:00,979 --> 00:26:23,719
I was watermelon og but that grape

618
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:25,848
stompers thank you no do something to me

619
00:26:23,719 --> 00:26:27,798
break it without being on the pad there

620
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:30,468
only the truth how was it taste good

621
00:26:27,798 --> 00:26:32,868
yeah and it hit nice - it didn't I'm not

622
00:26:30,469 --> 00:26:35,778
a big dabber number one I tell you I

623
00:26:32,868 --> 00:26:38,749
only do dabs to test my product you know

624
00:26:35,778 --> 00:26:40,069
and and also to enjoy with friends so

625
00:26:38,749 --> 00:26:42,950
it's like a social thing you know what I

626
00:26:40,069 --> 00:26:45,259
mean but I'm not a I don't have my own

627
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:47,179
peak I don't have I have my own Gaborik

628
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:49,098
but again I don't use it to test it so

629
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:50,629
people can so that way I know if there's

630
00:26:49,098 --> 00:26:51,999
any contaminations in my prodigal so

631
00:26:50,628 --> 00:26:55,819
what's your favorite method of

632
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:58,519
consumption what we just had I had a

633
00:26:55,819 --> 00:27:00,138
snake in here so I prefer putting my

634
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:04,338
hash back with the flour

635
00:27:00,138 --> 00:27:06,138
I like that combo I also will top just

636
00:27:04,338 --> 00:27:08,450
about every Bowl I smoked whether it's a

637
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:10,998
bong or a pipe it gets a little piece of

638
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:12,859
rosin and that's why I prefer my type of

639
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:15,558
texture versus the jar tech which

640
00:27:12,858 --> 00:27:17,028
applies heat makes it all gummy it's so

641
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:30,888
important if you guys could talk about

642
00:27:17,028 --> 00:27:32,959
texture can you speak more on growing

643
00:27:30,888 --> 00:27:34,699
for the melt one of the main one of the

644
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:36,109
main reasons I follow you all is I'm on

645
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,348
the East Coast where we don't have good

646
00:27:36,108 --> 00:27:41,749
melt knowledge so what's the question

647
00:27:39,348 --> 00:27:44,538
regarding melt I think growing fur melt

648
00:27:41,749 --> 00:27:46,700
like um well just what genetics you like

649
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:49,098
to grow for it's a very strained

650
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:53,110
dependent do you know for good melts a

651
00:27:49,098 --> 00:27:55,329
lot of this thick stuff that pumps

652
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:56,889
is much better with the melt the GMO is

653
00:27:55,329 --> 00:27:59,649
really good the cookies-and-cream stuff

654
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:01,900
the strong anti stuff is really good but

655
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:03,519
you have to once you grow it wherever

656
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,990
you're at that's when you have to do

657
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:06,549
your tests that he's talking about you

658
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:10,390
have to break down all those bags and

659
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:11,919
actually do a test of each head to see

660
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:15,490
which one melts the best where the meet

661
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:17,050
set like yeah what else that and you

662
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:18,400
better think oh well the first wash is

663
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:19,750
always the best well that's not true

664
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:21,640
sometimes the first wash you're getting

665
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:24,279
a lot of dirt because you are washing

666
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,960
your plant you're you're cleaning a lot

667
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:28,149
of crap off that's just been built up

668
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,059
there's dust every room you go in in

669
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:33,670
every house it builds up doesn't matter

670
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:35,500
so sometimes I feel the second and third

671
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:38,050
wash are really good really oh yeah

672
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,390
third you can jump used to be my dumper

673
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:42,700
when I when I washed three times on a

674
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:44,800
regular my third was my dumper but my

675
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:52,559
number two is my dumper I get it number

676
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:55,990
one number two it's it's it's I mean if

677
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:58,629
I wouldn't grow four four melt I would

678
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:00,940
grow for what you desire taste and then

679
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:03,970
you can figure out your melt you can

680
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:07,299
figure out which ones you want to choose

681
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:09,309
to you know go down that path in that

682
00:29:07,299 --> 00:29:11,470
when that happens okay I want this

683
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:13,240
strain okay I want you know strong Anna

684
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:15,039
or whatever the case may be but like I

685
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,990
haven't seen there's not much melt out

686
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,149
there there's like oh gee you know

687
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:21,160
there's no oh geez it's not if there's

688
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:25,390
not a big deal wash wash got a big

689
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:28,000
market I have like the old school the og

690
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:31,270
rascal Wi-Fi cut and this thing pumps

691
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,670
for Wi-Fi for an OG like it actually

692
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:38,889
smells like OG and does well and it's

693
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:40,120
white tell ya it's one of the few og

694
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:42,400
strains that comes through and you're

695
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:44,669
like okay cool it so gene it's still

696
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,670
half

697
00:30:00,118 --> 00:30:06,308
actually here's an OG I just happened to

698
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,629
have it in there and you got to open it

699
00:30:06,308 --> 00:30:11,678
up you know what I mean like give it the

700
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:13,719
world yeah my buddy grows oh geez he

701
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,190
gave me a pound of trim and same thing

702
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:21,129
Washington want to see what I do you

703
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:24,759
know what comes with oh nice and it's

704
00:30:21,128 --> 00:30:26,408
yeah that was that's like you know you

705
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:28,479
sometimes you just go into a room and

706
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:32,278
you're lucky with a strain it's got that

707
00:30:28,479 --> 00:30:36,009
sour bite like make sure your salivary

708
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:38,618
it just was probably one of the best

709
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:40,028
terpenes that I've ever had come out you

710
00:30:38,618 --> 00:30:41,769
know like okay the plant smelled like

711
00:30:40,028 --> 00:30:43,839
that and you wash it and it just smells

712
00:30:41,769 --> 00:30:44,829
even better than the plant did and

713
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:46,388
that's what you're trying to capture

714
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:48,368
you're trying to capture the essence the

715
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:49,719
essence of that plant and then when

716
00:30:48,368 --> 00:30:53,228
there's other things sprayed on that

717
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,778
plant it it comes out stronger you know

718
00:30:53,229 --> 00:30:56,798
that extra or you'll get a bad taste in

719
00:30:55,778 --> 00:30:58,210
the back here throat like almost

720
00:30:56,798 --> 00:30:59,528
immediately if someone's sprayed in

721
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:03,759
their plant and you're gonna turn it

722
00:30:59,528 --> 00:31:04,628
into ash is that the only one that

723
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:08,548
doesn't die

724
00:31:04,628 --> 00:31:10,509
that's the wife I want it's a Wi-Fi

725
00:31:08,548 --> 00:31:12,278
there's only one that doesn't have a

726
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:14,679
sticker and that's the alien rock candy

727
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:16,358
which only pumped like 2%

728
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:19,359
I like your packaging thank you Matt

729
00:31:16,358 --> 00:31:21,668
it's dope this just a label maker

730
00:31:19,358 --> 00:31:25,388
brothers a secret but it fits your jar /

731
00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:28,570
yeah it's a jar real gold sticker plug

732
00:31:25,388 --> 00:31:32,288
what sticker plug he orders them from

733
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:33,668
Germany and they're actually then I

734
00:31:32,288 --> 00:31:35,558
wrote the my Ron they're not just

735
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:38,739
painted glass no it's the real deal

736
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:41,378
the actual glass is that color they're

737
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:44,169
more expensive than any jar I use it

738
00:31:41,378 --> 00:31:46,748
sucks my bigger jars my big ball jars

739
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:48,820
are cheaper than these my big ball jars

740
00:31:46,749 --> 00:31:52,950
with the metal cap and everything are

741
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:52,950
literally like 60 cents cheaper each

742
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,159
they keep the sunlight out that's the

743
00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:00,129
benefit of those and they're extremely

744
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:01,550
these are all his yeah the little little

745
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:04,289
my Ron

746
00:32:01,549 --> 00:32:06,809
these are all different flavors I have

747
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:10,049
the clear bottom ones so they that's so

748
00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:13,859
they it's kind of burdening I don't buy

749
00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:16,669
them they actually just they come to me

750
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:19,679
[Music]

751
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:21,120
I'm not that I'd we'd not that I get up

752
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:24,480
for free I'm just saying that I don't go

753
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:26,129
out and get them I could order them but

754
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,299
they're so damn expensive unless you

755
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:35,000
order 10,000 so he orders the 10k and

756
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:35,000
then I get a little bit of a cut not

757
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:44,400
that's five great question washes I

758
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:46,710
believe and it's all five washes it's

759
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:52,800
not just first or anything little speck

760
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:57,390
it's all five washes forty you to 179 is

761
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:59,309
what you use I use ice extracts that's

762
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:00,750
that's what I like it because they have

763
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:03,419
like different numbers that's I'm like

764
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:06,140
yeah got them nice like and then I can

765
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:08,370
oh I also even have like a 104 bag and

766
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,930
they're they're really nice and they

767
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:12,329
hold up really well and I probably

768
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:15,180
doesn't like 500 washes of them and they

769
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:17,159
look like the dad mom really so yeah I

770
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:19,320
really highly recommend the ice extracts

771
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:22,890
bags are you just doing a natural cold

772
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:26,119
cure um I I press very hot though people

773
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:30,390
trip on how hot I press I press it to 24

774
00:33:26,119 --> 00:33:32,549
224 degrees and direct into a jar once I

775
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:33,900
press direct into a jar I whatever is

776
00:33:32,549 --> 00:33:35,099
left on the paper which isn't much

777
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,430
because I have a pretty good funnel

778
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:40,079
flows yeah I just throw into the top of

779
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:42,150
the jar put the lid on and I set it in a

780
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:43,559
dark room for like three days to three

781
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,590
why does that seem like it would be too

782
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:47,909
hot because it would have a parade

783
00:33:45,589 --> 00:33:50,189
people think that you're burning it or

784
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:51,690
it's gonna like we're gonna ruin it but

785
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,279
if you watch any one of my live videos

786
00:33:51,690 --> 00:33:56,070
you can watch one from today if you go

787
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,240
on my yeah on my Instagram I was like I

788
00:33:56,069 --> 00:33:57,629
said I was pressing right before I got

789
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:02,069
here

790
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:03,840
I pressed at 225 224 whatever then it

791
00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:06,240
was piss yellow I mean I said why does

792
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:09,559
you want it what well how many grams are

793
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:13,378
you going in on your puck like I do like

794
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:15,070
22 gram bags and then I do like four to

795
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:17,469
six of them I can

796
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:20,019
do that goes into one jar yeah and that

797
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:22,629
all go to one jar I don't I try not to

798
00:34:20,019 --> 00:34:23,739
do more than a hundred grams at a time

799
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:25,990
because then it won't fit in the jar

800
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:28,419
it'll actually like start to muffin up

801
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:31,569
so crazy you kind of gotta like Table

802
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:33,550
eight now so like 90 is about what you

803
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,260
want to do it the most and then I just

804
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:37,120
jar it on the lid and I said it in a

805
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,710
dark room that's a little bit warmer

806
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,469
because I for some reason I have this

807
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:43,990
closet that has my water heater in it so

808
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:45,579
it stays at about eighty degrees and I

809
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:47,919
just put it on a wood shelf so it's not

810
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:48,969
like on metal where it's getting hot and

811
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,099
cold hot and cold

812
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:53,230
wood on that content wood a thick piece

813
00:34:51,099 --> 00:34:58,690
of wood takes longer to change

814
00:34:53,230 --> 00:35:00,340
temperatures like 60 to 80 grams and

815
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:02,559
then like two or three days and then

816
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,420
depending on consistency like I have

817
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,400
this gnarly tool that I just beat the

818
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:10,150
living hell out of it with and I just

819
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:14,349
twist it up and smash it and go over and

820
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:15,940
over like two or three days you can sort

821
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:17,289
of see it start to do like a little bit

822
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,570
of a change and it'll almost like

823
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:22,119
separate itself from the jar and they'll

824
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:24,519
be like like white flaky lines towards

825
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:26,079
the bottom and stuff like that and you

826
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:28,210
just know okay it's good to go and it'll

827
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,190
usually build up a little pressure and

828
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,900
when you crack them too you know okay

829
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:34,030
cool it's been doing its thing that's

830
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,340
fermenting it's rotting it's it's eating

831
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:38,440
ensuring the Turks are literally doing

832
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:40,630
what it's supposed to it's it's getting

833
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,840
juicier and that's usually where they

834
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:46,750
call just stolen my stuff anyway so yeah

835
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,519
it's and like you couldn't build that

836
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:51,070
room that's just something that that

837
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:52,929
he's done it is lucky you know and it

838
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:55,090
literally like I bet you figured that

839
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:56,829
out by just yeah just screwing with it

840
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:58,240
and I've asked a million people hey how

841
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:59,829
do you do this and I've tried the other

842
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,289
way where people throw it in the oven at

843
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:03,340
like 200 degrees and let it cook down in

844
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:04,779
the oven and then right when they're

845
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,730
supposed to pull it out and whip it and

846
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:08,650
I'm like screw that I'm not heating my

847
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:10,599
stuff back up I'm not I'm not putting it

848
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:12,849
in through anything like that I'm not

849
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:14,289
even setting it on a heat mat at 100 I'm

850
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:15,940
just gonna put it in that room let it

851
00:36:14,289 --> 00:36:16,960
sit do it's they make sense and then I

852
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,750
beat the hell out of it to the point

853
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,539
where it becomes like super gooey and

854
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:23,980
super you know what thing would cook it

855
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:26,059
it's how it seems like it would be that

856
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:28,469
other process yet in the other

857
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:29,639
and a lot of people were all about that

858
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:32,009
for a minute and they liked that

859
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:33,359
consistency and like he said sometimes

860
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,190
you have to do what your customers are

861
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,840
asking and I was telling them you're

862
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,099
wrong this is not the way to do it we

863
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,110
shouldn't be putting it in the dam of

864
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:45,779
and they're like just just do it and

865
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:48,960
I'll buy it all know it just like turns

866
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:51,150
it like while we're in like like I don't

867
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,639
know I think by the consistency of mine

868
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:55,079
right now is the easiest way to dab the

869
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:56,279
easiest way to get it on add a burden

870
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:01,019
stays on the battery

871
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:02,430
would you like to demonstrate sure looks

872
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:04,349
loose I'm gonna I want to do some of the

873
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:07,589
grape stomper because I really haven't

874
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:10,549
seen any or I certainly haven't like

875
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:12,780
been posting much of this information

876
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:17,640
literally as soon as I knew as soon as I

877
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:19,140
made it it was gonna go so but anyway so

878
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:22,199
you can just kind of get a good job of

879
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:26,759
it you know you can easily do that you

880
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:29,099
could break it in half it stays on there

881
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,870
you can even wipe it off with your

882
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:40,319
finger if you don't want to press it on

883
00:37:30,869 --> 00:37:49,230
to the to the Banger itself I actually

884
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:51,870
do courts only oh no I just don't like

885
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:53,699
ceramic I've never been a ceramic fan

886
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:56,219
that's really good that's just that's

887
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:58,409
just don't like the way it tastes really

888
00:37:56,219 --> 00:38:00,659
actually I think course tastes the best

889
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:02,219
first it's for a high quality tab like

890
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:08,129
this I mean it doesn't would mean it

891
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:09,839
doesn't have one I don't know that's

892
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:13,079
it's personal preference like the owner

893
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,850
of puff co would call me crazy come on

894
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:16,769
they don't yeah yeah yeah he would be

895
00:38:14,849 --> 00:38:20,130
like what are you talking about cuz he

896
00:38:16,769 --> 00:38:23,159
only uses his ceramic one but I'm I'm

897
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:27,750
course I'm yeah I'm courts only okay

898
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:29,609
that's just I feel like no I think

899
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,739
courts has virtually no taste is the

900
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:33,870
purest way to smoke anything on top of

901
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:35,219
yeah yeah I mean come on I was I was

902
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:36,269
smoking weed out of a can in high school

903
00:38:35,219 --> 00:38:39,119
well it's not let's not talk about

904
00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:40,559
semantics here you know I always

905
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:57,210
collected

906
00:38:40,559 --> 00:39:01,460
inside the residence we were making

907
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:01,460
concentrates in our little metal pipes

908
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:12,619
and it was literally in the tire and we

909
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:19,190
would chip it out of the tire and then

910
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:19,190
crazy Danny would be like lizards in it

911
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:33,900
smoking all the crazy shit back in the

912
00:39:30,509 --> 00:39:40,949
back in the day yeah let's discharge it

913
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:47,970
all damn it yeah I thought it was

914
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:50,038
charging oh you guys want to try one of

915
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:53,808
these give it a go let's see here let's

916
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:59,039
start off with the Mack yeah definitely

917
00:39:53,809 --> 00:40:01,859
that's Mack dry trim material the reason

918
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:03,359
I started pooling the 90 you I started

919
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:07,139
with the Mack that was my first

920
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:08,730
experiment because before that before I

921
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:10,710
started pulling different bags and it's

922
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:13,528
you know paying closer attention to my

923
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:16,588
head sizes and things like that my full

924
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:20,880
spec you asked me earlier would have

925
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:24,058
been the what is it 144 sorry we just

926
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:28,588
remember 160 the the basically the 160

927
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:31,528
is a 159 teen year 45 I don't really get

928
00:40:28,588 --> 00:40:33,538
much in my 25 but all the little broken

929
00:40:31,528 --> 00:40:36,509
plant material that got through

930
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:38,730
everything else I used to save it and

931
00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:40,528
now it just slows down my draining yeah

932
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:43,019
it just slows the process so I don't

933
00:40:40,528 --> 00:40:43,858
even have a 25 it's 40 and then go

934
00:40:43,018 --> 00:40:46,258
straight tomorrow

935
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:47,818
and I all my plants that are my my

936
00:40:46,259 --> 00:40:49,048
greenhouse plants get watered with my

937
00:40:47,818 --> 00:40:51,759
wash oh hell yeah

938
00:40:49,048 --> 00:40:53,590
that's a nutrition right there that

939
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,150
same nutrients that you're feeding yeah

940
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:57,190
that's what you're washing out that's

941
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:59,500
what's coming out those anti-science

942
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:01,240
better so you just recycle that water

943
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,219
and put it down and it's RO water so I

944
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:05,889
know it's clean it's like I just yeah

945
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:07,209
and it tastes like weed and smell just

946
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:09,369
don't pour it in there like immediately

947
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:11,349
because it's really cold give it a day

948
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:13,989
to warm up and leave it in a bucket in

949
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:16,210
the damp it and man that stuff stinks

950
00:41:13,989 --> 00:41:24,159
yeah let me tell you yeah it's loud your

951
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:25,869
whole backyard on my street like every

952
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:27,670
other day and there's times where I'm

953
00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:30,309
just like sitting in my house not doing

954
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:32,170
anything and it smells so bad like as if

955
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:35,199
the skunk walked into my house and

956
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:36,430
sprayed my entire house no you don't

957
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:37,659
even know then you never see anything

958
00:41:36,429 --> 00:41:39,460
and you're just like literally it

959
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:41,889
smelled like an electrical fire it's so

960
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,449
like potent and insane and like it

961
00:41:41,889 --> 00:41:45,819
smells almost like chemicals it's it's

962
00:41:43,449 --> 00:41:47,710
really crazy so yeah I really

963
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:50,289
I'm sure it's gotten me off the hook a

964
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:52,389
couple times right yeah I guess it's

965
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:55,210
good yeah and my neighbors like this

966
00:41:52,389 --> 00:41:56,859
super cool lady she's like 90 years old

967
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,809
and she's from the Yucatan and she's

968
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:00,460
like just badass and she feeds the

969
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:01,630
squirrels and the birds and all the

970
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:03,670
other neighbors hate her and I love her

971
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:08,230
to death I'm like yeah bother them all I

972
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:10,119
don't care no actually the only problems

973
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:11,920
I have is because she leaves those nuts

974
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:13,929
and stuff out for the squirrels they go

975
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,369
and bury them in my yard sometimes a

976
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:19,679
little digging yeah I get a little

977
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:19,679
digging action going on once in a while

978
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:26,899
so when I was washing this one I ran all

979
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:31,380
my bags again and then I was like damn

980
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:35,550
1090 you is that on this one and the 45

981
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:37,619
was like smaller than this okay

982
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,990
usually when I do a big wash I'm usually

983
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:42,000
washing 10 pounds so that's you know 10

984
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:43,679
12 pounds what he's smoking on right

985
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,880
there no I just hit the gripper but I'm

986
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:46,049
about to do something about it right

987
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,410
right sorry

988
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:53,400
that's a Mac one so that's the caps cut

989
00:42:49,409 --> 00:42:55,739
that was gifted to the real iog and the

990
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,050
real iog tissue cultured it and gifted

991
00:42:55,739 --> 00:43:01,669
it to LA family farms and so that's how

992
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:08,580
that's that is the true tissue cultured

993
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:10,680
Mac one miracle alien cookies so like I

994
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:13,079
was saying I ran all the bags and then I

995
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:15,960
was like wow this thing does have a phat

996
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:20,569
90 and it had like a you know a big 90

997
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:24,539
you like this a 45 about that size

998
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:26,850
73 like that size and so I'm like I'm

999
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:30,599
okay with leaving that out you know what

1000
00:43:26,849 --> 00:43:34,289
I mean yeah it's not gonna hurt me

1001
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:35,969
compared to this so and if it's a really

1002
00:43:34,289 --> 00:43:37,259
that much of a difference like it looks

1003
00:43:35,969 --> 00:43:39,599
way different there's a different color

1004
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:40,920
by all means please you know you I was a

1005
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,900
hash maker you don't want it in there

1006
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,269
it'll boost your product way up by

1007
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,160
taking it out my buddy's product for

1008
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:49,710
example I do this the first time I ran

1009
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:50,299
it was that that 1,000 grams right I was

1010
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:54,360
telling you about

1011
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:57,539
yeah this is the one and guess where the

1012
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:59,190
meat was did that smell so familiar

1013
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:01,349
guess where the meat was that Mac that's

1014
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:05,880
Tropicana cook oh it is chopped cookies

1015
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:11,219
like I just ran some of this that the

1016
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:12,630
meat was the 45 the 45 that was where

1017
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:15,389
the meat that the heads were smaller

1018
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:17,090
there was and after I did it I realized

1019
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:18,319
I'm like maybe there was you know

1020
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:20,420
done he might not have ran it in the

1021
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,460
manner wheel or something told me he cut

1022
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,990
it early that's it that's what he did so

1023
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,090
there's also probably why I came out

1024
00:44:23,989 --> 00:44:28,699
whiter why do you think I've get her fat

1025
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:31,220
her head cuz le family farms they are

1026
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:33,529
not pulling early a lot of times they'll

1027
00:44:31,219 --> 00:44:36,049
pushing them to see what the genetics

1028
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:39,260
could actually do different conditions

1029
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:41,300
change the the length you can steer the

1030
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:43,460
plant to finish early or you can steer

1031
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,930
the plant to finish longer and and it's

1032
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,670
amazing what some of these strains do

1033
00:44:44,929 --> 00:44:48,079
some line you could do a lot with like

1034
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:50,720
just what you're feeding it by adding

1035
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,069
potassium at a certain time and whatever

1036
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:54,469
there's a guy that I follow named blue a

1037
00:44:52,070 --> 00:44:56,480
green tank the guy is so sick he doesn't

1038
00:44:54,469 --> 00:45:00,319
even feed his plants any food he makes

1039
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,760
these little avocado husks that he cuts

1040
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:04,070
all the meat out and then he adds like

1041
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,260
all of his nutrients into like a big mix

1042
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:07,970
in a big bowl and then puts it back in

1043
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:12,520
the avocado house sets it on the ground

1044
00:45:07,969 --> 00:45:15,169
and he has so much like so much bacteria

1045
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:17,119
beneficial bacteria and worms and lots

1046
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:19,369
of bugs and he literally just has a

1047
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,920
dripper that goes of water that goes on

1048
00:45:19,369 --> 00:45:23,299
the avocado and then he's grabbed the

1049
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,900
avocados flipped him over and it's just

1050
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:29,360
a giant puddle of red worms and just

1051
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,369
like what dude he's the cabin water he's

1052
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:34,099
like I had bananas for potassium I use

1053
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:35,630
barley and pumpkin ground-up pumpkin

1054
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:37,159
seeds you're like dude how do you even

1055
00:45:35,630 --> 00:45:39,140
know this shit like what are you talking

1056
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:46,460
about how did you learn to do this he's

1057
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:49,900
like Koreans man they're badass yeah I

1058
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,900
can't all right all right

1059
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:58,459
but yeah he was like he and he's very

1060
00:45:53,710 --> 00:46:02,920
he's very like open with his info he

1061
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:02,920
posted everything and he's super cool

1062
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,230
but it's also testament to how powerful

1063
00:46:06,619 --> 00:46:12,679
these plants are you know they they draw

1064
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:16,130
everything out it's crazy how versatile

1065
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:17,839
they are to that one that's the Mac yeah

1066
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:21,070
can I try this yeah please thank you

1067
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:25,579
yeah you know I I'm a believer of

1068
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:27,320
sharing information to a degree 2 degree

1069
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:29,599
B you know there are certain things that

1070
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:32,350
you just those are just your

1071
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:35,119
yeah that's that's what keeps you

1072
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:38,089
different there's also like that I could

1073
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,380
tell you some things you can't yeah even

1074
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:42,019
if I told you and I showed you a video

1075
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:44,390
you have to do it 20 times and screw up

1076
00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:50,119
five right to really learn it you don't

1077
00:46:44,389 --> 00:46:51,980
know how much material and mistakes you

1078
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:56,239
don't know were you just like how I do

1079
00:46:51,980 --> 00:47:01,369
sometimes I'm like that was a fail where

1080
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:04,039
I have done a few like first time fail

1081
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:05,900
second time fail 13 and I'm doing

1082
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:07,730
everything that I normally do right and

1083
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,650
then I just have to get it and I pull my

1084
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:12,409
hair and I'm like I'm like what the fuck

1085
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:14,510
like everything that I know is not

1086
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:15,589
fucked like I want to blow up and then I

1087
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:18,410
have to tell myself dude

1088
00:47:15,590 --> 00:47:20,630
just let go and then awesome you think I

1089
00:47:18,409 --> 00:47:23,239
started a lottery sometimes you forgot

1090
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:27,079
something you need to start and do the

1091
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:28,879
alphabet you're forgetting a step and

1092
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:31,639
you're rushing and you're getting

1093
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,320
frustrated and it's not it is not this

1094
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:35,299
machine's fault that you want to kick

1095
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:38,000
and throw through the fucking wall it's

1096
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:45,800
you and you just be cool

1097
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:48,829
smoking ball reset come back a B C D eat

1098
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:53,750
all the way through Z and then I nailed

1099
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:56,719
it because you get you get accustomed to

1100
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:59,269
nailing it at times you know especially

1101
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:01,639
when I'm running the same material over

1102
00:47:59,269 --> 00:48:03,469
and over and over and over and then you

1103
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:06,739
think I'm gonna do that same thing to

1104
00:48:03,469 --> 00:48:08,659
this thing and it just doesn't work it

1105
00:48:06,739 --> 00:48:12,819
just doesn't work and so now you have to

1106
00:48:08,659 --> 00:48:14,779
recreate a recipe to produce the what

1107
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:16,640
whoever you're really good to keep a

1108
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:18,860
book of screams forget what's happening

1109
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:22,129
and not only that if animate some luck

1110
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:23,960
as to whether chain my cush Mints the

1111
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:26,780
way that I started processing their

1112
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:29,809
Cushman's was not what you see today

1113
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:32,630
it's the ability to continuously process

1114
00:48:29,809 --> 00:48:35,329
that material and get to learn about it

1115
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:39,050
like a relationship you've gotta be

1116
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:41,750
around it continue to nurture it look at

1117
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:42,080
it evaluate it be with it be a part of

1118
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,329
it

1119
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,528
watch the squish

1120
00:48:43,329 --> 00:48:48,169
understand that the more you understand

1121
00:48:45,528 --> 00:48:51,139
especially you can hold that's that's a

1122
00:48:48,168 --> 00:48:51,798
whole nother you can you can't teach

1123
00:48:51,139 --> 00:48:53,989
that

1124
00:48:51,798 --> 00:48:55,130
oh how long the squire think oh just

1125
00:48:53,989 --> 00:48:57,650
because I tell you doesn't mean you know

1126
00:48:55,130 --> 00:49:00,140
when to push I squished fifty seconds

1127
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:01,429
you know people are like what I suppose

1128
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:07,009
I squish for four and a half minutes

1129
00:49:01,429 --> 00:49:09,679
exactly i squish at one eighty twenty

1130
00:49:07,009 --> 00:49:10,880
four there's like thirty four forty five

1131
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:12,349
degree difference and look at the

1132
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:14,209
texture differences there night and day

1133
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:16,429
they don't look like the same hash maker

1134
00:49:14,208 --> 00:49:20,389
did it so that's what makes it's your

1135
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:24,039
signature it's really cool I can do

1136
00:49:20,389 --> 00:49:29,808
laser logo designs on my textures I

1137
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:36,489
believe this is just my belief okay yeah

1138
00:49:29,809 --> 00:49:38,929
I did French cheese you want to try yeah

1139
00:49:36,489 --> 00:49:41,269
I want like the hell with the

1140
00:49:38,929 --> 00:49:43,909
marketplace I'm doing like you're gonna

1141
00:49:41,268 --> 00:49:46,639
like how I do then he gets a very

1142
00:49:43,909 --> 00:49:48,169
personalized it's like you're chefs or

1143
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:49,668
something you know you can only do that

1144
00:49:48,168 --> 00:49:53,018
to an extent and you're gonna put

1145
00:49:49,668 --> 00:49:56,058
yourself in a corner and what I see is

1146
00:49:53,018 --> 00:50:00,048
that's another challenge so I love

1147
00:49:56,059 --> 00:50:05,900
challenges I'm a puzzle guy so I like to

1148
00:50:00,048 --> 00:50:07,219
break down analyze backwards you know

1149
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:10,309
what do they call that when you you know

1150
00:50:07,219 --> 00:50:12,708
a read the reverse engineer I'm that

1151
00:50:10,309 --> 00:50:13,369
type of my I read instruction manuals

1152
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:15,739
for pleasure

1153
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:17,809
like I don't read books you know what I

1154
00:50:15,739 --> 00:50:19,880
mean I I'd read instruction manuals I

1155
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:21,380
like to know how machines work I'm not

1156
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,579
the guy that it says oh yeah I'm gonna

1157
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:24,798
make this thing work

1158
00:50:22,579 --> 00:50:26,989
yeah I don't like that people don't like

1159
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:28,969
understand how like pumps work or like

1160
00:50:26,989 --> 00:50:30,918
you need to understand how a vacuum pump

1161
00:50:28,969 --> 00:50:32,809
works before you're running your freeze

1162
00:50:30,918 --> 00:50:34,308
dryer understand what you're using

1163
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:36,979
what kind of pump oil goes in there

1164
00:50:34,309 --> 00:50:40,519
understand that how vacuum works

1165
00:50:36,978 --> 00:50:42,348
understand how when you open a valve

1166
00:50:40,518 --> 00:50:44,149
what which way the air is gonna go

1167
00:50:42,349 --> 00:50:46,309
through oh you're gonna put it on dude

1168
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:47,719
go slow so you don't think about that

1169
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:49,819
they don't give it to you they don't

1170
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:51,708
tell you there's nothing there isn't

1171
00:50:49,818 --> 00:50:53,900
even harvest harvest right they don't

1172
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:55,098
even have they shouldn't hold it fully

1173
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:56,989
don't even happen

1174
00:50:55,099 --> 00:50:58,729
we're making hash and we're taking care

1175
00:50:56,989 --> 00:51:01,670
of the Machine better than what there's

1176
00:50:58,728 --> 00:51:04,728
no no we troubleshooting this guy this

1177
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:06,858
guy's solving must be a bnv he has had

1178
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:09,198
to take his entire machine apart redo

1179
00:51:06,858 --> 00:51:12,528
the firmware redo everything and

1180
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:14,088
literally like teach them their mistakes

1181
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:15,858
and what in their and their dude he said

1182
00:51:14,088 --> 00:51:17,208
he was like soldering shit I'm like what

1183
00:51:15,858 --> 00:51:19,098
uh-huh I'm like dude that you're not

1184
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:20,239
attacked like he's like I had to be they

1185
00:51:19,099 --> 00:51:21,499
didn't want to take it back they didn't

1186
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:21,949
want to help they don't want to do

1187
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:23,358
nothing

1188
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:24,680
he said they kept sending him like flash

1189
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:26,778
drives where he'd have to plug in the

1190
00:51:24,679 --> 00:51:33,198
flash drive redo everything and I'm like

1191
00:51:26,778 --> 00:51:36,498
bro you could give it about ten seconds

1192
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:39,139
maybe maybe fifteen that's the cows cut

1193
00:51:36,498 --> 00:51:42,318
too nice such a small world right right

1194
00:51:39,139 --> 00:51:44,598
it is it is a small circle it's not a

1195
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:48,978
big it's not as big as you think and

1196
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:52,278
that's where your reputation matters

1197
00:51:48,978 --> 00:51:54,618
yeah not being a freaking scumbag not

1198
00:51:52,278 --> 00:51:56,478
being a liar not doing videos not

1199
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:59,630
running plants that are freakin sprayed

1200
00:51:56,478 --> 00:52:01,578
not you know dude just being good to

1201
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:03,079
your fellow man it's like so hard to

1202
00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:05,089
find somebody out there like that

1203
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:07,039
and I spent a breath of fresh air

1204
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:10,639
finding some hash makers that are so

1205
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:13,009
freakin humble and cool and like willing

1206
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:14,719
to share info like that guy Anthony the

1207
00:52:13,009 --> 00:52:16,519
solvent must be enemy cannabis cam

1208
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:18,588
Cameron's like one of the nicest people

1209
00:52:16,518 --> 00:52:20,629
in the world and like he's given me so

1210
00:52:18,588 --> 00:52:23,328
much information and helped me be

1211
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:25,009
confident just to you know just to go

1212
00:52:23,329 --> 00:52:28,278
swimming in the deep waters you know

1213
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:30,650
where you like all this weed in the

1214
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:31,670
freaking in the water and I saw we're

1215
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:33,829
not gonna know what's gonna happen you

1216
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:37,670
know so yeah that's the thing about

1217
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:39,859
washing and the process is that I do I'm

1218
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:41,719
not the guy that likes to wait after the

1219
00:52:39,858 --> 00:52:43,338
freeze dryer you know cuz that's a whole

1220
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:44,449
fucking nightmare for me to sleep

1221
00:52:43,338 --> 00:52:46,400
through that you know what I mean like

1222
00:52:44,449 --> 00:52:48,588
you dump it with all the water like I

1223
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,809
check numbers I'm a numbers % guy so

1224
00:52:48,588 --> 00:52:52,219
after I do my wash I still wash and I

1225
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:53,959
squeeze like the traditional hash

1226
00:52:52,219 --> 00:52:57,048
methods and I do my cutting up but again

1227
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:59,838
temperatures play a huge role in my

1228
00:52:57,048 --> 00:53:02,208
ability to pull that off but I always

1229
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:04,548
check my numbers I know based on the

1230
00:53:02,208 --> 00:53:06,679
pool that I got I got what I needed

1231
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:09,219
and if I didn't then I didn't

1232
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:12,349
damn good wash in and there's and

1233
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:15,439
everything every second counts man like

1234
00:53:12,349 --> 00:53:17,239
that's how I count every millisecond

1235
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,679
everything if I get distracted

1236
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:20,539
even when I'm pressing because I do

1237
00:53:18,679 --> 00:53:23,690
fifty second presses I did it you know

1238
00:53:20,539 --> 00:53:27,559
if I get distracted dude I'll lose you

1239
00:53:23,690 --> 00:53:29,420
know 0.25 of my yield just like that you

1240
00:53:27,559 --> 00:53:30,980
know on an overall picture you know if

1241
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:33,260
you're not focused and looking at it

1242
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:36,860
every moment to maximize it and you know

1243
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:38,480
you and I'm the same way

1244
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,730
when you're processing and making the

1245
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,590
hash in in the in the in the environment

1246
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:46,130
that you're doing how you're doing it

1247
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:48,470
how you're treating it affects your

1248
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:57,710
whole end result you know so we know

1249
00:53:48,469 --> 00:53:59,209
we're tired that's amazing dude that guy

1250
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:01,519
I was doing a live feed and someone's

1251
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:03,230
like hey from UK and I was like bro you

1252
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:05,360
have no idea how much that means to me

1253
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:16,130
like that seriously is like the world

1254
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:18,950
they are true hash connoisseurs and

1255
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:21,829
that's that's where the real hash market

1256
00:54:18,949 --> 00:54:23,629
world is America and everything was

1257
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:27,819
coming right there for Morocco's just

1258
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:30,410
like going to well it's the California

1259
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:32,660
it's a California thing it's ER it's our

1260
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:34,730
atmosphere and we walk around started

1261
00:54:32,659 --> 00:54:36,289
with it you know Colorado's brought I I

1262
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:38,750
got to give credit to Colorado for

1263
00:54:36,289 --> 00:54:41,840
bringing out the rosin but they they

1264
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:44,599
also you know struggled with their

1265
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:47,600
facilities so it was a way hard to grow

1266
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:49,699
pot above 6,000 feet yeah and it's their

1267
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,259
way to process early they didn't have to

1268
00:54:49,699 --> 00:54:52,789
worry about to take down the dry and all

1269
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:55,460
the humidity spikes and all those things

1270
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:58,070
so that it was it was they were almost

1271
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,119
forced into that market like if they

1272
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:00,920
weren't there could have been some

1273
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:02,569
failure you know what I mean I think

1274
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,099
that's why they went to rosin because

1275
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:05,690
you know some of the flour was so

1276
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:07,400
lacking just due to the the

1277
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:08,900
environmental conditions you know they

1278
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:11,389
couldn't finish and then they would just

1279
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:13,820
make these amazing hashes that would

1280
00:55:11,389 --> 00:55:15,409
come out I'm a big fan rob is almost I

1281
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:18,289
mean there's a lot of great hash makers

1282
