30
00:01:52,769 --> 00:02:04,228
I plan together the high in the drying

super compensate with your thumb to be

56
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:32,530
able to get that stuff in India is

57
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:36,400
different in India you literally stick

58
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:39,159
like a xenon your hand like the relation

59
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,739
with the plant doing that in the most

60
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:44,590
remote valley of the in Malaya and shit

61
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:47,230
is like it's different like that was the

62
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:50,019
first time where I had that relation

63
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:52,179
with a blonde I did not understand it it

64
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:55,840
took me a year to come here to

65
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,640
understand genetic but I had that strong

66
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,039
volition for the first time was that

67
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:03,359
living

68
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:05,908
organism you yeah it's savage burns like

69
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:12,810
everyday bounce after months it like it

70
00:04:05,908 --> 00:04:17,279
like it and then what do you do with

71
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:19,168
that you you you you cover them it's all

72
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:27,538
caressing so you're super light you you

73
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:31,918
yeah you waste you the jungle the jungle

74
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:34,649
usually is the season is earlier than

75
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:38,180
anything cultivated so the jungle is

76
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:42,620
like early September to end of September

77
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:46,740
mid September to the first week of

78
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:49,740
October and then up to end of November

79
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,910
you have cultivated sometime even have I

80
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:56,699
had a season where it fuck is snow like

81
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:59,160
this much but today later it had melted

82
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:01,800
and we didn't finish our field so we

83
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,889
went back to see it all the plant were

84
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,168
all back up but they were like semi wild

85
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:09,030
plant we let them even year we didn't

86
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:11,370
touch them we let them go back to work

87
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:15,448
to the wild so they were all standard

88
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:18,180
but they were all burn by the basal snow

89
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:21,710
so you we had a lot of contaminant you

90
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,709
know and that we couldn't save a

91
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:34,788
survival survival the species they put

92
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,788
out something else when now you have

93
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:47,879
sticky but if you have water in your

94
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:49,919
hand it's not gonna stick you don't

95
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:52,439
stick if you have only an you don't

96
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:55,079
stick if you break the plant and there

97
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,939
is water from the plant and clover files

98
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:58,709
that come in your hand it's not gonna

99
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:02,219
stick the same a so it's gonna take a

100
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:04,978
while before I was always like you just

101
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,800
catch the prawns the first time you look

102
00:06:04,978 --> 00:06:10,800
at your hands all shiny and it's cheeky

103
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,770
like fucking crazy and then layer blown

104
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,250
by plant layer by layer every plant you

105
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:20,759
clean up any any little particles that

106
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:23,579
stick to it and slowly slowly player and

107
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:29,370
the color start to appear and it got

108
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:32,879
from transparent and then when you have

109
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:36,360
a sick enough layer it's dark almost

110
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,848
black then you have enough and you

111
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,800
careful you see that when you carriage

112
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:43,110
the plum that is chunk of your ear from

113
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,680
your hand that goes out it's time to

114
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:48,960
stop and then you take your son you turn

115
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,478
it on your hand and you snap it out and

116
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:55,500
all the ash is gonna be on your son and

117
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:57,509
then you won't stick all your hand it

118
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,028
becomes about it's still sticky but it

119
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:04,339
becomes epi wine the most difficult is

120
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:07,680
actually to transfer this to your son

121
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:11,158
and then is to wait all you do a finger

122
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,800
that means that you hold in your that

123
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:14,848
piece of art so you capture whatever is

124
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,960
left in your arm

125
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:20,908
oh yeah I like better because but the

126
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:24,180
local did not have plastic in a time I

127
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:26,490
admit I made likes flat pancake into a

128
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:29,069
sink plastic so that there is very

129
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,110
little air that can get in contact with

130
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:33,750
the resin and create more than sheet

131
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,090
because in any other problem is more is

132
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:40,228
like even when your resin is perfectly

133
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:42,629
clean so the mold spore everywhere and

134
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:46,110
they stick to the resin so you have a

135
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:50,180
bunch of finger super clean but they put

136
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,180
them all together into a big

137
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:57,658
pounder there's a queen you have the

138
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:59,668
merge that is coming only when you bring

139
00:07:57,658 --> 00:08:03,050
it to the mountain down in South India

140
00:07:59,668 --> 00:08:03,049
right because the temperature change

141
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:08,370
there's a place when you're when you're

142
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:11,158
molding a hash where at a certain point

143
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:13,050
now it just it changes right the texture

144
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:16,259
changes and the color changes and now

145
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:19,829
it's not it's like it's life raising but

146
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:23,370
it doesn't have it's not like life

147
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:27,300
raising we got from with ice water not

148
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:30,769
at all as much as the high regime is the

149
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:33,799
same than ice water dry-cured regime

150
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:36,328
life is in in your hand is very

151
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:39,870
different and I've risen from the

152
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:41,879
machine I don't know why because it's it

153
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,089
shouldn't be that if I never seen new

154
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:48,208
creation in my life and there is 70%

155
00:08:45,089 --> 00:09:04,020
humidity easy you know I mean yeah it's

156
00:08:48,208 --> 00:09:07,019
crazy you mean make like 20 grams a day

157
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:09,629
when T cell T or they can make 5 grams

158
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,909
of creme so then to get them to make

159
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:15,708
creme is very hard you need you here

160
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:19,620
next to you yeah okay you walk like me

161
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:22,078
you instead of making 20 gram at so much

162
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,019
money you're gonna make only five seven

163
00:09:22,078 --> 00:09:28,229
ten gram I give you as much money for

164
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:30,389
what oh I had a one time I went there

165
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,670
with with I mean that was pretty amazing

166
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:35,850
in Marana like it change the perspective

167
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:39,509
and the deal was a guy say everything

168
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:42,600
used you you make I put out that I buy

169
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:44,970
of I quality on the table and at the end

170
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,790
of the season we go together to New

171
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,560
Delhi and I sell it to the store near

172
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:52,889
the same way that I would sell it for me

173
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,750
and that's your payment for the for what

174
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:56,870
you you

175
00:09:53,750 --> 00:10:00,320
giving me basically all you have the

176
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:02,720
local people also that come and and use

177
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,350
the field around you they know what you

178
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,240
want

179
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:07,220
and they know that you're ready to pay

180
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,500
for it so they do generally work for you

181
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,629
and every night when you got starts they

182
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:19,639
should use that on during the days I

183
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:21,950
could stay cool because thank you before

184
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:31,149
the farmers used to go there and they

185
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:35,780
had this work word called Cod and and

186
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:37,669
Cod used to mean goat shit now if you go

187
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:40,250
to the mountains and ask them a cod is

188
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:43,459
they pull out this little pink bag of

189
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:46,429
salts so like it's been completely

190
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:48,259
destroyed because so many of the demand

191
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:51,379
for hash is so high especially with

192
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:54,019
India as a economic boom like everybody

193
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:56,179
smokes hash in the cities so now you

194
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:59,120
have these farmers pushed and they're

195
00:10:56,179 --> 00:11:02,679
growing with salts and ruining that

196
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:09,980
whole all of those hills

197
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:12,859
we need worldwide legal to change

198
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:16,159
everything if you if you bring foreign

199
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:19,339
genetic to a place where the genetic is

200
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:23,209
possibly 16 another no six hundred and

201
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:25,780
seventy thousand years old it's like

202
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:28,400
you're you're polluting pool sites

203
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:32,029
technically speaking it's a national

204
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,309
treasure and the Indians they won't

205
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:37,039
actually they ask for the I had some

206
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:39,949
huge argument on farm the guy wanted

207
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:42,009
genetic from here to to bring to India

208
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:47,660
and I was telling him is like you have

209
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:50,059
vast source of amazing and unique

210
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:51,620
genetic in India and you want to bring

211
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:54,919
something foreign

212
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:57,259
that is based the iana predation or

213
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:59,689
actually long rice and you want to bring

214
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:01,379
that there and pollute something that is

215
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:04,259
unique to your present

216
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:06,359
and you don't get it and they don't it's

217
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:07,979
because this is a market in Europe they

218
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:11,549
want to they want to do the same they

219
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:14,399
want to smoke the same well the Union

220
00:12:11,548 --> 00:12:17,278
government is now actually trying to do

221
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,109
a landrace catalog and they're about to

222
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,178
start doing that and one of the things

223
00:12:19,109 --> 00:12:23,459
is for that whole thing with the genetic

224
00:12:21,178 --> 00:12:25,379
markers right but they want to make sure

225
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:27,538
that they get land races that are still

226
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:31,829
existing not just in him all but in

227
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:34,078
Orissa and also not time on Andrew but

228
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:36,828
Andhra Pradesh there's also traditional

229
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:39,538
cannabis growing areas right and so

230
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:42,508
right and so but they're still hung up

231
00:12:39,538 --> 00:12:45,239
on the 0.3% the still they're only gonna

232
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:47,129
stake stuff that's 0.3% and then they

233
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:53,849
they sort of don't get it right about

234
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:56,369
full plant right is level of THC is like

235
00:12:53,849 --> 00:12:59,819
from the old ash I was smoking when I

236
00:12:56,369 --> 00:13:03,329
was young there is a scientist in Israel

237
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:08,698
that did a study on ten years of burst

238
00:13:03,328 --> 00:13:12,478
in his a Moroccan Lebanese an Indian and

239
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:15,448
it was from the 1992 the 2000 so it's

240
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:17,879
not too far for my time to be a huge

241
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:22,708
difference between what I was smoking in

242
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:25,739
France and and Zeus burst Lebanese is

243
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:29,418
basically a one on one CBD THC and it

244
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:34,379
has a pretty low level of THC they were

245
00:13:29,418 --> 00:13:38,188
seeing only looking only at thecb CBD

246
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:39,839
and CBN it's like four percent THC so

247
00:13:38,188 --> 00:13:42,838
they're telling me that the fucking red

248
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:46,769
Lebanese that I remember forty five

249
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:49,229
years later was only four percent THC is

250
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:58,078
like it's cracking me up

251
00:13:49,229 --> 00:14:01,679
Malkin two to one is American - are you

252
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:03,748
a percentage of THC and CBD and in India

253
00:14:01,678 --> 00:14:07,259
is basically five to one there's a lot

254
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:10,158
more THC but like from the mountains or

255
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:14,169
the chalice is like fourteen percent THC

256
00:14:10,158 --> 00:14:18,409
for TM so it's like I

257
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:20,719
but even even even if it's not the

258
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:22,778
greatest of the greatest it show very

259
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:27,110
much almost the entourage effect

260
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:30,078
actually give power to to the ash we

261
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:32,959
smoke because there is no way I was

262
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:35,958
smoking a one-on-one focus on THC and

263
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:38,838
still be raving about it so many years

264
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,578
later I dream to smoke already bunnies

265
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:42,920
you know what I mean it's like there is

266
00:14:40,578 --> 00:14:45,558
no way that if he did not have that

267
00:14:42,919 --> 00:15:00,649
specific depend profile that he's so

268
00:14:45,558 --> 00:15:02,448
unique you cannot even describe it we we

269
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:05,749
only made like three four grams and it

270
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:07,219
was super nice it's a super nice high

271
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:10,839
and I don't think there is much we

272
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,839
tested it it was a what

273
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:32,149
I made a 52% CBD but I never tried them

274
00:15:29,448 --> 00:15:36,338
until Milan months ago when I was a

275
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:41,839
judge I'd sell for the ash made from I

276
00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:44,929
CBD almost 0.3 percent THC so the first

277
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:53,929
time I smoked false belief you know in

278
00:15:44,928 --> 00:15:56,419
the morning clean this is science I

279
00:15:53,928 --> 00:15:59,539
appreciate your dedication here come on

280
00:15:56,419 --> 00:16:04,610
now wait wait with tobacco and CBD what

281
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:06,948
yeah ask your hash okay so I I wake up

282
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:10,068
in the morning I have a bunch of aches

283
00:16:06,948 --> 00:16:13,729
and pain and shit I had never feels such

284
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:18,799
a really a well beingness bujji release

285
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:20,899
but like it's like a it's like a curtain

286
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:24,469
that that comes early sorry down your

287
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:27,830
your body and it's well beingness and

288
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:30,350
you have a birth but it's a birth of

289
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,690
feeling so good in your body magically

290
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:38,089
it's not the birds per se but is like on

291
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:39,920
the budgets gotta let me see well is it

292
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:41,810
is your cannabinoid system your

293
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:45,319
endocannabinoid system that the CBD

294
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:49,899
somehow comes in and like dances with

295
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,899
and it's just this is really
