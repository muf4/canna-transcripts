2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:13,440
other terpene profiles with weird oh

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,480
geez and Kem's and all that stuff I love

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,269
that kind of stuff but there's no real

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,490
reference in my life so therefore I kind

6
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:25,829
of just take it for what it is

7
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:27,989
versus like lemon or citrus I guess pie

8
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:31,528
and even to some extent if it's sharp

9
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:33,869
enough just in those smells it's almost

10
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:35,820
like you close your eyes and all of a

11
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:37,859
sudden you're not smelling pie that's a

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,170
crazy phenomenon that I see just with

13
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:42,210
these certain varieties where I already

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,700
recognize that smell so heavily from a

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,250
different place that it's it's

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,829
especially I don't know so strange when

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,539
I smell it in pop and it doesn't just

18
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,989
smell like some other type of cannabis

19
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:58,260
like way below are you saying about the

20
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,058
citrus what you started saying before

21
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,179
you

22
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:03,738
oh well the citrus I think more so than

23
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:06,280
the pine is that we have such a close

24
00:01:03,738 --> 00:01:08,569
relationship with it since we're young

25
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,780
how many oranges we've eaten during our

26
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,779
life

27
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:26,049
oh absolutely I mean I I guess we're

28
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:28,349
going to talk about the the citizen you

29
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:31,870
go into all the things of like that

30
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:33,309
limiting or the citrus smells in general

31
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:36,130
making us more happy we have this

32
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,290
attraction to them but specifically what

33
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:40,780
I'm talking about is this phenomenon

34
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,850
like there's a lot of we'd especially

35
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,890
like a lot of them are dank smells that

36
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:46,899
I'm really interested in but they all

37
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,909
are like pot if you little thing about

38
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,550
pot when they smell it and it's a cool

39
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:53,349
dank smell but it's it's weed I'm

40
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:54,879
talking about these specific types of

41
00:01:53,349 --> 00:01:56,979
weed and I see it a lot with orange

42
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,170
where if you just close your eyes and

43
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:03,780
you smell it you don't really smell weed

44
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:07,540
you smell some crazy citrus experience

45
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:10,419
no but there's enough variation within

46
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:12,129
there the like if maybe it takes 10

47
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:15,219
different citrus ones but then there's

48
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:17,710
those ones that aren't like citrus weed

49
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:19,330
they're like citrus citrus and that's

50
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:23,700
just a crazy experience when you close

51
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:23,700
your eyes yeah

52
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:31,580
and I don't wrote that plan what I

53
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,580
smelled you

54
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,959
[Music]

55
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:43,348
yeah when then furthermore when it ties

56
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,150
in with this other thing that I don't we

57
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:47,340
talk about it but it's like there's

58
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,989
these certain varieties and I saw it

59
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,769
with this our tangi I've got it like

60
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:52,800
that

61
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:55,800
the HP 13 this is older straighten that

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,989
weaves mess with a couple like Diesel's

63
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,840
over the years we'll do this where it's

64
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:04,230
this lingering mouth coating throat

65
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,629
coating flavor that lasts and it's

66
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:09,030
especially crazy and not all strains do

67
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:11,818
that a lot of ones taste like weed when

68
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,169
yeah what it could smell I have the

69
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:14,488
greatest pot whether it's somebody

70
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:15,568
else's are mine and it smells really

71
00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:17,939
good and when you smoke it tastes like

72
00:03:15,568 --> 00:03:20,669
weed and then there's other weed when

73
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:22,769
you smell it and then you smoke it and

74
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:25,078
it tastes and smells and whatever the

75
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,299
experience of smoking it's of that of

76
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,829
whatever you smelled before it was being

77
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:37,590
burned now you're tasting and smelling

78
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:39,209
all in the experience of yeah oh my god

79
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,519
you're putting me on the spot my brains

80
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:45,180
fried yeah I know depending are there's

81
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,700
just so many ways that could go bro I

82
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:51,870
got this I've been growing this dogshit

83
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:55,409
strain what I'm looking for is this

84
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:58,459
certain Fino of my you know of my

85
00:03:55,409 --> 00:04:00,209
cultivar where when I walk by it itch

86
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:03,229
you smelled

87
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:06,209
it's like nose curling like like

88
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:09,268
disgusting like you could taste dog shit

89
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,489
in the air like it's just like this is

90
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:13,920
the sky and to the point that it even

91
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,379
tricks me and I'll look at my shirt and

92
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:19,978
it's my plant and I'm breeding it you

93
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:21,810
know I'm breeding for that and I said it

94
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:24,478
smells like dog shit like a hundred

95
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:27,418
percent and the nastiest plant the

96
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,889
nastiest dog shit nose curling you could

97
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:31,079
taste that shit in the air it's like

98
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:33,660
you're like oh that's the plant that's

99
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:37,228
what I'm looking for that's the ultimate

100
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,360
that I got I'm like that's the one the

101
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:41,759
one that's just straight up so that's

102
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,580
what I've started breeding with you know

103
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:48,870
and then

104
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:52,109
we started breeding a high CBG a variety

105
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:54,079
of that starting from dog shape which I

106
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,000
really don't know at this point if it's

107
00:04:54,079 --> 00:05:00,990
how I'm getting like four three to four

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,410
percent see BGA whether it's some

109
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:07,470
interaction between the bacteria and the

110
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:10,800
fungus and the plants or it's my my

111
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,140
special it's the the light manipulation

112
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,730
or the full spectrum lighting that

113
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:19,379
whatever I'm doing with the lighting or

114
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:21,300
or or it's the genetics you know or a

115
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:22,860
combination of all of it so I'm trying

116
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,470
to figure that out which is kind of like

117
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,770
searching for like three needles in a at

118
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,870
once in a haystack so what while I'm

119
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:34,168
going what while it's my production

120
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,970
facility so I'm doing like research not

121
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:39,240
only am i pushing the edge on my

122
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:42,060
production facility you know you know on

123
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,530
a bunch of other levels with soil and

124
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:48,329
and new you know Zhu Dom living whatever

125
00:05:45,529 --> 00:05:49,769
full spectrum lighting but then you know

126
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:51,719
I'm like looking for these needles in

127
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:53,310
the haystacks while I'm doing production

128
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,080
so I'm doing research while I'm doing

129
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,910
production which is kind of you know I

130
00:05:55,079 --> 00:06:00,209
don't really recommend it it's really

131
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:02,490
like writing and a dangerous edge you

132
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:04,289
know cuz yeah because there's a lot of

133
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,660
variables so I kind of backed off of the

134
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,540
research last year and put the seeds

135
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,090
aside you know those seeds aside you

136
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,669
know just so I could focus on them and

137
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:17,668
just survive you know through compliance

138
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:20,759
so that way I could have the opportunity

139
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:22,439
to pick that project back up you know

140
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:24,269
what I mean because I was like alright

141
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:26,399
this is just too much going on I can't

142
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:29,339
I'm gonna I'm gonna blow this project

143
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,599
and even and whatever I did yeah I just

144
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:35,209
didn't you know because I would have to

145
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:37,740
do tons of testing to test for the C BGA

146
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:41,609
when you know we were getting like three

147
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,918
four percent at a week like nine eight

148
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,930
nine in like three months it was still

149
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:47,819
there like too much all my weed I went

150
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,290
through all my test results because I

151
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:50,399
wasn't looking for it at the time so

152
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,280
then I went back through all my test

153
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,589
results and I saw it all in all of my

154
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,128
test results of that cultivar that I've

155
00:06:55,589 --> 00:06:58,438
been running

156
00:06:56,129 --> 00:07:00,179
so then I was like oh because well

157
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:01,739
that's what I was that's what I've been

158
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:03,988
breeding for I just didn't know I was

159
00:07:01,738 --> 00:07:05,788
breeding for that until I figured out

160
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:07,438
because one day I was in my bar and I

161
00:07:05,788 --> 00:07:09,778
was in my office and I was like it was

162
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,239
just nagging at me like go look at the

163
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:13,829
test and like and I was like okay my

164
00:07:12,238 --> 00:07:15,268
wife really needed me to do some pay for

165
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:16,738

telling me to look I was like holy shit

172
00:07:26,728 --> 00:07:32,399
wow that's like 4% CBG eh

173
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,468
huh and then I called the lab and was

174
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,269
talking to them about it I was like okay

175
00:07:34,468 --> 00:07:38,218
that's the she was like that's insanely

176
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:42,689
high like you need normally it's like

177
00:07:38,218 --> 00:07:47,759
under 1% it was like it was like 3.8

178
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:50,819
percent you know so it was like 17

179
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,559
percent it was like 17 percent THC you

180
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:56,968
know three points something for a three

181
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:58,919
point eight percent see BGA yeah I was

182
00:07:56,968 --> 00:08:00,928
like woah okay so then I went back

183
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:06,088
looking through all my tests I saw that

184
00:08:00,928 --> 00:08:08,068
it was reoccurring then I tried to do

185
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:09,658
some more experiments didn't have enough

186
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:12,539
money to do all the testing that I would

187
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:14,610
need to do on on you know how many seeds

188
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:17,848
I popped and I have to test each plant

189
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:21,269
at week five six seven eight nine and

190
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:23,699
then have clones and cuttings of each

191
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:25,679
one of those plants and let's in the

192
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:28,439
metro and them I mean and I was like

193
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:32,038
well yeah I just don't have you know in

194
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:35,069
Sonoma County is not really making it

195
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:36,948

so yeah that's how I totally yeah she's

230
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:15,958
very thorough so yeah and generally

231
00:10:12,808 --> 00:10:19,048
people are wrong so you have to do it

232
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:23,128
yourself and and represent yourself and

233
00:10:19,048 --> 00:10:24,899
trust your instincts and and just do

234
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:26,369
what you you know and if you don't like

235
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:28,558
the answer somebody gives you it's

236
00:10:26,369 --> 00:10:32,999
everything's like the DMV you know you

237
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:35,639
go to the next person just the world the

238
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:37,139
world is like the DMV if you don't like

239
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,089
the everybody's wrong half of

240
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:40,678
everybody's wrong nobody knows what

241
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:44,339
they're doing no matter what your

242
00:10:40,678 --> 00:10:46,918
lawyers and doctors everybody's flailing

243
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:49,529
or winging it on some level so just like

244
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:51,418
you know you go to the next person the

245
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:53,578
prerequisite before you because wait

246
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:56,220
wait for a month

247
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:59,638
yeah because because push yep because

248
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,949
perception is everything nothing is what

249
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:04,230
it seems and our strengths are our

250
00:11:01,948 --> 00:11:08,448
weaknesses and our weaknesses are our

251
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,449
strengths you know so

252
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:18,399
yeah yeah exactly that's the hardest

253
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:21,039
thing to do is nothing that's why I call

254
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,990
it the the no-till nothing style because

255
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,789
you know the hardest thing to do is

256
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,129
nothing a lot of times it's just human

257
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:30,189
nature to want to impose our will and

258
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:34,090
fuck shit up that's just like our you

259
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:37,180
know so we feel useful we create a fire

260
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:39,190
so we can put it out but like then it's

261
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:40,449
just like that downward spiral you know

262
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:45,010
it's like flushing yourself down a

263
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:50,259
toilet you know just you know like don't

264
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:53,830
go there don't go there just like chill

265
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:56,439
you know and just like let it just

266
00:11:53,830 --> 00:12:03,310
naturally you know organically like

267
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:05,080
happen you know and that's that's yeah

268
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:08,589
this is epic

269
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:11,950
that would I know yeah yeah it's the

270
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:19,300
five-year-old this is epic like some yes

271
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:22,480
some Africa but it changes it changes I

272
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:27,219
was up at the Humboldt conference and I

273
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:30,909
shared a jar oh yeah and it is top notch

274
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:33,940
if you have any interests yeah yeah we

275
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:37,480
were there last year right Todd talked

276
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:40,030
about expanding and that was like really

277
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,399
condensed yeah that was all when you

278
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:44,289
only have so much time yeah and you need

279
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,449
to get the job done yeah like the cup is

280
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:48,789
so much there's so many different you

281
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:51,970

what we grow in the garden you know that

302
00:14:03,629 --> 00:14:16,058
those experiences you said but you said

303
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:21,578
that was the sunshine so this was gift

304
00:14:16,058 --> 00:14:23,499
the seats were gifted to me from a young

305
00:14:21,578 --> 00:14:25,088
man who's doing beautiful names named do

306
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:27,819

307
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:29,679
conference so this is like coming full

308
00:14:27,818 --> 00:14:31,688
circle closure in the loops yeah

309
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:33,100
and this is on purpose I met up with

310
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:34,149
people at the Humboldt conference that

311
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,879
were like we're gonna share some

312
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:40,688
genetics and see how it changes because

313
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:44,769
we're what are the my understanding it's

314
00:14:40,688 --> 00:14:46,328
her loopy fruity yeah give me a second I

315

can look at my phone I like really no

316
00:14:46,328 --> 00:14:52,508
hold on SEC yay for phones I hate them

317
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:54,399
and they're so useful so so he was

318
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:55,959
interested in people growing it out in

319
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,850
different microclimates to see how it

320
00:14:55,958 --> 00:15:00,789
expresses itself differently do John

321
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:04,028
gets the reality that there's stuff

322
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:07,448
going on in the soil and then you also

323
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:10,058
understand that actually if you have the

324
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:12,849
life around just the rhizosphere just

325
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:15,938
around the roots you don't have to have

326
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:19,089
it in everything but it will grow right

327
00:15:15,938 --> 00:15:22,298
and so you can have a pot if that's all

328
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:23,699
you got and you can put that life back

329
00:15:22,298 --> 00:15:25,798
in that pot

330
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:29,868
and it will do special things like it's

331
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:32,458
crazy and so my kids have that

332
00:15:29,869 --> 00:15:34,798
understanding and so we play with the

333
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:36,659
pots we experiment it they don't they

334
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:39,448
don't they know it's a garden but they

335
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:42,480
call it the laboratory thank you it's so

336
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:45,688
great like my seven really inspiring it

337
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:51,058
makes me want to like dude it's how we

338
00:15:45,688 --> 00:15:53,308
grow I'm training my side oh yeah you

339
00:15:51,058 --> 00:15:55,379
know that too but also you know have

340
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:59,009
them plant their own seed you know I've

341
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:02,428
been honestly afraid to enter the world

342
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:04,489
but on a personal level on your personal

343
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,730
you can do that right I mean that's like

344
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:07,949
legal

345
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:09,539
I'll give you can I mean opposed to like

346
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:12,149
my license borrow it

347
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:14,278
my kids are not allowed in my

348
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:20,958
greenhouses or whatever stuff like that

349
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:23,909
but you used to like five years ago no

350
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:28,948
not on write on record no I'm definitely

351
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:30,418
not admitting that I had my no you and

352
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:36,328
not really ever supposed to have your

353
00:16:30,418 --> 00:16:38,188
kids see because legally what do we give

354
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:41,548
people I mean I'm not saying it's a

355
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:44,219
problem but I wouldn't necessarily want

356
00:16:41,548 --> 00:16:45,989
to you know going records thing that I

357
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,499
had my kids running around in my

00:16:45,989 --> 00:16:53,369
greenhouse I would never do that

359

plants are teaching them about that yeah

375

to the TV and I'm showing them their

385
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,140
plants and the soil and the light and oh

386
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:12,169
yeah I need one of those microscopes and

387
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,870
it's this big and so this microscopic

388
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:16,670
creature dude it's better than it's so

389
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:19,369
crazy there's this thing called a micro

390
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:21,920
arthropods like it's on the screen right

391

396
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:41,990
in a garden it's alive and you can see

397
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:44,539
it and that actually tells you how your

398
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:47,839
plants are growing it's it's so epic

399
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:49,279
it's so amazing okay up if you if you

400
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:52,369
haven't looked through a microscope at

401
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:57,230
your soil it'll blow your mind son bolt

402
00:18:52,369 --> 00:19:00,379
groan is that is that Johnson son bolt

403
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:02,930
goes perfect yeah this is Sunshine's

404
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:08,300
but growing on the Central Coast in

405
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:12,110
living soil pushing that this this minty

406
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:13,250
and nice fennel terpene alright that's

407
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,779
what you were talking about yeah I'm

408
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,000
talking about

409
00:19:13,779 --> 00:19:19,700
okay well the fennel has this terpene

410
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,720
the smells flavor right and and it's

411
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:26,480
that smell when you zoom in it's that

412
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,769
smell when you're at lika an Indian

413
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,329
restaurant and there's that little bowl

414
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:30,769
of mints and you're like I'm not quite

415
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:32,750
sure what those are but I'm still a

416
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:34,400
little hungry you know and you haven't

417
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,670
and it hit you with that licorice but

418
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,009
it's also minty you know what I mean

419
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:42,160
and it's a plant that literally just

420
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:45,549
grows on the roadside and it pumps out

421
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,470
seeds and it's happy to grow anywhere no

422
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:52,210
Mullens different but it's an amazing

423
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:54,420
plant - fennel smoke yeah yeah it's

424
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,420
healing

425
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:06,719
so it's just putting the puzzle pieces

426
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:09,359
together

427
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:11,700
if the microbes in your soil don't have

428
00:20:09,358 --> 00:20:14,848
those puzzle pieces to work with it

429
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:17,580
can't change the picture it's literally

430
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:19,678
just adding biodiversity adversity

431
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:21,689
that's what it I am adding to your bio

432
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,719
of building your biome adding to

433
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:27,989
diversity yeah and you can do that on

434
00:20:24,719 --> 00:20:31,558
site you can encourage that growth for

435
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:33,358
pennies yeah without animals just

436
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,969
through plants yeah just through a plant

437
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:38,189
you just can't you to learn to work with

438
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:40,288
it in a little different way and it

439
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:42,298
starts so really grew then you don't

440
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:44,999
need to like necessarily you know halt

441
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:48,358
manures rights and then you have to call

442
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:51,719
them you basically work chop and drop

443
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:53,368
cover cropping yeah compel once I done

444
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:55,950
with my tomatoes this year I'm like you

445
00:20:53,368 --> 00:20:59,519
guys got hit with a frost it's all a

446
00:20:55,950 --> 00:21:02,609
this snip cross cross cross breakup done

447
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,329
and then I put compost and molt over the

448
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:08,398
top of that and I let it just mellow

449
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:10,378
overwinter they do so much work over the

450
00:21:08,398 --> 00:21:12,538
winter like that's when your soils

451
00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:16,168
really doing the work I know and then

452
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:18,179
they put in that in the spring yeah and

453
00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:21,359
so if you're not loving on your soil

454
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:22,919
that's your when you realize that and

455
00:21:21,358 --> 00:21:25,138
when you really realize and get that

456
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:28,499
that's that's oh yeah Horton step in

457
00:21:25,138 --> 00:21:30,449
here I go on vacation with my kids like

458
00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:32,940
their stretches a time where I I'm like

459
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:35,190
alright close the gate and you're like

460
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,379
we'll see you when you get when I get

461
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,999
back but I've got the rest of the team

462
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:40,769
already working in there so there's

463
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:43,348
confidence and so if there's a weird

464
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:45,509
temperature spike or a weird chill in

465
00:21:43,348 --> 00:21:49,468
the air the microbes literally keep the

466
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:52,710
soil warmer like your compost pile heats

467
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:56,179
up to a hundred it'll catch fire wait

468
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:59,778
what caught fire the party of life

469
00:21:56,179 --> 00:22:02,190
literally caught the shit on fire and

470
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:05,589
you can't even see

471
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:07,870
it's that powerful and you just kind of

472
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:10,809
work with it's pretty insane yeah it's

473
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:13,689
amazing it's pretty insane it you're

474
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:15,700
just getting the team running and all in

475
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,080
the same page but what were you saying

476
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,940
specifically about the fennel like

477
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:21,099
because you were talking about like

478
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:23,860
cutting it down and then that kind of

479
00:22:21,099 --> 00:22:30,069
mulch it like okay so you're taking that

480
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:31,569
input you're processing a turning point

481
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:33,939
is with a lot of fennel growing on your

482
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:37,000
proper know how you know I don't why I

483
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:40,420
have a small grow I have a big beautiful

484
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,980
community right it's like even like you

485
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,660
and I were talking about it's like Mike

486
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,360
Arden it's too small to feed my

487
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:48,370
community so I work with other farmers

488
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:51,189
to help them understand how they can

489
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:53,859
grow strawberries and hundreds of acres

490
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:56,470
in the Santa Maria Valley in a healthier

491
00:22:53,859 --> 00:22:58,719
way and now I'm helping to feed my

492
00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,789
community see what I mean it's it it

493
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,940
shifts it just a little bit but it

494
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:06,609
changes the program like literally he's

495
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:09,519
got a program and now he's got life as

496
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:12,189
part of that program it's it's it's

497
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:13,990
beautiful and it just took some time and

498
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:21,130
to work with people help them understand

499
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:25,079
and cannabis is like the conductor at

500
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:28,030
the orchestra and it changes the music

501
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:31,720
depending on how many pieces are in

502
00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:34,839
front of you to work with right and it's

503
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:37,450
it's there when I take my seed the seed

504
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:40,509
I take a handful of where that see is

505
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:43,420
going to grow and I take it and I put

506
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:46,240
intent into it and then I take it and I

507
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:49,480
put it in water and get the water

508
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:53,019
soluble these microbes are 70% water

509
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,329
wake everybody up and I soak my seeds in

510
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:56,750
it

511
00:23:53,329 --> 00:23:59,569
my Caesar literally sucking in we're

512
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:01,400
really basically can take your seeds and

513
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:04,759
go out in the forest and get some

514
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,730
leafmold soil no see but my rope is all

515
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:09,740
those things put in stacked right yeah

516
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:12,589
so I take that and so there's no

517
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:14,450
transition there's no shock like

518
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:16,399
everybody sends out their little poor

519
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,960
pictures of root porn you know I missed

520
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,009
a camera or whatever and I'm like oh

521
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:24,860
poor little babies because you're

522
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:29,769
exposing to something that that's not

523
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:33,919
how it's grown right it changes it

524
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:37,849
versus oh I know what to do here and

525
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:40,610
those genetics run and they've got all

526
00:24:37,849 --> 00:24:42,769
the team with them but that's where that

527
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:45,049
Orchestra all those players in front of

528
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:47,809
them if you're missing that's the timing

529
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:52,059
of it all it is but you got a spin

530
00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:55,549
something to know the timing of it yeah

531
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:57,289
that's like kung fu right there it's

532
00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:59,269
mushed yeah that's some kung fu right

533
00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:04,009
there cuz the timing is everything

534
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:05,930
microbes the kungfu but they are like

535
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:08,900
you right you because i can be like hey

536
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:10,820
this person overwatered which meant they

537
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,980
sent that environment into an anaerobic

538
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:15,259
state

539
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:17,690
yes fermentation is powerful and your

540
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:21,829
plants we use it but you don't want your

541
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:23,900
roots like that because those those

542
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:26,929
microbes that go anaerobic they

543
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:29,660
literally they fucking fart alcohol and

544
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:30,140
burn your stuff off that's what they're

545
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,470
doing

546
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:35,330
so it's excrement is alright like we

547
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:37,819
breathe in oxygen exhale carbon dioxide

548
00:25:35,329 --> 00:25:41,569
they're like okay i'm gonna take in all

549
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:44,960
this good and pomp out poison because

550
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:47,368
that's how they grow from over-watering

551
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:58,700
do let me show you a picture I have a

552
00:25:47,368 --> 00:26:01,648
thanks thanks it's a simple thing right

553
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:03,749
but most people don't think it's a big

554
00:26:01,648 --> 00:26:08,158
deal because they don't understand why

555
00:26:03,749 --> 00:26:11,069
it hurts your plans it's ripping them

556
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,509
out of where they're literally the it's

557
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:15,569
called the rhizosphere that's just

558
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:20,358
coding with life it's coated with life

559
00:26:15,569 --> 00:26:23,700
from too much water and you drown it

560
00:26:20,358 --> 00:26:26,548
you've seen that plant right it looks

561
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:29,369
like it got drowned and that's what

562
00:26:26,548 --> 00:26:32,028
happens because they breathe the soil

563
00:26:29,368 --> 00:26:32,028
freeze

564
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:43,510
[Music]

565
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,870
but the thing of it is oil like it so

566
00:26:43,509 --> 00:26:49,809
the grow water yeah oil is the habitat

567
00:26:46,869 --> 00:26:53,889
so it's like you saying my plant grows

568
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:57,549
in the Amazon the diversity the life the

569
00:26:53,890 --> 00:27:01,210
layers the depth of water that this the

570
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:03,490
birdsong the the storm or the the dust

571
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:05,799
from the plains of Africa being lifted

572
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:08,620
up across the Atlantic and coming down

573
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:11,440
as minerals across that's how they get

574
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:15,219
fertilizer like what it's like that's

575
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:20,230
what the plant wants to do that's how it

576
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:23,529
grows oh that changes things and you can

577
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:26,650
start small because the microbes are

578
00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:30,369
even smaller so you can literally start

579
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:32,500
small yeah system to do that in that's

580
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:34,569
why I was saying yeah I've got yeah

581
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,099
there's products out there too that are

582
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:39,569
starting to really turn the corner to

583
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:43,480
understand that no no it's not about NPK

584
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:45,159
there's if you want to help your plants

585
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,890
the first thing to change there go stop

586
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,019
using nitrogen just think of that how

587
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:51,790
would that change how you grow if you

588
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:54,039
didn't use any night do you mean like

589
00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:55,960
out of a bottle yeah that's so easy to

590
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:58,420
write nitrogen it's ridiculous

591
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,730
only out of like it's a dead grass I go

592
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:03,730
and like it's not used like weed rack

593
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:08,440
and use like a month old dead grass to

594
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:12,279
turn into like a jLF and like that yeah

595
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:15,180
you know which is but we were kept from

596
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:17,680
that technology because like you know

597
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:22,000
the nutrient companies don't want you to

598
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:24,279
know how easy it is to make nutrients

599
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,519
out of how to make liquid nutrients out

600
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:26,519
of

601
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:32,900
you're making it plant-available yeah so

602
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:37,820
you're taking what you got and turning

603
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:40,400
it into what you need yeah you can do it

604
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:42,519
oh yeah no I thought we did yeah we did

605
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,200
that this we've been doing that for I

606
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:47,660
haven't been doing it anaerobically but

607
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,360
I've been doing it you know no-till

608
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:52,900
style so talk about some stuff but maybe

609
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:55,669
do anaerobically versus real quickly

610
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:59,000
well real fast

611
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:01,400
anaerobic is just a category right it's

612
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,119
what do you prefer that that's really

613
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,730
all it is

614
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:07,069
but that preference changes what you

615
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:08,569
promote and that's why I like

616
00:29:07,069 --> 00:29:11,869
lactobacilli is so important because

617
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:14,389
work in that middle ground and actually

618
00:29:11,869 --> 00:29:16,789
it produces an enzyme that kills the bad

619
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:18,350
guys so literally it's like if you're

620
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:20,539
having a problem where it's leaning

621
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:22,730
towards and you can see it like you can

622
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:25,009
literally look at a soil sample and I

623
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:27,799
can tell your plants drowning before the

624
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:31,190
plant is drowning because those

625
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:33,200
creatures that like that anaerobic

626
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,799
environment they start to multiply and

627
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,140
you can see

628
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,180
you can see them and at that point

629
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,940
they're gone okay we're over but that's

630
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:44,990
an anaerobic environment that is created

631
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,130
because there's not proper drainage you

632
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:50,450
know what I mean that's different than

633
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:55,040
creating an anaerobic environment to

634
00:29:50,450 --> 00:30:00,650
cultivate specific bacteria you know

635
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:03,269
from from the plant to feed to the plant

636
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:08,040
which is kind of the completely

637
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:10,319
completeness of you know using like a G

638
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:14,250
DOM liquid fertilizer which is you know

639
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:17,519
made from in my instance I used cannabis

640
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:20,369
leaves because that's the methodology is

641
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,470
that a plant know not what you got but

642
00:30:20,369 --> 00:30:25,159
what the plant needs it's not about me

643
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:29,640
it's about you know the plant only needs

644
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:32,750
you know what's already there so it's

645
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,750
connecting its own

646
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:46,640
yeah what do you got bro okay so it's

647
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:49,250
both it's basically both it's just

648
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,170
there's just like it's just like kung fu

649
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:53,660
it's just like different styles of

650
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:54,980
kungfu it's not that one is better than

651
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:58,519
the other or they don't all work

652
00:30:54,980 --> 00:31:01,130
together or when they do we fight you

653
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:04,069
use you learn you know so it's not like

654
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:06,200
a competition it's a friendly right you

655
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:10,369
know we get in a flow where there's were

656
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:12,080
like hard but it's easy yeah you know

657
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:19,509
but it but it isn't evolution your

658
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:22,129
process so I start out with collecting

659
00:31:19,509 --> 00:31:24,079
the members of the team that live in the

660
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:26,420
area and so that's going to different

661
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:31,699
habitats it's going to the healthiest

662
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:34,070
undisturbed leftovers I'm pretty no like

663
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:37,160
that's where you find what grows there

664
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:38,990
on that smallest yeah but that you're

665
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,490
not you know if you're if you're not

666
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:42,769
sealing them then they're not

667
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:44,839
cultivating anaerobically you know cuz

668
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:46,789
there's air and so you collect them and

669
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:49,369
then you can take and you're and you'll

670
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:53,539
know it because it'll stink like crazy

671
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:55,369
yes like there's something primal where

672
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:56,349
you're like that is not healthy don't go

673
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:57,879
there

674
00:31:56,349 --> 00:32:01,029
done that right you flip a tarp or

675
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:04,059
whatever little oh there's that dog shit

676
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:05,829
right well I don't I don't know I mean I

677
00:32:04,058 --> 00:32:08,500
think that I think that comes back to

678
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:11,139
perception is everything because in some

679
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,650
cultures you know state they like stinky

680
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,049
stuff

681
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:18,190
will do maybe Americans don't you know

682
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:20,529
but Koreans you know KN app curry they

683
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:23,048
are not afraid of like when I mentioned

684
00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:27,730
I mentioned certain K you know Jew Dom

685
00:32:23,048 --> 00:32:30,220
style you know you know applications and

686
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,610
people get like weirded out like be

687
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:49,690
crazy

688
00:32:30,609 --> 00:32:51,788
you are like dirty dogs but it is so

689
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:54,100
beautiful I do like when I put it in

690
00:32:51,788 --> 00:32:56,740
your mouth and it's like custard sweet

691
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:59,139
and it is the biggest shift of

692
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:01,390
perspective because you go everything I

693
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:04,630
say is saying that this is not healthy

694
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:07,570
and yet there's something to it too

695
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:10,600
right and you you experience it anew

696
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:20,379
it's it's really kind of a weird but

697
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:25,209
it's good Owen son cycling or on using

698
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:30,640
or using cannabis health healthy or sick

699
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:34,900
to to make products for further cannabis

700
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:39,419
growing right yeah definitely using it

701
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:44,140
in the compost pile and chipping

702
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:45,280
chipping stocks we love gently Chappell

703
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,540
like

704
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,289
we'll cut a field will cut all the

705
00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:51,549
product on the field or the greenhouses

706
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:55,930
everything left please run through the

707
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:58,869
chipper and that's our you know that's

708
00:33:55,930 --> 00:34:00,730
like and the one like that I really

709
00:33:58,869 --> 00:34:04,659
piece you gotta like condense the

710
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:06,099
material down you know somehow yeah like

711
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,750
for things that take a while to break

712
00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:10,210
down here's the thing is like this we're

713
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:10,690
doing a lot of chitchat for work sudden

714
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,210
oak death

715
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:15,128
that one's easy but like what I'm saying

716
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:17,740
is that the recorded that because that's

717
00:34:15,128 --> 00:34:21,509
interesting sudden oak death is I live

718
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:25,898
with that I live in at an oak forest so

719
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:29,620
so if it is there a negative effect on

720
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:33,039
the cannabis plant by using oak that was

721
00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:37,199
down that died due to sudden oak I

722
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:37,199
understand how it could that's dangerous

723
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:51,549
okay so taking all and some of the

724
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:54,908
didn't die on oak but I'm just going

725
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:57,310
through or I'm using like a pile of

726
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:59,230
chips that you know which run through a

727
00:34:57,309 --> 00:35:01,119
chipper from The Electric Company

728
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:04,449
you know they left like 20 yards of

729
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:07,409
chips from my property so yeah like that

730
00:35:04,449 --> 00:35:11,949
these are oak dominant piles there's

731
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:13,899
four oak redwood but you don't know like

732
00:35:11,949 --> 00:35:16,589
the percentages or anything in the pile

733
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,210
I do it's predominantly 10 oh I'd say

734
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:22,530
8475

735
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:28,710
for Santana easily and maybe more 80%

736
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:30,869
1000 words and maybe a couple of drones

737
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:34,769
literally very few madronas down there

738
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:38,338
so what what like I've found is that if

739
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:38,849
I can use stuff that's been down 5 10 15

740
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:41,279
years

741
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:43,800
run it through the chipper I need way

742
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,430
less nitrogen in order to get a pile

743
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:50,099
cooking and let the rain hit it and it

744
00:35:47,429 --> 00:35:52,078
breaks down really nice a lot more fun

745
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:53,369
Glade on yeah that's like Duff at that

746
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,480
point you know it's stuffy

747
00:35:53,369 --> 00:36:02,190
yeah yes oh yeah yeah yeah yeah totally

748
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:05,068
yeah let the woodchips get all you know

749
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:07,710
just inoculated they're just like thick

750
00:36:05,068 --> 00:36:10,170
I'll dig into it I'll harvest the spots

751
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:13,079
that are just like cooked with like a

752
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:19,220
white you know fungal hypee where

753
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:21,690
they're like they're just like like just

754
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:23,879
decomposing at this one layer you know

755
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:26,190
quicker then like up heat you know

756
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:32,490
they're just it's just eating it that

757
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:36,119
one layer so much in chip piles yeah

758
00:36:32,489 --> 00:36:39,509
where we have things like what I guess

759
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:42,358
is like ecto but this strand like where

760
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,890
these through where the where it starts

761
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:46,409
webbing together but it's in dense

762
00:36:43,889 --> 00:36:47,789
pockets like so okay so you go a pile

763
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:49,348
and it's chipped up especially if it

764
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:52,500
looks like real rotten when it went in

765
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:55,740
and it's already a super fine a lot of

766
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,050
fines coming out we could get it wet it

767
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:59,909
like a 1 or 2 heavy

768
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:03,360
we get some water into the piles trying

769
00:36:59,909 --> 00:37:06,149
to keep the spot piles low and we'll see

770
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,590
it that the web's run through it but

771
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:09,510
what's weird is that they don't run

772
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,789
consistently they run maybe light at

773
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:14,610
first as they're building up but then

774
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:17,699
into these heavy pockets and those like

775
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:20,690
Justin knock you like yeah they just

776
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:24,919
like go into like a ball and just like

777
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:27,960
eat everything and then go from there

778
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:31,440
after we read Jeff lowenfeld book the

779
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:34,409
teeming with fungi yeah

780
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,519
Jeff's book so in towards the end of the

781
00:37:34,409 --> 00:37:40,619
book it teaches you about where to find

782
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:43,250
fungal hypha theory in in the wild right

783
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:46,409
and so we found out that you know like

784
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:47,789
long term of what full term outdoor

785
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:51,210
cannabis plants are like really

786
00:37:47,789 --> 00:37:53,279
beneficial to you know a fungal dominant

787
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:56,400
you know association with your bacteria

788
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,380
mixed in in there right so my neighbor

789
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,960
was basically it's the one who gave us

790
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:03,390
the book to read was like you know we

791
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,599
can go find these like whole pockets of

792
00:38:03,389 --> 00:38:08,129
dense mycorrhizae in the forest it's all

793
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:10,589
just like right there next to we're

794
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:12,630
broken oak trees are like falling on the

795
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:14,730
ground so like we literally just went

796
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:16,619
off in the woods a little bit and like

797
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:18,360
right where you would see where big old

798
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:20,190
branches had fallen down our trees had

799
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:23,160
fallen down you could like push over

800
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:25,380
like the top like decrepid layer of what

801
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:28,289
was bargained stuff and there's just

802
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:31,289
like hole just in dense pockets of it

803
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:33,829
where the I I assume where all that

804
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:35,778
comes from is the microbes in the

805
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:39,410
yes and mycelium are eating the wood

806
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:42,108
tissue inside of the the log or whatever

807
00:38:39,409 --> 00:38:44,149
that's falling down right so that's

808
00:38:42,108 --> 00:38:46,190
that's where that's where I've

809
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:48,499
personally experienced like finding it

810
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,059
in the wild in in old-growth forests

811
00:38:48,498 --> 00:38:52,518
that hasn't been disturbed for at least

812
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:54,559
sixty years you know so that was just

813
00:38:52,518 --> 00:38:57,139
cool to find you know right right right

814
00:38:54,559 --> 00:39:00,709
but you're saying of talking about like

815
00:38:57,139 --> 00:39:01,460
wait the specifically you know what I

816
00:39:00,708 --> 00:39:04,068
mean

817
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:07,400
you were saying specifically how you

818
00:39:04,068 --> 00:39:09,588
know what the tan oaks I think you know

819
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,510
like what if it's infix if I've been

820
00:39:09,588 --> 00:39:13,730
I've been wondering that myself if it's

821
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:16,040
like dangerous or not to use the tan

822
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:19,608
Oaks but so I'm just trying to

823
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:23,690
out-compete whatever whatever's there

824
00:39:19,608 --> 00:39:26,779
that yeah I like I just I don't see how

825
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:29,059
there's any like Cano concern to me and

826
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:31,069
growing cannabis like maybe if I was

827
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:34,040
raising it was if I was tricking me if I

828
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:36,920
was raising little tan oh I'd also be

829
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:39,170
like should I be using this as my soil

830
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:42,170
component but like I just see it as

831
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:43,940
something that's available and works way

832
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:45,800
sooner so we at for instance we have

833
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,530
this big pile that we're working with

834
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:51,829
its fir dominant and it's more like

835
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:55,490
twenty years down and it was already

836
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:58,519
bucked and run with dozers and stuff it

837
00:39:55,489 --> 00:40:00,500
was like um you know waste in making a

838
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:02,750
pond a long time ago and so we've been

839
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:04,068
working this ferpa and I'm like okay

840
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:07,909
there's stuff in there and I also have

841
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:11,539
like in different spots these like 50 60

842
00:40:07,909 --> 00:40:13,460
70 year old firs that they that they

843
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:15,710
dropped and they couldn't get out at the

844
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:19,880
time or whatever happened and I have

845
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:21,740
access to them and I'm more okay with

846
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,780
thinking about using that stuff but like

847
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:25,759
fresh fir just doesn't work in our

848
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,298
situation I don't think I think it's too

849
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,720
acidic

850
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:31,159
it's got like a lot of I don't know

851
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,118
there I think there's a lot of anti

852
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:35,239
microbials

853
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:36,130
in it just just by the nature of all the

854
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:38,949
terpenes

855
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:41,470
exactly yeah yeah I don't you I don't

856
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:43,659
have much fur in that yeah it's

857
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:45,759
predominantly ten of which and I've been

858
00:40:43,659 --> 00:40:47,889
wondering that is this dangerous am I

859
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,980
gonna you know if it's in fire with

860
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:53,500
Sutton okay yeah i don't know i don't i

861
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:58,000
did that probably know i just being

862
00:40:53,500 --> 00:41:00,309
driving with it so yeah like I asked the

863
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,539
lab I asked one of the labs and and he

864
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:04,449
thought it was fine too

865
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:21,820
also heavy metals I was concerned about

866
00:41:04,449 --> 00:41:25,439
heavy metal waterborne but I want I

867
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:25,440
watched how its spread on my property

868
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:37,249
for my my property it was chainsaws PG&amp;E

869
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:38,809
like we want we watch it come in on the

870
00:41:37,248 --> 00:41:40,699
power lines and spread through our

871
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:43,160
forests for sure and they they told

872
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:46,518
afterwards when I asked them yeah they

873
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:49,670
they'd for sure yeah that will happen

874
00:41:46,518 --> 00:41:52,368
I've seen that happen to with PG&amp;E come

875
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:55,670
in and they're just carrying it on their

876
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:57,440
trucks their chainsaws have it they have

877
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:59,930
it they've been working in it all day

878
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,670
it's in their pant cuffs it's on them

879
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:03,288
that's you know what I mean that's

880
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,729
either coming in on them it's here

881
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:05,509
they're in the air so it's kind of

882
00:42:04,728 --> 00:42:08,268
everywhere

883
00:42:05,509 --> 00:42:11,659
it's kind of hard to hard to hide from

884
00:42:08,268 --> 00:42:15,199
it at this point you know I have dicey

885
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:17,210
Mountains just dying you know up where

886
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:21,018
I'm at my neighbors Hill is just like

887
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:24,170
drowning out but by me it's not so bad

888
00:42:21,018 --> 00:42:26,859
honestly I must say where I'm at it

889
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:29,139
doesn't seem so bad work

890
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:31,930
what may because we're actually working

891
00:42:29,139 --> 00:42:34,210
with the forest and and letting it

892
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:35,889
breathe you know

893
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,990
maybe because we're letting it breathe

894
00:42:35,889 --> 00:42:45,190
just the simple cuz I'm cutting so many

895
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:47,859
trees down or that fault you know I live

896
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:50,889
in a like wherever you're standing and

897
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:52,900
there's no tree there were ten ten oak

898
00:42:50,889 --> 00:42:55,329
trees on the land we can verify this

899
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:59,369
like you know that's how thick it is and

900
00:42:55,329 --> 00:43:02,949
I have north east and west facing so

901
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:06,569
it's challenging I fight for space

902
00:43:02,949 --> 00:43:10,059
I fight trees oh yeah whatever

903
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:12,370
for light and in flat space I have to

904
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:15,070
like you know fight for it with like a

905
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:20,559
chainsaw and an excavator you know to

906
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:23,559
keep my spaces my life my flag or or not

907
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:25,659
even flat but just whatever and if it's

908
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:27,239
hope dominant then I would say you use

909
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:29,589
that to your advantage

910
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:32,459
yeah yeah it's what I've been doing I

911
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:37,510
just need my I've been predominantly

912
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:40,420
using like ten oak chips hi fungal tan

913
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:44,230
oak chips as my base and then I'm using

914
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:46,720
I have this hundred-year-old wisteria

915
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:48,630
patch that's mulching this

916
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:51,208
hundred-year-old wisteria

917
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:53,459
leaves for a hundred years and then I'll

918
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:56,098
be gathering up ten oak leaves I'll

919
00:43:53,458 --> 00:44:00,118
gather up ain't rotten anything I could

920
00:43:56,099 --> 00:44:02,249
find that high fungal rot even like

921
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:08,640
different color I'll go for like

922
00:44:02,248 --> 00:44:10,858
different like a yellow fungus on the

923
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:14,068
redwoods on the Redwood deaf I've been

924
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:16,409
growing old yellow I call it I'm trying

925
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:19,288
to grow old yellow and get it to pop

926
00:44:16,409 --> 00:44:24,298
I've been trying to get a morels to pop

927
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:25,140
in my my my beds inoculated with them

928
00:44:24,298 --> 00:44:27,748
some morels

929
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:31,199
I don't know they'll take a minute to

930
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:32,879
pop up it's it's still early to tell but

931
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:34,700
I was really just yeah I thought that

932
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,710
would be ideal

933
00:44:34,699 --> 00:44:40,019
that would be cool it's giant morels

934
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:42,360
popping up under your care cannabis

935
00:44:40,019 --> 00:44:56,090
plants that I'm stir talking mushrooms

936
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:56,090
that pop up in the Cardinal what is that

937
00:44:57,829 --> 00:45:23,699
all right on right now really yeah yeah

938
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:28,740
yeah yeah yeah right on

939
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:30,989
yeah absolutely yeah give things a try

940
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:33,409
toke first so it kind of sets your

941
00:45:30,989 --> 00:45:33,409
palate

942
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:42,950
would you like to pass around if you

943
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:47,629
guys would like to feel like they're not

944
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:52,299
