8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,600

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,279
um i really enjoyed um seeing what the

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:28,399
worms did to that it was pretty cool

12
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,960
yeah

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,640
i love experimenting and um

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,719
i will say that a lot of my uh worm

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,120
farms have taken off because of uh some

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,719
of the inoculation that you gave me a

17
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,359
few months ago so i really appreciate

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,520
that oh thank you brian and especially

19
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,119
the rogue beetles they're

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,359
i think most people on here know that

21
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,839
those are pretty expensive um so to be

22
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,519
able to get them and then breed them uh

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440
saved me a lot of money so appreciate

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,320
that wow

25
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,919
cool

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,439
yeah i kind of understand why that's

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,760
happening more so that's going to be

28
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,718
part of a down the road disclosure but

29
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,439
um

30
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,519
yeah hi that's beautiful thank you brian

31
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:07,118
for demonstrating that

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,799
absolutely

33
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,000
so what are we going to talk about today

34
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,159
are we going to go into a little bit of

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,438
history about who you are and how you

36
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,799
arrived at your living soils

37
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,039
sort of

38
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,520
like passion and also i'd like to hear a

39
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,040
little bit about how we've first became

40
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:28,158
acquainted through your education um or

41
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,320
your uh education over egos platform and

42
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,079
kind of maybe start there and work our

43
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:35,279
way into the present does that sound

44
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:37,758
good yeah that sounds great okay um i'm

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,079
talking about uh worm farming today with

46
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,840
uh rabbits using a specific rabbit

47
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,438
called a lionhead rabbit

48
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,960
so i'm excited to get into that and i

49
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,758
actually have them hanging out with me

50
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,519
right here so i can kind of show

51
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,680
how intelligent they are and they're

52
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,118
really fun to just

53
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,360
have around the house

54
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,040
i've been able to actually get mine

55
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,959
not only to be potty trained but to

56
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,920
understand to only poop and pee in the

57
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,158
pots

58
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,840
so there's all these worm bins

59
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,200
downstairs in the basement and he can

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,680
literally go all the way up to my

61
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,679
bedroom all the way down to the basement

62
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,159
and obviously my kids enjoy them i have

63
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,159
two little boys four and five so having

64
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,520
a bunny in the house is kind of fun and

65
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,000
he just kind of runs around and does his

66
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,719
own thing um

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,280
and it improves the soil

68
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,878
um and we can get into all that but uh

69
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,159
so for those that don't know my name is

70
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:32,318
brian walksman uh 303 organic cannabis

71
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:33,280
on instagram um and i really started out

72
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,598
um

73
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,439
i guess more um

74
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,119
in the underground market you know

75
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,439
sometimes i'm hesitant to say that but

76
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,800
but it is the truth me too

77
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,639
yeah i'm sorry you know i learned off of

78
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,120
friends and peers and made a lot of

79
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,039
mistakes um i'm not ashamed to say that

80
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,519
i lost a lot of crops

81
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:56,239
full tents before and stuff like that

82
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,400
and you know um i that's why i guess

83
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,920
when i also noticed that

84
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,560
you really have to have

85
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,399
the same vision and cultivating cannabis

86
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,598
as your business partners

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,519
because if you don't it's really hard

88
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,959
i even noticed like back in the day i

89
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,280
mean we were just growing in like a

90
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,959
basement-sized tent and the plants

91
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,560
really started to decline in health

92
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,039
because of the friction

93
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,400
of all like um you know we were arguing

94
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,318
back and forth basically on how to grow

95
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,158
the plants and we wanted to improve the

96
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,878
grow and we just weren't seeing eye to

97
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,158
eye um and that's so i um i started to

98
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,079
take a little bit of

99
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,560
you know the money that i had and i i

100
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,799
signed up for dr elaine ingham's courses

101
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,199
on soil food web okay

102
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,360
and they were pretty expensive um but i

103
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,679
felt like it was well worth the time

104
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,280
and my son had just been born so

105
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,560
i had a lot of time obviously to kind of

106
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,479
like sit around

107
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,759
and grow my plants and and educate

108
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,158
myself

109
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,239
and so once i started to learn about her

110
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,318
methods and that kind of stuff she had a

111
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,840
uh like a private chat room where you

112
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,560
could talk to other students and people

113
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,080
would talk about other um up and coming

114
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,840
and you know this is maybe eight or nine

115
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,760
years ago so it wasn't like

116
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,239
everybody knew really even what we were

117
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,759
talking about back then uh and myself

118
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,959
included i didn't really i mean i was

119
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,199
taking the course but it was still

120
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,199
really hard for me um and then that's

121
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,560
when um somebody told me about a guy

122
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,560
named jeff lowenfels which i'm sure

123
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,959
everybody knows about now um and i read

124
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,839
his first book teaming with microbes

125
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,000
and that um kind of broke it down for

126
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,439
a farmer from georgia type you know i'm

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,439
not i'm not that

128
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,959
of an academic if you will but i do love

129
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,000
to experiment and do research and that

130
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:31,758
kind of thing

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,560
so his book was able to break that stuff

132
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,919
down

133
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,160
and i started to play around with the

134
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,599
soil food web there's even a gentleman

135
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,919
here in colorado that's pretty well

136
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,160
known in your neck of the woods that

137
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,560
does really good work with like worms

138
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,400
and worm farming and stuff so i actually

139
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,720
drove um the 90 minutes one way to get

140
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,719
that specific inoculation

141
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,400
and i started playing around with that

142
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,639
and that's when i really started to

143
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:58,560
improve my cannabis skills

144
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,840
cultivation skills i was then able to

145
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,600
get a job

146
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,839
on a commercial facility here in denver

147
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,439
colorado and that's really where the

148
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,038
organic part started to come out in me

149
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,800
is because i found out real quickly that

150
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,000
even though we were you know all the

151
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,240
marketing and everything that we were

152
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
doing was supposedly um

153
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,600
medical there was really nothing medical

154
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,360
about the facility that

155
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,800
that was being run and there was a lot

156
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,600
of things that were being sprayed and

157
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,639
that kind of stuff uh eagle 20 forbid

158
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,320
avid

159
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,639
and i personally know that eagle 20 was

160
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,959
being spread late into flower

161
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,639
so those were certain things that

162
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,439
you know when you first come on you know

163
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,879
this is your dream job in a way um so

164
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:36,160
you don't want to rock the boat and to

165
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,519
be honest i didn't really know what

166
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,520
eagle 20 was you know i just knew that

167
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,560
for whatever reason the head grower

168
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,799
wasn't

169
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,079
was really big on me not applying it um

170
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,680
so then when i started to do some

171
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,120
research and stuff i started to rock the

172
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,478
boat a little bit

173
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,600
and then of course

174
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,519
you kind of know how that happens

175
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,960
sometimes and i had to find another

176
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,359
place um and that's where i really

177
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,359
started um educating people because i

178
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,199
was just amazed at

179
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,360
you know how brilliant some of these

180
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,160
cannabis cultivators were

181
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,439
but they really didn't know um really

182
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,439
about like

183
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,719
they knew about brand names i should say

184
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,918
right they knew about brand name

185
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,720
amendments but they weren't really

186
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,240
talking about like plants like what what

187
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,840
is really

188
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,120
especially on the microbial level it

189
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,758
didn't seem like anybody really knew

190
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,918
about that um so that's when i um i

191
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,319
joined these social media sites for

192
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,560
cannabis the first one in denver was uh

193
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,120
something called mass roots and so i was

194
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,879
on there trying to educate and and made

195
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,478
a you know a little name for myself on

196
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,079
there and then there was this other

197
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,879
thing called do

198
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:43,120
the doobie app and that was really where

199
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:45,199
i felt like i was able to gain traction

200
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,759
is because it was i mean it was cannabis

201
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,280
based it was gamified so people really

202
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,038
enjoyed it at first

203
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,638
um i don't know if you've ever did you

204
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,399
ever try that or anything any of those

205
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,759
apps no no no

206
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,679
yeah

207
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,680
like uh like many things with cannabis

208
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,439
it was it's probably a good idea but

209
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,959
they both both companies ran out of

210
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,839
money and stuff so

211
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,279
um

212
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,959
that's when i really brought i had this

213
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:09,359
whole organic cannabis thing i brought

214
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,279
it to instagram uh and somebody already

215
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,160
had that name so i just put the 303 in

216
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,519
front of it and off i went um and and

217
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,599
since then i've

218
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:19,120
i've seen you know the dark side of what

219
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,719
people are doing behind the scenes to

220
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,879
now where a lot of people are really

221
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,560
wanting to clean up the industry and

222
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,159
growers themselves want to be proud of

223
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,160
the product that they're they're farming

224
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,599
and i would i would say you know eight

225
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,319
or nine years ago back when that was

226
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:34,399
going on um it was really kind of an

227
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,720
inside secret that the big commercial

228
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,638
farmers would never grow or i'm sorry

229
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,919
never smoke uh the stuff that they were

230
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,000
growing for

231
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:44,079
you know some big some company some big

232
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,759
brand uh they would usually have back

233
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,240
then buy it from like the underground

234
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,240
guys um

235
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,280
yeah we were craft and you know we

236
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,639
couldn't compete against the

237
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,159
dispensaries back then um so how do we

238
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,519
you know we had to improve on quality

239
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,120
that was really the only thing you know

240
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,878
it's not like we have a bunch of money

241
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,720
so how do we change that and that's

242
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,520
really where i dove into the whole like

243
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,160
organic idea

244
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:10,839
thanks for articulating what is kind of

245
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,800
like a movement that we still get to be

246
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:15,198
like

247
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:18,400
creative within because you know we've

248
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,840
we've gone through that motion of like

249
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,159
answering to

250
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,959
the quality issue at a very early stage

251
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,120
in this game so it's kind of cool

252
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,439
congratulations and i would say that you

253
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,360
know these big big time farmers are big

254
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:34,639
time owners of these farms

255
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,719
um when they do understand this concept

256
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:39,120
i really think that you know as these

257
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,640
years go by their products are really

258
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,639
going to stand out

259
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,480
and i think so we have yet to discover

260
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,480
yeah how she's going to express herself

261
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,120
given the right conditions like it's

262
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,560
night and day

263
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,159
and there's a lot of brilliant minds out

264
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:53,199
there that are just popping up you know

265
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,719
that

266
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,920
maybe five years ago wouldn't have shown

267
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,320
their face three years ago wouldn't have

268
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,679
shown their face um so if those people

269
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,920
are watching you know come on out of the

270
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,039
woodworks and and let's discuss things

271
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,519
because

272
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,278
i assure you that it's not um

273
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,120
i don't feel nervous about talking about

274
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,240
cannabis anymore at all like this kind

275
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,360
of stuff

276
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,278
yeah

277
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,120
and it extends beyond i mean she's

278
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,120
teaching us how to grow food and how to

279
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
sort of get realigned with our natural

280
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,240
environment

281
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,720
um on such a profound level well and

282
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,278
she's been such an instrumental goddess

283
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,160
in teaching young men how to farm and

284
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,399
how to

285
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:32,000
garden and how to you know pay attention

286
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,440
to their to their natural world i mean

287
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,519
what a blessing

288
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,440
and also like yeah as far as like not

289
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,440
being afraid but also realizing that

290
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,040
it's through cooperation and like

291
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,320
communication that we get to learn the

292
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,319
most like

293
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,160
i've learned so much from you brian even

294
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,080
stepping into your basement that day i

295
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,559
was like a little kid in a candy shop

296
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,000
and seeing your bunnies and how amazing

297
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,399
they are i was like

298
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,839
i need to know more about this and just

299
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,559
in that little bit of time i picked up

300
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,480
so much knowledge just by being you know

301
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,799
in communication with you

302
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,800
so thank you well that's that's really

303
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:06,399
been my goal for like uh probably like

304
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,879
the last three years

305
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,480
um is just to share knowledge because i

306
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,799
know that you've helped me in tremendous

307
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,720
ways friends of yours that i now follow

308
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,399
on instagram you know

309
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,720
just following people and and seeing

310
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,559
what they're doing and um

311
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,639
it just it just really helps with the

312
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,078
with the time frame and i can't imagine

313
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,199
if i would have had this like 10 years

314
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,519
ago if we would have this kind of

315
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,278
platform how quickly you know it's the

316
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,560
it's the guys in the early 20s that are

317
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,480
actually taking over the cannabis

318
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,319
industry and i have no

319
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,639
shame in saying that or any hats off to

320
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,120
them because hats off yeah they are they

321
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,480
should be uh you know using technology

322
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,759
and educating themselves on a whole

323
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,480
another level

324
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,559
yeah

325
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,000
from my background i used to play online

326
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,518
poker and it was kind of the same way it

327
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,278
was these young kids that really

328
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,679
understood technology that were able to

329
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,679
educate themselves to beat these old

330
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,078
guards uh that played poker their whole

331
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,078
life but didn't see that many hands and

332
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,679
i see that same way especially with like

333
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,759
the sullivan-less guys and that kind of

334
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,359
stuff um they're able to educate

335
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,679
themselves on a whole another level so

336
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,959
they might not have been um

337
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,599
farming for as long but their

338
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,359
educational level is far superior and

339
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,959
and hats off to the you know the guys

340
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,200
that are out there that are continuing

341
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:16,399
to educate themselves and sharing that

342
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,519
knowledge i know that some of them

343
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,000
aren't going to always share their

344
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,839
secrets but uh i do see some of them

345
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,600
sharing like tips and tricks and stuff

346
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,320
like that and you know that goes a long

347
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,320
way too i mean

348
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,320
i'm sure you know as well like i just

349
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:32,879
want to smoke the best and the cleanest

350
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,200
it keeps me it keeps me sane

351
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,039
it is medicine for me and if i didn't

352
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,200
have it um i probably would be a

353
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:42,480
different person i smoke all day every

354
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,959
day um maybe that's not the best uh

355
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,039
but it is something that um keeps me

356
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,399
focused and i love that i'm able to get

357
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,278
a lot of things done and i'm very

358
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,559
productive and i know that um i wish my

359
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,000
mom was watching this because i know

360
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,039
back in the day she used to think that

361
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,639
just because you smoked a lot of

362
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,360
cannabis you're sitting around watching

363
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,200
tv you know i don't even have tv cable

364
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,759
that kind of thing i'm i'm very focused

365
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,600
on education and so uh you know

366
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,838
hopefully if somebody ever sees that i

367
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,079
could tell my mother that people are

368
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,760
successful and use cannabis as a as they

369
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:15,439
used to pump me full like ritalin and

370
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,799
adderall um

371
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,240
my mom would literally you know i would

372
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,879
have to take it and show her my tongue

373
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,879
and the whole thing um and

374
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,320
the reality is the cannabis was kind of

375
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,519
doing the same thing and now i've taken

376
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,519
it to where

377
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,639
i can really focus i've been doing

378
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,078
actually a lot more writing and

379
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,440
educational things and that's really

380
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:32,638
helping like

381
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,720
really open

382
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,839
this whole new world that i didn't

383
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,360
really

384
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,639
knew that i could that i could do so

385
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,759
there's some educational things that are

386
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,600
coming out that i've been working on

387
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,000
behind the scenes and this coveted thing

388
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,759
has really kind of helped um tina and

389
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,120
myself who are going to do a lot of

390
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,958
these live um educational classes and we

391
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,679
still are going to do that so yeah we

392
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,119
are uh i guess that's like a little plug

393
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,799
there but um

394
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,480
you know when we're allowed to really

395
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:59,759
focus and find things

396
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,879
um

397
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:02,240
you know there's a couple places they're

398
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,519
starting to open up so i think in you

399
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,360
know in the next few weeks we might be

400
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,360
able to make some moves but

401
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,600

410
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,039
yeah it would be great to be a community

411
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,199
oh yeah and brian you're so talented at

412
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:32,719
that so i went to uh before the covet

413
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,440
thing hit we were we were in engaged in

414
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,639
in planning this out and i went to an uh

415
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,760
instagram

416
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,959
class that brian gave and uh i was

417
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:45,278
really struck by how you know he had

418
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,039
this room full of people and he was

419
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,958
definitely giving us knowledge but at

420
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,439
the same time he was

421
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:54,000
drawing us into this participatory event

422
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,480
that was you know in truth amplifying

423
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,399
everybody that was there and it's a new

424
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,720
way for us to be in society with each

425
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,639
other to be on that level of like

426
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,240
win-win like you do when you do better i

427
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,480
do when we all do better we all do

428
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,879
better basically right and it's the

429
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,560
practice of that and brian you're so

430
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,639
good at it you're just a natural when it

431
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,239
comes to community so

432
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,360
i'm really thrilled to be working with

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,440
my boys like to call him rick rick so

501
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,199
rick rick let's go boy you know and

502
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,680
he'll run up the stairs

503
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,639
and do his thing but he is basically

504
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:59,039
feeding

505
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,560
the rest of uh my basement

506
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:03,439
and what i'm doing down in the basement

507
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,720
is worm farming uh for living soil and

508
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,558
just for

509
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,439
you know my own um

510
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,798
enjoyment i guess so how big how big is

511
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,360
your bunny

512
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,599
uh that's he's he's not that big that

513
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,078
he's a little guy yeah and i think uh

514
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,918
the breed was created in the 90s so as

515
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,519
far as i understand you know that's not

516
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,079
really that long ago

517
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:27,199
so they're still kind of little rabbits

518
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:30,319
i really highly recommend you guys um

519
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,558
warm farm with rabbits but take the time

520
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,558
and and spend a little extra money on

521
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:37,918
getting a lion head because the white

522
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:39,519
dwarfs are actually not that smart

523
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,400
yes it's going to be pretty hard to get

524
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:44,400
them uh potty trained and their pee is

525
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,519
actually kind of ridiculous

526
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,559
as far as like ammonia and stuff okay

527
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,759
all right so you're probably gonna have

528
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:51,440
some issues

529
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:52,720
do you have to compensate for that in

530
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,120
your worm bins or does it just

531
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,440
completely take care of itself well i uh

532
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,759
i have so many warm bins um yeah i think

533
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,919
i have like 15 going so he'll just run

534
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,440
around like he just does his thing so

535
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,679
he'll poop in this one and he'll poop in

536
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,200
this really and if i notice he hasn't

537
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,798
pooped in a certain one for a while i'll

538
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,880
just put treats or hay or something in

539
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:11,679
that one and then okay

540
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,480
yeah

541
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,480
but you know the goal is to oops

542
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,400
yeah my daughter had a pet rabbit when

543
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:23,038
she was a baby and uh

544
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,679
yeah it got it bit but these guys don't

545
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:25,679
bite huh

546
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,960
um i wouldn't say that but they're

547
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,678
they're really intelligent and they're

548
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:36,640
um you can have it they're really sweet

549
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,000
yeah so yeah i mean as long as you're

550
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,120
sweet to them they're gonna be sweet to

551
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,279
you as long as you don't scare them or

552
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,599
anything yeah yeah

553
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,720
but i have had a lionhead uh that i used

554
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,959
to call uh

555
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,120
grizzelda blanco i think i'm pronouncing

556
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,558
that correctly but she would bite for

557
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:52,558
whatever reason but that's why i

558
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,960
actually called her or named her that uh

559
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,359
because she was she was a feisty little

560
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,880
bitch

561
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,678
but another you know another smart

562
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,720
rabbit but she would bite it now

563
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:07,679
i love this so much

564
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,839
does he beg for food

565
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,880
is that a red wiggler this is actually a

566
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:16,079
big one this is a european night crawler

567
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,360
we're using the uh bunny poop to feed

568
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,000
four main

569
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:22,159
uh composting worms so we use the red

570
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,798
wigglers which i'm sure most people are

571
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,320
familiar with um that's like when you

572
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,240
know when you google composting worms

573
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,240
that's what usually pops up

574
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,319
and those work like the top four

575
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,720
of the

576
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,879
of the pot itself and so when those red

577
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,360
wigglers are turning things uh the goal

578
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,960
is to get about you know 2 000 of them

579
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,678
at the top there and they're going to

580
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,440
burn about seven pounds

581
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,400
of worm casting for you every single

582
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,200
month

583
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,559
what yeah these things are ferocious

584
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,720
eaters as long as you're feeding them

585
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:55,440
these are all optimal conditions but

586
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,038
uh again if you're using like again you

587
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,440
know bunnies eat all day and poop all

588
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:02,000
day so if you're just constantly feeding

589
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,080
that worm bin um and if you can get a

590
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,759
smart enough bunny he'll do it for you

591
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,439
right so i'm up here working typing and

592
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,679
stuff he's down here feeding the warm

593
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,919
bin um you know back in the day i had

594
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,080
him over i built like a cage that was

595
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,080
over the worm bin but again you run into

596
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,199
a lot of those uh

597
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:18,879
urea

598
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,679
ammonia nitrogen problems where it's

599
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,840
just

600
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,960
it just uh i think salts and stuff to

601
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,639
build up

602
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,038
in that pea um so if you just put them

603
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:31,200
and to me that's not really humane as

604
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,038
well like if i'm gonna have a an animal

605
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,840
i want to enjoy you know i enjoy having

606
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:37,519
the bunny around um yeah it's fun and

607
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,519
stuff so

608
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,960
i don't really like that method and i

609
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,480
know that a lot of people do it that way

610
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,720
where they just put the bunnies over and

611
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,519
to me it seems kind of like a factory so

612
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,919
am i not getting like the

613
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:52,319
i'm sure sometimes he might be like

614
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,480
pooping on the side of a you know but

615
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:57,359
for the majority of of everything and

616
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,798
for how much he poops it is no work he

617
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:59,839
just does his thing

618
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:01,519
wow

619
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,759
and there is crosstalk that happens

620
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:06,000
between you know animals and and people

621
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:08,000
like you know i i have goats and i have

622
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,159
a new muscovy ducks and it's like this

623
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,839
training process and then they become

624
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,840
like the communication that happens is

625
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:16,720
really truly amazing like they can

626
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,879
integrate into your lifestyle

627
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,038
that's good look at that

628
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,520
oh my god um so

629
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:26,558
the the next ones that we use are

630
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:28,158
european night crawlers okay um and

631
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,158
those

632
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,280
that's actually this this chatter worm

633
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,480
here

634
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:33,839
okay

635
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,159
can you guys see that

636
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,798
oh there we go yeah i can yeah so they

637
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,200
they really really wiggle um really all

638
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,359
compost ones kind of wiggle but

639
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,720
um they work the middle of the pots and

640
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:46,000
they work in conjunction with the

641
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,279
african night crawlers and the reason

642
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,720
why they're called night crawlers is

643
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,519
because at night they come to the top

644
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,279
and feed so the reason why i like um

645
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,440
introducing those into

646
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,399
you know as long as probably like a 20

647
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,000
gallon

648
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,519
air pot fabric pot

649
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,319
there's enough room where all the worms

650
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,319
can you know work their little area and

651
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,480
there's not any competition i have heard

652
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:10,158
if you're using like a smaller pot uh

653
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,839
that sometimes there's competition or

654
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,159
some of them might even like kind of

655
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,240
push each other out or um i believe it

656
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,960
was rachel gadjasana was saying that she

657
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,000
seemed like weren't eat other worms um

658
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,400
oh wow i've always just had huge pots as

659
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,359
big as i can because i try to i view it

660
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,880
as like the stomach for the plant and i

661
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,558
try to have as big enough stomach and

662
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,159
healthy of another stomach as possible

663
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:33,759
but if you're doing like a three gallon

664
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,600
or five gallon something like that i

665
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:37,599
could see you having issues

666
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,119
obviously because they like to burrow

667
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,639
right and so when they're working like

668
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,158
the middle of those pots they're working

669
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,120
in conjunction with those african night

670
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,200
crawlers and african night crawlers um

671
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,558
are another real workhorse with the red

672
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,720
wigglers but they work in the middle of

673
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,558
the pot and the europeans compost things

674
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,279
as well but not as fast

675
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,879
but they are um for me at least i can

676
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:58,798
get them to be a little bit fatter and i

677
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,720
know that they're going up and down as

678
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:02,480
the days go by building those dissolved

679
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,279
oxygen channels for me

680
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,038
which is extremely beneficial uh just to

681
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,678
keep the plant i'm sure everybody here

682
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,919
has like aerated their yard before their

683
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,840
front yard try to improve like the the

684
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:16,159
health of their grass if you live in an

685
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:17,599
hoa like me so you don't get fined um

686
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,840
that's kind of what they're doing right

687
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,839
they're going up and down up and down

688
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:23,839
and they're aerating building those

689
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:26,158
dissolved oxygen channels and then at

690
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,439
the bottom of the pots

691
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,520
is something that i've really just been

692
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,840
working probably like the last year and

693
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,279
these are called alabama jumpers or i'm

694
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:34,720
from georgia so i like to call them the

695
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:36,720
georgia jumpers

696
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,640
and they work the bottom of those pots

697
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,159
and they really um

698
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,320
they work almost as an earthworm but

699
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,440
they do compost as well and so if you

700
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:47,359
have a really hard compacted soil clays

701
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,640
uh just buy yourself a lot of alabama

702
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,119
jumpers

703
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,120
and give yourself some time and um

704
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,000
they'll reproduce for themselves if

705
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,079
they're

706
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,640
all these composting worms if if the

707
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,678
conditions are optimal they will usually

708
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,400
double their

709
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,600
entire population in 90 days

710
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,000
wow

711
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,639
so you can really start to build um you

712
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,720
know

713
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,320
especially if you're in raised beds you

714
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,960
can really start to build quite a little

715
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:16,319
um warm population for yourself and

716
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,600
what's the lifespan of these are they

717
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,678
do they because i read somewhere that

718
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:22,879
they can be they take two years to

719
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,559
mature or is that is that not true

720
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,278
uh no they they take about two to three

721
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,879
months to mature okay um

722
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:29,839
it's said that they can live up to four

723
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,679
years

724
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:35,599
but i would imagine most of them are

725
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,600
living between one and two okay

726
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,200
but again they're multiplying constantly

727
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,960
and

728
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,798
the cool thing about warm farming too is

729
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,600
you're never really going to see a bunch

730
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:48,079
of dead worms because they're 90 water

731
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,278
so as soon as they die the microbes and

732
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:50,720
everything if everything's healthy i

733
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,519
mean it just returns it back to that

734
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,640
soil um so like tina when you gave me

735
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:58,558
that i mean it was like a bag right

736
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,559
she was able to give me a bag when i got

737
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:03,359
back from oklahoma and i was able to

738
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:06,000
inoculate a hundred gallon

739
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,839
worm farm that i had used probably about

740
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,240
a year and a half maybe two years before

741
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,879
that so it had been alive but obviously

742
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,359
it died so right gave me that i was

743
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,240
enabled i was able to inoculate this

744
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,240
entire um 100 gallon

745
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,159
from the top and i would just water that

746
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,240
in and then give itself time and these

747
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,520
red wigglers started to reproduce over

748
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,278
time

749
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,278
and then i reached out to my buddy frank

750
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:32,159
up in new york so shout out to him with

751
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:35,200
um urban castings he was with us

752
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,400
tina at chris trump's great guy

753
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,400
i ordered worms from him

754
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:41,519
some of the red wiggers and the the

755
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,760
europeans

756
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,079
and i haven't looked back since so

757
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,879
it doesn't take a lot to really start

758
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,798
this um so if you guys yeah if you know

759
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,480
if you have peers or something like that

760
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:55,519
uh yeah just just help each other out

761
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,000
just a little bag full and some time

762
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:00,879
and you can change how you grow um yeah

763
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,880
tina tina probably saved me maybe a year

764
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,679
two years of me trying to rebuild

765
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,240
everything that i had or a trip up to

766
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,798
four cons i guess to to see you know the

767
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,798
buddy that everybody knows up there

768
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:16,158
what's can we mention him you mentioned

769
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:17,119
him earlier is he mentionable

770
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,120
um

771
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,959
we'll get this later too yeah i know him

772
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,399
as though i know him as like the worm

773

guy and the only

774
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,200
here's if you guys can figure this out

775
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:28,639
oh i know john and john

776
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,319
yeah no idea

777
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,520
he has a company name and he has a phone

778
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,200
number but he never

779
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:35,119
i know yeah exactly i know you're

mentioning we'll make sure that there's

783
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,960
going to be something attached to all

784
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:43,038
these this is a lot but i'm warm i'm

785

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,519
oh my god

812
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,519
so tell me about the process of building

813
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,079
these bins like go through a little bit

814
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,759
of it step by step just because i feel

815
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,599
like

816
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,919
so what what's in your what do you start

817
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:48,158
with what's your starting material

818
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,960
uh really just sphagnum i start off with

819
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,840
that

820
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,200
um

821
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:52,798
if i know it's gonna be there for a

822
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,880
really long time i'll put maybe a little

823
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,960
bit of lava rock on the bottom but i

824
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,039
don't like to do a lot because like i

825
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,440
said i am more i'm farming with the

826
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,398
georgia jumpers and those are going to

827
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,640
the bottom

828
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:07,119
um and i i have noticed with some of my

829
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,480
pots sometimes that i see a bunch of

830
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:09,839
you know

831
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,240
it just doesn't seem like it's as

832
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:14,158
healthy so i don't know if the worms are

833
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,679
dying down there or

834
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,278
i guess i would have to still experiment

835
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,159
but uh

836
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:22,798
have you have you added lab

837
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,399
uh i have before yes okay because i had

838
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:27,038
kind of a similar issue with that bin

839
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:30,719
i'm running and um i added about a cup

840
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:33,519
of lab and it completely

841
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,600
did away with any kind of funk

842
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,200
yeah and i think uh

843
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,038
you know when you start and even when

844
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,159
you start like a raised bed you know

845
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:42,480
that there's going to be like this

846
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,600
little hurdle if you will of a fungus

847
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,000
mass

848
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,359
so if you can reach out to appear if you

849
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,839
could um you know if you're really

850
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:51,759
forward thinking farmer i would have uh

851
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:53,038
by the way you know this is something

852
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:54,319
easy you can do is with these

853
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:55,759
springtails

854
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:56,960
uh these are super cheap you can get

855
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,359
these like

856
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,600
you guys see these

857
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:02,479
uh you can get this as like a reptile

858
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:04,480
place

859
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,360
but these are decomposers that are gonna

860
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,038
work um in a symbiotic relationship with

861
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:11,439
uh your composting worms and they're

862
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,359
gonna break organic matter down into

863
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,679
basically carbon and we all know that

864
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:17,678
carbon is like the currency of the of

865
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,120
the soil food web so the more carbon

866
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,960
that we have being exchanged everything

867
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:22,558
that's going on within the soil food web

868
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,640
the healthier everything is the

869
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,398
healthier whatever plant is that you put

870
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,679
into the soil whether it's tomato or a

871
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,359
cannabis plant

872
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,960
and that's something that i feel like

873
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,119
tina and myself and other people that

874
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,360
have been on tina's um

875
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,759
instagram show uh

876
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:39,599
really believe in is that you just feed

877
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,359
the soil right it doesn't really matter

878
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:44,079
about the plant anymore we're not we're

879
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:46,158
not really focused on synthetics or

880
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:48,319
chelated um

881
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,880
nutrients anymore we want things to be

882
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:52,319
broken down we want to be

883
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,039
top feeding knowing that it's not going

884
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:54,398
to

885
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,798
you know some of these amendments

886
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:59,278
sometimes might not even uh feed that

887
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,960
slip right and we hate that and we're

888
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,519
breaking down and we're feeding forward

889
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,278
next year and we're thinking and that's

890
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,398
the part that i really like about this

891
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:11,119
on a larger scale for commercial um

892
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,959
cannabis cultivation is that a lot of

893
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:14,558
the people that grow in this manner are

894
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,079
forward thinking and they're thinking

895
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,558
like okay what am i going to do two

896
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:19,599
years from now three years from now how

897
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:22,398
you know

898
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:23,759
how good are my beds gonna really be and

899
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,000
there's guys out there that have really

900
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,359
gotten the fungal aspect

901
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,440
through the roof where not only do they

902
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,038
have a cover crop growing but they have

903
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,759
just a beautiful

904
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:36,480
uh bouquet of mushrooms growing out of

905
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,599
their raised beds and um

906
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,038
you know i guess i probably shouldn't

907
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:40,639
say any specific names or anything but

908
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:42,558
you guys probably know who those guys

909
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,640
are and if you go to their instagram uh

910
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:46,639
you can really see that the healthier

911
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,919
the the almost like the more diverse

912
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,080
things that are growing out of that

913
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,080
cover crop the healthier that plant is

914
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:54,000
always going to be right and so the more

915
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,079
diversity that you can put into your

916
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,599
raised beds and your pots

917
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:59,759
the easier it's going to be to farm

918
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,359
cannabis and that's really the goal at

919
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,240
the end of the day right

920
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:06,240
is to grow cannabis in a in a healthy

921
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,038
and um

922
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,519
holistic manner and give yourself more

923
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:13,919
time so with living soil like we don't

924
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,720
ph anything right we're using worms to

925
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,880
to basically do that for us

926
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,798
and if there is a ph issue the worms

927
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,120
will tell you because they'll evacuate

928
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:25,519
the pots so it's pretty easy to tell if

929
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:27,038
something's horrific is going on but you

930
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,519
know at the end of the day you're

931
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:31,200
growing with mother nature so

932
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:32,880
it's really kind of hard to screw up

933
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,519
unless you start trying to add more

934
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,720
things or you know when i a couple years

935
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,960
when we first started doing this some of

936
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,399
my peers were kind of like okay so now

937
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,679
what am i doing you know they they felt

938
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,199
like they had to always tend their

939
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,600
plants and yep

940
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,159
our ass said this in my talks and stuff

941
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:49,918
i would joke with them like go outside

942
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,080
you know yeah you know spend time with

943
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,759
your family stuff like that because i

944
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,960
feel like as cannabis farmers sometimes

945
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,359
we can get

946
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,960
caught up in those are our babies those

947
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,918
are our blonde chain

948
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,600
i know at one time um and even in a past

949
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,278
relationship of mine i probably wasn't

950
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,319
the best of a you know a boyfriend

951
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:07,599
because

952
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:09,278
they took

953
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,719
it didn't matter what was going on you

954
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:13,359
know um

955
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,278
they took my attention

956
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:17,119
and so i do want to grow really good

957
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:18,880
cannabis i do want to spread the

958
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:19,759
knowledge that uh

959
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,278
you know

960
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,359
growing cannabis with living soil is

961
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:25,278
easier and you're gonna

962
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,879
have a better product and you know when

963
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:29,759
you first hear that it almost sounds too

964
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,120
good to be true yeah but the reality is

965
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,079
there's a lot of people out there that

966
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:34,239
are

967
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:36,319
that are showing that this is a

968
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,079
going to be a fundamental thing as a

969
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,158
farmer to understand

970
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:42,558
and it's kind of harder sometimes to

971
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,360
cultivate the patience that's needed to

972
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:45,519
not

973
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,879
add that that thing that you think you

974
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,640
need to add like to get away from the

975
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,880
mental like trying to fix everything all

976
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,440
the time and actually allowing for the

977
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,840
patients the patients to allow the plant

978
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,679
to kind of come into her own rhythm

979
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:59,439
because i mean even from like a clone

980
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,679
cut or something if that plant has been

981
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,360
used to a chemical environment and i'm

982
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,759
introducing it into my living beds

983
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:07,599
there's a good

984
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:10,558
like transition period that has to

985
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:12,480
happen for them to kind of like do you

986
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:15,278
find that this happens for you like to

987
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,200
even come into like um balance with that

988
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:18,240
system and then

989
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,679
that

990
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,079
even then from then on if i'm taking

991
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,840
clones from that it's the amplification

992
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:26,079
happens through generations as far as it

993
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:26,959
getting used to a living soil system

994
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,839
it's not

995
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,720
it's a patient's game and an observation

996
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,599
game

997
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,000
it's a it's a long man or a long person

998
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:37,519
thinking game right

999
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,200
we are thinking a year from now two

1000
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,519
years from now because we want to reuse

1001
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,480
the soil and uh especially for you home

1002
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,480
gardeners out there i mean

1003
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,919
a few months go by and you don't have to

1004
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,519
you don't have to go to the groce store

1005
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,480
anymore you can literally go to whole

1006
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,319
foods isn't it amazing right

1007
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,960
watch a couple youtube videos and you

1008
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:58,558
can make sprouted seed teas um

1009
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,640
like with the rabbits and the rabbit

1010
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:03,759
manure right one thing i found here's a

1011
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,519
tip is make like a slurry out of it um

1012
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:07,519
if there's a if there's a lot of it just

1013
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,320
put it in some water and make a slurry

1014
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:14,000
out of that a slurry out of what the the

1015
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,240
rabbit droppings okay and then once um

1016
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,480
obviously it's hydrated you can just

1017
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:21,279
drizzle that on top of your

1018
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,719
warm bins and they will go to town if

1019
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,720
you take that

1020
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,799
super super fresh worm castings and you

1021
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:29,118
put that on a troubled plant

1022
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,639
and you add some worms um and of course

1023
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,399
i would add the springtails and i would

1024
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,838
add rogue beetles i do that every time

1025
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:38,319
i'm really inoculating anything

1026
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:40,960
you're going to minimize the fungus

1027
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,720
issues um and if you do it well enough

1028
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,519
you won't even have them because those

1029
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:48,078
rove beetles are vicious and if you have

1030
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:50,000
uh the h miles what is it called now

1031
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,039
like a schidomus they keep changing the

1032
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,519
name of it

1033
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:56,480
oh yeah the predatory might yeah that's

1034
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:58,639
my again that's my georgia education so

1035
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,039
i might not be able to i know about it

1036
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:02,559
but uh academically

1037
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:03,440
you know what it looks like

1038
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,519
right

1039
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,000
and i think that's the beauty of

1040
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:10,000
what tina what we're trying to show is

1041
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,480
that you know you don't have to be this

1042
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,039
like super educated

1043
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,039
botanist uh to grow cannabis they made

1044
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:19,119
me think it was that way back in the day

1045
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:20,800
when you would go to the grow store but

1046
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,320
again the synthetic companies were the

1047
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,240
only companies that were teaching us how

1048
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,760
to grow cannabis well exactly we all

1049
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,919
have the knowledge and it's really based

1050
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,320
on observational skills how good are you

1051
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,960
at just looking without judgment or

1052
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,800
without preconceived idea like that that

1053
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,880
observational skill is something we all

1054
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,079
get to develop in doing this kind of

1055
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,519
work which has nothing to do with

1056
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,359
intellect it has everything to do with

1057
00:35:39,519 --> 00:35:43,679
heart and connection

1058
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:44,960
and caring and being truthful about what

1059
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:46,879
you're doing so

1060
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,358
that's that is so cute

1061
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,519
so let's so take me to so we've got the

1062
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:53,440
bins our worms are working we've got our

1063
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:55,599
different three kinds they're they're

1064
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,240
doing their their job

1065
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,240
before

1066
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,800
do you have a recipe now you've got your

1067
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,519
plants growing what how do you how are

1068
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,280
you integrating the worm castings and

1069
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,639
like are you separating how are you

1070
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,000
dealing with that are you separating the

1071
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,960
worms putting them how do you do all

1072
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,239
that

1073
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,000
so

1074
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:17,679
another thing that another tip that i've

1075
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,358
always shared with the community is this

1076
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,598
thing called or i guess the community

1077
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,519
now calls avocado tech right

1078
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,119
right it's not what i didn't come up

1079
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,358
with or anything i just i felt like i

1080
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,440
was maybe one of the first ones to share

1081
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,598
it um yeah i heard it from you first but

1082
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,200
it was definitely like a secret that we

1083
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,800
didn't share for a very long time and

1084
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:36,879
now that we're all showing our faces and

1085
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,160
stuff we're sharing with everybody and

1086
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,440
basically what you do is you take an

1087
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:43,039
avocado

1088
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,960
i prefer it to be a little bit on the um

1089
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:47,119
starting to mold side but i still want

1090
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,559
the flesh in there so there's like a

1091
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,559
almost like an art to it sometimes you

1092
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:53,759
can speed it up in a brown bag but

1093
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:55,759
you'll i personally like to take and um

1094
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,480
put an x with a knife like a baked

1095
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,079
potato and and kind of pop it open and

1096
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,679
the reason why i don't cut it in half is

1097
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,920
because when i cut it in half it seems

1098
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:06,960
like there's way more mites that come to

1099
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,760
it in a faster manner right and that's

1100
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,838
cool

1101
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,920
and that's great i want that but at the

1102
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,519
same time i'm also doing this for worms

1103
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,720
and if there's a ton of mites in there

1104
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:18,559
whoa sorry my bunny freaked out uh

1105
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:20,078
jumped off the table there

1106
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:21,679
so if there's a bunch of mites in that

1107
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,119
area the worms aren't going to really

1108
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:25,358
populate the way that you really want

1109
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,358
them to so i use the baked potato method

1110
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:29,358
if i'm using if i'm trying to use the

1111
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:30,960
avocado tech for

1112
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:32,078
composting worms

1113
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,280
okay

1114
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,440
the fats and everything that are in the

1115
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,680
avocado they love it

1116
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,920
and every composting worm and as far as

1117
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,000
i understand every earthworm as well are

1118
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,320
hermaphrodites meaning that they're male

1119
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,559
and female so the goal is to get them to

1120
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,320
touch right and as soon as they touch

1121
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:49,119
each other they all start to kind of

1122
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,640
ball

1123
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,079
and if you have enough worms in the

1124
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,000
system if you guys check out my

1125
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,000
instagram if you scroll back i've shown

1126
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,559
this many many times but you can get

1127
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,559
sometimes uh if you get it enough like a

1128
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,639
quarter pound worth of uh worms just in

1129
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,400
like a little avocado

1130
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,480
and then think of all the biofilm and

1131
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,599
all the things that's going on just in

1132
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,000
that little center of of that avocado um

1133
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,920
and then my goal is to get them so happy

1134
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,358
uh that they're now going you know once

1135
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,680
they finish that avocado they're now

1136
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,679
going and searching for other food

1137
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:23,598
but they've obviously started to lay

1138
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:24,799
these uh eggs which i actually have

1139
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,960
nice

1140
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,640
uh i don't know if you guys can

1141
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,519
hold it up oh oh

1142
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,400
it's uh it's like a funky yellow amber

1143
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,199
color

1144
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,519
yeah when you first like when you first

1145
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:40,078
start living soil especially if you get

1146
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:41,599
uh springtails you're going to freak out

1147
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,000
i actually threw away

1148
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,440
a couple of really good genetics

1149
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,400
when i got springtails because i thought

1150
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,920
they were

1151
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,838
they were my i mean i knew they were

1152
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,119
mites and everything like if you guys do

1153
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:53,119
a quick google search of white

1154
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,720
springtail mites everything that comes

1155
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:56,720
up on it pretty much on the first like

1156
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:58,319
two pages is how to get rid of them so

1157
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:00,319
they right at first it seems like

1158
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,760
they're a nuisance

1159
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,559
but they're not i mean they're working

1160
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,960
in a symbiotic relationship and they're

1161
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,759
honestly the secret to how you're able

1162
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,199
to speed up that living soil i mean how

1163
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,400
many people are watching 16 people are

1164
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,519
watching us right now so you guys 20

1165
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,400
21.

1166
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:19,280
oh

1167
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,559
yeah okay maybe 16 on your side 29. this

1168
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,640
is the first time i've ever done that so

1169
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:24,320
i appreciate that tina but for the

1170
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:26,480
people that are watching this right now

1171
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,640
the real secret to this right in

1172
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,800
cannabis is that you need to improve the

1173
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:33,358
calcium uptakes you need to improve the

1174
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,160
sulfur right and how do you do that you

1175
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:39,119
do that with rabbits because rabbits

1176
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:41,679
actually have very high calcium and very

1177
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,920
high sulfur in their poop so as long as

1178
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:46,239
you're feeding them quality

1179
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,559
food right quality and quality out and

1180
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:51,039
then you're using worms to break down

1181
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:53,599
that poop don't put that poop on your

1182
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:55,599
plants right because especially on a

1183
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,519
commercial setting there's all kinds of

1184
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,359
pathogens and stuff right so we take

1185
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,280
that there's there is a process and

1186
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:03,119
almost like an art form to this so we

1187
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,800
don't take any even though it's a cold

1188
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,800
manure and i should say that a cold

1189
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,800
manure like alpaca manure

1190
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,039
rabbit manure meaning as soon as it

1191
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,560
comes out of the animal you can put it

1192
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,039
on your plant without it burning it

1193
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:18,159
right okay right but because it is a

1194
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:19,920
manure there are potential for pathogens

1195
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,118
so we don't want to worry about that so

1196
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,760
what are we going to use we're going to

1197
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,760
use worms basically little machines that

1198
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,920
know how to clean up everything and

1199
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,240
break everything down and so as long as

1200
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,838
you use that rabbit slurry in that

1201
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:35,199
process and then use those worms to

1202
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:37,199
break that down those worm castings

1203
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:39,838
better than anything you will ever buy

1204
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:41,279
and i i promise you guys that

1205
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:42,799
anything you could ever purchase you

1206
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,880
could spend thousands of dollars there's

1207
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,200
no way you're ever gonna get uh what's

1208
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,358
coming out of those worms what ratio are

1209
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:50,719
you using in your soil mix do you mind

1210
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:52,559
me asking

1211
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:54,639
for the like for

1212
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,239
the 20 gallons i'm growing plants in

1213
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:58,318
yeah like you do 20 gallon what's your

1214
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,639
ratio of worm castings going into that

1215
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:02,239
soil mix yeah so i i actually don't

1216
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:03,759
really start off that that much with

1217
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,239
them because i want them to break down

1218
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,000
that sphagnum but i do top feed so i

1219
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:09,598
will probably

1220
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,280
you know i don't even really use like an

1221
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,519
exact percentage but i would imagine so

1222
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,200
you're growing you're growing inside of

1223
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:18,159
the castings you're just that's that's

1224
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:20,799
your growing medium 100 percent

1225
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:23,279
not all castings i'm using sphagnum peat

1226
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,160
moss as really the base i'm using rice

1227
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,560
holes uh okay i'm using pumice uh for

1228
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:30,879
aeration but in reality what am i really

1229
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:32,880
using i'm using worms

1230
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,240
are you doing biochar at all do you have

1231
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,240
anything

1232
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:38,639
so for you guys that don't know as well

1233
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:41,199
um i got picked up for on everflux

1234
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:42,960
technologies um i'm a vp of soil

1235
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:44,239
sciences so we're working hard with

1236
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,079
those guys to create really good

1237
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:48,719
products and one of the products that i

1238
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,880
am testing is a

1239
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:53,039
bioflex that's actually inoculated onto

1240
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,160
biochar uh so i've actually added that

1241
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:57,759
nice worm bins um and of course

1242
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:00,559
as long as you don't use too much

1243
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,119
biochar it is fantastic but again with

1244
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:04,960
anything in life right too much is is a

1245
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,720
bad thing

1246
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,039
and when it comes to growing

1247
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,598
less is always better that was one of

1248
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:13,759
the things i learned when i was growing

1249
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:16,880
aeroponically i was using house and

1250
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,560
garden back in the day and we were using

1251
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,559
the full nutrient strength and i

1252
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:22,719
remember there was this um

1253
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:25,119
it was called overgrow i think this is

1254
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,719
like so long ago it was like the only

1255
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,200
place where people would openly talk

1256
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:31,118
about grown weed

1257
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:32,399
where i felt like they were you know

1258
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,000
people were really trying to help each

1259
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,680
other and

1260
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,880
this aeroponic system this guy was like

1261
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:39,039
well hey man you know if you're having

1262
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,599
that those that big of issue just cut

1263
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:44,480
the nutrients back like dial it back in

1264
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,400
half and you know myself and the guy i

1265
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,199
was growing with at the time we never

1266
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,480
thought of that right right

1267
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,639
you know and we were new growers i think

1268
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,559
we were only maybe maybe eight months in

1269
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,719
at that that's right so we're

1270
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:58,480
yeah and the funny part is we thought we

1271
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,879
knew we thought we

1272
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,318
we had the best we're using you know the

1273
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,640
shooting powders and all these things

1274
00:43:02,318 --> 00:43:06,480
that cost a lot of money and um for

1275
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:08,639
anybody that's that's thinking about

1276
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,358
growing cannabis that never has i assure

1277
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:14,480
you that just the simple cheap

1278
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:15,519
um you know clean don't use guanos and

1279
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,280
stuff that's

1280
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:19,358
i joke around that that's like saying

1281
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,079
like um you know you're

1282
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:21,838
you're

1283
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:24,480
your ipod or something like that you

1284
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:26,480
know your cd player like that's not

1285
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,920
guanos aren't really um where it's at

1286
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,159
anymore um

1287
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,240
and it's a mind material

1288
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:33,118
yeah and and i know sphagnum isn't you

1289
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,879
know

1290
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,880
it's not the best material either but

1291
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:42,000
if somebody could tell me a better uh a

1292
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:43,838
better oh you know what i did you did

1293
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,920
you pay attention to leighton's did you

1294
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:48,078
watch his uh interview yet

1295
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,559
dude he's representing this uh company

1296
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:52,160
that's doing a post-consumer uh

1297
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:53,599
cardboard product that you need to know

1298
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:58,719
about i want to get some in your hands

1299
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:59,920
to play with sweet it is pretty

1300
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:02,318
well that's what i'm talking about if we

1301
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,480
could just have this little network of

1302
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:06,960
yeah people that want to help each other

1303
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,159
um that's really been my

1304
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,159
mo in colorado since day one of

1305
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:13,440
not being underground anymore

1306
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,480
exactly

1307
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,639
we're revolutionizing everything just by

1308
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,400
being cooperative and letting the plant

1309
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,239
show us the weight

1310
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:23,760
yeah

1311
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:26,000
i love you i love what you're doing

1312
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,599
there brian so you've got your so how

1313
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,440
many been how long did it take you to

1314
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,039
get your bins going and how many do you

1315
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,000
have again

1316
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:34,800
um

1317
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,920
i have i just have one really big red

1318
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,760
wiggler bin okay because in reality i

1319
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,680
use so many of those red wigglers i just

1320
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,760
scrape from the top and move them around

1321
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,279
that you don't really need a lot of that

1322
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,920
but i i have

1323
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,079
more bins for the al or georgia jumper

1324
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,639
alabama jumpers and the african night

1325
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,599
crawlers those are really the two that i

1326
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:57,519
personally feel like

1327
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,519
really get the job done you know i've

1328
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,838
grown for many many years with just a

1329
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:04,800
red wiggler and it definitely my plants

1330
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:08,000
looked great but having these four

1331
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,000
in conjunction um and having them that

1332
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,599
real biodiversity that you helped me

1333
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
inoculate with

1334
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,000
i appreciate you it's really what is

1335
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,039
really what you know i'm i'm running

1336
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,400
with right now and i'm sure other people

1337
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,599
have seen like you can go out into the

1338
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,119
woods and you can mycelium hunt and

1339
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:27,039
you know you don't have to go and spend

1340
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,599
all this money on um

1341
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:31,519
you know some of these nutrients that

1342
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:33,280
are really bogus

1343
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,759
and that's why actually i was working

1344
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,240
for everflux is because they're they're

1345
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,440
using organic ingredients and it's a way

1346
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:43,118
to speed up that soil life

1347
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,800
so for you guys that kind of want to

1348
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,280
learn more about that please dm me on

1349
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,359
that um i appreciate those guys because

1350
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,880
um they're behind me on doing a lot of

1351
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:53,598
this educational things and there's a

1352
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,720
lot of stuff behind the scenes uh in

1353
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,480
these next few months that are going to

1354
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:58,480
be coming out um so i'm really they're

1355
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,079
doing transitional work with larger

1356
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,240
farmers too so for people who are

1357
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,960
interested in scaling up like

1358
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,799
it's definitely an industry leader in um

1359
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,039
helping us transition

1360
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,400
yeah and uh the product was created in

1361
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:13,358
california

1362
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,599
it's tried and true on um a bunch of it

1363
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:17,759
works on over 250 different uh

1364
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,519
agricultural crops

1365
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,280
so it's obviously a product that is

1366
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:23,199
feeds the soil if it's working with that

1367
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,200
many different things um so i encourage

1368
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:26,879
you guys to check that out or you know

1369

1372
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:34,318
products you could you could really use

1373
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:36,960
uh everflux bio you know the bioflex the

1374

sorry

1377
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,839
uh tina's uh i had teraflex on the mind

1378
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:45,519
uh

1379
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:47,519
penis fuzzy balls

1380
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:50,480
okay and uh really start to play with

1381
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:52,239
that and kind of see you know that's

1382
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,440
we would love to hear what you have to

1383
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:55,679
say with that because we're

1384
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,400
experimenting all the time um and tina

1385
00:46:55,679 --> 00:47:00,879
and i are starting to exchange notes and

1386
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,400
we're just excited to

1387
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,400
you know hopefully with this cover thing

1388
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,680
maybe we we end up really do having a

1389
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,680
community where

1390
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:09,039
um we are able to stay in touch more

1391
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,039
because i know when we would have those

1392
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:12,639
live events it was like once a month um

1393
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,079
and we would kind of lose touch for that

1394
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:16,159
month and then you know not everybody

1395
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:17,760
can make it but now that

1396
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:21,358
everybody's kind of forced to use

1397
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:25,280
technology yeah i feel like all right

1398
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:27,279
it's kind of a thing with instagram

1399
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,240
there's trade-offs for being real-time

1400
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,640
spontaneous but i feel like it tests our

1401
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:34,639
like resilience

1402
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:36,558
yeah it definitely tests uh your brain

1403
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:40,078
power being able to recall everything uh

1404
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:42,800
live like this so yeah it's fun it's fun

1405
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,960
stuff man okay so we've got so we were

1406
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,039
doing a shout out to i want to try some

1407
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,199
of that paraflex

1408
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:51,759
yeah i have some uh just you know you

1409
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,519
know where i live i know where you live

1410
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,400
we need to visit and do some chatting

1411
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:57,838
about

1412
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,119
next next event next next happening

1413
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:01,599
and yeah i do want to hear from

1414
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:04,960
everybody if anyone has people that we

1415
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:07,039
that they want to hear from

1416
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,519
yeah we can bring together

1417
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:11,199
i i feel like between you and me and

1418
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:13,679
then the people we know

1419
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:15,679
that also know people yeah

1420
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:17,759
we could we could reach out to uh

1421
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:19,118
probably a pretty good majority of of

1422
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,240
the people that

1423
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:22,960
you know you guys would probably be

1424
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:25,279
interested in hearing from and uh yeah

1425
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,880
um like i said we

1426
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,720
we're really working behind the scenes

1427
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,079
for this educational thing and if cody

1428
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:32,000
wouldn't have happened there would have

1429
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:34,480
been a lot more of these live events and

1430
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,760
a lot of big things going on so maybe

1431
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,440
not for 2020 uh but we definitely still

1432
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,599
have big big plans and hopefully we can

1433
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,599
do it in the fall or the winter yeah

1434
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,680
let's just do it let's go let's do a

1435
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,640
let's do a consortium of sorts and get

1436
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:49,440
some

1437
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:51,199
get some um yeah let's do it i want i

1438
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,720
want to do it yeah look at this african

1439
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,879
night crawler

1440
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:56,879
you're crazy there

1441
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,800
wow

1442
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,599
hungry little things okay i'm definitely

1443
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,119
getting worms from you i'm happy about

1444
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,800
that so when you say that i give you an

1445
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:06,960
inoculation are you talking about that

1446
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,400
little bit from my weird orange bin of

1447
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,838
insects

1448
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,880
uh you gave them are you talking about

1449
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:15,199
gave me soil and then clothing yeah

1450
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,358
and you like right okay

1451
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:19,519
yeah all the things were in it now did

1452
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:22,400
you get a good healthy population of the

1453
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:24,400
mites and the everything from that i did

1454
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:25,920
and i got um something that i've never

1455
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,838
really seen a

1456
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,920
like an abundance of and it's this thing

1457
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:32,400
called orbital mite i don't know if

1458
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:35,838
you're just starting researching that

1459
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:38,160
um so your stuff was like crazy with

1460
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:41,599
that and when i put it into

1461
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:43,358
one of my uh worm bins they went nuts um

1462
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,480
so obviously you don't want them

1463
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:48,639
abundant but i just uh put like a piece

1464
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,480
of watermelon and they were attracted to

1465
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:52,639
that and then i would just take them and

1466
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,559
then go down the line for each worm bin

1467
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,719
you know as the days go by

1468
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,720
keep inoculating so yes i was able to

1469
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:02,558
inoculate everything that you saw in my

1470
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:03,759
basement from your uh inoculation so

1471
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:07,040
you know for people out there that are

1472
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:09,280
watching that that is and it's just time

1473
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:10,800
and i guess yeah skill set right i mean

1474
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,800
i i know the things that are going to

1475
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,720
speed up

1476
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,640
populations and you know i was talking

1477
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:19,118
about that avocado tech stuff if you

1478
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:20,318
guys really uh truly use that um there's

1479
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,480
a reason why

1480
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:24,400
that really took off on instagram and

1481
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:27,519
social media is because it works and

1482
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:29,358
then once you see uh for yourself that

1483
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:30,960
you don't have to go out there and buy

1484
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:32,400
ten thousand worms right you can just go

1485
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:35,838
out there and buy a thousand maybe two

1486
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:38,240
thousand maybe 40 50 bucks at most

1487
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:39,920
maybe a little bit more uh

1488
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:42,558
but then once you have them that's the

1489
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:44,400
beauty of it is uh using the avocado

1490
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,240
tech now you just really need three

1491
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,280
months and then as soon as you have that

1492
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:48,879
three months you've doubled that

1493
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,200
population and now you're off to the

1494
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,200
races now you can um

1495
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:55,199
take that avocado with all of those

1496
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:56,000
worms that you've you know got in there

1497
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:57,679
and

1498
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,358
i assure you a bunch of those are now

1499
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:03,199
pregnant and you can take that and

1500
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:04,960
inoculate in a into another worm bin and

1501
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:07,199
avocados are pretty cheap

1502
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,838
i know some people that that feel like

1503
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:11,598
you don't need to use organic

1504
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:13,039
i personally feel like you do when

1505
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:15,599
you're talking about a couple dollars

1506
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:17,519
there when it comes to an avocado on a

1507
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,559
larger scale i still feel like it's

1508
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:20,079
worth it

1509
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,280
because you're not potentially adding

1510
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,519
anything and if you're on a commercial

1511
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,280
level why would you ever add anything

1512
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,519
that you could potentially get popped

1513
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,280
for and then ruin your reputation or

1514
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:30,639
your brand or something like that when

1515
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,119
you were trying still trying to do the

1516
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:34,960
right thing you just got cheap and went

1517
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:36,640
cheap on avocados so

1518
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,639
for you guys that don't know

1519
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:40,799
for anything organic it will always have

1520
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:42,078
a nine in front of it um

1521
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,119
so if you're not sure like if you're

1522
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,318
walking in your grocery store and they

1523
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,240
have avocados over here they have

1524
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:48,000
avocados over there uh which ones are

1525
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:50,000
organic the one with the nine in front

1526
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,318
of it will always be organic that's good

1527
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,280
to know i didn't realize that

1528
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:56,480
yeah

1529
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:58,400
cool full of tips today tina i know

1530
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,960
so i'm still for some reason i'm still

1531
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,519
not visualizing this process so you've

1532
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,400
got your bins that are basically your

1533
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:05,599
worm

1534
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,318
bins that you're feeding and your

1535
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,480
bunnies pooping on top of now how do you

1536
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:13,440
transition that to having plants and

1537
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,519
cover crops in there like what's your

1538
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,358
process do you then take that very pot

1539
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:18,559
and move it somewhere else and plant it

1540
00:52:17,358 --> 00:52:21,119
or are you

1541
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:23,200
using some of that and creating um your

1542
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,039
situation somewhere else

1543
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:27,519
i'm always building up so like if i'm

1544
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:30,239
first starting a worm bin yes the

1545
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:31,199
majority of it's going to be cardboard

1546
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:33,439
okay

1547
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:35,118
brown right so anytime i add anything

1548
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,920
green especially when it comes to like

1549
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:39,920
cannabis farming i add brown to it so

1550
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:41,599
i'll add if i'm adding green there's

1551
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,920
still a little brown in there and if i'm

1552
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,079
adding brown it's just all brown i hope

1553
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,760
that makes it nice yeah that makes sense

1554
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:49,680
because you don't want too much green in

1555
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,599
there otherwise uh you can have

1556
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:53,679
potential like uh

1557
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:56,318
issue bug issues fungus gnats and stuff

1558
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:57,838
and i really minimized the like fruits

1559
00:52:56,318 --> 00:53:00,239
and vegetables and all that stuff i mean

1560
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:01,920
i know it's great and uh you know well

1561
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:04,799
you're feeding those to your bunny right

1562
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,960
yes yes but also at the same time like

1563
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,318
if i can't really bury it down i will i

1564
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,240
guess sometimes throw that in the

1565
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:11,519
backyard for like the wild bunnies and

1566
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:13,039
stuff

1567
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:15,920
because i love for them to come and poop

1568
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:18,318
on my my yard in the back

1569
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,838
but the ones downstairs i found that if

1570
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:21,920
i really keep it where i'm feeding the

1571
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:23,759
worms the the bunny poop and then i'm

1572
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:27,039
giving them actually like a worm chow

1573
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,960
that i buy from a girl off etsy i found

1574
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:30,239
that not only are the worms fatter and

1575
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,400
healthier and everything seems but

1576
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:35,838
there's not really any more of those bug

1577
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,680
issues because the in my opinion it's

1578
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:39,599
because the road beetles just take off

1579
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:41,679
dramatically right and then once you

1580
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:43,760
have i mean the other day i saw one that

1581
00:53:41,679 --> 00:53:46,719
was like no lie like this long i've

1582
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:49,200
never seen a rope beetle that long wow

1583
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:51,118
um and so i think

1584
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:53,199
you know this stuff is kind of creating

1585
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,960
the utopias and the the rogue beetles

1586
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:57,358
that i'm seeing that are extremely large

1587
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:01,280
are the ones i put your bokoshi balls in

1588
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:03,358
that's hilarious who knows who knows

1589
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,119
i'll have insight onto that very soon i

1590
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:06,639
want to show that ben real quick well i

1591
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:08,720
want to do two things i want to show you

1592
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:10,639
the soil that this someone just

1593
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:12,879
helpfully put in the comments that it's

1594
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:15,039
called pit um i want to show it to you

1595
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,519
but i want to also bring this bin over

1596
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:19,358
and show

1597
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:22,079
this thing so this

1598
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:23,119
so here's the bin right

1599
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:25,839
and

1600
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,838
let's do this

1601
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:31,599
help

1602
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:33,838
so

1603
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,838
there's what i gave brian a little

1604
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:37,440
sample of this stuff

1605
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:39,599
so then

1606
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,679
this is where the ball is

1607
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,838
and as you dig in

1608
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:46,798
there's just all kinds of

1609
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:48,400
life in there oop something flew

1610
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:50,639
so yeah anyway just thought they'd give

1611
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,838
people something to look at

1612
00:54:50,639 --> 00:54:56,078
in reference to what i gave you

1613
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:57,358
uh big hair poppy i'm i'm also

1614
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,359
cultivating

1615
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:02,239
uh these springtails i don't know if you

1616
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:02,239
saw them earlier

1617
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:06,880
yeah

1618
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:08,480
uh but these are just uh really they're

1619
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,960
i guess really well known in like the

1620
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:13,599
reptile bavarian world um they're known

1621
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,280
for just a cleanup crew

1622
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,039
so what i use them for is if you can get

1623
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,880
a ton of them to

1624
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:20,400
i would imagine it's probably millions

1625
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,079
of them but

1626
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,039
back in the day when i would begin to

1627
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,519
water

1628
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:27,199
my plants you would see it actually

1629
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:29,199
almost look like snow

1630
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:30,879
over the entire area that i had just

1631
00:55:29,199 --> 00:55:33,039
watered and it was all the springtails

1632
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,920
that had just come up and then once that

1633
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:36,798
water

1634
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,480
kind of goes down into your soil those

1635
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:40,159
springtails kind of come back down as

1636
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,079
well and then they just take off

1637
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:44,798
breaking everything down so like as

1638
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,240
you're watering every two three days uh

1639
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:49,199
you're just really increasing that

1640
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:50,959
springtail population i do have a uh a

1641
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:52,719
secret for you guys there's this stuff

1642
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,400
called morning wood

1643
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:56,719
um

1644
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,960
that i use uh you can get it it's like

1645
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:01,439
uh i think the brand name is like

1646
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,639
ropashi and i apologize if that's not

1647
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,720
correct uh

1648
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:05,920
morning wood morning

1649
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:08,318
yes

1650
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,720
quite the name there but that that green

1651
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:13,199
stuff there is the the morning wood and

1652
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:14,959
the isopods absolutely love this so you

1653
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:17,598
can go and get

1654
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,039
just one of these little uh

1655
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,760
i think this costs like seven dollars

1656
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:23,759
and fifty cents uh they put them um in

1657
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,559
charcoal and then i just put that

1658
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,000
morning wood in with the charcoal mix

1659
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:29,680
and then i let them sit for maybe like a

1660
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,280
week or two and you'll have

1661
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:33,679
you'll have more springtails than you

1662
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:36,000
than you can imagine and um

1663
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:37,440
you can then take them uh i might not be

1664
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,199
able to show this

1665
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,280
but you can basically like there's water

1666
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:44,639
on the bottom and then i just take

1667
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:46,720
right right to the edge right where the

1668
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:48,480
water will right to that edge and then

1669
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:50,719
the springtail so if you get them where

1670
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,519
they all bunch up they'll just basically

1671
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:55,039
jump out of the water into the pots and

1672
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:58,559
then you can literally just walk down

1673
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:59,838
the line um and put them in the pots and

1674
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,599
if you need to

1675
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:03,039
move worms and that kind of stuff

1676
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,720
throughout your garden

1677
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:07,358
again the avocado tech is how you do

1678
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:09,838
that every single worm is going to be

1679
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:12,000
attracted to that avocado so if you have

1680
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:13,759
like a you know i would set up if you're

1681
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,679
gonna do the four worms i would have

1682
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,240
four different bins that you're using

1683
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:21,039
that in and then you can you can combine

1684
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:22,000
them as long as the bins are big

1685
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:23,519
right

1686
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,838
20 gallons

1687
00:57:23,519 --> 00:57:27,920
so if i'm uh if i'm really starting

1688
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:30,318
something new uh you would use the red

1689
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,000
wigglers the african night crawlers for

1690
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:33,838
i see there's some new people coming in

1691
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,159
yeah african nightcrawlers european

1692
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:38,480
nightcrawlers and the georgia jumpers

1693
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:41,118
and if you use those four in a symbiotic

1694
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,679
relationship you won't really have any

1695
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,680
issues growing cannabis

1696
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,440
as you as you progress you know

1697
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:50,480
obviously continue to educate yourself

1698
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:54,240
but if you really understand worms and

1699
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:56,559
you understand adding the springtails um

1700
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:58,879
that's really the secret um and the

1701
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:59,680
bunny poop is what in

1702
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,160
is

1703
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:02,960
for me is really my secret is that's

1704
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:04,159
what's

1705
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,838
um

1706
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:07,118
really adding that calcium and adding

1707
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:09,199
that sulfur

1708
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,798
in a very organic way

1709
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:13,519
and then

1710
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:16,880
you know using um

1711
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:19,358
using ipm type stuff with uh predatory

1712
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:22,480
insects i love having praying mantis

1713
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:24,318
whether i have bug problems or not um

1714
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,000
and in reality i love seeing praying

1715
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:29,119
mantis eating each other because that

1716
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,519
means i don't have uh pest issues right

1717
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:33,440
that's very interesting yeah

1718
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:35,119
so those things are again you know you

1719
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,720
got to be proactive with all this stuff

1720
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:39,039
it takes probably two to three weeks for

1721
00:58:36,719 --> 00:58:41,519
those praying matches to hatch

1722
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:43,119
but once they do hatch and they go

1723
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:44,559
through their life cycle they'll be

1724
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,318
brown at the beginning and they kind of

1725
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:48,079
work the soil if you will and kind of

1726
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:50,159
the bottom of the stems

1727
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:51,599
then they start to turn um kind of like

1728
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:53,358
a light green

1729
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:54,880
uh they'll kind of work the stem they

1730
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:56,558
then turn pink

1731
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,000
um and then they kind of hide more and

1732
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,839
they're you know this i feel like that's

1733
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,318
when they get their like

1734
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:04,558
ninja skills and then once they're fully

1735
00:59:02,318 --> 00:59:06,558
green and fully established they will go

1736
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:08,640
to the top of the plants kind of like

1737
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:11,200
the brown ones do when they're babies

1738
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:12,558
and brown they have more um

1739
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:15,039
confidence i guess but once they're

1740
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:17,040
fully grown they will guard that plant

1741
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:19,119
like almost like a guard dog

1742
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:20,639
at least in an indoor setting

1743
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,480
and i will you know sometimes you have

1744
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:24,159
to kind of help the garden but if i see

1745
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,079
two of them on a plant i'm more than

1746
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:27,519
likely they probably will fight so i'll

1747
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,960
just move them to the other side of the

1748
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:31,119
garden

1749
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:34,159
and i feel like that is just another way

1750
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,039
where you guys can be proactive

1751
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:38,719
and

1752
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:41,838
i know that uh we used to use ladybugs

1753
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:44,239
and i think it was

1754
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:46,480
keep it simple organics

1755
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:48,239
tad heusey who just wrote an article

1756
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,480
about all that stuff i encourage you

1757
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:52,318
guys to read that um

1758
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:54,318
we've now moved on from ladybugs and now

1759
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:56,400
we use green lacewings i think those are

1760
00:59:54,318 --> 00:59:58,400
fantastic if you guys have ever used

1761
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,720
ladybugs you know that uh they usually

1762
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,559
just pump each other um and then fall

1763
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:03,919
over and kind of like wiggle like this

1764
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,079
and die

1765
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,039
so they're not really uh effective i

1766
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,400
mean

1767
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,558
the only time i've really seen them

1768
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,639
effective is that they would feed the

1769
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,559
praying mantis

1770
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:16,960
when there was no bugs around that's

1771
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:19,119
hilarious well only the larvae eat uh

1772
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:20,960
pests anyway

1773
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:22,640
yeah if you could ladies bugs don't do

1774
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:24,559
anything i don't think you can or i

1775
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:27,358
don't know of a place where you can uh

1776
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,720
buy the larvae but if you could that's

1777
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:30,318
they look like little like orange

1778
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:31,679
spotted alligators

1779
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:35,039
and they bite

1780
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:36,399
oh do they i didn't know yes they do

1781
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:38,239
it's painful

1782
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,480
okay so here's that stuff i wanted to

1783
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:42,959
show you the pit moss

1784
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:45,838
this is the stuff i'm gonna get you some

1785
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:48,000
sample of for you to try so it's

1786
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:49,759
it's really like

1787
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,199
it's all

1788
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,839
cardboard

1789
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:55,598
awesome it's like a post-consumer thing

1790
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:56,639
your company should be all about this

1791
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,240
stuff

1792
01:00:56,639 --> 01:00:59,838
so we'll get all the cardboard that

1793
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:02,318
would be a way better mix than the

1794
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:04,239
stagnant for the worm bins yeah i mean

1795
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:05,519
i'm already putting it in there

1796
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:10,838
yeah they've got two different things

1797
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:10,838
they've got this cocoa mix pit moss

1798
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:15,838
i'll make sure you get some of that

1799
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:18,078
all right uh would i recommend cow

1800
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:19,679
manure um

1801
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:21,359
uh yeah

1802
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:22,719
i don't

1803
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:25,440
i i wouldn't

1804
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:26,959
nope i know there's malibu compost out

1805
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,079
of california

1806
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,760
that

1807
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,798
for the most part you know i used to use

1808
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,000
their stuff

1809
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:34,480
and then

1810
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,039
something happened like there was

1811
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:39,358
i had like a major problem and i started

1812
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:40,239
asking people and they they have major

1813
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:41,920
issues

1814
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:43,838
and that's what i mean that's why i feel

1815
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,039
like a lot of us that have continued to

1816
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:47,838
talk about things that's why we're

1817
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:48,719
getting away from the guanos and

1818
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:49,679
the

1819
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:51,519
like

1820
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:52,879
other than the alpaca and the rabbit

1821
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:54,159
really getting away from any of the

1822
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,838
manures

1823
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:58,078
and knowing where your stuff is coming

1824
01:01:55,838 --> 01:02:00,239
from know your farmer know know your

1825
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,920
environment keep it local

1826
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:02,879
you know start to act like a natural

1827
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,280
farmer

1828
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:09,519
and every your medicine is where you you

1829
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:11,200
are yeah i put in a semi-truck load of

1830
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:13,599
manure that was supposed to be organic

1831
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:15,598
into my outdoor garden and

1832
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:17,359
something like you just said something

1833
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:20,000
happened there was something in there

1834
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:22,798
and it literally took me three years to

1835
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,519
get back to even a level of normal

1836
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:25,440
yeah

1837
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:26,880
so i don't know what was in there but it

1838
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,960
wasn't good

1839
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:32,960
and i think that only comes from

1840
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:35,199
like dairy cows so to minimize that just

1841
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,480
don't put it in your bits right don't

1842
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:39,279
even do it

1843
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:41,280
yeah and then again like

1844
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:43,440
if you're not sure about a product just

1845
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,000
run it through your worm bins or like oh

1846
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:47,440
true just always throw it in worms or

1847
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
you know put some castings in there get

1848
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:52,240
some microbiology going on in there and

1849
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,159
kind of see how things work out

1850
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:56,639
yeah tried and true things are really

1851
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:58,000
like just simple ingredients um you know

1852
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:59,440
like i said i was using that sphagnum

1853
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,639
maybe now it's you know just a little

1854
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:05,039
bit of that pit moss using some

1855
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:07,358
pumice

1856
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:10,160
and the rice holes and then adding some

1857
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:12,639
of that um you know worm castings from

1858
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:14,838
an old bin and then just moving on down

1859
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:17,920
the line and as long as you have some

1860
01:03:14,838 --> 01:03:20,239
time you can build an entire basement

1861
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:22,798
full of stuff you know with

1862
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:25,519
a hundred dollars worth of expense i

1863
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:28,079
mean it's it's really really minimal

1864
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:29,920
as long as you have the time i mean and

1865
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:31,760
you know it does take 90 days like i

1866
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:34,159
said and that you know

1867
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:36,160
quarter of a year is a long time but

1868
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:38,000
uh if you're growing cannabis you

1869
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:40,239
already kind of are used to that

1870
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,760
schedule anyway so get some worm bins

1871
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:43,598
going and just mess around with it and

1872
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:45,200
see what you guys uh

1873
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:46,160
you know how you guys feel about certain

1874
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:48,639
things

1875
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:51,038
yeah this avocado tech outdoors i don't

1876
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:53,440
think that would work uh mainly because

1877
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,200
most of the worms outdoors

1878
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:57,039
are earthworms

1879
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:59,519
but try and see

1880
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:02,240
yeah the trick i've always just used

1881
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:04,880
with composting worms and um

1882
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:07,118
it works fantastic

1883
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:09,119
so brian are you using any k f

1884
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:10,880
applications on your plants in addition

1885
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:13,119
to your

1886
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:16,000

1887
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:16,880

in my opinion and uh they gave us a

1955
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:41,358
really healthy lunch and then yeah

1956

1958
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:48,798
we got to run down the alleyway

1959
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:51,599
yeah downtown that was crazy

1960
01:06:48,798 --> 01:06:54,798
quick story this lady uh that was a

1961
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:56,720
bartender she said uh oh you guys uh you

1962
01:06:54,798 --> 01:06:59,038
guys can smoke some cannabis that's okay

1963
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:00,879
and she let us go into this back area

1964
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:02,880
and so i think there was like four or

1965
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,119
five of us and we just started pumping

1966
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:07,039
tough and she came back there almost

1967
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:09,280
sprinting she was like i didn't know you

1968
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:11,280
guys would be smoking like this she

1969
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:14,960
started freaking out so we had to go out

1970
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,960
in the alley and everything and

1971
01:07:15,838 --> 01:07:19,679
longer story so we we found an exit

1972
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:21,599
route like

1973
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:24,558
and ended up in the alley talking to

1974
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:27,119
preston and then uh came back in only to

1975
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,640
learn that like we had set this trend

1976
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:31,519
like every

1977
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:33,679
natural farmer was like migrating down

1978
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:34,960
to the basement and they were like

1979
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:36,719
there are all these stories emerging

1980
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:39,358
like oh my god and we're like really

1981
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:43,558
really that happened

1982
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:43,558
we weren't there we no

1983
01:07:49,838 --> 01:07:52,639

2004
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:44,479
rules

2005
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:47,199
we don't uh we don't wear masks in here

2006

or anything can i come visit soon and we

2007
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:50,479
hash out some of these details of this

2008
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,279
larger consortium we're gonna put

2009
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:55,759
together

2010
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:58,560
uh what do you mean could i go over

2011
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:58,560
like what they do

2012
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:02,678
big haired poppy

2013
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:10,000
doesn't quite turn into castings but you

2014
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:12,000
know what um

2015
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,719
uh but other things will break that down

2016
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:16,560
eventually right

2017
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:19,039
yeah and don't you think like i feel

2018
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,719
like it has some kind i'm really looking

2019
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:22,798
because i'm doing the work with the clay

2020
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:24,399
stuff like the biochar

2021
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:26,158
ends up having this kind of

2022
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:27,358
electrochemical

2023
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:29,679
effect

2024
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:31,679
there's kind of a field that's getting

2025
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:34,560
established through this

2026
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:37,199
material that sort of helps everything

2027
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,199
communicate

2028
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,520
absolutely

2029
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:45,278
so i feel like the ec is affected by

2030
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:47,520
biochar in interesting ways

2031
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:50,159
so breeding is with composting worms

2032
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:52,640
breeding is really the same thing um

2033
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:54,399
you know the goal is the avocado tech

2034
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,719
and to make sure that they always have

2035
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:57,839
enough food and that doesn't necessarily

2036
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:00,719
have to be

2037
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,600
like fruits and vegetables

2038
01:10:00,719 --> 01:10:03,600
you know

2039
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,280
contrary to common belief the worms

2040
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,520
aren't really eating the cardboard or

2041
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:09,679
eating the fruit they're eating the

2042
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:12,719
bacteria that's building on the fruit

2043
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:14,960
and the cardboard so as long as the

2044
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:16,719
there's enough food there

2045
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,719
they they really can just do their own

2046
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:21,760
thing and as long as you're using uh

2047
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:23,439
like an uh fabric pot um

2048
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,640
you know i've tried this before when i

2049
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:26,639
was using

2050
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,560
um like plastic bands and there's this

2051
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,640
thing that we tried called a worm bin or

2052
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,760
a worm in that would you know you could

2053
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:33,520
put it no

2054
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,520
like the castings would come down but it

2055
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,760
was always this mess and

2056
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,800
i found that you know using that 100

2057
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,320
gallon

2058
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,159
fabric pot

2059
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:44,639
is really the biggest i can do for my

2060
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:45,679
basement because i mostly do this all

2061
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,000
myself

2062
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:49,359
and 100 gallon uh i mean that thing is

2063
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,520
huge

2064
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:54,158
so i can like i can move it but i can't

2065
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:55,840
like really move it around too much um

2066
01:10:54,158 --> 01:10:57,439
and so once i have that it's kind of

2067
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:00,880
like stable

2068
01:10:57,439 --> 01:11:02,719
there and now my goal is really just to

2069
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:04,719
add food

2070
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:07,600
really get the biology

2071
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:10,239
up and start that cover crop because in

2072
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:12,480
my opinion worm farming is goes to the

2073
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:15,039
next level when you're using a cover

2074
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:17,279
crop and almost anybody that you see on

2075
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:19,279
like youtube or showing how to do worm

2076
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:21,439
farming they all they're always using

2077
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:22,880
like cardboard to cover it or a burlap

2078
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:26,238
sack

2079
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:28,719
which which which works right but again

2080
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:32,000
worms like uh the rhizosphere the the

2081
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:34,158
roots right and yeah

2082
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,319
dr laningham teaches everybody that the

2083
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:38,879
roots communicate with the microbes to

2084
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:41,279
something called exudates and so when

2085
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:43,359
she's giving off those exudates she's

2086
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:46,479
attracting all of these different

2087
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:48,158
microbes uh to her little area well

2088
01:11:46,479 --> 01:11:50,079
we're not able to attract those so we

2089
01:11:48,158 --> 01:11:52,399
have to actually add those as like a top

2090
01:11:50,079 --> 01:11:55,920
feed but once everything starts to build

2091
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:58,799
into that now cannabis farming is easy

2092
01:11:55,920 --> 01:12:01,119
and uh i will say that i um

2093
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:03,679
right before i was uh on the adam dunn

2094
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:04,719
show this one time i met uh soma's

2095
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:06,000
daughter

2096
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:08,239
and

2097
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,399
and i think her boyfriend and they were

2098
01:12:08,238 --> 01:12:12,479
all talking about how they grow cannabis

2099
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:13,839
uh in a living soil

2100
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:15,279
and they were also talking about how

2101
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,119
they believe that

2102
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:19,840
cannabis as a plant on a like a

2103
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:22,559
metaphysical level

2104
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:24,960
uh knows that cannabis has grown in that

2105
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:27,360
soil beforehand so i have no idea if

2106
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:29,119
that's true or not uh but

2107
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:30,719
i have noticed that

2108
01:12:29,119 --> 01:12:33,119
you know my clones when i put them in a

2109
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:35,760
living soil that's really you know been

2110
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:37,439
worked like let's say at least a year

2111
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,079
they perk right up and they get those

2112
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:42,319
praying leaves even at a clone stage um

2113
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:45,679
and i never achieved really that um

2114
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:48,639
growing cannabis on a synthetic so

2115
01:12:45,679 --> 01:12:50,719
that little there lets me know that

2116
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:52,800
you know the plant is you know when

2117
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:54,399
she's on when she has her prank leaves

2118
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,600
you need to pat yourself on the back as

2119
01:12:54,399 --> 01:12:57,119
a farmer because there's really nothing

2120
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,520
else you can do i mean she's there's

2121
01:12:57,119 --> 01:13:01,519
nothing else packed up she's happy she's

2122
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,000
getting ready right she's taking in

2123
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:05,920
sunlight and she's creating um

2124
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,238
photosynthesis and she is

2125
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,719
off to the races and as long as you

2126
01:13:08,238 --> 01:13:14,559
continue to build that soil

2127
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:16,079
um you know cannabis farming becomes

2128
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,039
not as hard as it seems when you first

2129
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:18,960
start out

2130
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:20,640
yeah you know i'm going to put a little

2131
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,840
two cents in there just because of what

2132
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,760
i've been learning a little bit there's

2133
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,920
a book called uh regenerate which i've

2134
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:28,400
been pushing for a couple weeks now

2135
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:30,158
sawyer g is the author and what i love

2136
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:33,599
about it is he goes into quite a bit of

2137
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:34,960
detail around rna and exactly what rna

2138
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,960
is

2139
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:38,719
in its function not only with our immune

2140
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:41,239
function but also a plant's immune

2141
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:43,679
functioning and so this

2142
01:13:41,238 --> 01:13:45,119
cross-generational talk the crosstalk

2143
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,440
that happens all the time but it also

2144
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:50,079
happens cross-generationally so

2145
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:52,238
a lot of what we're doing for

2146
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:53,920
uh our plants that then

2147
01:13:52,238 --> 01:13:55,678
succeed into the next generation whether

2148
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:59,440
through clone or seed

2149
01:13:55,679 --> 01:14:03,440
are having this rna conversation that is

2150
01:13:59,439 --> 01:14:06,559
trans mute it's transmitting

2151
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:08,879
just an immense amount of information

2152
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:10,719
so it's kind of he goes into a neat

2153
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:12,159
description about it and it's a nice

2154
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:14,560
understanding to have especially in this

2155
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:16,000
time of covid because our immune

2156
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,679
functions

2157
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,359
are different than i think what people

2158
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:21,279
understand and the more of us that can

2159
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:23,198
really understand this

2160
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:25,039
and understand it through the cannabis

2161
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:26,719
plant because it's operating there

2162
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:29,279
really well just like what you just said

2163
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,960
that it's you know they have this memory

2164
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:32,639
from generation to generation what kind

2165
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,920
of soils they've been grown in and it's

2166
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,560
the rna

2167
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:37,600
and the uh the roots like you know when

2168
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:39,920
um

2169
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,840
when a root dies i guess

2170
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,239
uh i learned this from minnesota nice i

2171
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,360
don't know if you guys know who that is

2172
01:14:44,238 --> 01:14:47,359
but

2173
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:49,839
the the new route supposedly can tap

2174
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:51,679
into the old route and basically take

2175
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,119
all that nutrition that the cannabis

2176
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:55,199
plant before it

2177
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:57,119
has taken up and then if the roots are

2178
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:58,719
old enough then obviously uh the

2179
01:14:57,119 --> 01:15:00,960
decomposers start to break those things

2180
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:03,279
down and that and that um obviously

2181
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:05,039
uh builds up in your soil and one joke

2182
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:07,039
that i learned from uh

2183
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:08,800
i think it was jeff lowenfeld's is you

2184
01:15:07,039 --> 01:15:11,279
know it's kind of like it's rough

2185
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:12,640
streets in in the microbial world right

2186
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:14,800
like there's no

2187
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,719
there's not really like a long life for

2188
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,800
microbes they're here and then they're

2189
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,960
dead and they're decomposed and then

2190
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:23,840
things quickly change so

2191
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:26,000
uh the biodiversity is king if you guys

2192
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:28,079
focus on that if you guys focus on the

2193
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,079
calcium and the sulfur for the flavors

2194
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:31,679
and the terps uh you'll be growing

2195
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:33,439
cannabis better than

2196
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:35,840
most of your peers

2197
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:38,479
wow so good

2198
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:41,199
uh yeah well the biochar would be uh

2199
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:43,678
still there and anytime i'm even making

2200
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:46,238
mix it's not complete worm castings i'm

2201
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:47,760
not uh like i'm not making worm castings

2202
01:15:46,238 --> 01:15:50,479
to sell or anything i'm just making worm

2203
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:52,880
castings to improve my uh overall grow

2204
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:54,639
and so it does have uh

2205
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,800
you know it's it's not as clean as and

2206
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:59,039
pure as just worm castings but i don't

2207
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,400
want it that way i like that there's a

2208
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:01,760
little bit of biochar in there i think

2209
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:03,279
that those are like

2210
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:05,039
almost like a little hotel if you will

2211
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:07,920
from microbes and they're able to like

2212
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:08,719
go on the the cracks and the crevices uh

2213
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,079
and

2214
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:14,239
multiply and you know um

2215
01:16:12,079 --> 01:16:16,800
this long again as long as you don't

2216
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:18,238
overdo it with the biochar it's fabulous

2217
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,960
if you overdo it with the biochar you're

2218
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:22,319
gonna have some serious problems

2219
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,920
put one of those

2220
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:25,840
put one of the fuzzy balls in my worm

2221
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:27,199
bin last week that was complete yes

2222
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:30,000
that's exactly what happened the same

2223
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:31,119
way jade uh i put i've actually put two

2224
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,520
of uh

2225
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:34,800
her fuzzy balls in my worm bin uh just

2226
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,400
with the red wigglers which actually

2227
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:40,079
don't eat as fast

2228
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:42,639
as the africans or uh europeans and they

2229
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:45,439
devoured it destroyed it and the beauty

2230
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:48,400
of that is all of a sudden i saw

2231
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:50,000
an unbelievable amount of road beetles

2232
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:51,920
so

2233
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,198
take that for what it is if if you're

2234
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:55,199
able to have rove beetles in there and

2235
01:16:53,198 --> 01:16:56,799
you put a bokashi ball in there and

2236
01:16:55,198 --> 01:16:59,198
you're able to get hundreds of rose

2237
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:00,560
beetle rove beetles uh that right there

2238
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:03,759
is probably worth

2239
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:05,600
200 i mean rove beetles are not cheap so

2240
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,280
interesting

2241
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:09,280
yeah and they're going to amplify any

2242
01:17:07,279 --> 01:17:12,559
anything that's in anything that they're

2243
01:17:09,279 --> 01:17:14,880
part of it's going to amplify the um

2244
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:17,120
that entropic level whatever it is and

2245
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:18,719
traffic level whatever it is it's there

2246
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:20,719
there's something in the they're

2247
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:23,679
producing something those facultative

2248
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:25,198
anaerobes are producing a terrestrial

2249
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:26,880
form of

2250
01:17:25,198 --> 01:17:28,079
chitin

2251
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,239
exactly

2252
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:32,238
and what does chitin do chitin makes the

2253
01:17:30,238 --> 01:17:34,718
plant think it's being attacked right

2254
01:17:32,238 --> 01:17:36,799
and so a plant can't run away from bugs

2255
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:39,359
so how does she improve herself well she

2256
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:41,760
improves the overall health and

2257
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:43,439
vigor of herself and chitin is one of

2258
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,039
the ways that we trick our plants into

2259
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:46,399
thinking that she's being attacked

2260
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:48,719
that's why if you guys have ever messed

2261
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:51,119
around with insect frass which actually

2262
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:53,119
is something that we use at everflux

2263
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:54,960
the plants are extremely healthy from

2264
01:17:53,119 --> 01:17:57,039
that alone because it's almost uh like a

2265
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:59,439
flu shot if you will

2266
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:02,238
they think they get attacked she grows

2267
01:17:59,439 --> 01:18:03,919
healthier um greener stronger and what

2268
01:18:02,238 --> 01:18:06,319
are exoskeletons made out of they're

2269
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:09,359
made out of chitin so that is a source

2270
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:11,359
for them to produce big-ass bugs

2271
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:13,439
that's right and you don't have to buy

2272
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:15,039
like super expensive stuff like you can

2273
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:17,279
get uh crickets

2274
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:19,359
online yeah and i would take uh dead

2275
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:21,840
crickets right i think i could buy like

2276
01:18:19,359 --> 01:18:23,599
a ridiculous amount of them for like

2277
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:26,239
i don't even know maybe 15 bucks 10 15

2278
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:28,640
bucks um and then i put them in a like

2279
01:18:26,238 --> 01:18:30,238
emulsifier like a magic bullet and i

2280
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:31,679
just grind them up

2281
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:34,158
um and that's

2282
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:37,199
basically insect fresh and it's probably

2283
01:18:34,158 --> 01:18:40,158
a tenth of of the cost so like i said

2284
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:41,759
there's there's many many ways and if we

2285
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:43,599
continue to have these talks tina i'd

2286
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:44,960
love to just continue to educate people

2287
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,039
because yes

2288
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,960
sometimes it takes months years to

2289
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:50,880
really understand all this stuff and

2290
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:52,399
know that like hey you can grind up

2291
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:54,880
qrikets and it's not gonna be a problem

2292
01:18:52,399 --> 01:18:56,799
you know before we all started educating

2293
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:58,880
each other there were little things that

2294
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:01,279
like i would be terrified back in the

2295
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:03,760
day to put a bunch of bugs into my even

2296
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:06,079
if they were dead into my growing medium

2297
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:08,159
right right because i well what happens

2298
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:09,840
if you know i just probably have silly

2299
01:19:08,158 --> 01:19:10,799
questions or silly thoughts of what

2300
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,679
would happen

2301
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,760
yeah

2302
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:15,840
once uh once you have that microbial

2303
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:18,480
life and you have the worms going on now

2304
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:20,319
you get to experiment now you might mess

2305
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:22,479
up but who cares throw some more worms

2306
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:24,238
in there throw a little uh worm castings

2307
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:26,158
on top

2308
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:28,079
so because the diversity ends up

2309
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:30,158
balancing out and it's you know when

2310
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:32,719
you're when you have a diversity that's

2311
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:35,439
inclusive of a lot of beneficials

2312
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:37,520
um it's not necessarily that your aim is

2313
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:39,759
to get rid of the bad ones it's just to

2314
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:42,080
overpopulate them with diversity and it

2315
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:44,400
really does balance itself out i mean

2316
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:46,640
nature wants to live nature wants to

2317
01:19:44,399 --> 01:19:48,000
thrive and nature thrives through

2318
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,719
abundance

2319
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,319
and the beauty of uh most beneficial

2320
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:54,640
insects whether they're in the soil or

2321
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:56,719
they're in the plant itself is they work

2322
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:59,119
in a symbiotic relationship with one

2323
01:19:56,719 --> 01:20:02,319
another uh it's usually the alphas they

2324
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:03,920
emerge that are the the problems so as

2325
01:20:02,319 --> 01:20:06,319
long as you know you got your green lace

2326
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:08,319
wings got your praying mantis up top uh

2327
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:10,079
you got your predatory mites

2328
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:12,399
um and then you got your rove beetles

2329
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:15,279
you got your uh i think it's skittimus

2330
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:16,879
now that h miles predatory mite um and

2331
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:18,960
your worms

2332
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,639
everything else just seems to pop and uh

2333
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,639
i think was the green bean asked the

2334
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:25,039
question how like best way to get

2335
01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:27,920
decomposers in your soil is to start off

2336
01:20:25,039 --> 01:20:31,039
with really high-end compost um get you

2337
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:33,920
know spent spend the money and get um

2338
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:36,319
you know some really quality compost uh

2339
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:39,119
i personally i used to work for a

2340
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:41,198
buffalo which was like a bison

2341
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:43,359
compost company and i had a bunch of

2342
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:46,079
that stuff so that's what i started with

2343
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:48,000
and it was amazing and and i feel like

2344
01:20:46,079 --> 01:20:51,519
maybe that was part of that secret too

2345
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:53,679
is that i was using uh bison compost

2346
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:55,440
at the time i was using malibu compost

2347
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:59,039
as well um

2348
01:20:55,439 --> 01:21:01,599
and i was using mushroom compost

2349
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:03,039
yeah i love that rabbit rabbit compost

2350
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:06,159
rabbit manure

2351
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:08,800
and i think that was it but again

2352
01:21:06,158 --> 01:21:10,479
as you progress as a farmer you start to

2353
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,639
notice like i don't want to add all

2354
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:15,039
those things right so you start to use

2355
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:16,880
less and less like i i used to be big on

2356
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:18,880
making all these teas and stuff i

2357
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,520
thought that was like fantastic right

2358
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:23,199
but as you progress in your thinking and

2359
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,800
and your workload and you really start

2360
01:21:23,198 --> 01:21:27,198
to think about labor and this is more

2361
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:29,119
even on like the commercial level uh

2362
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:31,359
really what is the point of of a compost

2363
01:21:29,119 --> 01:21:32,880
tea right it's just to add length right

2364
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:35,439
we're just building up life and then

2365
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:38,079
we're adding it on top of it well we can

2366
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:40,319
do that same thing maybe not as fast but

2367
01:21:38,079 --> 01:21:42,158
i have noticed that with certain compost

2368
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:43,439
teas when you're first starting out if

2369
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:45,119
you're not

2370
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:46,879
really focused on that

2371
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:48,559
and you do kind of make some mistakes

2372
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:50,079
there are alphas that can breed out of

2373
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,679
that and

2374
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:53,920
i have personally seen people that have

2375
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:56,399
brewed compost teas and it killed their

2376
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:58,239
plants because they just didn't pay

2377
01:21:56,399 --> 01:22:00,719
attention to certain things

2378
01:21:58,238 --> 01:22:02,959
so to minimize that and instead of like

2379
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:05,439
really worrying about that

2380
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:07,520
we just put compost as a top feed we

2381
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:09,599
water it in and then the worms are going

2382
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:11,760
to take care of everything else

2383
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:14,000
so there's less risk of some kind of

2384
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:16,079
myself as a human being making some kind

2385
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,679
of mistake i make sure that the worms

2386
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:19,600
are in my bins

2387
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:21,600
so that i don't make mistakes because

2388
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,880
mother nature you know she's working

2389
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:24,880
together she really doesn't make

2390
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:26,400
mistakes those worms are going to break

2391
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:28,560
down everything you're putting in as a

2392
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:29,839
top feed every single time

2393
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,840
and they're going to do it in a

2394
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,920
fantastic way and the beauty of a

2395
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:36,960
composting worm is what comes out of

2396
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:39,279
them is always better than what they put

2397
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:41,600
in and that is extremely rare on this

2398
01:22:39,279 --> 01:22:44,719
planet uh usually what's coming out is

2399
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:46,560
only waste um so i hope that people

2400
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:48,800
see that these little uh

2401
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:51,840
these little creatures are extremely

2402
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:53,840
beneficial to cannabis farming i mean

2403
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:56,639
and you use avocado attack and you have

2404
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:58,880
enough time in some space and you could

2405
01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:01,119
build an entire facility growing

2406
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:02,800
cannabis with just

2407
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:05,599
the soil food web

2408
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:08,560
the four composting worms that you need

2409
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:12,320
the farmer brain that you have and

2410
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:14,480
some kind of really well thought out ipm

2411
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:16,559
management program and then you get to

2412
01:23:14,479 --> 01:23:18,399
enjoy your weekends you'll get to enjoy

2413
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:20,560
your nights off you don't have to worry

2414
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:22,879
about ph and all the time you know you

2415
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:26,000
girls will be praying all the time that

2416
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:28,960
is a joy in life is to do what you love

2417
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,920
to do but not have it be such a burden

2418
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:33,600
and growing synthetically on a

2419
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:35,920
especially hydroponically because i have

2420
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:38,560
done that on a commercial scale is a

2421
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:41,279
burning yeah it really is even though

2422
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:43,679
you love the plant day in and day out it

2423
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:45,039
becomes a burden um

2424
01:23:43,679 --> 01:23:46,399
and if it is your you know your

2425
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:49,119
livelihood and you're growing that for

2426
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:50,879
somebody else it's just hard to put the

2427
01:23:49,119 --> 01:23:53,039
same love and care in a hydroponic

2428
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,480
growth that farmers seem to put into a

2429
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:56,960
living grow

2430
01:23:54,479 --> 01:23:59,039
organic living soil growth

2431
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,840
and you know work becomes play when you

2432
01:23:59,039 --> 01:24:05,039
discover that you are actually a steward

2433
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:07,440
rather than you know an interpreter

2434
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:09,359
when you're and being a steward puts you

2435
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:11,519
right in alignment with natural systems

2436
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:12,719
so you're not only learning things about

2437
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,159
the plants you're growing but you're

2438
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:16,399
learning things about your own

2439
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:18,399
microbiome which is a reflect a

2440
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:19,759
reflection of the soil microbiome and

2441
01:24:18,399 --> 01:24:20,559
then suddenly

2442
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:22,159
you're

2443
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:23,760
feeling more healthy and not just

2444
01:24:22,158 --> 01:24:26,158
because you're smoking amazing weed but

2445
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:28,159
because you're actually ingesting

2446
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:29,198
through your working with a plant you're

2447
01:24:28,158 --> 01:24:31,679
getting

2448
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:34,000
inoculated in your own body on your skin

2449
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:35,279
like everything comes into a unification

2450
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,238
that is just

2451
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:40,079
so pleasing and then work becomes play

2452
01:24:38,238 --> 01:24:42,879
and we're suddenly like having these

2453
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:43,600
conversations and loving life

2454
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:47,359
so

2455
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,360
i so appreciate you brian

2456
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,719
you know i want people especially the

2457
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:53,198
home gardeners i mean that's where i

2458
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:54,239
started right i'm i was just

2459
01:24:53,198 --> 01:24:56,559
you know i

2460
01:24:54,238 --> 01:24:58,638
to be honest i was lost i used to play

2461
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:00,400
uh poker and then the government shut

2462
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:03,440
that shit down one day i just like woke

2463
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:05,519
up uh i think it was tax day like i

2464
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:08,000
don't even remember now like 2010 maybe

2465
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,920
or something and uh

2466
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,639
my whole world was crushed and i was

2467
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:14,480
growing cannabis as a hobby and so that

2468
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:16,239
was really the only other alternative

2469
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:17,839
that i had i didn't have a college

2470
01:25:16,238 --> 01:25:19,439
degree i thought i would play canada or

2471
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,119
i thought i'd play poker for the rest of

2472
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:23,439
my life

2473
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:25,279
and so i want to pass this on to other

2474
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:27,279
people because

2475
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:30,000
like as you guys can see like

2476
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:32,800
one like i've had this home for

2477
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,158
since 2009 i believe

2478
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,480
and

2479
01:25:34,158 --> 01:25:38,559
part of it has been because i understand

2480
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:39,919
how to grow cannabis

2481
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:42,159
i know i have to say that very

2482
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:43,600
delicately but the reason i have certain

2483
01:25:42,158 --> 01:25:45,519
things in life is because i taught

2484
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:48,400
myself how to grow cannabis

2485
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:50,960
yeah she's she's

2486
01:25:48,399 --> 01:25:53,359
me too i mean i have my own sort of

2487
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:55,760
story around how she's brought me into

2488
01:25:53,359 --> 01:25:59,599
this very community that we're a part of

2489
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:02,639
now you know like i just gotten through

2490
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:04,719
i was down for breath surgery i'd had

2491
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:06,639
implants but i had breast cancer and so

2492
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:10,000
i went eight years with a prosthetic and

2493
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:12,079
i was tired of it so i had i got my

2494
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,600
boobs and i was just

2495
01:26:12,079 --> 01:26:15,198
like going through a divorce at that

2496
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:17,600
time and i just remember i was

2497
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:19,839
i literally watched the entire season of

2498
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:22,239
weeds

2499
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:24,000
i was not again i did not i didn't even

2500
01:26:22,238 --> 01:26:26,399
smoke cannabis the first six years that

2501
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,198
i grew but i looked around my house and

2502
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:31,920
i was like this is a perfect grow house

2503
01:26:29,198 --> 01:26:33,519
so i just taught myself how to grow

2504
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,960
and i'd already been gardening my mom

2505
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,280
and i are big gardeners we were part of

2506
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:40,639
the farmers market i'm really into

2507
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:42,479
growing i just and but cannabis is what

2508
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:47,039
growing cannabis and aligning myself

2509
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:50,000
with her is what taught me about

2510
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:52,560
my connection to nature through a very

2511
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,880
long for a very slow and

2512
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:56,239
thorough tutoring

2513
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:58,960
of of me

2514
01:26:56,238 --> 01:27:02,479
and uh yeah i am incredibly grateful to

2515
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:04,480
her for her medicine and um for

2516
01:27:02,479 --> 01:27:06,879
helping bring us together

2517
01:27:04,479 --> 01:27:08,559
yeah and like i said it's um

2518
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:10,800
you know i was diagnosed when i was a

2519
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:13,039
young man with adhd

2520
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,480
and they started pumping me full of

2521
01:27:13,039 --> 01:27:16,319
drugs and

2522
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:18,238
uh they first gave me this thing called

2523
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:20,639
dexadrine and it made me feel weird and

2524
01:27:18,238 --> 01:27:23,359
i never ate and so then they gave me

2525
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:25,199
ritalin and then ritalin made me feel

2526
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:26,880
really anxiety like a lot i had a lot of

2527
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:29,839
anxiety and just felt like a different

2528
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:33,199
person and then they gave me adderall

2529
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:34,239
and adderall was horrific it's fantastic

2530
01:27:33,198 --> 01:27:35,759
like

2531
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:36,879
you know if you take it on a friday

2532
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,639
night because you need to study or

2533
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:40,880
something but if you take that day in

2534
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:42,480
and day out for months on end

2535
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:44,880
there is something that changes in your

2536
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:46,959
brain and i don't really know what

2537
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:49,359
happened but i know that for a few

2538
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:52,239
months there i did not feel like i was

2539
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:54,238
myself and so i quit i just blatantly

2540
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:56,879
quit and i basically told my parents

2541
01:27:54,238 --> 01:28:00,079
that you know i'm an adult even though i

2542
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,960
wasn't and i am going to smoke cannabis

2543
01:28:00,079 --> 01:28:02,639
um

2544
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:05,100
and i have ever since

2545
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:06,719
wow gorgeous

2546
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:08,800
[Music]

2547
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:10,079
true medicine do you guys have more i

2548
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,000
know you guys were asking questions and

2549
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:13,439
we kind of missed them um if you guys

2550
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,960
have more questions there was somebody

2551
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:18,158
who said b a b b m b t what is that do

2552
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:22,960
you know what that is

2553
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:22,960
an anachronism bmt yeah

2554
01:28:23,279 --> 01:28:28,880
that was back in the feed let's go back

2555
01:28:26,158 --> 01:28:32,399
all right let's see

2556
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:32,400
microscope yes

2557
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:37,760
good to have a microscope leighton is

2558
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:43,400
teaching me how important that is

2559
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:43,400
my client has chit and chitin too yes

2560
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:49,199
that's the anaerobic facultators as well

2561
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:51,039
might and remember mycelium is really

2562
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:52,960
like the difference between

2563
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:55,198
dial-up internet and fiber optic

2564
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:57,679
networks right once you have that

2565
01:28:55,198 --> 01:28:59,439
mycelium going and that

2566
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:02,399
so much so like

2567
01:28:59,439 --> 01:29:05,359
you can see it growing in the sunlight

2568
01:29:02,399 --> 01:29:07,359
holy cow is that entire world

2569
01:29:05,359 --> 01:29:09,679
communicating and

2570
01:29:07,359 --> 01:29:12,639
once you get that nice little fuzz for a

2571
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:13,520
living soil farmer or a natural natural

2572
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:15,440
farmer

2573
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,719
that is kind of like our three pounds of

2574
01:29:15,439 --> 01:29:18,319
light

2575
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:20,560
you know it's really hard for us to

2576
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:22,719
achieve certain um

2577
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:24,960
metrics i guess that the synthetic world

2578
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:27,039
puts out there it's true but we've

2579
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,880
always said even in my classes and stuff

2580
01:29:27,039 --> 01:29:31,519
i used to teach guys that were still

2581
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:33,600
kind of you know in that gray area do

2582
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:35,600
you always want to hustle three pounds

2583
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,920
day in and day out or do you want

2584
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,120
somebody willing to pre-pay you for two

2585
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:40,000
two and a half

2586
01:29:39,119 --> 01:29:42,079
right

2587
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,520
and i would rather have somebody pre-pay

2588
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:45,039
me because i don't know if you guys have

2589
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:46,400
ever tried to hustle packs throughout

2590
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:47,760
life but

2591
01:29:46,399 --> 01:29:50,238
here's the real secret you get the

2592
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:52,480
bubble guts it fucking sucks you're

2593
01:29:50,238 --> 01:29:54,799
worried the entire time whether this is

2594
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:56,638
guys you're home you're not you're just

2595
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:59,440
the real truth of it is is that you're

2596
01:29:56,639 --> 01:30:01,359
extremely nervous as that kind of

2597
01:29:59,439 --> 01:30:02,399
person and if you're making money that

2598
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:05,359
way

2599
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:06,638
especially way back in the day

2600
01:30:05,359 --> 01:30:08,639
it's just it was horrible it's a

2601
01:30:06,639 --> 01:30:09,840
horrible existence i mean we pretended

2602
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:11,840
and we um

2603
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:14,880
made ourselves feel better with material

2604
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:16,960
things but on a um

2605
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:18,800
metaphysical level and just on a health

2606
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:20,800
level you know like probably even this

2607
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:24,159
kind of stuff

2608
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:25,679
that that came from selling packs um so

2609
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:28,319
the fact that we can now do this on a

2610
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:31,840
legal in a legal way um and you know i

2611
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:33,519
have i have children and everything

2612
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:35,520
money doesn't really matter as much as

2613
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:38,639
it used to to me i just want to take

2614
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:40,480
care of my family but yeah i think um i

2615
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:42,079
think the living soil crowd our whole

2616
01:30:40,479 --> 01:30:43,678
views are shifting

2617
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:45,359
we don't really give a shit if we're

2618
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:47,039
growing through a light uh we're just

2619
01:30:45,359 --> 01:30:49,039
trying to grow medicine

2620
01:30:47,039 --> 01:30:50,719
cannabis and greed do not get along

2621
01:30:49,039 --> 01:30:53,039
although they do seem come hand in hand

2622
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:56,399
at certain points of the

2623
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:57,679
development of the community but yeah

2624
01:30:56,399 --> 01:30:59,359
you know those guys don't really last

2625
01:30:57,679 --> 01:31:00,560
that long and um

2626
01:30:59,359 --> 01:31:02,799
i don't know if you guys are familiar

2627
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:05,679
with brands like med men and stuff but

2628
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:08,480
that's a classic example of greed

2629
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:10,560
that's a classic example of those guys

2630
01:31:08,479 --> 01:31:12,559
basically thinking they're like uh

2631
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:15,039
almost like an nfl franchise yet they

2632
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:18,159
had no real talent they had no real

2633
01:31:15,039 --> 01:31:19,119
quarterback uh for that brand and that's

2634
01:31:18,158 --> 01:31:20,879
um

2635
01:31:19,119 --> 01:31:22,719
something that i would say to any owners

2636
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:25,920
out there is

2637
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:26,639
your head grower is your quarterback

2638
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:29,039
and

2639
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:30,960
if you don't believe in him and

2640
01:31:29,039 --> 01:31:33,840
ride with them on the ups and downs of

2641
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:36,158
things uh you're going to be like the

2642
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:37,760
browns or the rams or you know i mean

2643
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:39,519
you're never going to win

2644
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:41,039
because

2645
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:43,600
you got to have a you got to have an

2646
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:44,880
owner that believes in you and yes

2647
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:46,560
and that's why i think a lot of people

2648
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,679
are torn are starting to educate

2649
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:49,840
themselves

2650
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:52,000
with a living soil is because then you

2651
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:53,840
get to stand out from all the other

2652
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:55,920
cannabis farmers out there that do

2653
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:58,560
understand growing cannabis and are good

2654
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:01,440
at it but at the end of the day

2655
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:04,159
how are you adding value to my farm and

2656
01:32:01,439 --> 01:32:06,479
if your knowledge is going to bring my

2657
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:09,039
labor costs down and bring my material

2658
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:12,319
costs down and your you know your

2659
01:32:09,039 --> 01:32:14,238
thinking two years from now um you know

2660
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:16,079
i hope i don't step on anybody's toes

2661
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:17,599
but i don't really see synthetic guys

2662
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:19,679
thinking like that

2663
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:22,400
they're just thinking flip flip flip

2664
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:24,480
right yep just thinking about that flip

2665
01:32:22,399 --> 01:32:25,359
and with a living soil you have to think

2666
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:28,079
about

2667
01:32:25,359 --> 01:32:30,719
the future flips because you're feeding

2668
01:32:28,079 --> 01:32:32,960
number one you're feeding for those next

2669
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:34,319
flips uh while you're growing your

2670
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:35,520
current flip

2671
01:32:34,319 --> 01:32:36,880
and so

2672
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,560
you know that i think that helps with

2673
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:40,719
genetics i think

2674
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:42,320
growing organically keeps you

2675
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:44,480
you know

2676
01:32:42,319 --> 01:32:46,559
going out there and and

2677
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:48,238
being involved in your plants every day

2678
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:50,159
i know that when we would do like some

2679
01:32:48,238 --> 01:32:52,399
consulting stuff a lot of the stuff that

2680
01:32:50,158 --> 01:32:54,799
i feel like with pest issues and stuff

2681
01:32:52,399 --> 01:32:57,759
just came down because

2682
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:59,920
the team was actually lazy right and

2683
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,280
everything was so automated that they

2684
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:03,760
just

2685
01:33:01,279 --> 01:33:05,279
that culture started to build and the

2686
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:07,440
weeks went by the months went by and

2687
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:09,519
maybe a year or two went by and now

2688
01:33:07,439 --> 01:33:11,359
everybody has gotten used to

2689
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:13,199
minimal work because everything was

2690
01:33:11,359 --> 01:33:14,559
automated but they weren't checking the

2691
01:33:13,198 --> 01:33:16,479
plants they weren't making sure things

2692
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:17,679
were going and they had major major

2693
01:33:16,479 --> 01:33:18,479
issues

2694
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:20,319
so

2695
01:33:18,479 --> 01:33:22,638
living soil especially if you have your

2696
01:33:20,319 --> 01:33:25,679
team you almost kind of force your team

2697
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:28,480
to hand water um to me

2698
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:30,960
money well spent oh yes that labor is

2699
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:33,678
because you you teach your team to

2700
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:36,079
scope and check the plants as they're

2701
01:33:33,679 --> 01:33:37,520
watering um

2702
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:40,319
there's there's nothing better than it

2703
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:41,840
then a human being walking the plants um

2704
01:33:40,319 --> 01:33:43,759
well i know when i go to these big like

2705
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,800
mj biz cons and stuff and all these guys

2706
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:47,679
are pitching you and everything

2707
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:50,079
automated my rights just closed because

2708
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:51,520
i know john yeah at least in my world

2709
01:33:50,079 --> 01:33:53,760
you have no idea what you're talking

2710
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:55,440
about it's automated is the worst thing

2711
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,920
we would do

2712
01:33:55,439 --> 01:33:59,519
yes automation makes certain people lazy

2713
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:01,440
i'm not saying everybody out there and i

2714
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:05,080
hope that people don't take it or well

2715
01:34:01,439 --> 01:34:05,079
the natural farmers

2716
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:11,039
however you grow cannabis i i personally

2717
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:14,000
like that i personally like you right

2718
01:34:11,039 --> 01:34:15,760
i'm not saying that living soil is

2719
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:18,000
the be all end-all i'm just saying that

2720
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:20,159
i have personally found that with my

2721
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:22,158
skill set and my knowledge base that i

2722
01:34:20,158 --> 01:34:24,399
don't have the same knowledge that you

2723
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:26,638
bought in this do and you guys that are

2724
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:28,960
out there growing amazing cannabis

2725
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:31,600
synthetically hats off to you because i

2726
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:34,719
wouldn't be able to do that um

2727
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:36,960
i'm i just never got that skill set so i

2728
01:34:34,719 --> 01:34:38,719
educated myself in another way and that

2729
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:40,480
is to use mother nature and that's

2730
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:42,239
really what korean natural farming is

2731
01:34:40,479 --> 01:34:43,759
that's what living soil is

2732
01:34:42,238 --> 01:34:46,479
at the end of the day everything comes

2733
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:47,760
down to we're using nature uh we're

2734
01:34:46,479 --> 01:34:49,359
we're speeding things up with nature

2735
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:52,639
we're using our farmer brain to improve

2736
01:34:49,359 --> 01:34:54,238
things but we're still using nature

2737
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:56,159
and that's why we love sharing this

2738
01:34:54,238 --> 01:34:56,959
stuff with you is because you know if i

2739
01:34:56,158 --> 01:34:58,960
have

2740
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:01,760
if i have a farm that's five years in

2741
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:03,920
right there's no way that you guys could

2742
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:05,520
ever catch up with that farm because

2743
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:07,359
that soil has already churned

2744
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:09,440
everything's become alive and thriving

2745
01:35:07,359 --> 01:35:10,880
why wouldn't i hope why wouldn't i you

2746
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:13,039
know unless you're just a

2747
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:15,359
dick i guess but

2748
01:35:13,039 --> 01:35:17,279
i mean if someone asks me a question and

2749
01:35:15,359 --> 01:35:19,118
i know they're not um

2750
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:20,800
i know they're not like trying to pick

2751
01:35:19,118 --> 01:35:22,158
my brain where it's just

2752
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:23,679
you know you can tell people when

2753
01:35:22,158 --> 01:35:24,559
they're genuinely asking a question or

2754
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:27,199
they're

2755
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:28,560
strictly asking me a business question

2756
01:35:27,198 --> 01:35:30,479
because they want to take that

2757
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:32,239
information and make money off of it i

2758
01:35:30,479 --> 01:35:34,559
hate those kind of people but if you

2759
01:35:32,238 --> 01:35:36,238
guys genuinely have like a question like

2760
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:38,239
i have an issue with this or what the

2761
01:35:36,238 --> 01:35:39,919
hell is a russ it might um you know

2762
01:35:38,238 --> 01:35:41,359
reach out to tina reach out to myself

2763
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:43,440
where you know

2764
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:44,719
we help i talk to people in the dm as

2765
01:35:43,439 --> 01:35:46,399
long as they don't ask me to ship them

2766
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:48,319
weed and shit

2767
01:35:46,399 --> 01:35:50,638
i'm willing to help you guys i just

2768
01:35:48,319 --> 01:35:52,158
don't again i just sometimes when i help

2769
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:54,000
i feel like then people take advantage

2770
01:35:52,158 --> 01:35:55,118
of that and then they were like

2771
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,719
i don't know they get upset because

2772
01:35:55,118 --> 01:35:59,679
you're not like basically helping them

2773
01:35:56,719 --> 01:36:01,679
through their entire grow right um so

2774
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:03,600
yeah there's a few bad habits that we

2775
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:06,319
have to shed as we're sort of coming out

2776
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:08,480
of this dark age of silo thinking

2777
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:10,319
vertical like everyone's against each

2778
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:13,198
other competitive like we really are

2779
01:36:10,319 --> 01:36:15,599
coming into a new paradigm and we're all

2780
01:36:13,198 --> 01:36:17,599
having to get rid of our bad habits and

2781
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:21,679
kind of learn how to share with one

2782
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:23,440
another and it's it's a process like

2783
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:25,679
it's it's a pain it's sometimes a

2784
01:36:23,439 --> 01:36:28,479
painful process because i often felt

2785
01:36:25,679 --> 01:36:30,560
like i'm giving away the king things

2786
01:36:28,479 --> 01:36:32,479
that maybe i should keep to myself

2787
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:35,199
because i you know am

2788
01:36:32,479 --> 01:36:37,678
still paying a mortgage i'm still like

2789
01:36:35,198 --> 01:36:40,559
even with these balls like i'm full you

2790
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:43,279
know there's i'm

2791
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:45,520
fully sharing the entire process recipe

2792
01:36:43,279 --> 01:36:47,599
everything like there's still part of me

2793
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:49,440
comes up with this risk fast factor like

2794
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:51,840
oh if i do that no one's gonna buy the

2795
01:36:49,439 --> 01:36:53,759
balls but really it's not about that

2796
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:56,239
it's about like

2797
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:58,480
if my area is thriving if my little

2798
01:36:56,238 --> 01:37:00,319
piece of acre is thriving

2799
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:03,359
it's going to help your piece of acre

2800
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:05,519
thrive and by everybody thriving we're

2801
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:07,279
going to change the world and we're

2802
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:09,199
going to be able to feed ourselves

2803
01:37:07,279 --> 01:37:11,359
nurture ourselves

2804
01:37:09,198 --> 01:37:14,158
medicate ourselves and help each other

2805
01:37:11,359 --> 01:37:16,559
and you know and be at play again you

2806
01:37:14,158 --> 01:37:19,679
know this whole theme of like let's work

2807
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:20,800
smarter not harder and it's about

2808
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:22,719
it's about

2809
01:37:20,800 --> 01:37:24,320
it's about helping nature and the only

2810
01:37:22,719 --> 01:37:26,639
way we can do that is by helping each

2811
01:37:24,319 --> 01:37:28,399
other because we're a part of nature so

2812
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:30,319
and working smarter is us having

2813
01:37:28,399 --> 01:37:31,759
conversations because there are certain

2814
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:33,039
things that i've learned from you tina

2815
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:34,639
that probably would have taken me months

2816
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:37,198
maybe a year to learn

2817
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:38,719
um there's certain tips and tricks like

2818
01:37:37,198 --> 01:37:40,079
uh you know i was sharing before with

2819
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:41,359
the rabbits and stuff

2820
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:43,760
oh i can't wait for the rest that's

2821
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:45,519
taken me years guys that's taken me

2822
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:48,159
years and then i just rattle them off to

2823
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:51,760
you are you breeding your rabbits i'm

2824
01:37:48,158 --> 01:37:55,519
not um i i actually save them from the

2825
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:57,600
the shelter oh you do but i um

2826
01:37:55,520 --> 01:38:00,000
maybe in time i might

2827
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:01,039
buff it down no i just i rescue them and

2828
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,960
then they

2829
01:38:01,039 --> 01:38:04,000
uh teach them to poop in the pots and

2830
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,439
then

2831
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:07,920
i feel like they have a way better

2832
01:38:05,439 --> 01:38:09,759
existence in life being able to just go

2833
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:10,880
amongst the house like a dog

2834
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:14,400
do you think that they can be

2835
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:14,400
cohabitators like that

2836
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:18,159
probably not huh or maybe

2837
01:38:18,319 --> 01:38:22,960
it's really up to your cat

2838
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:24,638
right training the cat

2839
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:25,840
the lion heads like i said the reason

2840
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:28,159
why they like that breed is because

2841
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:31,039
they're extremely intelligent

2842
01:38:28,158 --> 01:38:32,319
and they're really sweet but yeah um if

2843
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:34,238
they're in a corner or something like

2844
01:38:32,319 --> 01:38:36,639
that they will bite the shit out of you

2845
01:38:34,238 --> 01:38:39,439
like my zelda she'd bite the shadow me

2846
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:42,000
when i'd feed her you know

2847
01:38:39,439 --> 01:38:42,839
damn girl

2848
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,399
lighten

2849
01:38:42,840 --> 01:38:46,159
up

2850
01:38:44,399 --> 01:38:49,439
this food ain't cheap you know this

2851
01:38:46,158 --> 01:38:51,039
organic greens over here

2852
01:38:49,439 --> 01:38:52,879
oh my god

2853
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:55,198
all right

2854
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:56,960
so there was one question and maybe we

2855
01:38:55,198 --> 01:38:58,879
can use this to kind of wrap up because

2856
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:00,480
i i'm not i want to come down and talk

2857
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:01,440
we need to have a we need to have lunch

2858
01:39:00,479 --> 01:39:02,559
and talk

2859
01:39:01,439 --> 01:39:03,678
yeah

2860
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:06,239
so

2861
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:08,800
what's his name big hair

2862
01:39:06,238 --> 01:39:10,399
big hair

2863
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:13,119
big hair

2864
01:39:10,399 --> 01:39:14,719
pappy is asking i'm trying to reduce the

2865
01:39:13,118 --> 01:39:16,639
local waste stream at our local

2866
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:19,840
distributor for produce how would you

2867
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:22,319
convert a thousand pounds of fresh

2868
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:24,880
veggies into insects i've been feeding

2869
01:39:22,319 --> 01:39:28,000
to cows but i'd

2870
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:30,000
but i'd like to do some insectary

2871
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:31,840
so yeah how about like start like i

2872
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:34,238
don't know quick run down like what it

2873
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:35,600
would take to scale up to that level

2874
01:39:34,238 --> 01:39:37,678
yeah obviously

2875
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:40,800
well at that level i would probably be

2876
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:42,079
start using like uh worms and bokashi

2877
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:44,960
oh yeah

2878
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:44,960
because at that level

2879
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:50,479
a bunch of worms i mean that is

2880
01:39:49,359 --> 01:39:53,198
yeah

2881
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:55,198
bokashi is

2882
01:39:53,198 --> 01:39:56,559
next level as well so

2883
01:39:55,198 --> 01:39:58,479
tina if you would love to have like

2884
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:00,960
another i know you're definitely way

2885
01:39:58,479 --> 01:40:02,479
more knowledgeable on it than me but uh

2886
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,480
we could definitely have a discussion on

2887
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:06,799
that because i think yeah

2888
01:40:04,479 --> 01:40:09,198
that was another like aha moment for me

2889
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:11,279
cover crop was an aha moment for me

2890
01:40:09,198 --> 01:40:12,638
um and then what do you use for what do

2891
01:40:11,279 --> 01:40:15,198
you use for a cover crop what do you

2892
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:16,400
have a mix that you like especially or

2893
01:40:15,198 --> 01:40:17,599
uh

2894
01:40:16,399 --> 01:40:19,679
yeah i would

2895
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:22,000
i guess i don't is it all right to give

2896
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:23,760
build a soil i like those guys

2897
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:27,679
yeah yeah it has a they have a cover

2898
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:29,440
crop blend uh it's a 12 seed blend

2899
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:31,359
if you don't uh if you don't want to

2900
01:40:29,439 --> 01:40:32,799
shop like online something you just want

2901
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:35,039
to go to a store

2902
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:37,760
crimson clover is usually something that

2903
01:40:35,039 --> 01:40:39,920
you can buy really easily um and i just

2904
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:43,679
load up on that if i wasn't able to get

2905
01:40:39,920 --> 01:40:46,079
like a variety mix but again uh

2906
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:47,039
diversity is king right yeah

2907
01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:48,079
so

2908
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:49,359
the

2909
01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:50,880
the different crops that you can get

2910
01:40:49,359 --> 01:40:53,359
especially legumes and that kind of

2911
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:57,279
stuff in addition with the clover uh

2912
01:40:53,359 --> 01:41:01,359
that's really going to build that um

2913
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:04,000
thriving living soil uh that in a

2914
01:41:01,359 --> 01:41:07,599
in the living soil way of like where we

2915
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:09,439
understand the soil food web because

2916
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:10,800
it's okay to have

2917
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:13,279
like if you really understand the soil

2918
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:16,159
food web it's okay to have a little bit

2919
01:41:13,279 --> 01:41:18,719
of bad things like you almost kind of

2920
01:41:16,158 --> 01:41:20,879
need it in a way percent now and again

2921
01:41:18,719 --> 01:41:22,800
the rove beetles really take

2922
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:24,319
take care of all that so

2923
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:26,320
um if you guys

2924
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:28,238
you know take away from anything today

2925
01:41:26,319 --> 01:41:29,840
it's that if you're gonna grow with a

2926
01:41:28,238 --> 01:41:32,000
living soil

2927
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:34,400
be so proactive that you're thinking it

2928
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:36,639
through that you guys of worm farming

2929
01:41:34,399 --> 01:41:37,839
before you even start putting a plant in

2930
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:39,920
the ground

2931
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:41,760
and i assure you that you will

2932
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:43,440
appreciate that you took the time to set

2933
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:44,719
that up beforehand

2934
01:41:43,439 --> 01:41:46,158
because your life's going to be so much

2935
01:41:44,719 --> 01:41:47,920
easier and if you don't have to deal

2936
01:41:46,158 --> 01:41:49,920
with fungus gnats and that's the other

2937
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:51,440
thing too is you know sometimes these

2938
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:53,440
owners they don't

2939
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:55,439
you know they don't smoke they don't

2940
01:41:53,439 --> 01:41:57,439
grow they're just the wallet so when

2941
01:41:55,439 --> 01:41:59,439
they come in and they see a shit ton of

2942
01:41:57,439 --> 01:42:00,960
fungus gnats

2943
01:41:59,439 --> 01:42:02,479
you know they they give you these looks

2944
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:03,679
sometimes like you know like does this

2945
01:42:02,479 --> 01:42:06,399
guy know what the hell he's talking

2946
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:08,880
about but once you get over that hurdle

2947
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:11,759
right and it goes away then everybody so

2948
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:13,199
to minimize your your boss or your

2949
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:16,480
your investors or whatever looking at

2950
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:19,198
you that way be more proactive

2951
01:42:16,479 --> 01:42:21,359
in these living soil grows and you are

2952
01:42:19,198 --> 01:42:24,079
going to look like a rock star

2953
01:42:21,359 --> 01:42:25,759
to some of these investors because

2954
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:27,760
not only growing cannabis that they've

2955
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:28,480
probably never seen before

2956
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:29,280
but

2957
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:31,359
uh

2958
01:42:29,279 --> 01:42:33,759
if you're doing it the right way

2959
01:42:31,359 --> 01:42:35,519
the labor should be down dramatically

2960
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:36,880
maybe not the first like few months

2961
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:38,719
because you're you know working

2962
01:42:36,880 --> 01:42:40,719
everything through but once you're

2963
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:42,158
you know your process is in and you've

2964
01:42:40,719 --> 01:42:44,239
kind of taken over that facility and

2965
01:42:42,158 --> 01:42:46,238
you're running a living soil and um the

2966
01:42:44,238 --> 01:42:48,559
beds and everything are growing uh that

2967
01:42:46,238 --> 01:42:50,479
labor cost goes down dramatically oh

2968
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:52,239
yeah and then it comes you know and then

2969
01:42:50,479 --> 01:42:53,678
we you know it can continue i could talk

2970
01:42:52,238 --> 01:42:55,359
about this all day but then it comes

2971
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:57,199
down more than to like the genetics

2972
01:42:55,359 --> 01:42:59,359
right and genetics are probably 50

2973
01:42:57,198 --> 01:43:00,638
percent of growing cannabis right there

2974
01:42:59,359 --> 01:43:02,719
um so

2975
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:04,480
there's just there's just a whole line

2976
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:08,399
of things that if you really set

2977
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:08,399
yourself up for success at the beginning

2978
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:13,119
you just won't ever falter you won't

2979
01:43:10,158 --> 01:43:14,879
lose a crop you won't um you won't have

2980
01:43:13,118 --> 01:43:17,439
pest issues to wear

2981
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:18,560
or powdery mildew issues or anything

2982
01:43:17,439 --> 01:43:20,479
like that because you're just growing

2983
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:21,920
such a healthy cannabis

2984
01:43:20,479 --> 01:43:24,158
uh crop

2985
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:25,840
that those issues even if they pop up

2986
01:43:24,158 --> 01:43:27,198
like let's say you had spiderman

2987
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:29,760
especially in a larger facility you

2988
01:43:27,198 --> 01:43:31,039
might have a pocket of spider mites but

2989
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:33,119
you know

2990
01:43:31,039 --> 01:43:35,359
you might not ever see that because the

2991
01:43:33,118 --> 01:43:37,759
mice uh the predatory mice that you've

2992
01:43:35,359 --> 01:43:39,118
been adding every few weeks uh they've

2993
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:41,280
been keeping up

2994
01:43:39,118 --> 01:43:43,439
yeah

2995
01:43:41,279 --> 01:43:45,679
yeah i would love to have a genetics

2996
01:43:43,439 --> 01:43:47,759
conversation with you especially because

2997
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:50,239
like being a woman

2998
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:53,199
uh grower being of an age group that's

2999
01:43:50,238 --> 01:43:55,039
not sort of like in the know or not

3000
01:43:53,198 --> 01:43:57,359
being a traditional part of the culture

3001
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:59,920
either like the genetics

3002
01:43:57,359 --> 01:44:01,679
game has been sort of the hardest for me

3003
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:04,239
to like actually

3004
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:06,480
be part of a community and i guess so

3005
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:08,399
this is kind of like me saying

3006
01:44:06,479 --> 01:44:09,599
like shouting out to everybody out there

3007
01:44:08,399 --> 01:44:11,920
who's

3008
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:14,639
hoarding genetics or feeling some kind

3009
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:18,800
of ego involvement in it that like

3010
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:21,359
this sharing of genetics or like

3011
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:24,000
even shari like i'm doing this

3012
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:26,399
crazy genetics project that i am

3013
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,920
intuiting on my own and not getting a

3014
01:44:26,399 --> 01:44:28,879
whole lot of

3015
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:31,920
help

3016
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:33,920
in the community from

3017
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:35,279
based on my observational skills that

3018
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:38,158
it's going to take

3019
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:39,679
a plant a period of time to adapt to

3020
01:44:38,158 --> 01:44:41,839
their environment

3021
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:43,279
and so

3022
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:44,639
anyway there's a whole there's a whole

3023
01:44:43,279 --> 01:44:46,559
lot of things we could talk about in

3024
01:44:44,639 --> 01:44:48,719
that but this is just a shout out to be

3025
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:51,039
like hey let's find a way to come

3026
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:53,520
together

3027
01:44:51,039 --> 01:44:55,679
as a community around genetics as well

3028
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:57,440
and figure out how to share stuff there

3029
01:44:55,679 --> 01:44:59,679
because there's a whole lot that needs

3030
01:44:57,439 --> 01:45:02,158
to happen there

3031
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:04,079
and not only that but let let's share

3032
01:45:02,158 --> 01:45:04,960
real truths with each other because i

3033
01:45:04,079 --> 01:45:06,639
know

3034
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:08,560
i know that people out there are afraid

3035
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:10,319
to say certain things but there are

3036
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:12,320
breeders out there and i am not afraid

3037
01:45:10,319 --> 01:45:14,000
to say this that are taking two three

3038
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:16,399
hundred dollars from you for a ten pack

3039
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,520
of seeds and they've really never even

3040
01:45:16,399 --> 01:45:19,920
tested it

3041
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:22,400
right right and yes

3042
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:24,158
and then you might not notice that um

3043
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:25,920
you know i i personally didn't notice it

3044
01:45:24,158 --> 01:45:29,039
for many years because i was just

3045
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:30,719
growing in a tent and i didn't have like

3046
01:45:29,039 --> 01:45:32,880
just a huge

3047
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:35,520
amount of plants to run through but then

3048
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:37,279
when i started growing commercially um a

3049
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:39,040
lot of these

3050
01:45:37,279 --> 01:45:41,599
seed brands that i'm sure you guys

3051
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:43,279
probably are in love with um

3052
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:44,880
they're

3053
01:45:43,279 --> 01:45:47,039
a on a larger

3054
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:49,520
scale facility their stuff is not as

3055
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:51,840
good and i and i really think that if we

3056
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:53,840
had a real candid conversation we don't

3057
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:56,079
have to name names or anything but no

3058
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:58,239
just talk about the process

3059
01:45:56,079 --> 01:46:00,960
and know that i mean it's really simple

3060
01:45:58,238 --> 01:46:02,559
guys right if you see a genetics brand

3061
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:04,960
that's coming out with

3062
01:46:02,560 --> 01:46:06,719
20 new genetics every few weeks

3063
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:07,840
i mean

3064
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:09,039
it doesn't

3065
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,960
you don't even really have to be that

3066
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:13,359
great of a cannabis farmer to understand

3067
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:15,439
that how are they working those lines

3068
01:46:13,359 --> 01:46:17,118
you know and that's why um you know i

3069
01:46:15,439 --> 01:46:19,439
have a little thing that i've been doing

3070
01:46:17,118 --> 01:46:20,880
as well tina's been on foreverflux where

3071
01:46:19,439 --> 01:46:22,638
i've been interviewing people and last

3072
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:25,279
week we had a guy named derek with some

3073
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:28,079
leaf scene and he comes out with a line

3074
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:29,359
like every six months you know and that

3075
01:46:28,079 --> 01:46:31,760
and that really is kind of the

3076
01:46:29,359 --> 01:46:33,439
difference um

3077
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:35,039
you know and i'm i guess i'm giving i

3078
01:46:33,439 --> 01:46:36,719
guess i am giving certain brands of

3079
01:46:35,039 --> 01:46:38,319
shadow but i think

3080
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:40,399
i think derek deserves a shout out

3081
01:46:38,319 --> 01:46:42,719
because he he really does work his lines

3082
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:44,399
like he's and he's not a like he doesn't

3083
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:47,279
drive a lamborghini and all this

3084
01:46:44,399 --> 01:46:48,960
bullshit like he's he's a guy of the

3085
01:46:47,279 --> 01:46:50,238
people you know i mean he's

3086
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:51,920
he takes his mind we're going to get

3087
01:46:50,238 --> 01:46:53,839
together again we want to get together

3088
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:55,920
again for one of these and we'll and i

3089
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:57,600
want to catch up on those the interviews

3090
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:59,520
that you've been doing how can people

conversation we like let's go you know

3110
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:42,639
this is an ongoing relationship that

3111
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:46,000
we're having with each other and so you

3112
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:48,319
know yeah let's like you need help and

3113
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,238
but at the same time if we've got things

3114
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:52,880
that you know we're needing support

3115
01:47:50,238 --> 01:47:55,118
through products or you know any of

3116
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:58,560
those sorts of things or attendance and

3117
01:47:55,118 --> 01:48:00,319
anyway you know let's do reciprocation

3118
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:02,480
together like i said you know we're

3119
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:03,840
going to have these live events

3120
01:48:02,479 --> 01:48:06,479
tina was the first person i actually

3121
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:08,319
reached out to because of like her

3122
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:09,678
her message and the way she teaches and

3123
01:48:08,319 --> 01:48:13,279
all that stuff so

3124
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:16,000
once we are allowed to run with that um

3125
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:17,519
i really think what yeah there's uh

3126
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,840
chris obviously i'd love to have there's

3127
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:22,000
like a live event uh wendy's uh sun

3128
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:23,840
abyss yes

3129
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:26,319
cultivating classics i saw you on there

3130
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:27,840
too buddy dj um

3131
01:48:26,319 --> 01:48:29,759
there's just a lot of bright minded

3132
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:32,239
people that really understand it that

3133
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,360
maybe just because their instagram is

3134
01:48:32,238 --> 01:48:35,678
you know

3135
01:48:33,359 --> 01:48:37,359
not as big or whatever

3136
01:48:35,679 --> 01:48:39,520
i really hate when i hear people be like

3137
01:48:37,359 --> 01:48:41,839
oh yeah but you know they only have this

3138
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:43,679
many or

3139
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:45,520
instagram is bullshit right the reason

3140
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:48,000
i'm on instagram is because it's worked

3141
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:50,480
for me otherwise it wouldn't be on this

3142
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,479
um it's just it's a platform it's a way

3143
01:48:50,479 --> 01:48:54,479
for us to be able to educate and

3144
01:48:52,479 --> 01:48:56,718
communicate with one another

3145
01:48:54,479 --> 01:48:58,479
and my goal is to give the guys that

3146
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:59,920
maybe don't have you know they're

3147
01:48:58,479 --> 01:49:02,158
brilliant that they're posting things

3148
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:05,279
and maybe four people liked it but it's

3149
01:49:02,158 --> 01:49:08,238
it's next level uh thought process

3150
01:49:05,279 --> 01:49:09,439
so hopefully tina i know like um since

3151
01:49:08,238 --> 01:49:11,039
you've been doing this and i've been

3152
01:49:09,439 --> 01:49:12,399
helping you understand social media

3153
01:49:11,039 --> 01:49:14,319
maybe that's something else that i could

3154
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:16,879
help the community with so that the

3155
01:49:14,319 --> 01:49:18,799
message could be seen more

3156
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:20,400
yeah yeah yeah let's yes yes yes

3157
01:49:18,800 --> 01:49:22,239
platform building

3158
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:24,079
if excuse me for you guys that don't

3159
01:49:22,238 --> 01:49:25,279
know if you um

3160
01:49:24,079 --> 01:49:26,559
if you have a cannabis account

3161
01:49:25,279 --> 01:49:29,279
especially like me that has the word

3162
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:32,400
cannabis in the actual name um i'm

3163
01:49:29,279 --> 01:49:33,840
basically like shadow band and

3164
01:49:32,399 --> 01:49:35,759
everything you can imagine like they

3165
01:49:33,840 --> 01:49:38,159
don't really even show like uh my

3166
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:40,480
hashtags to to many people i mean it'll

3167
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:44,238
it'll show up in the feed but it doesn't

3168
01:49:40,479 --> 01:49:46,718
go to the people and so we as a cannabis

3169
01:49:44,238 --> 01:49:51,118
community have to work together to kind

3170
01:49:46,719 --> 01:49:53,679
of spread uh our material throughout the

3171
01:49:51,118 --> 01:49:55,920
ethernet of instagram because their

3172
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:57,359
algorithm punishes you just for being a

3173
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:58,560
cannabis person

3174
01:49:57,359 --> 01:50:00,238
um and so

3175
01:49:58,560 --> 01:50:02,320
you know to have my account at where

3176
01:50:00,238 --> 01:50:04,399
it's at could you imagine if we were

3177
01:50:02,319 --> 01:50:06,880
actually allowed to like promote a

3178
01:50:04,399 --> 01:50:07,598
living soil cannabis and stuff like

3179
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:09,118
you know

3180
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:10,560
if we could add

3181
01:50:09,118 --> 01:50:12,319
you know we're not allowed to do that

3182
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:14,719
kind of stuff so we need to find a way

3183
01:50:12,319 --> 01:50:16,880
where we're able to promote each other

3184
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:19,039
um and

3185
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:20,560
tina and i already do that so you know i

3186
01:50:19,039 --> 01:50:22,800
hope that you guys as well like if you

3187
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:24,639
have something interesting or something

3188
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:27,279
tag me in it if i think it's cool i'll

3189
01:50:24,639 --> 01:50:29,599
post it up there yeah i tag people all

3190
01:50:27,279 --> 01:50:31,920
day i try to promote people that

3191
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:34,400
don't really have a voice or i just try

3192
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:35,679
to use my instagram to promote others

3193
01:50:34,399 --> 01:50:38,479
and show

3194
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:40,000
you know unique things in my life and i

3195
01:50:38,479 --> 01:50:42,079
hope that other people in this community

3196
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,760
do the same i do see a lot of these

3197
01:50:42,079 --> 01:50:45,359
people now with like

3198
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:46,880
the ego starting to get to them and

3199
01:50:45,359 --> 01:50:49,039
they're starting to like

3200
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:51,599
really show their plants and all and i

3201
01:50:49,039 --> 01:50:53,599
get that and that's great and stuff but

3202
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:55,679
let's use instagram so to further

3203
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:58,000
educate one another we all have pretty

3204
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:58,960
plants right yeah

3205
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:01,439
yeah

3206
01:50:58,960 --> 01:51:02,719
we all smoke dabs right i'm not into the

3207
01:51:01,439 --> 01:51:03,919
whole like

3208
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:07,039
you know

3209
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:09,118
we have cool rigs and we smoke good yeah

3210
01:51:07,039 --> 01:51:10,560
we all do that right and we've kind of

3211
01:51:09,118 --> 01:51:12,319
in reality if you're in colorado we've

3212
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:13,840
been doing that for a while now so let's

3213
01:51:12,319 --> 01:51:15,759
move on to something cooler and to me

3214
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:18,400
that's educating one another

3215
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:20,239
building a community um

3216
01:51:18,399 --> 01:51:21,920
you know the material shit like i said i

3217
01:51:20,238 --> 01:51:23,359
don't as long as i can take care of my

3218
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:24,880
family i don't

3219
01:51:23,359 --> 01:51:26,719
i don't know i just don't really care

3220
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:28,239
anymore and then when covet hit you kind

3221
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:30,560
of see like what really matters when

3222
01:51:28,238 --> 01:51:32,959
some major stuff goes down isn't it

3223
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:34,880
funny how it kind of realigns how what's

3224
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:36,158
important to us like

3225
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:37,599
you know the constriction you know

3226
01:51:36,158 --> 01:51:40,079
there's two different forces there's

3227
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:42,159
constriction and there's expansion and

3228
01:51:40,079 --> 01:51:44,800
by being constricted from an outside way

3229
01:51:42,158 --> 01:51:46,559
we're maybe being taught to sit and

3230
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:48,400
learn what it's going to be like to

3231
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:54,320
expand and

3232
01:51:48,399 --> 01:51:54,319
expansion requires like breath and uh

3233
01:51:54,960 --> 01:52:00,239
so in reciprocity so when we're learning

3234
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:03,119
how to be in community it's def and we

3235
01:52:00,238 --> 01:52:05,598
feel like we need to be given a lot of

3236
01:52:03,118 --> 01:52:07,279
education or whatnot and we're

3237
01:52:05,599 --> 01:52:10,159
taking that freely from the people who

3238
01:52:07,279 --> 01:52:12,399
are giving it but also in that remember

3239
01:52:10,158 --> 01:52:14,238
that you're you're you're also required

3240
01:52:12,399 --> 01:52:16,000
to give so when you're receiving

3241
01:52:14,238 --> 01:52:17,919
remember that it's a way of you you know

3242
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:20,319
it's it's a reciprocity breathing is

3243
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:22,399
reciprocity you're great bringing it in

3244
01:52:20,319 --> 01:52:26,238
but then you're giving it out so

3245
01:52:22,399 --> 01:52:26,238
let's all learn how to breathe together

3246
01:52:26,479 --> 01:52:30,638
and we're gonna you know if you want to

3247
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:33,199
be greedy on that side of things we'll

3248
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:35,279
you know this one guy taught me this uh

3249
01:52:33,198 --> 01:52:38,479
what what radio station does everybody

3250
01:52:35,279 --> 01:52:41,118
listen to and it's like wwe fm what's in

3251
01:52:38,479 --> 01:52:42,879
it for me oh right so what's in it for

3252
01:52:41,118 --> 01:52:46,238
you guys well the fact that you can

3253
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:48,079
shave months years off of growing right

3254
01:52:46,238 --> 01:52:49,759
if we actually had a community where we

3255
01:52:48,079 --> 01:52:51,359
were working together and we were

3256
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:53,360
talking about certain things where it's

3257
01:52:51,359 --> 01:52:55,359
like hey you know i tried this on

3258
01:52:53,359 --> 01:52:57,279
russell mike's and it didn't work do you

3259
01:52:55,359 --> 01:52:58,960

3260
01:52:57,279 --> 01:53:00,158
saved me back in the day if i could oh

3261
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:02,399

3262
01:53:00,158 --> 01:53:03,519
nobody knew how to combat rusted mites

3263
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:04,319
at first

3264
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:06,080
right

3265
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:07,118

right

3268
01:53:08,158 --> 01:53:12,559
focus

3269
01:53:10,238 --> 01:53:15,279
do you know how long you know how many

3270
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:17,199
years and and trials and stuff it took

3271
01:53:15,279 --> 01:53:18,079
me to just be able to rattle that off to

3272
01:53:17,198 --> 01:53:19,759
you guys

3273
01:53:18,079 --> 01:53:20,559
um so that's the kind of stuff that i

3274
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:22,880
hope

3275
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:24,960
other people will start to do for us so

3276
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:26,880
that tina and i can learn and you guys

3277
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:28,719
can continue to learn and if i can

3278
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:30,639
rattle off that

3279
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:32,079
something that took me years to just you

3280
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:33,760
know you guys just got for free like

3281
01:53:32,079 --> 01:53:35,279
that i hope that

3282
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:36,800
people kind of like pay it forward type

3283
01:53:35,279 --> 01:53:38,559
thing and we really start to work

3284
01:53:36,800 --> 01:53:40,639
together and i would imagine in a few

3285
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:42,639
years if we had this kind of community

3286
01:53:40,639 --> 01:53:44,239
that all of our attributes would just be

3287
01:53:42,639 --> 01:53:45,599
through the roof

3288
01:53:44,238 --> 01:53:47,118
well i'm going to give you a little

3289
01:53:45,599 --> 01:53:48,400
example of what that's going to feel

3290
01:53:47,118 --> 01:53:50,238
like for everybody because i'm going to

3291
01:53:48,399 --> 01:53:51,679
lay something down for you

3292
01:53:50,238 --> 01:53:53,039
that you're going to just love and i'm

3293
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:54,399
going to make sure you get some of this

3294
01:53:53,039 --> 01:53:56,880
to play with

3295
01:53:54,399 --> 01:53:58,559
do you know what helps a plant receive

3296
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:00,639
more sulfur

3297
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:02,400
in order to do that thriving amazing

3298
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:06,079
thing

3299
01:54:02,399 --> 01:54:08,879
um i had heard that it's like oh okay

3300
01:54:06,079 --> 01:54:10,880
a little bit

3301
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:14,639
um iron

3302
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:17,118
yep and and uh so i and i so and you

3303
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:18,560
need something called a sedero for

3304
01:54:17,118 --> 01:54:21,598
within or

3305
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:24,560
within your uh soil system to move that

3306
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:26,239
iron a cediro4 is an iron carrier it

3307
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:28,480
moves the iron

3308
01:54:26,238 --> 01:54:30,319
so this is an organic form so this is

3309
01:54:28,479 --> 01:54:32,158
this shell of jeet is extremely high in

3310
01:54:30,319 --> 01:54:34,238
iron because i had it tested

3311
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:35,519
so okay keep that thought for a second

3312
01:54:34,238 --> 01:54:36,638
but let me tell you how i arrived at it

3313
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:38,560
and then i want to hear what you're

3314
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:40,159
saying because see how this works when

3315
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:41,760
we share information we build on each

3316
01:54:40,158 --> 01:54:43,839
other like i'm about to learn something

3317
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:45,840
from him and he now learns i have a

3318
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:49,679
product that's got a plant available

3319
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:53,119
form of iron what so um

3320
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:53,118
that's so fucking cool

3321
01:54:53,198 --> 01:54:56,879
and those are the things that really

3322
01:54:54,319 --> 01:54:58,479
make your canvas stand out you know

3323
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:59,840
oh my gosh exactly

3324
01:54:58,479 --> 01:55:02,000
right so what and there is a

3325
01:54:59,840 --> 01:55:04,400
relationship between iron and sulfur so

3326
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,840
they they and i just found one research

3327
01:55:04,399 --> 01:55:08,079
paper that i'm going to have to go back

3328
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:09,840
and refine but it's something about iron

3329
01:55:08,079 --> 01:55:12,880
and sulfur go together to make something

3330
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:15,119
that resembles a protein in the plant

3331
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:16,719
but i so i was trying to figure out how

3332
01:55:15,118 --> 01:55:19,039
what the ratio is going to be for the

3333
01:55:16,719 --> 01:55:20,399
plants the use of this as a humic and

3334
01:55:19,039 --> 01:55:22,560
fulvic source

3335
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:24,559
and so i was using it at different

3336
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:27,440
ratios one to three hundred seemed to be

3337
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:30,159
about the right amount

3338
01:55:27,439 --> 01:55:31,839
but what happened was i burned all my

3339
01:55:30,158 --> 01:55:34,479
plants because i was treating with

3340
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:35,440
sulfur there's a dom sulfur with wetting

3341
01:55:34,479 --> 01:55:37,919
agent

3342
01:55:35,439 --> 01:55:40,158
but guess which plants didn't burn at

3343
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:41,920
all the ones that i had treated with one

3344
01:55:40,158 --> 01:55:43,519
to three hundred of shellajit i mean

3345
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:45,520
they were like they almost literally

3346
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:47,280
like thrived by it

3347
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:49,280
so then i started doing some research

3348
01:55:47,279 --> 01:55:51,679
and i was like what is this relationship

3349
01:55:49,279 --> 01:55:53,599
between what is it and it's just

3350
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:55,039
iron and sulfur

3351
01:55:53,599 --> 01:55:56,880
and i don't know what's happening in the

3352
01:55:55,039 --> 01:55:58,719
plant but they're creating some kind of

3353
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:01,359
a protein so i'm very curious now what

3354
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:03,679
was that word you used for a carrier

3355
01:56:01,359 --> 01:56:05,679
it's called a cediro4

3356
01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:08,079
sediro4

3357
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:10,960
yeah i don't know how to spell that so

3358
01:56:08,079 --> 01:56:12,800
sorry i'll look it up okay

3359
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:14,800
okay we have a whole list of things to

3360
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:17,039
list from this show

3361
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:18,159
well we have like i said

3362
01:56:17,039 --> 01:56:20,079
i mean i just

3363
01:56:18,158 --> 01:56:22,399
we could do this with with so many

3364
01:56:20,079 --> 01:56:24,399
people i mean oh god yeah

3365
01:56:22,399 --> 01:56:26,238
and and there's so many brilliant people

3366
01:56:24,399 --> 01:56:27,198
that never get a platform so if we were

3367
01:56:26,238 --> 01:56:29,519
able to

3368
01:56:27,198 --> 01:56:30,879
use our platforms you know it's not like

3369
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:32,000
we don't have a huge platform or

3370
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:34,400
anything but we do have our little

3371
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:36,800
platforms that we have the message out

3372
01:56:34,399 --> 01:56:38,079
and i think uh as far as living soil you

3373
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:41,039
know

3374
01:56:38,079 --> 01:56:43,840
it is the future of growing i mean it is

3375
01:56:41,039 --> 01:56:44,960
absolutely 100 i know i'm biased on that

3376
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:47,119
but

3377
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:49,039
i i just can't see um

3378
01:56:47,118 --> 01:56:51,039
especially labor and

3379
01:56:49,039 --> 01:56:52,560
you know the cost of soil like when i

3380
01:56:51,039 --> 01:56:55,760
worked at this commercial facility in

3381
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:56,560
denver we bought bagged soil

3382
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:58,800
right

3383
01:56:56,560 --> 01:57:01,199
so we were ripping bags of soil filling

3384
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:02,719
like 10 000 square foot rooms

3385
01:57:01,198 --> 01:57:04,559
i mean

3386
01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:07,039
cost effectiveness is but we weren't

3387
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:08,800
even buying totes you know and shoveling

3388
01:57:07,039 --> 01:57:10,560
it out they thought it was quicker just

3389
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:13,599
but we were probably paying three bucks

3390
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:15,199
extra a bag for that that quickness um

3391
01:57:13,599 --> 01:57:17,279
and you know

3392
01:57:15,198 --> 01:57:18,479
thousands of bags is what we were using

3393
01:57:17,279 --> 01:57:20,158
and then what do you do with the bags

3394
01:57:18,479 --> 01:57:21,839
you stick them in the dumpster

3395
01:57:20,158 --> 01:57:23,759
yeah

3396
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:25,920
and we uh all of our material and stuff

3397
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:29,280
we we threw away we didn't reuse any of

3398
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:31,359
that oh right oh the damn facility that

3399
01:57:29,279 --> 01:57:33,198
we worked out they were like uh

3400
01:57:31,359 --> 01:57:36,319
supposedly green or whatever and they

3401
01:57:33,198 --> 01:57:38,638
were paying to have their stuff like

3402
01:57:36,319 --> 01:57:40,799
removed on site and then recycled

3403
01:57:38,639 --> 01:57:43,199
um so then when we brought up like well

3404
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:44,159
why don't we just use it you know in our

3405
01:57:43,198 --> 01:57:45,598
own stuff

3406
01:57:44,158 --> 01:57:48,479
right

3407
01:57:45,599 --> 01:57:51,440
they didn't like that idea no

3408
01:57:48,479 --> 01:57:53,839
yeah the waste box farm yeah fox farm is

3409
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:54,799
shit and if you guys grow with that

3410
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:56,400
stuff

3411
01:57:54,800 --> 01:57:58,880
i encourage you to try something else

3412
01:57:56,399 --> 01:58:00,559
and see what your shirt looks like yep

3413
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:02,719
here here

3414
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:05,199
yeah rocks from the river to get like

3415
01:58:02,719 --> 01:58:06,719
iron and yeah

3416
01:58:05,198 --> 01:58:09,039
badass

3417
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:09,039
nice

3418
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:14,960
what did the burn look like with jadam

3419
01:58:13,599 --> 01:58:18,639
um

3420
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:21,920
typical like sulfur burn like it uh it

3421
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:23,840
sort of eats the leaf away like if you

3422
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:25,520
notice it uh i think

3423
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:26,880
burst comes up is kind of like yellow

3424
01:58:25,520 --> 01:58:28,320
spots and then pretty soon you've got

3425
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:30,639
holes in your leaves and it progresses

3426
01:58:28,319 --> 01:58:32,399
over a period of days like

3427
01:58:30,639 --> 01:58:35,679
it's not pretty you can do that with a

3428
01:58:32,399 --> 01:58:38,479
sulfur burner too i mean i you know i

3429
01:58:35,679 --> 01:58:40,480
yeah it didn't take much to burn either

3430
01:58:38,479 --> 01:58:42,479
um

3431
01:58:40,479 --> 01:58:45,198
i can't remember what my application

3432
01:58:42,479 --> 01:58:46,479
rate was but i think it was

3433
01:58:45,198 --> 01:58:49,439
maybe

3434
01:58:46,479 --> 01:58:51,919
just a quarter teaspoon above what was

3435
01:58:49,439 --> 01:58:53,598
prescribed it wasn't much it wasn't much

3436
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:55,840
over so you want to be careful with your

3437
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:57,360
use of sulfur for sure or

3438
01:58:55,840 --> 01:59:00,079
use a buffering

3439
01:58:57,359 --> 01:59:02,158
agent and again sulfur in that form

3440
01:59:00,079 --> 01:59:04,158
again we're really using that to kill

3441
01:59:02,158 --> 01:59:06,799
russet mites yeah that's that's what

3442
01:59:04,158 --> 01:59:10,079
that's about yeah but i mean that's it's

3443
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:12,719
an extreme it's going to

3444
01:59:10,079 --> 01:59:14,800
it's not it's not the best thing i won't

3445
01:59:12,719 --> 01:59:16,399
do now that i know this relationship i

3446
01:59:14,800 --> 01:59:18,079
will never do that again

3447
01:59:16,399 --> 01:59:20,638
i will never i don't i don't actually

3448
01:59:18,079 --> 01:59:22,399
use the job sulfur i'm actually the bae

3449
01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:23,520
laurel that we talked about with preston

3450
01:59:22,399 --> 01:59:26,399
last time

3451
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:28,320
that it so i had um hemp aphids last

3452
01:59:26,399 --> 01:59:30,719
year because i had my hemp license last

3453
01:59:28,319 --> 01:59:33,920
year i had hemp aphids and i did and i

3454
01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:36,800
had brussets as well and that bay laurel

3455
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:39,599
with the jadam wedding agent what and

3456
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:42,079
literally in two days put the population

3457
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:43,760
into such a great control that the

3458
01:59:42,079 --> 01:59:45,679
what i was doing with the natural korean

3459
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:48,159
natural farming kicked in and the plants

3460
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:50,639
you know overcame their own stress

3461
01:59:48,158 --> 01:59:52,559
so i don't really uh

3462
01:59:50,639 --> 01:59:54,159
and this year i'm not using anything i'm

3463
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:56,239
only using korean natural farming and

3464
01:59:54,158 --> 01:59:58,960
i'm using um

3465
01:59:56,238 --> 02:00:01,118
the living soils and you know

3466
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:02,960
that's it i mean

3467
02:00:01,118 --> 02:00:05,118
you don't really need anything else you

3468
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:07,039
don't need anything on all cylinders

3469
02:00:05,118 --> 02:00:09,118
yeah you don't need it

3470
02:00:07,039 --> 02:00:10,960
what would you recommend instead of fox

3471
02:00:09,118 --> 02:00:13,118
farm i love their setup what their other

3472
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:14,000
products suck um

3473
02:00:13,118 --> 02:00:15,598
i

3474
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,439
you can make your own i mean that's what

3475
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:19,360
i that's what i would do yeah

3476
02:00:17,439 --> 02:00:21,598
that's what we doing

3477
02:00:19,359 --> 02:00:24,479
aurora organics they make a pretty good

3478
02:00:21,599 --> 02:00:27,119
bagged soil um

3479
02:00:24,479 --> 02:00:28,879
again though it's it's not apples to

3480
02:00:27,118 --> 02:00:30,639
apples kind of thing like if if you're

3481
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:31,840
using a bag soil compared to like

3482
02:00:30,639 --> 02:00:33,760
something you

3483
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:37,440
built and made yourself i mean it is a

3484
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:40,800
night and day difference yeah um

3485
02:00:37,439 --> 02:00:43,598
you have the compost

3486
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:45,679
so you're practically almost there right

3487
02:00:43,599 --> 02:00:47,520
maybe just try um

3488
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:50,719
building your own soil and using like a

3489
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:52,880
sphagnum pumice rice holes

3490
02:00:50,719 --> 02:00:56,719
a little bit of worm castings use those

3491
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:57,679
worms and run that as your soil and

3492
02:00:56,719 --> 02:00:59,679
if you

3493
02:00:57,679 --> 02:01:02,158
if you set that up a few weeks

3494
02:00:59,679 --> 02:01:03,679
beforehand it'll be ready to go

3495
02:01:02,158 --> 02:01:05,198
right away for your plants and you just

3496
02:01:03,679 --> 02:01:06,880
plant right into that

3497
02:01:05,198 --> 02:01:08,719
as a clone

3498
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:10,400
yeah

3499
02:01:08,719 --> 02:01:11,520
healing earth

3500
02:01:10,399 --> 02:01:13,598
that's

3501
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:15,360
i mean how can you say anything better

3502
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:18,079
than that if you can make your own if

3503
02:01:15,359 --> 02:01:19,118
you can get as local as possible

3504
02:01:18,079 --> 02:01:20,479
um

3505
02:01:19,118 --> 02:01:21,920
and again if you could really like

3506
02:01:20,479 --> 02:01:24,000
understand the companies that you're

3507
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:25,279
buying this stuff from there are a lot

3508
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:27,520
of companies out there that are

3509
02:01:25,279 --> 02:01:29,519
omni-certified and i can tell you from

3510
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:30,400
experience when i worked at a company

3511
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:31,840
that

3512
02:01:30,399 --> 02:01:34,559
we went through the process of being

3513
02:01:31,840 --> 02:01:36,400
army certified is bullshit

3514
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:39,520
they never came and checked anything it

3515
02:01:36,399 --> 02:01:42,399
was all on our word um so

3516
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:44,639
just because something is army certified

3517
02:01:42,399 --> 02:01:46,638
they did go out of their way better than

3518
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:48,800
another company but

3519
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:50,880
the reality at least with that program

3520
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:53,039
is that they just paid money to get that

3521
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:54,719
logo i mean there's not really

3522
02:01:53,039 --> 02:01:56,800
as far as i know there was no one that

3523
02:01:54,719 --> 02:02:00,158
ever came to our facility and checked

3524
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:03,360
what we did well what our sop was if we

3525
02:02:00,158 --> 02:02:05,279
dropped compost on the ground um

3526
02:02:03,359 --> 02:02:07,519
you know stuff like that and for it to

3527
02:02:05,279 --> 02:02:08,800
be organic we're not supposed to

3528
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:09,920
if it falls on the ground we're not

3529
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:11,279
supposed to put it back in the machine

3530
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:12,800
well i can assure you that like

3531
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:14,319
sometimes when mistakes were made and

3532
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:18,800
something fell on the ground it was put

3533
02:02:14,319 --> 02:02:20,559
back in the machine you know i mean so

3534
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:22,079
really know the you know there's brands

3535
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:23,440
out there that you know if you guys want

3536
02:02:22,079 --> 02:02:25,920
to reach out to me that i could probably

3537
02:02:23,439 --> 02:02:28,319
like tell you offline and stuff but

3538
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:30,000
um i have no problem saying bullshit to

3539
02:02:28,319 --> 02:02:32,319
advanced nutrients and fox farm and

3540
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,800
stuff they've been ripping off uh new

3541
02:02:32,319 --> 02:02:36,319
farmers and it's time for a paradigm

3542
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:38,079
shift you guys i mean i'm gonna tell you

3543
02:02:36,319 --> 02:02:40,079
about what i did like i have

3544
02:02:38,079 --> 02:02:41,920
um indoor beds that are four by four and

3545
02:02:40,079 --> 02:02:44,479
i built them up myself i didn't buy the

3546
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:45,920
fancy double bag the double sided bags

3547
02:02:44,479 --> 02:02:48,319
whatever i don't have the money to do

3548
02:02:45,920 --> 02:02:50,560
that so i've built my own beds i use and

3549
02:02:48,319 --> 02:02:52,399
i've been gardening outside so i used

3550
02:02:50,560 --> 02:02:54,719
wood chips in the bottom and i used my

3551
02:02:52,399 --> 02:02:57,359
own soil and i topped it with compost

3552
02:02:54,719 --> 02:02:58,960
and then i topped it with car with wood

3553
02:02:57,359 --> 02:03:01,118
chips and then i topped it with straw

3554
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:03,039
and started using you know started

3555
02:03:01,118 --> 02:03:05,359
inoculating with the bugs and everything

3556
02:03:03,039 --> 02:03:08,079
and let them kind of do the work of

3557
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:09,920
bringing those beds into order and it

3558
02:03:08,079 --> 02:03:11,439
was scary to do that because i didn't

3559
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:13,039
know what kind of pathogens i was

3560
02:03:11,439 --> 02:03:14,960
bringing in i didn't know what kind of

3561
02:03:13,039 --> 02:03:17,198
insects i was bringing in but i did it

3562
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:19,520
anyway and my beds are

3563
02:03:17,198 --> 02:03:22,319
just getting better and better and

3564
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:23,280
better and better and the only problem

3565
02:03:22,319 --> 02:03:24,960
that i

3566
02:03:23,279 --> 02:03:26,639
the only problem that i

3567
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:29,840
didn't foresee and i've learned a lot

3568
02:03:26,639 --> 02:03:33,760
from it is those darn pill bugs dude

3569
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:35,520
i have an overrun of pill bugs because

3570
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:37,760
they are you know they're they're they

3571
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:39,679
break things down but they also each

3572
02:03:37,760 --> 02:03:42,000
baby shoots and they keep me from being

3573
02:03:39,679 --> 02:03:43,679
able to have a very good cover crop

3574
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,560
because they're literally eating all the

3575
02:03:43,679 --> 02:03:46,560
shoots

3576
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:49,360
so i hand

3577
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:52,000
trapped all as many of those as i could

3578
02:03:49,359 --> 02:03:54,559
out of my beds and that's why i have the

3579
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,319
bin i have is because i was just taking

3580
02:03:54,560 --> 02:03:58,159
all the critters i was trapping from my

3581
02:03:56,319 --> 02:03:59,759
beds and moving it into that bin and now

3582
02:03:58,158 --> 02:04:02,238
i have that as a kind of

3583
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:04,079
a pre-digester add some like

3584
02:04:02,238 --> 02:04:05,198
leaves if you add some magnolia leaves

3585
02:04:04,078 --> 02:04:07,118
to them yes

3586
02:04:05,198 --> 02:04:10,319
they'll eat that instead of the

3587
02:04:07,118 --> 02:04:12,479
shoots oh god god it's been annoying but

3588
02:04:10,319 --> 02:04:14,799
i finally put my muscovy ducks i like

3589
02:04:12,479 --> 02:04:16,479
built a little and i moved them from bed

3590
02:04:14,800 --> 02:04:18,560
to bed and they literally ate all the

3591
02:04:16,479 --> 02:04:22,519
pillpops

3592
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:24,639
yeah and i was having cover crops

3593
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:26,320
yeah in a in a

3594
02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:29,199
fantastic relationship with the worms

3595
02:04:26,319 --> 02:04:31,198
and the the springtails but again

3596
02:04:29,198 --> 02:04:32,960
anything is out of control if anything

3597
02:04:31,198 --> 02:04:34,319
is too much where it's almost become

3598
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:36,639
like an alpha

3599
02:04:34,319 --> 02:04:38,000
uh yeah then you have issues whether

3600
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:39,840
it's and you just bring your next and

3601
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:42,479
tropical in tropic level which for you

3602
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:44,960
is the rabbits like it's so brilliant i

3603
02:04:42,479 --> 02:04:46,799
am in love with this the rat i want the

3604
02:04:44,960 --> 02:04:49,039
rabbits

3605
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:50,880
yeah the rabbits are a game changer oh

3606
02:04:49,039 --> 02:04:53,599
my goodness and that's just bringing the

3607
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:55,520
next level up the next trophic level up

3608
02:04:53,599 --> 02:04:57,199
you're you're integrating that into your

3609
02:04:55,520 --> 02:05:00,079
systems because nature wants to

3610
02:04:57,198 --> 02:05:01,439
naturally progress towards succession

3611
02:05:00,078 --> 02:05:03,118
so you're bringing in these higher

3612
02:05:01,439 --> 02:05:04,879
successional levels and with these

3613
02:05:03,118 --> 02:05:07,920
things like the ducks or the or the

3614
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:10,078
rabbits or or the higher level insects

3615
02:05:07,920 --> 02:05:12,560
or yeah it's beautiful

3616
02:05:10,078 --> 02:05:14,559
and if i uh if i didn't have like hoa

3617
02:05:12,560 --> 02:05:17,199
restrictions i would probably start

3618
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:19,440
messing around with alpacas

3619
02:05:17,198 --> 02:05:19,439
that's

3620
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:22,560
as great as rabbit manure is it's

3621
02:05:21,679 --> 02:05:25,199
probably

3622
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:27,760
the best uh alpaca's probably twice

3623
02:05:25,198 --> 02:05:30,000
twice as good as that i just have never

3624
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:30,880
raised alpacas or anything but

3625
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:34,000
um

3626
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:38,319
gorgeous their stuff is next level

3627
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:39,439
malibu compost is definitely overrated

3628
02:05:38,319 --> 02:05:41,039
i don't know what they're charging

3629
02:05:39,439 --> 02:05:43,759
anymore but i remember that it

3630
02:05:41,039 --> 02:05:46,000
definitely felt overpriced

3631
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:48,639
and if you guys again do your research

3632
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,639
on that like

3633
02:05:48,719 --> 02:05:53,118
biodynamic farming is definitely a

3634
02:05:51,920 --> 02:05:55,279
system

3635
02:05:53,118 --> 02:05:59,198
but

3636
02:05:55,279 --> 02:06:01,039
biodynamic farming is not

3637
02:05:59,198 --> 02:06:03,759
like how do i say this the right way

3638
02:06:01,039 --> 02:06:06,560
biodynamic farming still has a bit of

3639
02:06:03,760 --> 02:06:08,800
metaphysical things to it to where if

3640
02:06:06,560 --> 02:06:10,800
somebody as a brand is saying that they

3641
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:13,520
are making you a product using only

3642
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:15,440
biodynamic farming that is probably one

3643
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:17,280
of the reasons why

3644
02:06:15,439 --> 02:06:19,439
tina and i experienced the issues that

3645
02:06:17,279 --> 02:06:23,039
we did is because they probably had a

3646
02:06:19,439 --> 02:06:24,158
human being make a mistake

3647
02:06:23,039 --> 02:06:24,960
and that's

3648
02:06:24,158 --> 02:06:30,598
so

3649
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:30,599
i'm not knocking it it's just um

3650
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:34,399
there's a lot of metaphysical things for

3651
02:06:32,399 --> 02:06:36,719
that and i think people still even today

3652
02:06:34,399 --> 02:06:38,158
like they still think like the rams horn

3653
02:06:36,719 --> 02:06:39,198
is something that is

3654
02:06:38,158 --> 02:06:41,359
um

3655
02:06:39,198 --> 02:06:43,839
like really needed and in reality it was

3656
02:06:41,359 --> 02:06:45,598
just what they had back then right right

3657
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:47,760
and it does serve a function but those

3658
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:49,679
but it's a non-transparent function and

3659
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:51,679
you have but yet the korean natural

3660
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:53,920
farming has every

3661
02:06:51,679 --> 02:06:56,000
piece of tool that you'd ever gain i

3662
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:57,840
mean they're both systems are

3663
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:00,479
kind of reflective of each other and yet

3664
02:06:57,840 --> 02:07:02,319
i do appreciate the simplicity and the

3665
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:05,039
transparency behind natural farming

3666
02:07:02,319 --> 02:07:06,960
techniques like it's so simple specific

3667
02:07:05,039 --> 02:07:09,519
but oh my goodness so simple and you're

3668
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:10,719
getting the same results i mean

3669
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:12,639
and then

3670
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:14,319
chicken poop is filled with nitrogen but

3671
02:07:12,639 --> 02:07:16,880
again that's a hot manure so you're

3672
02:07:14,319 --> 02:07:18,158
gonna have to wait and compost that down

3673
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:20,078
um

3674
02:07:18,158 --> 02:07:22,879
i would personally use alfalfa meal

3675
02:07:20,078 --> 02:07:24,639
instead of uh chicken poop for uh

3676
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:26,159
nitrogen source

3677
02:07:24,639 --> 02:07:29,199
and again nitrogen is like the

3678
02:07:26,158 --> 02:07:31,439
goldilocks principle right you only want

3679
02:07:29,198 --> 02:07:34,000
her to be right there in the middle of

3680
02:07:31,439 --> 02:07:36,319
her nitrogen uptake because especially

3681
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:38,960
if you're using like a nitrate nitrogen

3682
02:07:36,319 --> 02:07:40,799
she's going to eat that even in flour so

3683
02:07:38,960 --> 02:07:43,520
if you're pumping her full of those

3684
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:45,520
nitrate nitrogens uh your yields are

3685
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:47,760
going to suffer your quality is going to

3686
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:48,960
suffer but yeah you're still eating that

3687
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:50,239
nitrogen

3688
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:52,399
so if you keep it more at that

3689
02:07:50,238 --> 02:07:54,238
goldilocks level where you do get that

3690
02:07:52,399 --> 02:07:56,319
kind of fade as she's starting to go

3691
02:07:54,238 --> 02:07:58,078
into flower and turn

3692
02:07:56,319 --> 02:08:00,319
then you kind of know you're at

3693
02:07:58,078 --> 02:08:02,799
you're at that right right peak to where

3694
02:08:00,319 --> 02:08:04,960
she is still munching at it it is being

3695
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:06,159
removed from the fan leaf

3696
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:07,279
and then

3697
02:08:06,158 --> 02:08:09,118
for me i

3698
02:08:07,279 --> 02:08:12,078
i only take the families off if i feel

3699
02:08:09,118 --> 02:08:14,960
like it would improve a bud site um

3700
02:08:12,078 --> 02:08:16,719
i do believe in at least an indoor uh

3701
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:18,319
you know outdoor it's kind of silly

3702
02:08:16,719 --> 02:08:19,840
because it doesn't matter where the sun

3703
02:08:18,319 --> 02:08:22,399
is obviously it's the same amount of

3704
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:23,840
sunlight but indoor it does matter and

3705
02:08:22,399 --> 02:08:25,359
so i think that's where that part of

3706
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:28,639
that comes into is where you should

3707
02:08:25,359 --> 02:08:29,839
de-fan uh things that are covering buds

3708
02:08:28,639 --> 02:08:33,118
um

3709
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:35,199
but otherwise i try to keep the plant as

3710
02:08:33,118 --> 02:08:36,719
intact as possible i do like the

3711
02:08:35,198 --> 02:08:39,279
lollipop because i feel like that's

3712
02:08:36,719 --> 02:08:40,639
improved yields um

3713
02:08:39,279 --> 02:08:43,118
so there are a bunch of tips and tricks

3714
02:08:40,639 --> 02:08:45,760
we could talk about at another time yeah

3715
02:08:43,118 --> 02:08:47,679
that i do know is uh tried and true even

3716
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:52,079
on like a commercial level and

3717
02:08:47,679 --> 02:08:53,199
lollipopping is one of them cool man

3718
02:08:52,078 --> 02:08:56,719
well

3719
02:08:53,198 --> 02:08:58,479
have we come to a natural progression

3720
02:08:56,719 --> 02:09:00,960
yeah

3721
02:08:58,479 --> 02:09:04,559
two hours went by pretty quick yeah two

3722
02:09:00,960 --> 02:09:06,319
and a half maybe even

3723
02:09:04,560 --> 02:09:08,560
holy crow yeah

3724
02:09:06,319 --> 02:09:09,920
i'm surprised that my boys are upstairs

3725
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:11,760
and i didn't hear one peep out of them

3726
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:13,840
so wow you're proud of me

3727
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:16,079
you are getting rain right now

3728
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:18,560
yeah or it's about to for sure yeah

3729
02:09:16,078 --> 02:09:21,039
we're getting rain here well i can't

3730
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:23,360
wait to come see you and visit and um

3731
02:09:21,039 --> 02:09:25,439
let's have a chat soon we get busy and

3732
02:09:23,359 --> 02:09:28,238
then we

3733
02:09:25,439 --> 02:09:30,319
yeah we might do that uh weekly i know

3734
02:09:28,238 --> 02:09:32,799
tina and i um

3735
02:09:30,319 --> 02:09:34,960
uh she she compares that package it's

3736
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:37,119
not as good but uh

3737
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:39,198
it's a close it's a close one i would

3738
02:09:37,118 --> 02:09:41,279
run i would throw worms in that sheep

3739
02:09:39,198 --> 02:09:42,638
compost i mean if you have a bunch of

3740
02:09:41,279 --> 02:09:44,880
chicken

3741
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:47,760
wire alpacas next level because they

3742
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:49,760
have uh they have more than one stomach

3743
02:09:47,760 --> 02:09:51,599
like a cow oh they're right and their

3744
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:54,079
diet is um

3745
02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:55,840
really clean for an animal

3746
02:09:54,078 --> 02:09:57,118
so as long as you like let them graze

3747
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:59,440
and do their thing

3748
02:09:57,118 --> 02:10:02,000
the goats goats are good

3749
02:09:59,439 --> 02:10:04,000
yeah but don't um

3750
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:06,639
aren't aren't goats like gross i heard

3751
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:08,719
like i have oh i have four goats

3752
02:10:06,639 --> 02:10:11,199
don't they uh

3753
02:10:08,719 --> 02:10:13,679
don't they ejaculate all the time no so

3754
02:10:11,198 --> 02:10:15,439
so no because you just you get a weather

3755
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:16,560
so i have one male that's a weather so

3756
02:10:15,439 --> 02:10:18,238
he's fixed

3757
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:19,760
oh yeah you wanted the billy goats

3758
02:10:18,238 --> 02:10:22,799
different the billy goat's a different

3759
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:24,239
thing yeah that's different but um

3760
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:26,560
they're amazing they're smarter than

3761
02:10:24,238 --> 02:10:29,039
dogs and i walk them twice a day and

3762
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:31,360
they respond to my nose and they're

3763
02:10:29,039 --> 02:10:33,279
really amazing animals

3764
02:10:31,359 --> 02:10:35,279
and that's easier to keep than alpaca i

3765
02:10:33,279 --> 02:10:37,679
think alpacas are fairly sensitive to

3766
02:10:35,279 --> 02:10:39,679
predation perdition creation

3767
02:10:37,679 --> 02:10:42,800
predictions guys are more like dogs too

3768
02:10:39,679 --> 02:10:44,239
like that okay personalities and uh

3769
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:46,719
no goats don't eat everything that's

3770
02:10:44,238 --> 02:10:49,039
such you guys oh my god i think

3771
02:10:46,719 --> 02:10:51,520
wait i think witches owned goats because

3772
02:10:49,039 --> 02:10:53,920
they've been sort of uh people have so

3773
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:54,960
many misconceptions about goats

3774
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:57,440
um

3775
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:59,279
they're like natural medicine finders

3776
02:10:57,439 --> 02:11:00,559
they will only eat the things that are

3777
02:10:59,279 --> 02:11:02,960
at the perfect

3778
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:05,520
medicinal quality so you can actually as

3779
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:08,719
an herbalist do a lot of um

3780
02:11:05,520 --> 02:11:11,040
figuring out harvest times and at peak

3781
02:11:08,719 --> 02:11:12,399
times to harvest using a goat as an

3782
02:11:11,039 --> 02:11:15,198
indicator there are

3783
02:11:12,399 --> 02:11:17,118
other amazing creatures

3784
02:11:15,198 --> 02:11:18,960
uh big haired poppy

3785
02:11:17,118 --> 02:11:20,639
cow would be

3786
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:23,039
next level if you could find like an

3787
02:11:20,639 --> 02:11:25,599
organic source

3788
02:11:23,039 --> 02:11:28,399
the problem is is that even in malibu

3789
02:11:25,599 --> 02:11:30,480
that supposedly was that way

3790
02:11:28,399 --> 02:11:33,839
i had heard that like that bovine growth

3791
02:11:30,479 --> 02:11:35,439
hormone somehow got into their stuff

3792
02:11:33,840 --> 02:11:36,719
and as far as i understand anything

3793
02:11:35,439 --> 02:11:39,439
that's being done

3794
02:11:36,719 --> 02:11:41,279
dairy-wise

3795
02:11:39,439 --> 02:11:44,078
they always use that thing they always

3796
02:11:41,279 --> 02:11:45,759
use that growth hormone

3797
02:11:44,078 --> 02:11:47,118
unless it's like an organic

3798
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:49,760
and

3799
02:11:47,118 --> 02:11:52,639
i don't really know an organic

3800
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:55,280
pure organic dairy

3801
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:58,000
cow manure source so if you guys do know

3802
02:11:55,279 --> 02:11:59,279
uh one please let us know i'm all about

3803
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:01,920
using different

3804
02:11:59,279 --> 02:12:03,519
um sources it's not like i'm it's not

3805
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:06,480
being biased or anything it's just the

3806
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:08,480
fact that like if you can't source it or

3807
02:12:06,479 --> 02:12:10,399
if you know like using malibu could

3808
02:12:08,479 --> 02:12:11,919
potentially fuck up your entire crop

3809
02:12:10,399 --> 02:12:14,719
then i'm not going to

3810
02:12:11,920 --> 02:12:15,840
spend full retail to buy their product

3811
02:12:14,719 --> 02:12:17,920
and then

3812
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:20,719
you know just to have diversity that

3813
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:23,279
that's not worth it to me yeah no your

3814
02:12:20,719 --> 02:12:24,560
farmer man you know your grower

3815
02:12:23,279 --> 02:12:26,800
yeah

3816
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:28,560
horse manure is best as long as you know

3817
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:30,480
you take the time to compost it and i

3818
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:33,039
would vermicompost that

3819
02:12:30,479 --> 02:12:35,118
again there's a lot of like

3820
02:12:33,039 --> 02:12:36,960
there's a lot of things that

3821
02:12:35,118 --> 02:12:38,559
horse manure and cow manure can have in

3822
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:40,960
it that um

3823
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:42,719
if you're growing where your product is

3824
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:43,760
tested you could fail

3825
02:12:42,719 --> 02:12:45,760
um

3826
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:46,960
microbial testing here

3827
02:12:45,760 --> 02:12:49,039
um

3828
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:52,960
like what do they call that just

3829
02:12:49,039 --> 02:12:55,519
pathogen just pathogen you fail

3830
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:55,520
yeah yeah

3831
02:12:55,679 --> 02:12:58,319
yeah all right well if you guys don't

3832
