1
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:09,899
why don't you tell us what's on what's

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,949
on the menu today a lot of different

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:17,310
options here this is my repurposed jar

4
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:22,920
of gay cush bought from MJ to celebrate

5
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:25,159
I no longer yeah a little but this

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,840
[Music]

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,439
exactly and in remembrance members of

8
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:33,899
July our noon and then for the CBD we've

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,960
got the gift from THC design which is a

10
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,179
CBD flower high in limonene pining and

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,469
mercy which I mentioned because you

12
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:41,808
actually get to taste them in the ghost

13
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,969
which is my favorite part

14
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:48,449
and then for concentrates we've got a

15
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:53,210
honestly of just kind of cheap not great

16
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:56,160
CBD isolate from bang it's like really

17
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,719
it's very inexpensive that's how I feel

18
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,639
about it I feel very good about how

19
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,558
inexpensive it is container looks this

20
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,939
container feels like yeah this is this

21
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,420
is a whitest thing in the world

22
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:07,679
oh yeah it's not no very very light no

23
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,329
and if you compare that to action

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,750
expensive if you're better quality oh

25
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:11,399
yeah

26
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,349
that's glass this is like 20 times the

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,590
weight of that way exactly yeah so then

28
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:20,519
this is I believe also a brand of THC

29
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,650
design called resin and it's crescendo

30
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:27,298
is the strain so it's only gonna get

31
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:29,130
better and louder a nice nice yeah this

32
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,659
is however the most difficult lid to get

33
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:32,609
off because it's a teeny tiny thing and

34
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,600
uses like a pressure well it looks like

35
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:37,739
it's taped shut it's not trust me

36
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,589
except for that part no it's not look

37
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:42,030
look it's not it's childproof okay no

38
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,640
it's childproof in the sense of like if

39
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,049
your hands are at all oily it's almost

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:54,329
impossible to get yeah and if you're

41
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:56,579
already high just leave the lid off I'd

42
00:01:54,328 --> 00:02:01,649
like to turn our attention to the head

43
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:04,859
of engineering this guy right here what

44
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,540
I thought would be cool is to have a

45
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:11,159
conversation about industrial

46
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:13,260
design sure and kind of the the

47
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:16,560
trade-offs that go into product

48
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:19,199
development and the macgyvering of

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,789
solutions to make something happen that

50
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,969
you want to happen that doesn't

51
00:02:20,789 --> 00:02:27,120
currently exist so can kind of talk

52
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:30,300
about the product development process of

53
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,240
developing the ghost babe sure can you

54
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,460
hand me the ghost man please unless your

55
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,350
hands are too oily from how the we'd do

56
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:42,450
you want the constructive one it's the

57
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:45,959
constructed one is perfect yeah well

58
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:47,669
this is your baby yeah it's our baby

59
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,370
it's and it's very iconic you know I

60
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:52,229
mean the shape the form there's nothing

61
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,879
out there like it and and that in and of

62
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:56,639
itself from an industrial design

63
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,849
standpoint is is you know a goal

64
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,469
definitely to get something where people

65
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:03,239
first don't know what it is and then

66
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:05,039
they start to become familiar with it

67
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,170
enough to know that wow that's that's a

68
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,849
ghost I can recognize that immediately

69
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:11,579
and that's that is kind of like the

70
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:15,900
visual recognition we have from from

71
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:19,920
this form and shape a couple really cool

72
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:22,110
things about this one is that the device

73
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:25,399
just fits in your hand so comfortably

74
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:27,720
you know the ergonomics of this make you

75
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,700
even no matter how you hold it in your

76
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:32,189
hand initially eventually you find the

77
00:03:29,699 --> 00:03:36,179
right spot because it just leads your

78
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:38,819
hand to the right position and part of

79
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,280
that is due to this this cutout here for

80
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,509
your thumb which when you're vaping and

81
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,250
there's a little button that's kind of

82
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:46,709
like disguised in that surface but you

83
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:49,979
can you can feel it really nicely and

84
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,750
it's if most of it is that your hand is

85
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,149
in the perfect position when you're

86
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,759
ready to vape and when you're activating

87
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,129
the vape button but the other part I

88
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:02,310
love about this design is that the

89
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:04,439
rounds and the shape of this make you

90
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,909
want to play with it a little bit make

91
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:08,189
you want to just move your thumb around

92
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:11,879
on there until you find the perfect spot

93
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:13,979
and it's very very comfortable in that

94
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:16,798
position the other thing that I really

95
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:18,120
like about it is this this belly in the

96
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,899
front here which actually has a

97
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,860
technical purpose

98
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:25,299
also really helps you grab it so that I

99
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,770
know exactly where my fingers are gonna

100
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,449
go it's almost like the handle of

101
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:30,758
something that's really comfortable to

102
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:33,520
hold and my thumb goes there and that's

103
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:38,199
just you know that that's just perfect

104
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:41,438
the other thing yeah so the the center

105
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:43,749
part is what actually we have patents on

106
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:45,939
and does all the air handling and the

107
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:48,490
cooling and the heating of of the the

108
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:51,278
flow through the device so when you draw

109
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,379
here you're actually pulling air through

110
00:04:51,278 --> 00:04:56,709
this heat sink and down through the

111
00:04:53,379 --> 00:04:59,229
outer collar of this basically a pipe

112
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:01,239
and when it gets down to where the

113
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:03,158
heater is it actually preheats by moving

114
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:06,610
back and forth across where the heater

115
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:11,079
is located preheating your air and then

116
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:15,819
it goes through the cannabis in the in

117
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:17,709
the crucible and then it does the same

118
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:19,930
thing in Reverse up here it actually

119
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:21,218
cools down so this tunnel is the right

120
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,199
size to be able to deal with that

121
00:05:21,218 --> 00:05:26,019
airflow the crucible inside with the

122
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,110
material in it and the preheat and the

123
00:05:26,019 --> 00:05:31,389
cooldown cycles are just right and

124
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:34,750
balanced so that you can get a really

125
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:37,449
good cool draw from it so the the draw

126
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,620
is very very cool and comfortable versus

127
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:41,528
other things that might be a little bit

128
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:43,478
harsh or it's sometimes it's hard to

129
00:05:41,528 --> 00:05:44,649
even quantify it but it feels like it's

130
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:46,508
just a little bit harsh on the throat

131
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:50,050
this doesn't do that just because it's

132
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:53,278
cooling cooling the vapor down before it

133
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:57,699
gets to your mouth so the compromise is

134
00:05:53,278 --> 00:05:59,588
that you're exposing this feature from

135
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:02,228
the insides it's really a pipe so some

136
00:05:59,588 --> 00:06:04,838
of it has to be exposed underneath or

137
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:08,050
the shape of it requires the outer

138
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:09,939
enclosure to be the shape however it

139
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,978
works perfectly because that's where

140
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:14,139
your fingers go naturally so that's

141
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:18,370
that's the benefit of this shape and

142
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:20,800
that's the technical limitation if you

143
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,689
want to call it that that we have but

144
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,310
it's also extremely easy to get this

145
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:28,949
heat sink out and to and to clean it

146
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:32,079
which I which I really love about that

147
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:33,040
and it's it's funny because as soon as

148
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,870
you oh

149
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,210
and this it may not be intuitively

150
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,430
obvious as to how to take this out

151
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:42,370
because it's meant to integrate really

152
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,199
well and I found that the best way is

153
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,449
just really to push the green area and

154
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,939
it just comes right up and so that's

155
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:50,439
something you know then that's one of

156
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:52,420
the struggles I think because that part

157
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:54,009
of that is that part of this device is

158
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,199
not as intuitive as I would have liked

159
00:06:54,009 --> 00:07:01,329
it liked it to be but once you know it

160
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:06,539
it's super super easy so you don't come

161
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:11,109
from a background of developing babe

162
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:13,240
devices so like when you the challenge

163
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:17,170
is laid in the front like were you a

164
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,490
smoke a vaporizer smoker before like do

165
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,640
you have experience with lots of

166
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:25,569
different beep not right like I could do

167
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:29,500
it better or not at all I had personal

168
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:33,040
experience in in the category for years

169
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:36,759
I've been either smoking because I

170
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:40,240
didn't know what vaporizers or using a

171
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:42,310
bong or something like that joints and I

172
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,990
knew nothing about this my background

173
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:46,720
and my whole professional career has

174
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:51,310
been in consumer product design so

175
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:54,460
anything from computer joysticks to Lego

176
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:57,629
to water pitchers coffee makers things

177
00:07:54,459 --> 00:08:01,299
that are very high touch products so in

178
00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:04,230
amazingly large volumes and integrate

179
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:07,780
technology in a really meaningful and

180
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:09,520
interesting way so with this you now

181
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,979
know what the homework assignment is

182
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:14,709
what did you like start researching and

183
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:18,069
reading up like talk about the the

184
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:19,810
process of what was the mandate what was

185
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:22,599
it like do you have a price point if you

186
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:26,680
have a product size or weight you know I

187
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:29,680
think what it all comes down to is is

188
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:31,269
trying as much of the competitive units

189
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,330
that are out there you got to give

190
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:36,848
everything a shot whether you're not you

191
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:39,370
think you know it you have to use it you

192
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:40,540
can't look at anything and assume either

193
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:42,310
by the way it looks or by what you've

194
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:44,069
heard on the market that you know it so

195
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,779
yeah there's a lot of background

196
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,910
we talked about what you liked and

197
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:49,860
disliked like as you were trying like

198
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:51,419
what products were you trying out and

199
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,490
what were you like oh this is kind of

200
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:56,639
ingenious or I could improve on this

201
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:59,180
part well I think you know each one has

202
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,049
its own limitations as ours does as well

203
00:08:59,179 --> 00:09:04,649
you know there there are some

204
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:06,689
limitations here and there but I'm

205
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,759
trying to think of what might jump out

206
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,660
as being you know something that was

207
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:14,970
like as an example for me the first

208
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:17,089
dryer vaporizer I ever tried was the

209
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,430
Sapir remember the one that was like a

210
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:22,350
it had a long straw at the top do you

211
00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:24,449
guys ever try that I think so yeah yeah

212
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,759
and they were for me the first one and I

213
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,410
was like this thing is brilliant you

214
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,080
know I think the first one I really

215
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:34,139
tried and again I'm a relative newcomer

216
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,060
to the category but I think the one I

217
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:38,100
tried was was the packs just because

218
00:09:36,059 --> 00:09:40,319
everyone was talking about it and it

219
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,320
seemed very consumer product key you

220
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,500
know very like a consumer product and so

221
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,450
I used it and you know compared to

222
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:51,269
smoking a bowl there's a lot of

223
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,460
convenience there but one of the things

224
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:56,759
I really didn't like is the the flavor

225
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:59,790
and the taste just kind of you know it

226
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:03,029
didn't the flavor to me kind of tasted

227
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:05,759
burned or yes I've heard people say pop

228
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:08,759
corny and that's kind of what I taste it

229
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:12,090
as well and so as you disassembled a

230
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:14,970
product like that did you identify like

231
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:17,910
why it has a burnt taste to it

232
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:20,960
sure yeah why was it well I think

233
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:23,939
there's a lot of the way that the

234
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:28,950
material is heated up has a lot to do

235
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:31,980
with it and the fewer the less contact

236
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:34,590
you can have of hot surfaces with the

237
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,560
the cannabis itself the better because

238
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:40,410
as soon as you heat things up the

239
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:43,109
contact just burns things it's just

240
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:44,639
going to be like leaning up against a

241
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,220
really hot engine of a car you're gonna

242
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:50,039
you're gonna burn yourself and the weed

243
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,960
suffers from that where the ghost is

244
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:55,049
different is that we're actually just

245
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:57,240
sending hot air it's true convection and

246
00:10:55,049 --> 00:11:00,318
convection is your your the hay

247
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,428
the air is sorry the heat is actually

248
00:11:00,318 --> 00:11:05,099
distributed into the air and the air

249
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:06,899
goes through all the parts of the of the

250
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,860
consumable that's inside there so it's

251
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:12,869
not the way to look sadly probably the

252
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,970
best example for this in this specific

253
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:18,178
case here is the difference to retain a

254
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,829
an electric stove and a gas stove so the

255
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:22,078
PAC's is an electric stove and that with

256
00:11:19,828 --> 00:11:23,638
electric stove you turn it on the coils

257
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,859
take a while to heat up it heats your

258
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,688
pan up and then once you've once you're

259
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,519
done cooking you turn that off

260
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,748
but the coils take a while to cool down

261
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,549
the pan takes a while to cool down

262
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:32,869
everything has tests take time to cool

263
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:35,278
down

264
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:36,689
that's the PAX that's any conduction

265
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,299
vaporizer that's the PAX that's the

266
00:11:36,688 --> 00:11:40,860
mighty that's the solo that's every

267
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:43,349
other vaporizers on the market except me

268
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,970
- the Firefly right but ghost being an

269
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,800
on demand vaporizer is much more like a

270
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:49,470
convection stove where you put your pan

271
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,299
down you turn it on gas comes on heats

272
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,069
immediately once you're done cooking you

273
00:11:51,299 --> 00:11:55,498
turn the gas off heat dies immediately

274
00:11:53,068 --> 00:11:58,139
right and because we're using a a

275
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:59,639
medical-grade ceramic crucible that heat

276
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:01,318
dissipates from the crucible which is

277
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:02,490
what we're holding the flower in that

278
00:12:01,318 --> 00:12:04,229
heat dissipates from the crucible very

279
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,639
quickly so as soon as you turn the heat

280
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,769
off as soon as you let go of that button

281
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:08,938
and you stop drawing you stop applying

282
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:11,009
heat to the flower and makes it

283
00:12:08,938 --> 00:12:12,659
extremely efficient which is probably

284
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:13,980
the I think it's the only device that

285
00:12:12,659 --> 00:12:16,169
I've ever used that has that same kind

286
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:17,730
of functionality by the way while we're

287
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,828
talking about this critical

288
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:23,610
functionality let's pack that with some

289
00:12:19,828 --> 00:12:25,138
yeah let's do that let's do the gift

290
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:27,899
let's start with some CVD let's start

291
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:29,490
light because I think this will be this

292
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:33,600
is my favorite demonstration of the

293
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:35,188
actual flavor so we'll do so here this

294
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,509
is actually a great example of the

295
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:39,509
biggest problem that I have with the

296
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:43,558
Ghost which is that I am incapable of

297
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:46,019
grinding a single crucible worth because

298
00:12:43,558 --> 00:12:47,818
I just grind a hell of because it's like

299
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,350
no matter how tiny of a nug I grab it's

300
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:53,688
always too much and I actually don't

301
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,689
know if I have I have an empty crucible

302
00:12:55,509 --> 00:13:01,870
empty crucible okay so a great example

303
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:04,659
is if you try to use if you were to try

304
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:07,120
to grind for like a joint or a bong or

305
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:09,009
anything this amount would just not be

306
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,948
enough this is like a teeny tiny little

307
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:13,720
nug but this tiny tiny little nug will

308
00:13:11,948 --> 00:13:15,969
probably be a little bit too much for a

309
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,670
crucible like 1/10 of a gram is a lot

310
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,070
smaller than you ever imagined

311
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:23,409
particularly when you grind it and I

312
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:25,750
personally like to use the our

313
00:13:23,409 --> 00:13:27,730
Phoenician grinder that we have branded

314
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,948
here because it gives a very kind of

315
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:33,129
corks loose grind which is really ideal

316
00:13:29,948 --> 00:13:36,458
for convection yes you actually talked

317
00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:38,799
about the coarseness grind and different

318
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:41,439
yeah why is it coarser grind better

319
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,990
versus a yeah yeah so if you think about

320
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,339
it if you think about it the what he was

321
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,698
just described he was describing about

322
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:50,680
the air flow is because we're not baking

323
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:53,078
because we're not heating the actual

324
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:54,489
oven that the material is kept in

325
00:13:53,078 --> 00:13:56,679
because we're drawing we're heating by

326
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,750
drawing air across it if you grind to

327
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:00,669
fine or you pack to tight there's no

328
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,990
space for the air to go and so typically

329
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:03,429
what you'll end up if you grind it to

330
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:06,009
fine or packet through tight what you'll

331
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:07,778
end up at the end is a hot crucible M no

332
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:09,309
vapor I find nothing coming out of the

333
00:14:07,778 --> 00:14:11,049
end but the crucible itself will be very

334
00:14:09,309 --> 00:14:13,719
hot and that means that the air has

335
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:15,068
nowhere to go and it's getting stuck so

336
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,839
if you grind it really if you grind it

337
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:18,458
really loose you pack it nice and loose

338
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,470
it gives that air plenty of space to

339
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:22,149
travel over the flour to transmit its

340
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:25,740
heat he'd love to create that vapor

341
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:28,419
really even distribution exactly exactly

342
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,009
and I personally like this grinder as

343
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:33,659
well because it's got this nice rounded

344
00:14:30,009 --> 00:14:36,698
bottom that happens to perfectly fit the

345
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:40,179
contours of our crucible so this is a

346
00:14:36,698 --> 00:14:42,578
nice want to get that it's a nice loose

347
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:43,838
grain and I like to just straight out

348
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:46,028
the crucible either straight out of the

349
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,209
grinder I like to just kind of scoop it

350
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:51,970
up pretty loosely give it a nice little

351
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:54,189
kind of brush off the top that's not too

352
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,259
much packing nice and loose so you can

353
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,300
kind of see that it's it's packed pretty

354
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:04,208
loosely in there like you can see space

355
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:06,278
around it and that's ideal I'm pretty

356
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:08,089
sassy and I'm pretty satisfied now

357
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:10,189
graded by high hopes

358
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:12,470
got really high hopes that this is going

359
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:15,380
to produce a lot of a before us like I

360
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,910
see my deny scene so one of the things

361
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:19,669
that I like about the crucible system as

362
00:15:16,909 --> 00:15:21,319
well is that you can pre pack a bunch so

363
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:25,189
we use the we have this nice little

364
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,930
crucible dispenser I actually know we'll

365
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:29,420
bring you one we've been I was like

366
00:15:26,929 --> 00:15:31,159
that's the on the go it's they've been

367
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:32,509
so popular we had a such a hard time

368
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:33,980
keeping them in stock and finally have

369
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:40,279
them back in stock we're sending them

370
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:42,230
all out so whose idea was that whoever

371
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:44,000
first said oh I want to have a whole

372
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,820
bunch would be able to pre pack yeah

373
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,980
during my day so whoever said that was

374
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,350
the one who invented it yeah so like

375
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:53,149
Steve was saying the once we actually

376
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:55,279
load the crucible in here if you notice

377
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:57,199
they're a tiny little they're teeny tiny

378
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:59,569
perforations on the bottom of it and on

379
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:01,520
the top and those are specifically so

380
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,410
that the air can travel through the

381
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,789
flour and not get caught there and not

382
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:06,919
heat the crucible too much and not heat

383
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:08,329
it up but the here airs gonna be

384
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,500
superheated down here we're gonna draw

385
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:11,060
it up through the flour it's gonna go

386
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,080
through the heat sink and if we're

387
00:16:11,059 --> 00:16:14,299
talking about comparison to other

388
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,650
devices that heat sink is probably the

389
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:17,659
biggest difference personally when I

390
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:19,610
tried the when I tried the packs myself

391
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:21,230
the thing that bothered me the most is

392
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,840
that that mouthpiece got really hot

393
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:25,789
really fast like after one drawer so I

394
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,830
felt I remember feeling a tingling on my

395
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:29,000
lips I was like what's so strange and

396
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:31,190
then I realized that is because the

397
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,559
whole device was getting too hot one hit

398
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,850
but this because of the heatsink and the

399
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,409
fact that the mouthpiece is actually

400
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,180
separated from the rest of the device so

401
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:40,209
it's like a it's like one of those no

402
00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:42,919
heat pan handles right mm-hm

403
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:51,050
but melfi's never gets hot even at high

404
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:52,579
temperatures so yeah well cuz I want the

405
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:55,639
the reason I'm going into the app here

406
00:16:52,580 --> 00:17:03,310
so we have 3 we have 5 presets preset

407
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:09,200
temperatures of 338 362 390 to 405 and

408
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:10,669
then 428 I believe those are the 5 no

409
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,440
hilariously enough actually because

410
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,610
we're converting from Celsius because

411
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,259
it's all based in Celsius and we're

412
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:17,269
converting it is impossible to set it to

413
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:19,730
420 it was a huge oversight but we'll

414
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:21,328
fix it yeah yeah it's the downside every

415
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,389
vaporizer that's based on the Celsius

416
00:17:21,328 --> 00:17:26,428
temperature scale can't hit 420 just

417
00:17:24,388 --> 00:17:28,709
because of the conversion it's funny so

418
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:30,119
anyway so I will connect it to my app

419
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:31,970
and the reason I want to connect to the

420
00:17:30,118 --> 00:17:37,079
app is so that I can set the temperature

421
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:39,210
specifically for mersin and limonene and

422
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:40,980
mining which are at a very specific

423
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:43,230
temperature that I have saved to my

424
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,929
phone in a fantastic little graph that

425
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:48,450
we like to keep track of so PI 9 is at

426
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:51,600
311 degrees is when that terpene

427
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:54,149
vaporizes Mersin is at 334 and limiting

428
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:56,069
is at 349 so what I'm gonna do is I'm

429
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:58,618
gonna set this my custom temperature

430
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:59,970
here all right it set the custom

431
00:17:58,618 --> 00:18:02,548
temperature so I'm gonna set the

432
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,200
temperature here to 311 and my my first

433
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,908
temperature here that's gonna get us

434
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,600
mostly pining its that lowest

435
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:12,509
temperature so because it's a convection

436
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:16,408
vaporizer your lungs are part of the

437
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:19,259
machine right so like the the volcano is

438
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:20,759
going to use a fan to blow air across it

439
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:22,120
but here we're using our lungs to draw

440
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:38,200
it across

441
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:42,408
[Music]

442
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:46,038
very pine-sol so interestingly I was

443
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:49,570
using this with Cameron jodieandandy

444
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:51,648
from Fiddler's Green yes your

445
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:54,468
expectation is you're gonna blow out

446
00:18:51,648 --> 00:18:57,218
this huge billowy puff of smoke

447
00:18:54,469 --> 00:18:59,570
you don't which I think from an end-user

448
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:03,440
standpoint you're like is it working in

449
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:06,288
your highest fuck so can you guys talk

450
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,509
about that because I think perception

451
00:19:06,288 --> 00:19:10,128
perception wise people are expecting

452
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:11,929
that they're like is this thing now I

453
00:19:10,128 --> 00:19:13,848
kept thinking I needed to crank up the

454
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:14,989
temperature yep so I'm actually really

455
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:17,418
glad you asked that because this is

456
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:18,108
something that I've been like a passion

457
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:20,749
project of mine

458
00:19:18,108 --> 00:19:22,608
most recently which is there isn't a ton

459
00:19:20,749 --> 00:19:25,429
of research surprise surprise people

460
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:27,618
haven't done research but I would argue

461
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:29,829
that you're if you're getting the flavor

462
00:19:27,618 --> 00:19:32,088
and if you're getting the effect it

463
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:34,819
kinda doesn't matter if you're getting

464
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,989
visible vapor right it like weird what

465
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:37,939
you're just saying is that you're you're

466
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:39,588
used to blowing out a cloud right and so

467
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,419
if you're blowing out a cloud you are

468
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:43,638
likely at a very high temperature and

469
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:45,619
are vaporizing pretty much everything

470
00:19:43,638 --> 00:19:46,968
all in one go which is a huge waste or

471
00:19:45,618 --> 00:19:49,098
you're combusting I mean if you're using

472
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:51,259
a poorly constructed conduction

473
00:19:49,098 --> 00:19:52,189
vaporizer you're combusting right it's

474
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:53,690
gonna get to a too high of a temperature

475
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:56,209
in that case you're actually producing

476
00:19:53,690 --> 00:20:00,979
smoke not vaporize I I agree but I think

477
00:19:56,209 --> 00:20:02,839
there's an end user because you're sure

478
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:04,969
that's the first episodes you're like

479
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:06,858
this must not be working well the other

480
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:09,379
thing too is as soon as you start

481
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:11,388
exhaling and all that vapor goes out

482
00:20:09,378 --> 00:20:13,338
that's vapor that you're not consuming

483
00:20:11,388 --> 00:20:15,918
you're just bringing into your lungs

484
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:17,269
none of it has actually attached or very

485
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,459
little of it and then you're you're

486
00:20:17,269 --> 00:20:22,669
exhaling back out so there's some

487
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:25,219
element of less vapor is actually better

488
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:27,399
in that you're retaining more and you're

489
00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:30,440
you're consuming in a more delicate way

490
00:20:27,398 --> 00:20:33,498
we will get vapor at higher temperatures

491
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,028
for sure yeah you'll even get vapor so

492
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:37,098
you'll even find at the lower

493
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:39,108
temperatures I found that so this is

494
00:20:37,098 --> 00:20:40,129
right now at 311 degrees which is a

495
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:42,289
common temperature that you

496
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,610
don't get any vapor from but even on

497
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:45,740
just the second puff I already got some

498
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:47,509
vapor so a lot of it is a matter of the

499
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,099
cure of the flower how moist it is

500
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:50,329
sometimes you have to dry it out a lot

501
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:52,459
of people grind their flower and then

502
00:20:50,329 --> 00:20:53,480
let it sit out for an hour before they

503
00:20:52,460 --> 00:21:04,850
actually vape it because you wanna give

504
00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:06,950
that a chance to dry out this one is

505
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:10,159
pining so this is this tastes very much

506
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:11,630
like pine sometimes if you get if you

507
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,550
hit the right temperature particularly

508
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,740
with this flower the biggest downside is

509
00:21:13,549 --> 00:21:17,269
that if you hit the temperature between

510
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,670
pining and limonene which is about 338

511
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:21,470
just our lowest preset you get this

512
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,150
almost pine-sol flavor because you get

513
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,549
the lemon and the pine and it's a it's

514
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:30,470
like a it's a good flavor but it also

515
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:32,000
has the reminiscence Oh am i poison to

516
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:38,539
myself the XD oh just bring some fine

517
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,549
right now yeah is it going around the

518
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:42,500
circle I don't know about this it's the

519
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:47,839
circle is very small I think right now

520
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:49,009
the circles a dot there you go you want

521
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,149
to you want to set it up too

522
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:54,289
you want hit the pine you want to set it

523
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:56,030
up pining sure let me just do my name

524
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:59,509
put the pine in first and we'll settle

525
00:21:56,029 --> 00:22:01,369
up you can also do some this really fun

526
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:03,289
stuff you can temperature step so you

527
00:22:01,369 --> 00:22:05,659
can start at the low temperatures take

528
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:07,039
one long 15-second draw then step it up

529
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,960
to a slightly higher temperature take

530
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,609
another 15 second draw and if you want

531
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,090
to talk about getting big clouds if you

532
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:16,309
start at these lower temperatures yeah

533
00:22:14,089 --> 00:22:18,619
yeah see so this is still in a 311

534
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:20,659
degrees yeah I have not changed the

535
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:22,909
temperature it's still at 311 and that's

536
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,920
the fourth fourth or fifth it's the I

537
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:27,230
think it's the fourth yeah so you're

538
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,670
right very tasty yeah so with with flour

539
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:31,519
that's really dried out or kind of old

540
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:32,600
stuff you'll find that it it vapes of

541
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,450
the lower temperatures very easily

542
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:37,159
sometimes too easily but it's usually

543
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,539
because it's very dry it out like I

544
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,420
found that a lot of my old stuff that's

545
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:43,369
I've had for a long time it's just about

546
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,620
any temperature but good stuff that's

547
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:47,779
well preserved well cured I know so you

548
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:50,239
got the Boveda packets if you use those

549
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:51,889
to keep that yeah so if you use those to

550
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,970
keep your flower at a good moisture

551
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,470
level chances are pretty good that

552
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:57,059
put it in the end of the ghost or any

553
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:59,160
vaporizer you're gonna want to either

554
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:01,500
let it dry out a bit or hit it a really

555
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,330
low temperature to kind of to activate

556
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,529
it more so we boosting this baby now

557
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:08,339
well let's give it let's give Daniel a

558
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:12,539
try oh oh you want to you want to go

559
00:23:08,339 --> 00:23:16,679
other around you want right yeah go for

560
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:19,170
it give me some more

561
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,810
let's hit the industrial design part of

562
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:25,769
the conversation so what so we talked

563
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:27,960
about the like the crucible and the

564
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:30,629
heating like give me a challenge that

565
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:35,190
took a long time to find a clever

566
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:41,430
solution to hmm you know and a lot of

567
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:43,650
these devices I think the the layout is

568
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,029
fairly straightforward on a lot of these

569
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:48,570
so the air is gonna pass through a

570
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:50,849
heater and then pass through the

571
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:53,129
material and then go into your lungs I

572
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:56,279
think where it becomes difficult is

573
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:58,260
managing the firmware and figuring out

574
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:00,569
what the temperature set points are

575
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:03,839
going to be and it's not as as glamorous

576
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:07,740
as you might think but that's where most

577
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:10,470
of the challenges come in is what what

578
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:13,769
how do you drive the heater with the

579
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:18,990
batteries you have to consume the least

580
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:21,450
amount of power but you know provide the

581
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,190
most longevity and have the most

582
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:26,730
efficient thing it's it's a balance in

583
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:29,750
engineering about you know proper use of

584
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:32,849
the battery yeah and I think you know

585
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:34,980
and we want to be right sized as well so

586
00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:38,219
you know consuming the battery and

587
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:40,890
they're in the right amount to to deal

588
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,299
with someone's expected session use how

589
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:44,610
many times you're gonna pass it around

590
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:46,470
before you exchange the bowl I think is

591
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:48,329
you know this there's a lot of science

592
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:51,870
and engineering that goes into that so

593
00:24:48,329 --> 00:24:54,149
that's that's one thing you know from an

594
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:57,899
ID perspective a lot of it's all about

595
00:24:54,150 --> 00:25:00,390
organ a'm --ax and balance I think the

596
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:03,360
other important part of this is for

597
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:05,380
instance the front in enclosure on this

598
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:10,049
device is all casts

599
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:12,790
which adds a forward waiting to it and

600
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:14,500
balances very well so that when you're

601
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:16,269
holding it in your hand and it just

602
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,819
feels right and a lot of the times

603
00:25:16,269 --> 00:25:21,309
weight contributes is that the reason

604
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:22,569
you use cast Inc or is that just a it's

605
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:24,609
has to do with the temperature I guess

606
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:28,240
so talk about the wreath what is cast

607
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:32,559
Inc good for well why does one use cast

608
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:35,500
as Inc well good question but I think a

609
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:38,950
lot of it is a durability for the most

610
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:43,390
part there's there's a lot of plastics

611
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:46,360
that can do that but zinc is very bio

612
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:48,880
neutral it's it's very safe material

613
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:50,469
it's also super strong and it adds the

614
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,820
right amount of weight if you think

615
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:54,910
about making it out of aluminum that

616
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:58,960
wouldn't be as heavy and wouldn't give

617
00:25:54,910 --> 00:26:00,880
it that that quality feel it also reason

618
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,250
it's very very durable so if we were to

619
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,010
make this out of say plastic and you

620
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:08,200
dropped it on the ground in cold weather

621
00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:11,470
it would probably likely be a brittle

622
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,539
failure this material is strong

623
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,279
everywhere and you know when we design

624
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:16,720
something we have to anticipate all the

625
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,250
use and all the abuse you're going to

626
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,720
see people are going to drop it out of

627
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:22,000
their pocket people are going to leave

628
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,970
it in their cars overnight or even on

629
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,519
the dashboard underneath their

630
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:29,140
windshield so when you design a product

631
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,450
you have to think about all those edge

632
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:34,030
cases because they're not as uncommon as

633
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:35,470
you think they'd be and it's just

634
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:37,029
something that you have to design for

635
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:38,829
that people are going to be use the

636
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:41,079
product what happens when they do that

637
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:43,179
hopefully they get to use it another day

638
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:45,669
and that's the goal of you know the

639
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:48,910
design team well some of it some of this

640
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:51,789
leads into having to make trade-offs

641
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:54,370
when you develop a product of things you

642
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:57,309
want to maybe put in it like materials

643
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:59,189
or features but you also want to hit a

644
00:26:57,309 --> 00:27:01,659
price point so can you talk about

645
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:04,120
something that you wanted to do but you

646
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,250
had to leave on the idea floor because

647
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:10,358
you couldn't hit the price point you

648
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:16,669
wanted to hit for the market hmm

649
00:27:10,358 --> 00:27:21,678
it's a great question I would have to

650
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:23,239
say that you know where where there's a

651
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,269
bit of product improvement that could

652
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:27,679
happen on this and that where I think

653
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:29,868
you use the word compromise I think

654
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:35,119
that's that's a reasonable word here is

655
00:27:29,868 --> 00:27:37,728
that the interface is was initially

656
00:27:35,118 --> 00:27:39,829
thought of to be simple with one button

657
00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:43,369
you can get everywhere well with that

658
00:27:39,829 --> 00:27:46,509
simplicity has a little bit of you know

659
00:27:43,368 --> 00:27:49,069
interface user interface issues and

660
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:50,989
while certainly it's easier for people

661
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:52,788
who are programming it it's not one

662
00:27:50,989 --> 00:27:54,979
button and how long you hold it and in

663
00:27:52,788 --> 00:27:56,658
what order is is critical and give you

664
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:59,690
the right output the user these days

665
00:27:56,659 --> 00:28:01,519
wants to just push the button go and

666
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:03,019
they wanted to know they want it to be

667
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,868
as smart as they are they wanted to

668
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:07,848
anticipate everything that they want

669
00:28:05,868 --> 00:28:10,608
without saying it that's kind of what

670
00:28:07,848 --> 00:28:13,368
our devices do now so you know we took

671
00:28:10,608 --> 00:28:16,189
the route of one button does all and it

672
00:28:13,368 --> 00:28:18,048
really does a lot of things that many

673
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:21,558
vapes don't do just from the button

674
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:23,148
alone most vapes need the ones that are

675
00:28:21,558 --> 00:28:25,819
app connected need that app to give it

676
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:28,218
that additional versatility well the the

677
00:28:25,819 --> 00:28:29,838
I think the the biggest comparison is

678
00:28:28,219 --> 00:28:32,058
the Firefly is the only other real

679
00:28:29,838 --> 00:28:34,848
convection vaporizer out there right and

680
00:28:32,058 --> 00:28:36,710
after using it they also only have a

681
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:38,808
single button relate but that button all

682
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:41,509
it does is turn it on and off yeah all

683
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:43,398
it does is start the start the

684
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:44,989
temperature increasing and stop the

685
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:46,368
temperature increasing and so you're

686
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,749
required to use an app and if you don't

687
00:28:46,368 --> 00:28:49,608
want to have to use your app your can

688
00:28:47,749 --> 00:28:50,989
out of luck yeah that's right I mean

689
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:54,019
sometimes I just want to sit on my porch

690
00:28:50,989 --> 00:28:55,759
and you know use my clothes paper and I

691
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:56,298
don't want to have to worry about where

692
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,429
my phone is

693
00:28:56,298 --> 00:29:01,249
you know I I don't care what the phone

694
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:02,809
is I you know I'm here I'm ready to vape

695
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:06,308
I want to relax why should I get my

696
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:10,308
phone and so we have the ability of

697
00:29:06,308 --> 00:29:12,229
adjusting many many things and you know

698
00:29:10,308 --> 00:29:15,019
that's important what the device does

699
00:29:12,229 --> 00:29:16,669
without an app at all without being app

700
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:18,200
enabled some people don't want to attach

701
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:20,839
their device to an app I get it

702
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,730
well so it has to be as capable there as

703
00:29:20,838 --> 00:29:23,259
it is with

704
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:25,480
yeah and what I like is that you can use

705
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:26,859
the app to set it and then you don't

706
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,960
have to use the app so you can use the

707
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:31,000
app to set the two custom temperatures

708
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,440
and then once you've set them you don't

709
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,880
have to use the app again you can just

710
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,230
switch to those custom temperatures and

711
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,370
know that they are yeah so like I've got

712
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,740
one of the custom temperatures set

713
00:29:36,369 --> 00:29:40,149
whatever 349 right now is that the

714
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,589
limonene we're just we're gonna hit next

715
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,180
right and then I got the other custom

716
00:29:41,589 --> 00:29:45,069
temperature set to 428 which I always

717
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:48,580
like to clean up any bowl I like to sure

718
00:29:45,069 --> 00:29:52,899
and you know I think another let's not

719
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:54,129
say compromise but design selection has

720
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,560
been the battery

721
00:29:54,130 --> 00:30:02,380
you know the batteries are super capable

722
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:04,240
has to 18 650 cells in here and what you

723
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:07,570
can do is integrate the cells themselves

724
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,750
into the device and close the door and

725
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:13,450
some people do that some people you know

726
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:16,359
and but what we decided to do was make

727
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:19,029
this a custom battery integrated with

728
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:21,519
the back so that you're really using the

729
00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:23,500
least amount of wall thickness that you

730
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,139
need to make the plastic do what it

731
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:28,019
needs to do there are a lot of different

732
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:32,770
ways of doing this I think in this case

733
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:35,769
it's an extremely economical and nice

734
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:37,539
touch but you know those decisions

735
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:39,639
aren't easy for any designers or

736
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:41,649
developers there's so many options out

737
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:44,980
there on which way to go you really have

738
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:49,930
to think about usability and you know

739
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:51,160
refurbishment you know just there's a

740
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:53,019
lot of different considerations to

741
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,640
battery selection how long you want it

742
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:58,569
to last you know we decided to make ours

743
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,860
last a hell a long time and you know and

744
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:02,319
so that's that's what we have here

745
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:05,259
something that maybe is slightly bigger

746
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:07,059
than than others but again with the

747
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:09,849
ergonomics you don't feel it as much and

748
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:13,419
it really gives you the the feel of a

749
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:19,389
super capable device and and it gives

750
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:20,590
you you know you know as well the other

751
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,940
the other advantage that once you start

752
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:23,199
looking at the once you start

753
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,680
considering the idea of a removable

754
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,470
battery

755
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,700
I mean able to take it out probably one

756
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,440
of my favorite accessories is the fast

757
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,059
charger mmm being able to have

758
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,990
particularly having two batteries be

759
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:33,970
able to just pop one out

760
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:35,140
leave one always on the fast charger on

761
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:37,390
the desktop and then

762
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:39,759
whenever I even basically whenever I

763
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:41,259
leave my house I just grab whatever the

764
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:42,730
charger is on the whatever batteries on

765
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:44,769
the charger and pop it in and I know

766
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:47,440
every time I've got a full charge so it

767
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:49,119
makes it super super easy there are

768
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,980
plenty of devices that have batteries

769
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:52,989
and have good batteries also have

770
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:55,179
eighteen 650s but they all plug in and

771
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:56,470
if you're if you were you know about to

772
00:31:55,179 --> 00:32:01,540
head out and you realize that your but

773
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:05,190
your vape is dead I'm really cool about

774
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:07,750
this bag is that you can charge it

775
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:09,340
through a USB you don't need a custom

776
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,480
charger oh you don't even need to put on

777
00:32:09,339 --> 00:32:11,829
the fast charger you can just take the

778
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,140
battery off and charge it via the USB

779
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:16,990
well yeah yeah you can I hope you

780
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:18,520
haven't been wasting your time in a fast

781
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,990
charger no no no you can charge it this

782
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,789
way but but the benefit to that is I

783
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:24,490
don't have you know wherever I have a

784
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:26,889
USB cable that I can charge it up yeah I

785
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:30,190
don't need to oh now it's dead and go

786
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:32,770
home to my custom charger yeah and I

787
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:35,919
mean not to keep using this word but the

788
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:37,690
Firefly does that and I actually have a

789
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,090
Firefly that I've been playing with and

790
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,140
you know whenever you go somewhere you

791
00:32:40,089 --> 00:32:43,629
have to either make sure that the

792
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:45,520
battery soup-like fully charged or bring

793
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:47,559
the charger along with you I'd rather

794
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,389
just bring my USB camera do you like I

795
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:52,089
mean I have so many different types of

796
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:55,150
devices and a camera equipment right

797
00:32:52,089 --> 00:32:57,269
audio equipment I have smoking equipment

798
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:59,410
and anything that uses standard

799
00:32:57,269 --> 00:33:02,259
standardization is beautiful versus

800
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:03,880
proprietary proprietary drives me crazy

801
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:05,619
sorry yeah the same that's what we have

802
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,570
so that's where that's kind of the the

803
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:09,339
idea of balance as well is that we have

804
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:11,918
the removable battery with a proprietary

805
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:13,149
connector and a proprietary fast charger

806
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,400
that you can sit at home and you can

807
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,690
charge nicely but like you were saying

808
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,759
if you're on the go if you've got a

809
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:20,590
bunch of other devices that also use

810
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:22,329
micro USB you're never without a charger

811
00:33:20,589 --> 00:33:25,629
so you have that kind of flexibility in

812
00:33:22,329 --> 00:33:28,210
it which I appreciate so we just tried

813
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,980
some drier I want to mix it up let's go

814
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:37,569
straight you want to go straight to

815
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:38,829
concentrates all right so really quick

816
00:33:37,569 --> 00:33:41,889
before I move from the concentrates

817
00:33:38,829 --> 00:33:43,779
though I'd like to point out with flower

818
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:46,780
vaporizers with dryer vaporizers like

819
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:47,788
this the the biggest judge one of the

820
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:49,108
best judges of them

821
00:33:47,788 --> 00:33:52,408
is what your flower looks like

822
00:33:49,108 --> 00:33:56,069
afterwards okay so here's here's the

823
00:33:52,409 --> 00:33:57,989
example here so we had what I had like

824
00:33:56,069 --> 00:34:01,499
to click four hits before I passed it so

825
00:33:57,989 --> 00:34:02,909
I went four five six seven eight nine I

826
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:05,460
think I took another one so we'll just

827
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:08,220
call it ten hits at 3:11 degrees and

828
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:09,929
this is not even brown this this

829
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:12,298
specific crucible I could bump this up

830
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:13,980
to probably 349 get another four or five

831
00:34:12,298 --> 00:34:17,009
good hits and I can probably get another

832
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:19,108
five or six good hits at 428 so I always

833
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,760
tell people depending on how you use it

834
00:34:19,108 --> 00:34:23,369
depending on the temperatures depending

835
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,049
on your process you can get a whole heck

836
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:27,929
of a lot so how many more hits are you

837
00:34:25,048 --> 00:34:29,190
gonna could you get from that across all

838
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:32,369
the temperature ranges probably another

839
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:33,780
six to ten we might I guess yeah yeah

840
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:35,338
realistically that's after another

841
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,470
already hit taking nine hits out of them

842
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:39,449
so conceptually that's actually pretty

843
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:43,078
interesting the idea of almost like

844
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:44,939
watching your terpene intake of like

845
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:46,589
yeah I'm gonna do this slice and I'm

846
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,048
gonna get these terpenes that this

847
00:34:46,588 --> 00:34:52,378
specific terpene that I'm gonna like

848
00:34:49,048 --> 00:34:54,929
move on over to the limonene or whatever

849
00:34:52,378 --> 00:34:58,230
uh-huh yeah what a great example of that

850
00:34:54,929 --> 00:35:00,960
what I like to do is there are there are

851
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:04,679
two cannabinoids that I love Delta 9 THC

852
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,480
and THC v the reason I love them is

853
00:35:04,679 --> 00:35:09,960
they're both you for ian's so they give

854
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,838
you that kind of euphoria hi and Delta 9

855
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:17,130
THC vaporizes at 315 degrees which is

856
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:18,659
very very low and THC v vaporizes at 428

857
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,920
degrees which is typically what you're

858
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:22,019
getting when you're smoking if you're

859
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,088
smoking at all whether a joint a bong

860
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:25,920
anything you're getting a whole heck of

861
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:27,420
a lot more that THC because it's at that

862
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,250
high temperature that's one of the

863
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:32,220
reasons why you associate this kind of

864
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:34,588
euphoria high with smoking and it's a

865
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:35,879
very common it's very common feeling

866
00:35:34,588 --> 00:35:37,858
when you smoke in general and that's why

867
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,030
a lot of people find vaporizing it's a

868
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:41,130
very different experience because you

869
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,240
typically aren't hitting it at that 428

870
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,858
and you're getting these kind of

871
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:45,298
in-between cannabinoids that give you a

872
00:35:43,858 --> 00:35:47,298
little more sometimes a little more

873
00:35:45,298 --> 00:35:51,539
mellow high and little difference to it

874
00:35:47,298 --> 00:35:52,798
so I like 315 and 428 allows you to

875
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:53,279
really like dial in what you're looking

876
00:35:52,798 --> 00:35:57,150
for

877
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:59,220
so for concentrates what I like is that

878
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,660
we use this we use the same crucible

879
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:01,529
system so it's the same medical grade

880
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:04,289
ceramic gruesome

881
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:08,070
all same stainless steel lid but we drop

882
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:10,079
in this stainless steel mesh pad and the

883
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:12,000
pad is what actually captures the

884
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,130
melting and concentrate so you stick a

885
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,500
little rice grain size amount on the pad

886
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,390
and then on the first heat up it melts

887
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,610
it in and then every other draw after

888
00:36:18,389 --> 00:36:23,039
that you're really kind of vaping this

889
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:24,750
stainless steel sponge essentially

890
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,429
that's holding all that concentrate what

891
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:28,079
that also allows that I like is that you

892
00:36:26,429 --> 00:36:29,219
can then once you're done pop the whole

893
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,869
thing out and drop everything in

894
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:33,689
isopropyl and it just kind of cleans

895
00:36:30,869 --> 00:36:38,099
itself so easily the the easiest cleanup

896
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:39,210
for concentrates so did you have

897
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:41,279
anything else you want to add about

898
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:43,230
going on to concentrate some when you're

899
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,220
when you're vaping it on the pad the pad

900
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,420
actually lets you get all your

901
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:46,829
concentrate that's out of it so you're

902
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,119
not really wasting anything I'm not too

903
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,319
sure if you guys ever dab and you guys

904
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:51,119
ever dab you guys have to clean it with

905
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,380
a q-tip after and you're cleaning up

906
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,000
you're cleaning up all that constant

907
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,740
rate as with the mv-1 you're actually

908
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,940
vaping all of it out of the pad so

909
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:58,859
you're getting the full use out of your

910
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,630
concentrate which is crazy because you

911
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:03,480
could get like 15 to 20 hits off of a

912
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:04,710
concentrate pad so it goes back just as

913
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,110
just to the efficiency of the device

914
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:09,179
with flour with a concentrate super

915
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,620
efficient I mean 1/10 of a gram compared

916
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:11,969
to other baits on the market where they

917
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:14,909
use point three grams and we're using

918
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:17,009
point one we're saving them we're saving

919
00:37:14,909 --> 00:37:17,940
a lot of a lot of flour and going back

920
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,290
to what they were saying about the

921
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,309
heating system if you're just pushing

922
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:22,469
the button there and you're not drawing

923
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:24,269
your materials not burning you know

924
00:37:22,469 --> 00:37:26,519
because your lungs part of the system it

925
00:37:24,269 --> 00:37:27,929
becomes part of the vape so if if I'm

926
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:29,429
sitting here just pushing the button my

927
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:30,629
materials not gonna burn it's not going

928
00:37:29,429 --> 00:37:32,399
to waste which means it's not gonna come

929
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,990
bus either since there's no contact with

930
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,570
that with that heating element in your

931
00:37:33,989 --> 00:37:38,219
material right exactly yes yeah and for

932
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:39,480
concentrates you're really only you're

933
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:41,219
really only hitting it when you're

934
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,659
taking a draw and when you're pulling it

935
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:44,039
across it is when you're because we're

936
00:37:42,659 --> 00:37:46,019
still even for the concentrates we're

937
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:47,519
still using the same convection heating

938
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:48,750
we're still heating in the same way so

939
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:50,460
you get all the same benefits of the

940
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:52,500
on-demand it's one of the only places

941
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,420
that you can take out of your pocket

942
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,070
take a hit of your concentrates and then

943
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:58,590
put it back in your pocket making me

944
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:00,210
anxious here by just holding that ready

945
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,440
to be put in well I wanted to feel I

946
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:03,030
wanted to show that this is all you

947
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,679
needs this is about a little less than a

948
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,450
rice grain size amount this is all you

949
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:08,579
need so you drop it right here in the

950
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:10,118
middle of the middle of the screen here

951
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:11,498
I'm not a I'm not a

952
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:14,200
what that concentrates this is my first

953
00:38:11,498 --> 00:38:15,608
my first jar of it but I'm pretty happy

954
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:17,679
about it so drop it right there in the

955
00:38:15,608 --> 00:38:20,018
middle and you usually want it for

956
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:22,058
concentrates you want solids right if

957
00:38:20,018 --> 00:38:23,318
it's too liquid it's just gonna melt all

958
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:25,269
the way down through and you don't want

959
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:27,880
that so we you want to go with more the

960
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:29,229
more solid bit better in my opinion but

961
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:32,710
like I said the same one do you have

962
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:34,900
anything else on there we cover we cover

963
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,999
most of it yeah so put on the same

964
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:38,650
crucible stick in the same device so

965
00:38:36,998 --> 00:38:41,018
it's all the same stuff which makes a

966
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:42,999
lot easier and then for concentrates we

967
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:45,068
have one setting so I'll change the

968
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:47,169
setting on the device up from my custom

969
00:38:45,068 --> 00:38:49,568
all the way up to three Reds three Reds

970
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:51,608
means concentrate it's important that

971
00:38:49,568 --> 00:38:53,139
you don't try to do herbs in the

972
00:38:51,608 --> 00:38:53,889
concentrate mode because concentrate is

973
00:38:53,139 --> 00:38:56,379
at a much higher temperature

974
00:38:53,889 --> 00:38:57,788
understandably and you'll just burn your

975
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:01,318
flower and that's not good experience

976
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:03,579
but for the efficiency purposes we

977
00:39:01,318 --> 00:39:05,288
preheat the device for concentrate modes

978
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:06,999
so normally when you press the button

979
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:09,099
you're going to start heating and you're

980
00:39:06,998 --> 00:39:11,199
start drawing after about seven or ten

981
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:12,730
seconds to start drawing the heat across

982
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:14,078
it but for concentrates we're gonna

983
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,659
press on hold and you'll see it'll start

984
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:19,509
blinking as if we should be drawing

985
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:20,679
right now but instead it's preheating

986
00:39:19,509 --> 00:39:22,719
so we're preheating the air down here

987
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:28,778
we're kind of getting everything set up

988
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:30,219
and ready to go it'll take about and so

989
00:39:28,778 --> 00:39:32,048
once the yellow lights on then you know

990
00:39:30,219 --> 00:39:33,368
that you're at concentrate level and

991
00:39:32,048 --> 00:39:34,869
you're ready to go this will actually

992
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:36,910
turned on if you let it sit here for too

993
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:38,170
long and I'll turn back to green because

994
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:39,969
it's cooled down too much so I have

995
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,079
concentrate level will press it you can

996
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:42,909
just start drawing immediately and you

997
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:44,170
want to draw relatively slowly because

998
00:39:42,909 --> 00:39:46,538
you're drawing that heat across and

999
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:48,809
letting that that concentrate Milton to

1000
00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:48,809
the pad

1001
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,000
[Music]

1002
00:39:54,889 --> 00:39:58,528
and then going back to efficiency like

1003
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,088
you were saying on the device um with

1004
00:39:58,528 --> 00:40:00,989
your material with your flour especially

1005
00:40:00,088 --> 00:40:02,250
once you're done using it

1006
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:04,108
I tell people not to throw it away and

1007
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:05,730
save it because you can make edibles out

1008
00:40:04,108 --> 00:40:07,528
of it with later so you could really get

1009
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:09,929
that full lifecycle out of your material

1010
00:40:07,528 --> 00:40:11,940
that you're using in your rate because I

1011
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:13,828
know it prices are getting expensive now

1012
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,990
so 1/8 instead of rolling you three

1013
00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:17,940
joints you could have 35 crucibles you

1014
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:20,909
know yeah so yeah there's there's a

1015
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,019
super it's really it's really efficient

1016
00:40:20,909 --> 00:40:25,048
with with all the material you're using

1017
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:26,219
yeah I like to the I've always started

1018
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,630
since I started using the ghost I've

1019
00:40:26,219 --> 00:40:30,088
transitioned from buying really cheap

1020
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:32,369
eighths to buying really nice grams yeah

1021
00:40:30,088 --> 00:40:34,078
I have I have wheat that I only smoked

1022
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:36,088
in vapes because they have certain

1023
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,470
certain cannabinoids tincture peens that

1024
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:39,179
I want to hit and then there's certain

1025
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:40,348
weed that I had to smoke out of a bong

1026
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:45,239
or joint because I don't care about them

1027
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:46,230
you know so I really like Wonder Bread

1028
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:48,868
because they have a bunch of different

1029
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:50,699
cannabinoids in in their flower so

1030
00:40:48,869 --> 00:40:52,079
because of that they are you able to hit

1031
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:53,368
different flavors will to get different

1032
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,559
highs um with that because a lot of

1033
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:56,730
people will just want THC but what those

1034
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:57,720
with those terpenes you that's where you

1035
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:59,130
get the different flavors and things

1036
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:01,348
like that so that's why I don't always

1037
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:02,220
look for the highest THC flower but the

1038
00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:04,170
ones with the most different

1039
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:06,629
cannabinoids and wonder Bret has a bunch

1040
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,730
of those yeah exactly and so what it

1041
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:11,220
what is your current Wonderbread flavor

1042
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:13,440
I like the blueberry the blueberries

1043
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:15,088
really good yeah you know and speaking

1044
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,579
of that I think that one of the things

1045
00:41:15,088 --> 00:41:19,798
that people forget is you've everybody's

1046
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:22,589
been so trained at this point to go to a

1047
00:41:19,798 --> 00:41:24,239
go to a dispensary to smell a much

1048
00:41:22,588 --> 00:41:25,769
different flower to find that flower

1049
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:27,838
they really like and find a delicious

1050
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:29,969
flavor and they buy it based on that

1051
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:31,949
smells like awe smells so good I want to

1052
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:33,598
try this but as soon as you put it into

1053
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:36,689
your anything that's gonna combust put

1054
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,250
into a bowl a bong a pipe and you loot

1055
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:39,659
you lose most of that like if you roll

1056
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:41,460
it into a joint you smoke it you'll

1057
00:41:39,659 --> 00:41:42,778
usually get a hint if you get like a

1058
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,449
strawberry banana strain you'll get a

1059
00:41:42,778 --> 00:41:47,010
hint of that but you don't even realize

1060
00:41:45,449 --> 00:41:48,629
how much of those terpenes you're

1061
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:50,460
missing out on until you try it on the

1062
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:53,640
ghost like I've had people I've had

1063
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,750
people who really enjoy their specific

1064
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:56,219
strain we actually a fantastic example

1065
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:58,679
there was a grower at one of these

1066
00:41:56,219 --> 00:42:00,598
events that we went to that's been doing

1067
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:04,288
it for 15 20 years been the industry

1068
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:05,130
forever and he tried the ghost for first

1069
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:07,740
time and

1070
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:09,300
his like private stash is private

1071
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:11,609
straining the stream and he's had a

1072
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,620
million times that is like his his go to

1073
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:16,620
and he tried it in the mv-1

1074
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:17,039
and he was driven to tears my verge of

1075
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,809
tears

1076
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:20,119
eyes watering up and he said it's like

1077
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:23,039
he was tasting it for the first time

1078
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:25,289
which i think is a fantastic example of

1079
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:27,090
how when you've tried when you've been

1080
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:29,460
smoking weed and you're familiar with it

1081
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:31,170
so much you kind of get used to the low

1082
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:32,639
quality and it's only once you finally

1083
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,809
taste it in something that really

1084
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:35,730
highlights that flavor that you

1085
00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:36,900
understand everything that you're

1086
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:38,760
missing out on them and you go back to a

1087
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,590
joint and you're just it's kind of

1088
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,700
ruined for you you know yeah no you're

1089
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:43,590
you're completely right on that because

1090
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:45,389
I'm the same way the first time I resize

1091
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:46,650
I was like am i smoking oregano am i

1092
00:42:45,389 --> 00:42:48,299
smoking a herb like what did you guys

1093
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:50,099
put in this because I never tasted we

1094
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:52,170
never toasted like what it smelled like

1095
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:54,360
out of the jar so I think I think that's

1096
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:56,070
a good experience to that if you never

1097
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,570
tasted weed what it smells like you need

1098
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:58,980
a taste out of but ghosts vape and like

1099
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:01,920
what Collier says you could hit specific

1100
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:04,230
temperatures for specific terpene so you

1101
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,970
could even get more more of a better of

1102
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:08,670
experience that way so let me ask you a

1103
00:43:05,969 --> 00:43:10,949
question cuz when were in drier mud we

1104
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:13,079
were tranching we're going like right up

1105
00:43:10,949 --> 00:43:17,009
temperature-wise to hit and isolate

1106
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:19,889
specific terpenes and cannabinoids but

1107
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:21,630
in concentrate mode there's just one

1108
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:25,940
temperature temperature okay so can you

1109
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:28,650
talk about yeah yeah so concentrate is a

1110
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:30,480
concentrate is concentrate I mean it's

1111
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:34,230
it's a concentrated form so it's a much

1112
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,210
less complicated material that has far

1113
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:37,409
fewer compounds involved in it so we

1114
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,980
still got terpenes you still got

1115
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:42,149
cannabinoids but it's going to vaporize

1116
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:42,960
about the same temperature at that high

1117
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:44,639
temperature because you're not

1118
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,900
vaporizing the the terpenes and

1119
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:49,650
cannabinoids you're vaporizing the

1120
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:51,420
actual like material itself you're

1121
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:52,800
vaporizing the concentrate itself and

1122
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,300
that's gonna vaporize it's gonna

1123
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,740
vaporize at different temperatures but

1124
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,600
the temperature we have a set-to is the

1125
00:43:55,739 --> 00:43:59,519
one that will vaporize pretty much every

1126
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,449
concentrate around there so the reason

1127
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:03,860
you want to build a set different

1128
00:44:00,449 --> 00:44:05,819
temperatures for flour is that

1129
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:08,519
unflattering itself you want to vaporize

1130
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:10,170
the things that's that are in it and to

1131
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:12,539
do that you want to hit those very

1132
00:44:10,170 --> 00:44:15,349
specific temperatures that's the that's

1133
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:15,349
the simple version yeah

1134
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:24,430
just like yeah so no definitely not so

1135
00:44:20,469 --> 00:44:26,379
is it against TV oh yeah yeah I can get

1136
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:29,799
into a lot of the specifics for flour

1137
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:31,210
are the quality of the flour in general

1138
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:33,789
as far as where it was grown how it was

1139
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:35,440
grown the age of the flour so sometimes

1140
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:37,090
if it's far too old when you grind it

1141
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,099
I'll get way too powdery and you'll just

1142
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:41,019
you'll get a bad flavor out of it but

1143
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:43,420
cure a lot of flour isn't cured well

1144
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:44,889
enough and then the moisture content is

1145
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:46,630
what we're talking about so for good

1146
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:48,279
flour if you're keeping it properly

1147
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:49,599
preserved what you want to do I'm not

1148
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,519
saying you shouldn't use the Boveda

1149
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,289
packs I'm saying that you want to use

1150
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:55,690
them to keep your flour preserved but

1151
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:57,250
when you go to vaporize you you're going

1152
00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:59,440
to particularly fits well-preserved

1153
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:02,380
those first couple hits are gonna be

1154
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,960
pure flavor very little visible vapor

1155
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:06,940
but you'll get some fantastic flavor and

1156
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,500
once you get out of that flavor range

1157
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,849
you've kind of dried it out you've

1158
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,500
gotten rid of a lot of the the terpenes

1159
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:12,849
at that level and everything after that

1160
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,619
it's gonna be a lot more visible vapor

1161
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:16,089
you can get a lot more a lot less the

1162
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:19,389
flavor lot more vapor a lot more the

1163
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:21,070
effects so as far as flour goes it's

1164
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:22,900
it's all over the place I mean you'll

1165
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:24,610
see a lot of people say that CBD flour

1166
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,740
doesn't taste good and that's typically

1167
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:29,230
because they're burning it and CBD flour

1168
00:45:26,739 --> 00:45:30,789
doesn't have a lot of terpenes at those

1169
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:32,650
high temperatures so when you burn it

1170
00:45:30,789 --> 00:45:33,400
you just get kind of grass it doesn't

1171
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:35,500
taste very good

1172
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,750
but a great example is that this stuff

1173
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,789
we had because even though it's CBD

1174
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:41,559
flour because it's got those terpenes at

1175
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:43,929
the low temperatures but piney in the

1176
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:45,130
Mersey and aluminum you get the low

1177
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:48,250
temperatures where you don't get the

1178
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:50,260
kind of Burnie flour ease the Bernie

1179
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:52,539
plant taste and you get those actual

1180
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:54,970
terpenes yeah you know and so many

1181
00:45:52,539 --> 00:45:56,800
people these days are heading to oil

1182
00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:59,469
cartridges and so forth which are really

1183
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,990
just they're extracted all the terpenes

1184
00:45:59,469 --> 00:46:05,980
are taken out mmm does fill them and

1185
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:09,059
then they're put back in later with

1186
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:11,860
flour it's really more of a natural

1187
00:46:09,059 --> 00:46:14,199
extraction in a way we're extracting and

1188
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:15,910
consuming all in one and that's what

1189
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:18,429
makes it so much better the terpenes

1190
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:22,599
that you taste are natural as a part of

1191
00:46:18,429 --> 00:46:24,460
the flour and whereas with oil it's just

1192
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:26,920
there's always this kind of like well

1193
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:28,240
it's either too much or not enough and

1194
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,280
there's very few that are balanced

1195
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:32,889
correctly with ours we really do

1196
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:34,570
getting the taste of the flower and

1197
00:46:32,889 --> 00:46:35,949
that's really a wonderful thing yeah and

1198
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:37,990
I like to the to your point about the

1199
00:46:35,949 --> 00:46:40,299
oil cartridges I like to associate it

1200
00:46:37,989 --> 00:46:41,949
with kind of this move towards vitamins

1201
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:44,019
all right there's a period where we were

1202
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:45,969
eating a lot of just regular old food

1203
00:46:44,019 --> 00:46:48,429
back in the good old days of the you

1204
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:50,019
know the early thousands and then when

1205
00:46:48,429 --> 00:46:51,449
we started doing manufactured food we

1206
00:46:50,019 --> 00:46:53,320
started having canned food and

1207
00:46:51,449 --> 00:46:55,629
pre-prepared food pre-prepared meals

1208
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:57,280
that was a huge was a big deal everybody

1209
00:46:55,630 --> 00:46:59,410
loved those we flocked them was great

1210
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,090
and then we've we've gone to this point

1211
00:46:59,409 --> 00:47:02,710
where we're doing vitamins right people

1212
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:05,350
are taking I wake up in the morning take

1213
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:06,579
vitamin C vitamin D vitamin E like I

1214
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:09,639
take all these different vitamins and

1215
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:11,440
now even more recently we're getting

1216
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:12,909
back to this idea of Whole Foods right

1217
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,280
we're doing the backs idea of just

1218
00:47:12,909 --> 00:47:17,230
taking vitamin C isn't good you need to

1219
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,580
take vitamin C as part of a food that

1220
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:19,809
you're eating because there are these

1221
00:47:18,579 --> 00:47:21,819
other things that come with the food

1222
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:24,880
that we kind of don't understand fully

1223
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:26,289
their benefits in the same way vaping an

1224
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,420
oil cartridge is just like taking

1225
00:47:26,289 --> 00:47:31,029
vitamins like you're getting the THC

1226
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:32,829
which trick which gives you THC and if

1227
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:34,570
that's your goal that's good but what's

1228
00:47:32,829 --> 00:47:36,309
what's being missed that we don't have

1229
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:37,870
enough research to really back up is

1230
00:47:36,309 --> 00:47:40,599
this idea of the entourage effect

1231
00:47:37,869 --> 00:47:43,389
which is that when you vape flour you're

1232
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:44,980
getting those cannabinoids but also the

1233
00:47:43,389 --> 00:47:46,599
terpenes and also the other camp

1234
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:49,300
annoyance and they're all kind of acting

1235
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:51,219
together to increase the effect and give

1236
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,260
you a much more rounded experience that

1237
00:47:51,219 --> 00:47:56,649
isn't just like a like a blasted head of

1238
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:57,970
high it's like a full kind of experience

1239
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:59,530
yeah it's more of it it's more of a

1240
00:47:57,969 --> 00:48:02,980
journey right exactly that when you know

1241
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:04,600
when you when you taste the flour at

1242
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,610
lower temperatures and then halfway

1243
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:08,619
through like after six or seven hits

1244
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:10,990
yeah change the temperature higher it's

1245
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:13,750
it's really a much more versatile of a

1246
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:15,279
way consuming it no to that point why do

1247
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:16,210
have a different flour here that was pre

1248
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,420
packed from one of our other events

1249
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:21,220
called XJ 13 and the reason I mention it

1250
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:23,079
is that this flour if I'm not mistaken I

1251
00:48:21,219 --> 00:48:25,750
think it's this one is high inter

1252
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:27,460
pinnacle which is a terpene that tastes

1253
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:29,940
a lot like diesel that is that the

1254
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:32,650
turpentine kind of kind of alcoholic

1255
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:35,440
gasoline kind of flavor and that

1256
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:37,269
vaporizes at 426 degrees so that's

1257
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,579
strain to your question about the the

1258
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:41,440
different flours that's strain if you

1259
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:42,769
vape it at lower temperatures doesn't

1260
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,300
really taste very good

1261
00:48:42,769 --> 00:48:46,219
it doesn't have many terpenes at those

1262
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:49,820
low temperatures but if you hit it at

1263
00:48:46,219 --> 00:48:52,459
426 or 428 at the high temperatures you

1264
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:55,039
get a very strong kind of sour diesel

1265
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:56,960
flavor that goes along with the

1266
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:59,509
cannabinoid THC v that's vaporize it's

1267
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:02,000
that that same temperature so that XJ 13

1268
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:04,190
with that high terpenes her pineal is

1269
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,500
very much like I'm considered as close

1270
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:08,650
here and get like a smokers high oh it's

1271
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:11,300
interesting there is I kind of feel like

1272
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:13,550
cultivators and brands should understand

1273
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,380
when people are vaping their products

1274
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:18,200
what's the ideal temperature from my

1275
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:20,030
flower for sure which you're hitting on

1276
00:49:18,199 --> 00:49:21,259
conceptually that is that is one thing

1277
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:22,280
that we've worked with a lot of flower

1278
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,630
companies and we've made a lot of

1279
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,880
friends with flower companies and they

1280
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:28,430
they all have that same idea which is

1281
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:30,740
that they're working so hard there every

1282
00:49:28,429 --> 00:49:33,199
day is trying to make their flower

1283
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:36,229
unique make it different make it special

1284
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:37,368
make it great and no matter who's

1285
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:39,380
selling it no matter how much time you

1286
00:49:37,369 --> 00:49:41,390
spent on it if you sell it and then roll

1287
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:49,910
it up into a joint they might as well be

1288
00:49:41,389 --> 00:49:52,579
the same as every other quality like

1289
00:49:49,909 --> 00:49:55,759
produced in the curing process and by

1290
00:49:52,579 --> 00:49:58,579
that do you mean short curing or you

1291
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,650
know yeah as not a grower I have no idea

1292
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:04,969
all I know is that it needs to be well

1293
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:06,260
cured I've been told by a lot of by a

1294
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:08,449
lot of growers when I showed them flower

1295
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:10,100
that I bought when they when they have

1296
00:50:08,449 --> 00:50:11,839
told me like but this is not this is not

1297
00:50:10,099 --> 00:50:12,469
well cured this is not good because not

1298
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,570
well cured

1299
00:50:12,469 --> 00:50:17,480
I don't know exact what that means but I

1300
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:22,369
know it needs to be well cared I believe

1301
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:23,630
this is the so the what I was just doing

1302
00:50:22,369 --> 00:50:25,309
there there's one of the things I love

1303
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:27,349
just that it's one of the only

1304
00:50:25,309 --> 00:50:29,509
vaporizers that what you smell is what

1305
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:32,389
you end up tasting right so I always

1306
00:50:29,510 --> 00:50:34,070
love when I do a demo at events is I

1307
00:50:32,389 --> 00:50:38,358
like to have people smell it and then

1308
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:40,910
put it in there I think that's the puff

1309
00:50:38,358 --> 00:50:42,559
Co peak they're different they're

1310
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:45,019
totally different you know I mean the

1311
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,309
peak is essentially around concentrates

1312
00:50:45,019 --> 00:50:47,599
and only constitutes only there's five

1313
00:50:46,309 --> 00:50:49,159
different settings for concentrates

1314
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:50,389
whether you like hot dabs or cold that

1315
00:50:49,159 --> 00:50:51,739
that's kind of kind of what it's for

1316
00:50:50,389 --> 00:50:53,809
people that just wants an instant high

1317
00:50:51,739 --> 00:50:55,289
as where the ghost it's people that are

1318
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:56,340
looking for flavor you know they're just

1319
00:50:55,289 --> 00:50:57,449
looking to get high they want to hit

1320
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,800
those terpenes they want to get those

1321
00:50:57,449 --> 00:51:00,509
flavors they want to get the most out of

1322
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,250
their weed for example someone smoking

1323
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:04,470
three joints a day that's an eighth the

1324
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:06,059
day you know and if they switched if

1325
00:51:04,469 --> 00:51:07,409
they switch to vape there's gonna be

1326
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:08,279
anything we kept they're buying you know

1327
00:51:07,409 --> 00:51:11,129
they're gonna have that good quality

1328
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,390
weed using a vape as even is even

1329
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:13,980
healthy for you for those people that

1330
00:51:12,389 --> 00:51:15,299
smoke like backwoods and things like

1331
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,679
that that tobacco is horrible for them

1332
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,930
you know if they're smoking joints or

1333
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:20,669
bongs or getting that butane as or all

1334
00:51:18,929 --> 00:51:21,960
this it's it's pure and like Collier

1335
00:51:20,670 --> 00:51:23,099
said you get a different high from it

1336
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,780
you get a cleaner high from it cuz

1337
00:51:23,099 --> 00:51:26,219
you're not getting any of those things

1338
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,300
that you're not supposed to smoke if

1339
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:28,500
that makes sense you're not supposed to

1340
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,539
smoke the butane you're not supposed to

1341
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:31,559
smoke the tobacco you know and that's

1342
00:51:30,539 --> 00:51:32,909
when people will say that they're we

1343
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:34,409
doesn't taste good like what about what

1344
00:51:32,909 --> 00:51:35,909
tobacco leaves you know because you cuz

1345
00:51:34,409 --> 00:51:36,899
you're you're covering up that taste

1346
00:51:35,909 --> 00:51:38,519
with the tobacco leaf

1347
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,889
however this you're just getting the

1348
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:42,059
full the full tasting even with the

1349
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:43,559
puffs go peak I don't think we were able

1350
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:45,539
to get a hit with that grain of rice we

1351
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:47,219
use in this out of the puff go peak you

1352
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:48,179
be lucky to get one draw one person to

1353
00:51:47,219 --> 00:51:50,009
get one draw out of it and then you

1354
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:51,089
still have to clean it up after this we

1355
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:52,410
could just keep hitting it you know

1356
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:55,140
they're two totally they're two totally

1357
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:57,179
different devices but I do like how this

1358
00:51:55,139 --> 00:51:58,920
it gives you the option to use both and

1359
00:51:57,179 --> 00:52:00,179
then you get the best out of both um

1360
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,039
when you're using it because I don't

1361
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:04,049
know if you notice to concentrate it was

1362
00:52:02,039 --> 00:52:05,460
very very tasteful you're able to taste

1363
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:07,080
it and that's what we get by having the

1364
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:09,889
one temperature uhm you not have to

1365
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:14,849
worry about over burning it yeah okay so

1366
00:52:09,889 --> 00:52:17,759
what are we oh yeah okay so this one

1367
00:52:14,849 --> 00:52:20,699
what his temperature is it's like the

1368
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:22,680
cheat code and a video what temperature

1369
00:52:20,699 --> 00:52:24,569
the temperature I believe is up up down

1370
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:25,949
down left right left right B a start if

1371
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:29,490
I'm not mistaken that's how you unlock

1372
00:52:25,949 --> 00:52:33,269
this temperature no that one would be

1373
00:52:29,489 --> 00:52:39,959
contra that is the correctly everybody

1374
00:52:33,269 --> 00:52:41,730
does so I'm not gonna lie to you I'm not

1375
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,019
entirely sure if this is x-ray 13 or not

1376
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:44,760
because my nose is not good enough to be

1377
00:52:43,019 --> 00:52:47,880
able to smell it but just judging by the

1378
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:50,580
look pretty sure it'll go to that I can

1379
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:52,200
tell you yeah okay so here's the test

1380
00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:54,809
this will be the test I haven't set to

1381
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:57,210
428 degrees right that's right around

1382
00:52:54,809 --> 00:52:59,400
that 426 the terpin e all so we're gonna

1383
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:01,679
get high flavor of the terpene y'all and

1384
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,480
a lot of THC fioors that euphoria and

1385
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:05,608
high so if it doesn't taste like that

1386
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,849
then that's nuts turn the

1387
00:53:05,608 --> 00:53:11,489
this is where we need like the like The

1388
00:53:08,849 --> 00:53:13,109
Bachelor where like someone's someone's

1389
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:15,749
about to get kicked off and they cut to

1390
00:53:13,108 --> 00:53:18,409
each person like looking at you to see

1391
00:53:15,748 --> 00:53:20,219
if you're gonna you're gonna taste it

1392
00:53:18,409 --> 00:53:21,568
everybody's looking at you at this

1393
00:53:20,219 --> 00:53:28,018
temperature though you should get a lot

1394
00:53:21,568 --> 00:53:29,369
more clouds as well have you guys used

1395
00:53:28,018 --> 00:53:30,088
the peak before or any other vapors

1396
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:31,739
before

1397
00:53:30,088 --> 00:53:35,909
what is your guys's opinion all those

1398
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:38,039
compared to the girls you guys you found

1399
00:53:35,909 --> 00:53:40,199
something so that's it this is a great

1400
00:53:38,039 --> 00:53:42,089
example of when you started it when you

1401
00:53:40,199 --> 00:53:44,068
go straight to 428 I think that's the

1402
00:53:42,088 --> 00:53:46,739
term I think that's the that's the exit

1403
00:53:44,068 --> 00:53:50,608
13 when you started at the high

1404
00:53:46,739 --> 00:53:53,068
temperature you usually can only get

1405
00:53:50,608 --> 00:53:54,480
instead of the full 15-second draw on

1406
00:53:53,068 --> 00:53:56,068
the particularly the first couple

1407
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,960
drawers I can only make it five or six

1408
00:53:56,068 --> 00:54:02,788
seconds because you they produce is so

1409
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:05,818
much vapor so quickly that's the long

1410
00:54:02,789 --> 00:54:07,650
one the other taste like you get that

1411
00:54:05,818 --> 00:54:08,998
diesel a little bit a little bit yeah

1412
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:10,559
I'm not sure if that's C not sure if

1413
00:54:08,998 --> 00:54:12,709
that's the XT 13 because I'm getting I'm

1414
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:17,309
getting a little bit diesel into my head

1415
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:18,690
yeah I I primed you but one thing what

1416
00:54:17,309 --> 00:54:22,079
you're saying about the the flower as

1417
00:54:18,690 --> 00:54:23,999
well is the pack is very important so

1418
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:26,130
I've noticed a lot of times on the first

1419
00:54:23,998 --> 00:54:29,278
draw if it's not good I'll just kind of

1420
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:31,588
I'll pull it out and I'll just even use

1421
00:54:29,278 --> 00:54:33,389
the lid here and just kind of not even

1422
00:54:31,588 --> 00:54:37,170
stir it just kind of rough it up just

1423
00:54:33,389 --> 00:54:39,358
give it a little loose and show who's

1424
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:41,999
boss but if you notice when you do that

1425
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:44,659
you get you get much more much feathery

1426
00:54:41,998 --> 00:54:46,919
much more feathery pack which is ideal

1427
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:53,969
I'm not sure if there's nothing it up

1428
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:55,619
yeah but you can get even if you get to

1429
00:54:53,969 --> 00:54:57,058
a point even if you get to a point where

1430
00:54:55,619 --> 00:54:59,068
you're not getting any vapor or any

1431
00:54:57,059 --> 00:55:01,319
effects sometimes you get to a point

1432
00:54:59,068 --> 00:55:02,639
where it's it has vaporized just about

1433
00:55:01,318 --> 00:55:04,318
everything you can get and all you got

1434
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:06,389
to do is stir it up little get you can

1435
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:10,710
get two more good hits and what you just

1436
00:55:06,389 --> 00:55:12,358
did there that I want to i if I could if

1437
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:16,170
I could say anything I would say that's

1438
00:55:12,358 --> 00:55:18,108
like the that's like the call sign of

1439
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:20,670
the ghost if you've ever tried a ghost

1440
00:55:18,108 --> 00:55:21,900
the most common thing is people even if

1441
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:24,838
you don't get a visible vapor they blow

1442
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:27,660
out and I go hmm yeah

1443
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:29,190
yeah I get that and people don't even

1444
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:32,429
realize they're doing it it's my

1445
00:55:29,190 --> 00:55:34,679
favorite part let's see if I've got I

1446
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:36,789
wonder if I don't do you have cuz I mean

1447
00:55:34,679 --> 00:55:39,460
I think I have a jar of XJ 13 I may

1448
00:55:36,789 --> 00:55:42,820
but we we like to partner with different

1449
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:44,920
flower brands yes actually so talk about

1450
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:48,700
that well yeah what's your interactions

1451
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:49,990
and relationships with yeah well so it

1452
00:55:48,699 --> 00:55:51,789
works really well flowers the flower

1453
00:55:49,989 --> 00:55:53,319
brands work really well with us one of

1454
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:54,579
our good friends is THC design which is

1455
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:57,820
what we're which is what we've been

1456
00:55:54,579 --> 00:55:59,889
smoking this whole Bay the reason that

1457
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:02,230
they love us and we love them is that

1458
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:04,179
they like I said they put their terpenes

1459
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:05,980
on the packaging not many other brands

1460
00:56:04,179 --> 00:56:08,500
actually put what terpenes to expect on

1461
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,760
a packaging so that helps us because

1462
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:12,699
people are looking for those terpenes

1463
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:15,010
and I know that the first time that the

1464
00:56:12,699 --> 00:56:17,409
folks from THC design tried their flower

1465
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:20,110
in the mv-1 they wanted to work with us

1466
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:22,239
and the reason is like I said earlier

1467
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:24,010
you put so much time into making this

1468
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:25,329
flower that tastes a certain way that

1469
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:28,330
smells a certain way that has a certain

1470
00:56:25,329 --> 00:56:30,069
effect and you really only get to

1471
00:56:28,329 --> 00:56:32,440
maximize that and get the most out of it

1472
00:56:30,070 --> 00:56:34,660
in something like the ghost I do like it

1473
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,190
because you can seek out those specific

1474
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:39,279
terpenes and look for them and one of my

1475
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:41,679
favorites that is not as common is mercy

1476
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,330
and I learned recently that mercian is

1477
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:46,659
the same chirping that's found in

1478
00:56:43,329 --> 00:56:49,569
mangoes and if you vape something like

1479
00:56:46,659 --> 00:56:51,190
the gift at 349 to get that mercy and

1480
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:53,590
you eat a mango or eat something high in

1481
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:55,929
mangoes it's like it's kind of like

1482
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:57,760
drinking red wine mistake has this kind

1483
00:56:55,929 --> 00:57:03,909
of multiplier effect that just really

1484
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:06,430
enhances everything so in THC designs

1485
00:57:03,909 --> 00:57:09,489
Power Move would be next to the terpenes

1486
00:57:06,429 --> 00:57:12,699
to list what temperature exactly you can

1487
00:57:09,489 --> 00:57:14,649
isolate that exactly yeah so give me an

1488
00:57:12,699 --> 00:57:17,109
example like you talked about part is

1489
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:20,170
partnering just like mutual love and

1490
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:23,260
admiration or is partnering like we have

1491
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:25,990
a business deal together so yeah about

1492
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:28,240
partnerships with THC design as our case

1493
00:57:25,989 --> 00:57:30,489
Ted sure so as you probably guess we're

1494
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:32,349
a relatively young company still and as

1495
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:34,239
you can also probably guess we are still

1496
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:35,710
working very hard to get our name out

1497
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:37,269
there and get the product out there get

1498
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:39,460
people trying it make people aware of it

1499
00:57:37,269 --> 00:57:40,869
so right now we're still at the stage

1500
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:43,210
where we're just good friends

1501
00:57:40,869 --> 00:57:45,489
we're dating you know we've had a couple

1502
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:47,409
dates you know we we've exchanged phone

1503
00:57:45,489 --> 00:57:47,949
numbers we were Facebook friending up

1504
00:57:47,409 --> 00:57:50,469
with other

1505
00:57:47,949 --> 00:57:51,578
exactly exactly but the the kinds of

1506
00:57:50,469 --> 00:57:54,189
partnerships that we're building are

1507
00:57:51,579 --> 00:57:56,589
very mutually beneficial in that there

1508
00:57:54,190 --> 00:57:58,150
we have one there's one brand that

1509
00:57:56,588 --> 00:58:00,400
probably does want to be mentioned but

1510
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:01,930
they're using they're they're taking the

1511
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,088
ghost MV one around with their sales

1512
00:58:01,929 --> 00:58:06,039
team and they're bringing the ghost and

1513
00:58:04,088 --> 00:58:07,838
crucibles and their flour to

1514
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:10,358
dispensaries and distributors and all

1515
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:12,338
these places to demo their flour for

1516
00:58:10,358 --> 00:58:13,630
those buyers all right because right now

1517
00:58:12,338 --> 00:58:16,239
the current process is if you're a

1518
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:18,548
grower when buyers come to your to your

1519
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:20,618
grow to test out your flower to see if

1520
00:58:18,548 --> 00:58:23,440
they want to buy you're rolling you know

1521
00:58:20,619 --> 00:58:25,900
seven to ten joints of an eighth or more

1522
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:28,150
a piece and it's a huge waste right

1523
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:29,048
that's a good time speed fears but if

1524
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:30,760
you think about it from two different

1525
00:58:29,048 --> 00:58:33,068
perspectives if you're the grower that's

1526
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:36,190
a huge waste and if you're the person

1527
00:58:33,068 --> 00:58:37,900
who's trying to judge it's difficult to

1528
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:39,220
like you can if you're professional you

1529
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,720
can judge the difference between a bunch

1530
00:58:39,219 --> 00:58:43,000
of different strains by slight

1531
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:44,588
variations but those different strains

1532
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:56,108
and the mv-1 at the temperatures that

1533
00:58:44,588 --> 00:59:03,699
highlight their terpenes like buyer goes

1534
00:58:56,108 --> 00:59:07,449
a particular brand brandy flower for

1535
00:59:03,699 --> 00:59:09,279
either yeah yeah that's definitely an

1536
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:11,019
option I mean everyone might be yeah

1537
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,609
yeah that's that's definitely something

1538
00:59:11,019 --> 00:59:15,130
that we're we're considering going down

1539
00:59:12,608 --> 00:59:18,670
the line there and you can also do by

1540
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:19,780
can extend dispensaries so yeah we're

1541
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:22,210
actually in a lot dispensaries right now

1542
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:24,040
yeah so dispensaries can sell vaporizers

1543
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:25,449
actually realistically almost anybody

1544
00:59:24,039 --> 00:59:26,829
can sell vaporizers we're also sold in

1545
00:59:25,449 --> 00:59:29,500
smoke shops all over the place because

1546
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:31,750
it's you can vape lavender out of it

1547
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:33,250
like it is it's just a vaporizer kind of

1548
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:35,170
depends on what you put in it most

1549
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:37,119
people put cannabis I know yeah I'm

1550
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:39,309
gonna try that later well you know if

1551
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:41,470
you want to try that yeah yeah other

1552
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:43,990
herbs for my garden so I hear that I

1553
00:59:41,469 --> 00:59:46,029
hear that sage is a really good it's a

1554
00:59:43,989 --> 00:59:47,329
really good combo if you grind sage and

1555
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:51,800
cannabis together that Gary

1556
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:52,969
and multiplicative effect exactly it's a

1557
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,940
doe it's a dual-purpose

1558
00:59:52,969 --> 00:59:57,139
right but you can also you can also what

1559
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:59,809
I've started experimenting with more

1560
00:59:57,139 --> 01:00:02,089
recently as I grind I usually do like

1561
00:59:59,809 --> 01:00:04,190
two nodes of THC flour and one lug of

1562
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:06,200
CBD flour I just grind that all together

1563
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:08,240
and load my crucibles because one of the

1564
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:10,549
one of the downsides of the modern

1565
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:14,899
cannabis is that modern cannabis is

1566
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:16,640
bread and and grown to maximize THC

1567
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,619
right the whole purpose is to get the

1568
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:20,420
highest percentage THC that's like that

1569
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:22,460
the goal of every single grow right now

1570
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:25,099
is the THC percentage is how we're

1571
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:27,730
judging the quality as alcohol came out

1572
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:31,219
of prohibition you only had moonshine

1573
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:33,500
exactly you had exactly exactly and so a

1574
01:00:31,219 --> 01:00:34,969
woman a bunch of craft beer - which is

1575
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:37,960
like we're not even trying to get drunk

1576
01:00:34,969 --> 01:00:42,409
here we're just enjoying the beer and so

1577
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:45,500
firewater yeah some of that wine some

1578
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:47,659
flavor to that point the what I'm what

1579
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:49,909
I'm trying to replicate here by grinding

1580
01:00:47,659 --> 01:00:52,309
some CBD flour back in with it is to add

1581
01:00:49,909 --> 01:00:54,049
that CBD back into the flour that's been

1582
01:00:52,309 --> 01:00:56,420
bred out because for the longest time

1583
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:57,650
there was no value in CBD right it

1584
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:59,690
wasn't the thing that was getting people

1585
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:01,789
high if your purpose is to get high CBD

1586
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:06,920
has no value to you so there's there's

1587
01:01:01,789 --> 01:01:08,840
no purpose no I people yeah you know

1588
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:11,300
like when you actually understand fully

1589
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:14,269
like CBD has the has the combination but

1590
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:16,280
like to the general consumer THC is the

1591
01:01:14,269 --> 01:01:18,199
thing that gets you high and so having a

1592
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:20,330
high THC percentage is what you're

1593
01:01:18,199 --> 01:01:23,929
looking for so let's brainstorm some

1594
01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:25,880
business partnerships with a because

1595
01:01:23,929 --> 01:01:28,039
obviously there's just like the mutual

1596
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:31,180
marketing and publicity of partnership

1597
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:34,789
alike I'm thinking more like there's a a

1598
01:01:31,179 --> 01:01:40,190
legal business deal in place like what

1599
01:01:34,789 --> 01:01:42,320
are you guys what could you do so - it

1600
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:45,159
brands yeah so the two types of brands

1601
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:47,570
that were most that we have the most

1602
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:50,329
synergy with for lack of a non-business

1603
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:53,120
term is consumption lounges and

1604
01:01:50,329 --> 01:01:55,819
retailers and flour brands flour brands

1605
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:57,139
we are providing the best experience in

1606
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:58,580
many different ways for them so

1607
01:01:57,139 --> 01:02:00,650
providing the best experience for buyers

1608
01:01:58,579 --> 01:02:01,190
trying their flour we're providing the

1609
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:02,630
best experience

1610
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:04,670
for their customers to actually be able

1611
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:06,730
to appreciate the quality of their

1612
01:02:04,670 --> 01:02:09,769
flower which means that if I've spent

1613
01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:12,289
$100 for 1/8 instead of my usual 40 or

1614
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:14,509
60 dollars for 1/8 I want to I want to

1615
01:02:12,289 --> 01:02:16,759
know that that was worth it and using it

1616
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:17,660
in something like the mv-1 makes you

1617
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,160
actually feel like it was worth it

1618
01:02:17,659 --> 01:02:21,108
because you taste those terpenes you get

1619
01:02:19,159 --> 01:02:23,088
that effect you get that smooth flavor

1620
01:02:21,108 --> 01:02:29,348
and you actually feel like it was worth

1621
01:02:23,088 --> 01:02:32,719
$100 multiple testimonials from

1622
01:02:29,349 --> 01:02:39,680
cultivators wanting people to use your

1623
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:40,309
device to show off my flower I mean its

1624
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:43,489
best

1625
01:02:40,309 --> 01:02:46,130
exactly exactly and then the consumption

1626
01:02:43,489 --> 01:02:46,969
lounges are our best friends as soon as

1627
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:48,858
they start getting up and running

1628
01:02:46,969 --> 01:02:50,689
they're our best friends because they've

1629
01:02:48,858 --> 01:02:52,130
got costs on the mind right every time

1630
01:02:50,690 --> 01:03:01,068
somebody's come in ER up and run it like

1631
01:02:52,130 --> 01:03:03,140
we're zero there's a lot there's a lot

1632
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:08,690
that aren't licensed yeah there are a

1633
01:03:03,139 --> 01:03:10,549
lot of underground ones yes yep yep so

1634
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:13,700
we're friends at the consumption lounge

1635
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:15,470
opening there I know that the 101 the I

1636
01:03:13,699 --> 01:03:17,929
think it's bud berry is opening in West

1637
01:03:15,469 --> 01:03:19,129
Hollywood but they they're we're friends

1638
01:03:17,929 --> 01:03:22,098
with them but they won't be hosting the

1639
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:24,289
mv-1 because they're entirely edibles so

1640
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:26,359
it's all it's all consumables not flour

1641
01:03:24,289 --> 01:03:28,400
which is fine that's okay if that's what

1642
01:03:26,358 --> 01:03:29,750
you want to do but consumption lounges

1643
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,250
if you're particularly if you're

1644
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:32,838
providing flour if you're providing

1645
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:35,239
flour for people to demo to try to sell

1646
01:03:32,838 --> 01:03:38,029
or whatever your goal is being able to

1647
01:03:35,239 --> 01:03:40,789
just use a tenth of a gram there's a

1648
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:42,680
huge cost savings right a tenth of a

1649
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:44,269
gram instead of an eighth in a joint or

1650
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:46,460
even in a even in like a little mini J

1651
01:03:44,269 --> 01:03:48,019
like an even a mini J is gonna be you

1652
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:51,199
know probably 2 or 3 grams at the very

1653
01:03:48,019 --> 01:03:54,588
least probably two grams fairly what

1654
01:03:51,199 --> 01:04:01,219
okay so this first one on the market

1655
01:03:54,588 --> 01:04:03,469
what like when could I first buy know if

1656
01:04:01,219 --> 01:04:06,739
first one on the market I want to say

1657
01:04:03,469 --> 01:04:08,539
like June of last year but we really hit

1658
01:04:06,739 --> 01:04:09,588
our stride in October October is when

1659
01:04:08,539 --> 01:04:10,969
you would have when you would have first

1660
01:04:09,588 --> 01:04:13,219
really heard of us and the reasons we

1661
01:04:10,969 --> 01:04:13,739
launched the the stealth Black Edition

1662
01:04:13,219 --> 01:04:15,509
weird

1663
01:04:13,739 --> 01:04:17,309
well you got over there so the stealth

1664
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:19,230
black was the first the first version

1665
01:04:17,309 --> 01:04:21,539
that we had that is that was all black

1666
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:22,769
comes this matte black but the torn down

1667
01:04:21,539 --> 01:04:24,239
ones actually a better example of it

1668
01:04:22,769 --> 01:04:33,690
because I've swapped out my heat sink

1669
01:04:24,239 --> 01:04:35,969
here you know we just in a weird way

1670
01:04:33,690 --> 01:04:38,670
we're actually doing better and the

1671
01:04:35,969 --> 01:04:40,649
reason is that those shops you can pay

1672
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:42,000
with credit card probably the probably

1673
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:44,220
the biggest barrier right now is that

1674
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,260
people love it people people understand

1675
01:04:44,219 --> 01:04:49,769
it they see the value of it but if

1676
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:51,240
you've got to pay $300 in cash usually

1677
01:04:49,769 --> 01:04:52,440
if you're going to dispensary like the

1678
01:04:51,239 --> 01:04:54,118
most I think I've ever brought into a

1679
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:56,880
dispensary was 200 ollars in cash and

1680
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:58,230
that was to buy weed right and I'm not

1681
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,940
gonna then turn around and pull it

1682
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:01,679
another 300 dollars to buy a vaporizer

1683
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:02,820
no matter how good it is so we're

1684
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:04,049
working on solutions you can obviously

1685
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:04,710
buy it directly on our website go

1686
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:07,109
space.com

1687
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:09,358
we ship internationally pretty much

1688
01:05:07,108 --> 01:05:10,650
everywhere everywhere that's a lot more

1689
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:15,289
allowed to ship which at this point is

1690
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:15,289
most places yeah we shipped all states

1691
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:29,519
that the I would say there's two one of

1692
01:05:27,869 --> 01:05:30,539
them is user error which is they just

1693
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:32,130
didn't read the instructions that

1694
01:05:30,539 --> 01:05:34,230
understand how vaporizers work they

1695
01:05:32,130 --> 01:05:36,990
didn't bother to you know look up

1696
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:39,329
anything okay usually didn't break it

1697
01:05:36,989 --> 01:05:40,500
it's very difficult to break obviously

1698
01:05:39,329 --> 01:05:42,869
being made of such high-quality

1699
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:45,630
materials they said so when I when I was

1700
01:05:42,869 --> 01:05:48,630
with the the Fiddler's guys yes we

1701
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:50,190
actually had to bust out the instrument

1702
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:53,039
and and you have shown me how to use

1703
01:05:50,190 --> 01:05:54,179
that and I totally like was blank I was

1704
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:56,909
like I know there's something about

1705
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:58,129
hitting at three times I don't remember

1706
01:05:56,909 --> 01:05:59,690
what that does but

1707
01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:01,490
that something I think we're trying to

1708
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:03,460
change the temperature yeah

1709
01:06:01,489 --> 01:06:07,239
[Music]

1710
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:10,400
fortunately Jody I know sorry Cameron

1711
01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:13,669
was like I'm gonna focus and read

1712
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:15,410
through this instructor it out if it's

1713
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:17,210
green flashing that's giving the battery

1714
01:06:15,409 --> 01:06:18,858
indication it says press and hold the

1715
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:21,139
mode button to display battery level

1716
01:06:18,858 --> 01:06:23,420
release then press and hold again to

1717
01:06:21,139 --> 01:06:25,730
display the current heat setting to be

1718
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:28,519
fair when I first got it I first got

1719
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:30,440
mine about two or three months before I

1720
01:06:28,518 --> 01:06:31,969
started working for ghost and when I

1721
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:33,500
first got it and I found out there a

1722
01:06:31,969 --> 01:06:36,169
smartphone app I just downloaded the app

1723
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:38,028
and never used the buttons on the device

1724
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:40,159
like I used the vape button on the back

1725
01:06:38,028 --> 01:06:41,568
to use it but otherwise I just turned it

1726
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:44,509
on and did all the temperature

1727
01:06:41,568 --> 01:06:45,980
management on the app it was only once I

1728
01:06:44,509 --> 01:06:47,329
started a ghost and I realized that you

1729
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:49,699
could change the temperature on the

1730
01:06:47,329 --> 01:06:51,140
device itself that I realized that I

1731
01:06:49,699 --> 01:06:53,598
needed to look up the instructions and I

1732
01:06:51,139 --> 01:06:56,088
as an employee of ghost pulled out my

1733
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:58,430
box I pulled out the instructions and I

1734
01:06:56,088 --> 01:06:59,750
read up and literally read it one time

1735
01:06:58,429 --> 01:07:01,250
like once you figure out the button

1736
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:03,949
sequence it's it's not difficult to

1737
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:05,210
remember but I read the instructions and

1738
01:07:03,949 --> 01:07:09,199
figured it out and most people that we

1739
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:11,659
find they after about one day of use

1740
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:12,469
have figured out how to turn it on they

1741
01:07:11,659 --> 01:07:13,940
figured out how to change the

1742
01:07:12,469 --> 01:07:15,949
temperature is they figured out the draw

1743
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:17,690
speed there kind of technique on using

1744
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:18,169
it and after about a day there they're

1745
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:23,450
golden

1746
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:25,480
so the second complaint though is it was

1747
01:07:23,449 --> 01:07:30,078
the second plane it was user error and

1748
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:32,389
no visible vapor that's a common and the

1749
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:35,359
reason I say no visible vapor is as we

1750
01:07:32,389 --> 01:07:37,699
were discussing before I would I would

1751
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:39,318
argue that if you are tasting if you're

1752
01:07:37,699 --> 01:07:41,629
tasting something and if you're getting

1753
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:44,808
high then it doesn't matter if you're

1754
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:47,960
seeing oh yeah I think anybody once they

1755
01:07:44,809 --> 01:07:51,349
get it gets it it's the process of going

1756
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:53,599
from your initial expectation to get and

1757
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:56,000
when I was with like you can watch the

1758
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:58,068
video you literally watch us in real

1759
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:00,048
time figuring stuff out with the ghost

1760
01:07:58,068 --> 01:08:03,380
which is like a how to use that one

1761
01:08:00,048 --> 01:08:06,079
button to do 18 different things and

1762
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:07,789
then number two was we're all sitting

1763
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,849
there like everyone's sucking really

1764
01:08:07,789 --> 01:08:10,499
hard on it

1765
01:08:08,849 --> 01:08:12,599
and we're like is it working and then

1766
01:08:10,498 --> 01:08:13,018
we're like we are all super high right

1767
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:16,259
now

1768
01:08:13,018 --> 01:08:17,698
so I think it might be working yeah

1769
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:20,039
there's just and that was when we were

1770
01:08:17,698 --> 01:08:22,678
like oh me and I was like maybe it's

1771
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:27,509
like better if you're not blowing vapor

1772
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:30,079
out so to that point the only recently I

1773
01:08:27,509 --> 01:08:32,969
discovered the best the best

1774
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:35,039
instructions for breathing technique if

1775
01:08:32,969 --> 01:08:37,380
you've ever done a guided meditation or

1776
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:39,210
any kind of any any kind of yoga

1777
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:40,710
meditation or anything that has a

1778
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:43,250
breathing exercise where you're like 10

1779
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:43,250
seconds like

1780
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:49,539
well you want to it's not that you want

1781
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:51,069
to take a 10-second breath

1782
01:08:49,539 --> 01:08:53,319
it's that you want to spread your breath

1783
01:08:51,069 --> 01:08:55,330
across ten seconds and if you do that

1784
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:56,740
then it forces you to draw at the

1785
01:08:55,329 --> 01:08:57,760
correct speed because if you guys are

1786
01:08:56,739 --> 01:08:59,679
sitting there sucking on it there's a

1787
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:02,109
very good chance that either a it was

1788
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:04,390
packed too tightly or B you're pulling

1789
01:09:02,109 --> 01:09:05,890
too fast and because the the definitely

1790
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:07,990
only downside of having your lungs be

1791
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:09,760
part of the mechanism is that if you're

1792
01:09:07,989 --> 01:09:11,588
pulling too fast you're pulling that hot

1793
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:13,480
air across the material before it can

1794
01:09:11,588 --> 01:09:14,470
actually transfer its heat to the

1795
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:16,629
material so you're essentially not

1796
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:18,400
giving it any time to heat up well it's

1797
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:20,170
like when I try to teach my

1798
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:22,389
four-year-old daughter how to swim and

1799
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:25,088
I'm like the more you flail around the

1800
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:27,548
worse off you are just relax and float

1801
01:09:25,088 --> 01:09:30,250
on your back yeah you could like float

1802
01:09:27,548 --> 01:09:32,920
across the entire pool exactly so in my

1803
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:37,270
research you know I I don't I forget how

1804
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:39,279
it is I made my way to ghosts but but it

1805
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:41,650
just it just you know and there's just

1806
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:43,750
so many products on the market and the

1807
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:46,269
one and the one problem for that article

1808
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:49,539
at is I'm hands-on so I wanted to be

1809
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:51,640
able to try it out is that a problem is

1810
01:09:49,539 --> 01:09:56,890
that a problem well no no I wasn't able

1811
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:59,289
to oh no I don't that is a big yes so

1812
01:09:56,890 --> 01:10:01,990
you know I kind of had to you know do

1813
01:09:59,289 --> 01:10:04,710
that part a bit blind yeah pretty much

1814
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:08,559
it was a learning experience for me and

1815
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:10,029
you with respect to ghosts specifically

1816
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,340
I don't I don't have any follow-up

1817
01:10:10,029 --> 01:10:15,219
questions and it was a quality product

1818
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:17,110
and all I knew from that one after the

1819
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:19,240
article was I wanted to get my hand

1820
01:10:17,109 --> 01:10:21,250
that's good you know that's good and

1821
01:10:19,239 --> 01:10:22,300
that's that's good and again you tried

1822
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,439
it with the concentrate what do you

1823
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:25,270
think about the concept it was it was

1824
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:26,769
awesome yeah I was a flavor and listen

1825
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:29,200
the flavors you know bringing out the

1826
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:31,180
flavors is really what it's all about

1827
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:33,039
yeah you know there's there's a lot of

1828
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:34,630
things I appreciate about this one right

1829
01:10:33,039 --> 01:10:38,739
now the fact it doesn't get really hot

1830
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:41,980
it's easy to use that electronically is

1831
01:10:38,739 --> 01:10:43,429
well-made but the bottom line is the

1832
01:10:41,979 --> 01:10:47,359
experience

1833
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:50,420
and if you can because that's my

1834
01:10:47,359 --> 01:10:52,819
experience longtime smoker yeah longer

1835
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:54,920
than you guys have been around but the

1836
01:10:52,819 --> 01:10:59,029
last few years learning to appreciate

1837
01:10:54,920 --> 01:11:01,940
that nuanced experience has has really

1838
01:10:59,029 --> 01:11:03,949
been very exciting yeah you know so and

1839
01:11:01,939 --> 01:11:06,079
I love all the look like because I'm not

1840
01:11:03,949 --> 01:11:08,389
a blow my brains I don't go to show her

1841
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:10,819
and dab and write down I wanna be able

1842
01:11:08,390 --> 01:11:13,700
have conversations I want to do that so

1843
01:11:10,819 --> 01:11:15,949
now experiencing the new you know like

1844
01:11:13,699 --> 01:11:19,399
Rosen's new Levin resins and those

1845
01:11:15,949 --> 01:11:22,010
things and to be able to consume them

1846
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:24,349
properly and experience them properly is

1847
01:11:22,010 --> 01:11:26,900
mind-expanding literally yeah it's not

1848
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:29,000
my numbing yeah it's the opposite

1849
01:11:26,899 --> 01:11:41,960
exactly yeah so that's a beautiful thing

1850
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:44,229
about you mister we're in mr. Rogers

1851
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,230
neighborhood

1852
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:56,630
hey there's trolley it sells well people

1853
01:11:53,180 --> 01:11:58,550
love it we're doing great we're yeah

1854
01:11:56,630 --> 01:12:00,350
we're just working on expanding and

1855
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:01,760
visibility and get more consumers so

1856
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:04,400
weird one of the main things that we're

1857
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,570
trying to do is get to as many consumer

1858
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:06,920
events as possible there's many

1859
01:12:05,569 --> 01:12:09,109
opportunities to get it in front of

1860
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:10,819
people because as you know I can sit

1861
01:12:09,109 --> 01:12:12,469
here and tell you all day every day how

1862
01:12:10,819 --> 01:12:14,539
great it is how great the flavor is how

1863
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:17,300
easy it is to use how you would dial in

1864
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:19,250
those terpenes but because there really

1865
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:21,829
is no other device that gives you that

1866
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:23,659
kind of control there's no frame of

1867
01:12:21,829 --> 01:12:25,760
reference right so you don't actually

1868
01:12:23,659 --> 01:12:27,380
you don't actually understand or even

1869
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,510
believe what I'm saying until you try it

1870
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:31,190
like we were just this Saturday we're at

1871
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:33,590
an event downtown that was a consumer

1872
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:35,269
event and we had plenty of people coming

1873
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:37,699
up like and these this is a consumption

1874
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:40,520
lounge where people were smoking joints

1875
01:12:37,699 --> 01:12:41,779
rolling huge joints and they would come

1876
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,850
up and they're like oh what is this oh

1877
01:12:41,779 --> 01:12:45,319
it's a vaporizer oh it's nice and once

1878
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:47,450
you gave him a shot once you give him a

1879
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:49,639
chance to actually hit it every go every

1880
01:12:47,449 --> 01:12:55,220
single one guaranteed they blow up the

1881
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:56,789
smoke blog the vapor oh whoa oh and

1882
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:58,349
because of the heat sink

1883
01:12:56,788 --> 01:12:59,788
the vapor comes out so cool that these

1884
01:12:58,349 --> 01:13:02,038
people that are used to taking huge hits

1885
01:12:59,788 --> 01:13:03,359
from bongs or joints whatever it is they

1886
01:13:02,038 --> 01:13:04,889
don't realize how big of a hit they're

1887
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:06,420
taking so they're sitting there kind of

1888
01:13:04,889 --> 01:13:08,038
like mmm that's good I'm getting good

1889
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:09,840
flavor this is good it was good and then

1890
01:13:08,038 --> 01:13:11,729
they they finish their draw and they

1891
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,139
blow out and that's the vapor just keeps

1892
01:13:11,729 --> 01:13:16,339
coming and keeps coming and they start

1893
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:16,340
coughing oh I liked it Oh

1894
01:13:16,939 --> 01:13:20,428
like we have a lot of people that walk

1895
01:13:18,988 --> 01:13:21,658
away from our booth or walk away from

1896
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:24,569
our table wherever we're demoing and

1897
01:13:21,658 --> 01:13:26,328
coffee just like what did not expect

1898
01:13:24,569 --> 01:13:30,558
that was not expecting that

1899
01:13:26,328 --> 01:13:30,558
because the vapor just comes out so cool

1900
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:37,219
so sales are good

1901
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:40,979
[Laughter]

1902
01:13:37,219 --> 01:13:42,899
this is like the first product the hero

1903
01:13:40,979 --> 01:13:46,078
product I would say so

1904
01:13:42,899 --> 01:13:49,618
is there another product in the pipeline

1905
01:13:46,078 --> 01:13:53,038
and what what do you want to do is it

1906
01:13:49,618 --> 01:13:54,719
just like the Model S of this or is it

1907
01:13:53,038 --> 01:13:58,050
something totally different for a

1908
01:13:54,719 --> 01:14:00,059
different purpose you know there's this

1909
01:13:58,050 --> 01:14:01,800
there's always a lot of different

1910
01:14:00,059 --> 01:14:04,199
answers to that like what's this one

1911
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:06,090
called this is called the ghost mb1 so

1912
01:14:04,198 --> 01:14:08,428
so you're talking about the MV 2 for

1913
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:09,929
instance okay but let's say not oh what

1914
01:14:08,429 --> 01:14:12,269
happened to two things one

1915
01:14:09,929 --> 01:14:15,170
what's the improvements that you want to

1916
01:14:12,269 --> 01:14:19,289
make or not improvements what's the a

1917
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:21,960
different word additional features you

1918
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:24,198
want to put in the MV 2 and then

1919
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:27,118
secondly what's a totally different

1920
01:14:24,198 --> 01:14:30,538
product you guys are conceptualized yeah

1921
01:14:27,118 --> 01:14:32,969
I mean I think the the idea of

1922
01:14:30,538 --> 01:14:35,908
improvement is is pretty clear you know

1923
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:38,279
we listen to our customers you know we

1924
01:14:35,908 --> 01:14:40,679
hear what they have to say and you know

1925
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:42,479
I think most of them focus around the

1926
01:14:40,679 --> 01:14:46,019
interface and so that's a clear

1927
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:48,569
opportunity for us and there's a lot of

1928
01:14:46,019 --> 01:14:50,699
ways there are so many parallels like

1929
01:14:48,569 --> 01:14:55,368
here is a Panasonic

1930
01:14:50,698 --> 01:14:58,558
EBA one here's a Panasonic gh4 I have

1931
01:14:55,368 --> 01:15:01,259
can it like they each and then your

1932
01:14:58,559 --> 01:15:03,510
phones and things like all these things

1933
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:05,460
have different interfaces that you need

1934
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:07,500
to learn and some are just you're just

1935
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:08,158
like that's so frustrating why do they

1936
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:11,069
make that

1937
01:15:08,158 --> 01:15:13,828
interphase decision right right and as

1938
01:15:11,069 --> 01:15:16,198
you said you know everyone now is aware

1939
01:15:13,828 --> 01:15:18,479
of user interface and and so now the

1940
01:15:16,198 --> 01:15:21,928
playing field is different your minimum

1941
01:15:18,479 --> 01:15:23,819
product has to be it has to meet

1942
01:15:21,929 --> 01:15:25,408
expectations or exceed them and that

1943
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:28,219
means it has to take all of this into

1944
01:15:25,408 --> 01:15:30,839
consideration where users are going to

1945
01:15:28,219 --> 01:15:32,789
expect the feedback to be what kind of

1946
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:34,199
feedback it is and is it intuitive and

1947
01:15:32,789 --> 01:15:36,539
that's really what we want to make is as

1948
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:39,210
intuitive as possible so that you need

1949
01:15:36,539 --> 01:15:42,000
no instruction whatsoever you just have

1950
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:43,618
it in your hand and the product tells

1951
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,260
you how to use it

1952
01:15:43,618 --> 01:15:48,238
it just it just knows and it knows you

1953
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:50,039
right away so those are the things you

1954
01:15:48,238 --> 01:16:04,019
know aspirationally and you know for a

1955
01:15:50,039 --> 01:16:05,969
next-gen that's what yeah I totally

1956
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:07,829
random funny example you know I was

1957
01:16:05,969 --> 01:16:09,868
looking at like a GoPro and I was like

1958
01:16:07,828 --> 01:16:13,049
this one's cheaper and it has great

1959
01:16:09,868 --> 01:16:14,009
reviews I bought it and the first time I

1960
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:16,020
filmed with it

1961
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:18,630
I pulled the footage and it had the

1962
01:16:16,020 --> 01:16:20,909
timestamp in the footage and so I

1963
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:25,920
emailed the company being like I can't

1964
01:16:20,908 --> 01:16:27,750
figure out where and how to turn off the

1965
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:30,779
timestamp because I don't want it to say

1966
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:33,479
like January 1st 1999 or like what cuz

1967
01:16:30,779 --> 01:16:35,849
you never said that thing and they were

1968
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:38,039
like yeah I know you can't do that and I

1969
01:16:35,849 --> 01:16:39,569
was like am I the first person who's

1970
01:16:38,039 --> 01:16:42,090
brought this at it and that's that's

1971
01:16:39,569 --> 01:16:44,279
like a firmware update right that should

1972
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:47,279
be a simple very mine and they're like

1973
01:16:44,279 --> 01:16:49,078
yeah sorry yeah well to that point one

1974
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:50,399
of the things that we that I really love

1975
01:16:49,078 --> 01:16:52,139
about the ghost and that I love about

1976
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:53,578
the fact that this is this is more a

1977
01:16:52,139 --> 01:16:55,980
technology company than ever than

1978
01:16:53,578 --> 01:16:58,319
anything so we have we obviously have an

1979
01:16:55,979 --> 01:17:00,899
app we've got firmware I can tell you

1980
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:02,698
late-breaking news we have a new update

1981
01:17:00,899 --> 01:17:03,420
to the app coming out I have the beta

1982
01:17:02,698 --> 01:17:07,289
version of it

1983
01:17:03,420 --> 01:17:08,969
you heard your first app update so and

1984
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:10,408
what's interesting is bad news obviously

1985
01:17:08,969 --> 01:17:12,300
we can't change the hardware so we're

1986
01:17:10,408 --> 01:17:13,979
limited by what we already have but with

1987
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:16,770
software we're able to make some very

1988
01:17:13,979 --> 01:17:18,598
kind of minor but very valuable

1989
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:21,150
improvements and one of the changes that

1990
01:17:18,599 --> 01:17:22,949
I love that was a big for me as

1991
01:17:21,149 --> 01:17:24,599
that the current way to change the

1992
01:17:22,948 --> 01:17:27,089
temperature that's I don't have a

1993
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:28,260
different one but the way to change the

1994
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:29,819
temperature is you press and hold on

1995
01:17:28,260 --> 01:17:31,320
this multifunction button for about

1996
01:17:29,819 --> 01:17:33,119
three seconds you'll see the battery

1997
01:17:31,319 --> 01:17:35,189
level blink and you press and hold it

1998
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:37,079
again to get to the temperature right

1999
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:38,369
when you do that once or twice I call

2000
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:39,300
guys normally impressing hold give the

2001
01:17:38,369 --> 01:17:41,609
battery press an old you to the

2002
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:43,440
temperature right once you've been doing

2003
01:17:41,609 --> 01:17:44,939
that for a few months and you do it

2004
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:46,500
every day all day and you're changing

2005
01:17:44,939 --> 01:17:48,299
the temperature a lot having to go

2006
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:50,789
through the battery level every single

2007
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:52,409
time gets a little bit tedious not a

2008
01:17:50,789 --> 01:17:53,908
deal-breaker it's not a reason to return

2009
01:17:52,408 --> 01:17:55,799
it it's not a reason to hate it but it's

2010
01:17:53,908 --> 01:17:57,839
just it's not great so to have like fuck

2011
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:00,060
the function one button which gets you

2012
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,409
right in so what we so what we did on

2013
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:02,850
the newest version of the app and the

2014
01:18:01,408 --> 01:18:05,009
newest version of the firmware is we

2015
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:07,620
just gave you the option to change the

2016
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:09,329
order that those come in so I changed it

2017
01:18:07,619 --> 01:18:11,698
so it goes straight to the temperature

2018
01:18:09,329 --> 01:18:13,500
so when I press and hold temperature not

2019
01:18:11,698 --> 01:18:16,019
battery level so it's those kinds of

2020
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:18,238
little changes that we can very easily

2021
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:20,040
make via software and we are obviously

2022
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:21,448
making that we don't have to do a new

2023
01:18:20,039 --> 01:18:22,859
card where we don't have to release any

2024
01:18:21,448 --> 01:18:24,719
product people don't have to buy a new

2025
01:18:22,859 --> 01:18:26,279
version of it we can just roll out

2026
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:28,079
software updates and suddenly your vape

2027
01:18:26,279 --> 01:18:31,649
has a whole new mode or a whole new

2028
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:33,090
setting or somewhere in color or I mean

2029
01:18:31,649 --> 01:18:37,319
we can do we can't do that it just

2030
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:38,640
change the color of the LEDs but yeah so

2031
01:18:37,319 --> 01:18:40,529
there's there's a lot of opportunity

2032
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:42,560
with the fact that it is a connected

2033
01:18:40,529 --> 01:18:42,559
device

2034
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:54,900
yeah I mean in the ghost I think ship

2035
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:56,279
rinsky's works really well um wonder

2036
01:18:54,899 --> 01:18:57,869
Brett works really well I've actually

2037
01:18:56,279 --> 01:19:00,539
just hopped on the trend of Fidel's

2038
01:18:57,869 --> 01:19:02,069
he sells at her rhenium in LA um really

2039
01:19:00,539 --> 01:19:04,019
good concentrate really good live resin

2040
01:19:02,069 --> 01:19:06,599
rock garden works perfectly perfectly

2041
01:19:04,020 --> 01:19:07,949
well in the vape as well um honestly

2042
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:09,719
anything that's just grown really well

2043
01:19:07,948 --> 01:19:11,009
that's grown with respect because we

2044
01:19:09,719 --> 01:19:12,510
like to respect the flower that people

2045
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:14,400
really put the time in to grow their

2046
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:15,570
flower to get the best flower to it so

2047
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:17,129
that people even growing like terpenes

2048
01:19:15,569 --> 01:19:19,710
you know for THC design putting them on

2049
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:21,150
the on the on the bottle it's perfect

2050
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:24,000
for us you know to specifically hit

2051
01:19:21,149 --> 01:19:25,738
those temperatures so if you know what

2052
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,390
you're getting out of your you know what

2053
01:19:25,738 --> 01:19:28,979
terpenes are in your flowers and big

2054
01:19:27,390 --> 01:19:31,050
doses for any of those flowers you know

2055
01:19:28,979 --> 01:19:32,549
anyone who puts that time in to

2056
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:32,940
cultivate and get those terpenes out of

2057
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:34,470
their plan

2058
01:19:32,939 --> 01:19:36,779
okay we're gonna go right down the line

2059
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:38,010
when not using the ghost babe what are

2060
01:19:36,779 --> 01:19:40,500
you smoking out of are you rolling

2061
01:19:38,010 --> 01:19:42,750
joints a bong another usually doing

2062
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:44,310
joint pattern no usually doing joints

2063
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:46,409
joints or bongs I currently have a graph

2064
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:50,180
a graph helix long so if I'm not using

2065
01:19:46,409 --> 01:19:50,180
them b1 I mean that's what I'm using

2066
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:58,170
yeah same question I'm not gonna lie I'm

2067
01:19:54,060 --> 01:20:00,390
like 99% mv1 like I've I've now just

2068
01:19:58,170 --> 01:20:03,630
added the interest of product research

2069
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:06,630
I've now tried the Firefly the solo to

2070
01:20:03,630 --> 01:20:09,420
the mighty the crafty a bunch of cheap

2071
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:11,340
Chinese vaporizers a bunch of knockoff

2072
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:11,750
brands and every time I come back to the

2073
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:14,069
mv-1

2074
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:16,319
pretty much immediately because the

2075
01:20:14,069 --> 01:20:19,710
other ones are not great I have on

2076
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:21,000
occasion smoked a 2 or 3 puffs from a

2077
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:22,800
joint because that's about all I can

2078
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,829
ever handle and then I immediately wash

2079
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:27,840
my hands sometimes take a shower at the

2080
01:20:25,829 --> 01:20:30,390
very least change my clothes because I'm

2081
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:32,159
not I'm not wild about the lingering

2082
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:37,380
smell of cannabis in general which is

2083
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:39,869
why I like vaporizers wait what else do

2084
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:44,640
you smoke out of you know like the whole

2085
01:20:39,869 --> 01:20:46,619
time joints I do I was never good at

2086
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:51,060
joints I was really good at bowls though

2087
01:20:46,619 --> 01:20:53,279
yeah and at any time it's like okay you

2088
01:20:51,060 --> 01:20:55,830
know I have the ghost and I love it but

2089
01:20:53,279 --> 01:20:59,159
sometimes the closest thing is the

2090
01:20:55,829 --> 01:21:02,100
preloaded bowl that I always keep in my

2091
01:20:59,159 --> 01:21:05,939
shed and and it's always ready to go

2092
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:07,260
it's the perfect pack and so I'll I'll

2093
01:21:05,939 --> 01:21:09,089
hit on that every once in a while just

2094
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:11,520
because it's right there and the lighter

2095
01:21:09,090 --> 01:21:14,550
sits right next to it and then I

2096
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:16,920
realized though why now I've discovered

2097
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:18,779
vaporizers cuz it's like okay I know

2098
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:21,210
this will get me high in a second but

2099
01:21:18,779 --> 01:21:24,059
still it tastes like shit and it's like

2100
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:24,420
I feel like my my throat is literally on

2101
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:27,840
fire

2102
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:30,090
so it's like it's good to have that so

2103
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:32,520
that I can appreciate vaporizers as much

2104
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:34,260
as I do so yeah you're completely right

2105
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:36,840
on that I love how we get no coughs on

2106
01:21:34,260 --> 01:21:38,940
them v1 yeah it's great it's a surprise

2107
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:40,829
actually get I forget how smooth it is

2108
01:21:38,939 --> 01:21:42,359
until I hit a joint and then I remember

2109
01:21:40,829 --> 01:21:43,979
her look that's why I only get like two

2110
01:21:42,359 --> 01:21:45,929
or three puffs because I taste I like I

2111
01:21:43,979 --> 01:21:47,639
get like a pre-roll or I use my

2112
01:21:45,929 --> 01:21:49,380
my fancy Auto to roll a joint for me

2113
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:51,090
which is nice and then I'll pack it and

2114
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:52,619
I'll light it and I'll get maybe two or

2115
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:54,449
three hits and then it's just too much

2116
01:21:52,619 --> 01:21:56,130
it's too much it hurts my chest throat

2117
01:21:54,448 --> 01:21:57,779
right I'm done okay I guess I'll just

2118
01:21:56,130 --> 01:21:58,859
I'll just untwist it and pour the

2119
01:21:57,779 --> 01:22:00,829
underneath that remaining stuffing

2120
01:21:58,859 --> 01:22:03,960
crucibles

2121
01:22:00,829 --> 01:22:03,960
