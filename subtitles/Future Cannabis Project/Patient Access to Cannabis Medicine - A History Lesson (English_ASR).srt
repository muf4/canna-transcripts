1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,029
we are live patient access kind of a

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:11,609
history of patient access with a focus

3
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:14,189
on Los Angeles and a little bit the Bay

4
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:17,608
Area and then we will talk about the

5
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:21,868
current state of patients and access to

6
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:26,630
medical cannabis in 2020 so let's kick

7
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:29,129
it off and I think Sarah Armstrong if

8
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:34,259
you want to kind of start with a little

9
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:36,780
history like everyone sure um since

10
00:00:34,259 --> 00:00:40,619
access came very late to Los Angeles in

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,140
1996 The Compassionate Use Act was

12
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:46,199
passed and immediately in the Bay Area

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:51,929
places started opening up most not only

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:55,079
the Berkeley patient group which Don

15
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:57,509
Duncan was a founding member of what

16
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,058
happened in that way was people kept

17
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:03,780
trying and people kept getting raided

18
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:06,149
and closed I think most of you who have

19
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,420
been around for a while remember the

20
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,590
yellow house or Scott Ambler operation

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,490
in West Hollywood

22
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,759
it wasn't until 2005 when we had our

23
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:19,769
first stable group of dispensaries and

24
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,329
they were all in West Hollywood and West

25
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:23,329
Hollywood was very welcoming

26
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:28,920
Don Duncan who had been part of the

27
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:32,699
Berkeley patients group came to an open

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,530
deli PCG he worked with others to get an

29
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,640
ordinance in West Hollywood and then

30
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:42,030
turns his attention to Los Angeles he

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,750
was already an activist with 10 years

32
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,519
experience in the cannabis field and for

33
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,149
those of you who have never met him he's

34
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:56,489
a very short haired conservative looking

35
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:58,859
guy but very very engaging in a beat he

36
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:02,368
went and negotiated with Dennis ina

37
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:06,090
councilman at that time who's a former

38
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:10,330
cop and the end result of that was

39
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:13,360
something called the pre icos now today

40
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:15,850
one of your guests Michael Backus was on

41
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,150
that list he founded cornerstone and

42
00:02:15,849 --> 00:02:21,370
just so people know when people who were

43
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:24,129
really sick came into our dispensaries

44
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,319
we sent them to Cornerstone because we

45
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:29,560
knew that they would get the kind of

46
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,829
care the people who are really sick and

47
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:37,479
not going to be around in a year need so

48
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:41,320
he's one of my great heroes the pre ICO

49
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:44,159
list invited anyone who was operating in

50
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:47,530
the city to come forward and register

51
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:50,939
the promise was that you would get an

52
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:55,810
ordinance down the line that took from

53
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:57,849
2007 to 2010 and during that period all

54
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:00,780
of these people who came forward most

55
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:04,359
all of them were rated at at least once

56
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:07,120
the LAPD was not shy about this activity

57
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:11,920
and the DEA came every summer it was a

58
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:15,370
very dark time when the first ordinance

59
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:18,369
came forward in 2010 it was fatally

60
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,739
defective among other things it gave

61
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,739
people only something like a month to

62
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:26,439
find a location that would be compliant

63
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:28,569
with their sensitive uses which if any

64
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:31,329
of you have ever looked for dispensary

65
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:32,169
you know it did you never get a lease in

66
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,930
just one month

67
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:38,469
another real big problem was they wanted

68
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:40,810
all cannabis to be tested but they were

69
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:44,560
insisting that it be a certified lab

70
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:48,610
which means federal lab certification

71
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:51,340
and it cannot be done at the local level

72
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:56,200
because at the federal level marijuana

73
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:59,200
is illegal what followed then were a

74
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:03,069
series of ordinances ASA was the first

75
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,479
to sue we sued in 2010 on the original

76
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:12,430
ordinance but there were other lawsuits

77
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:15,219
and eventually things got so bad that a

78
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,879
consortium on the City Council we've

79
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:19,819
always had between three and five real

80
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:24,319
opponents

81
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:28,370
forced through a ban between 2012 and

82
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:31,790
2013 the retail operators in Los Angeles

83
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:37,399
came together with a meaningful assist

84
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:40,280
from UFCW local 770 they originally had

85
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:43,609
their ordinance we abandoned it in favor

86
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:47,809
of the city's ordinance which came to be

87
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:50,780
known as prop D it passed and for the

88
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:53,199
first time we had stability and for the

89
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:56,509
next three years everybody was under

90
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,479
what's called limited immunity limited

91
00:04:56,509 --> 00:05:01,490
immunity is just a system where if

92
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,470
you're accused of wrongdoing you can go

93
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,449
into court and say you know what I was

94
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:09,850
following the rules the city said I

95
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:13,670
should follow I am not the problem here

96
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:18,670
what happened with all this was a real

97
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:21,890
retardation in terms of any kind of

98
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:27,110
development for cultivators for

99
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:29,930
manufacturers they were under if they

100
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:34,720
were to claim limited immunity they had

101
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:36,920
to be part of a medical cannabis

102
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,030
dispensary and they were the patient

103
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:47,330
providers what this meant was that we

104
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:50,839
were kind of screwed up because there

105
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:52,370
was no real industry you know if it

106
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:54,669
existed it all it was kind of

107
00:05:52,370 --> 00:06:00,829
underground and sort of not two together

108
00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:04,069
and that led finally to prop M which was

109
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:07,669
launched by the ucba in tandem with the

110
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:12,620
UFCW they abandoned their voter

111
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:15,199
initiative in good form and signed on to

112
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:19,069
the city and that's really how you got

113
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,810
measure M which for the first time held

114
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:25,339
out the hope that we could have a true

115
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:27,290
industry concurrent with that there was

116
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:29,659
a real problem that the state of

117
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:31,540
California finally decided to regulate

118
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,390
and

119
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:38,020
everybody in their dog decided to tax so

120
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:40,569
while we finally had stability and the

121
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:43,930
promise of Licensing and the promise of

122
00:06:40,569 --> 00:06:49,329
an industry it rapidly became so

123
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:51,490
expensive for operators to exist that

124
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:53,229
they were passing cost funded on to

125
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:56,230
patients and there was very little

126
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:59,470
relief the state of California also did

127
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:02,170
some very nasty things they got rid of

128
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:05,520
the compassion program for what programs

129
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:08,560
for a while we fought back we got that

130
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:11,289
so it's been an ongoing dialogue with

131
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,259
the state but the kind of regulation

132
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:20,319
that you see nowadays is way too much

133
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:22,509
and way too expensive in Los Angeles we

134
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,490
self regulated the dispensaries self

135
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:27,639
regulated for many many years

136
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,560
they had a code of conduct which they

137
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:33,149
had to follow which was put forward by

138
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:36,370
glocca the Greater Los Angeles

139
00:07:33,149 --> 00:07:38,829
collective alliance and they did pretty

140
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:42,040
well I mean I don't ever remember going

141
00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:46,149
into a shop that was dirty or poorly

142
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:49,180
staffed or had any problems so from my

143
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:51,069
point of view one of the main bars to

144
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,579
safe access right now it's not

145
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:57,250
dispensary operators it's the taxes and

146
00:07:54,579 --> 00:08:00,699
regulation that have pushed them into a

147
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:05,399
very bad place and forced them to pass

148
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:09,939
on a lot of the costs to the patients

149
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:15,459
making save tested marijuana cannabis

150
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:17,290
very difficult to come by as a in a

151
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:22,180
price range that the average person

152
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:25,740
who's l can afford concurrent with this

153
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:28,930
there has been a huge upsurge in

154
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:35,019
delivery and retail operations that are

155
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:38,769
unlicensed repeated journalist exposes

156
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:41,929
have tested the products in these shops

157
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:43,919
and found them to be

158
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:46,019
contaminated with a lot of very

159
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,279
dangerous things and for patients it's

160
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:52,169
potentially dangerous because if you're

161
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,529
really sick you often have a compromised

162
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:57,089
immune system perhaps the best example

163
00:08:55,529 --> 00:09:00,839
of this was the great leader of black

164
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:04,710
iyami balonus was a transplant recipient

165
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:06,330
and in order to get the transplant to

166
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,960
work they have to suppress the immune

167
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,220
system so it's very important that

168
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:15,810
anything that's sold to a patient be

169
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:20,220
very very clean today the City Council

170
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:22,549
voted to support a state bill which

171
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,040
would allow law enforcement to test

172
00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:30,209
cannabis at cannabis licensed cannabis

173
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:34,490
labs so what we're thinking is to avoid

174
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:38,940
the war on drugs 2.0 keep this as a

175
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:40,379
civil nuisance abatement but factor in

176
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,020
the fact that if you're found to be

177
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,850
selling poison to the public you're

178
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,909
going to face some fines that are really

179
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:53,389
spectacular that's all I got does

180
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:58,279
anybody have any questions so since the

181
00:09:53,389 --> 00:10:05,610
reactivation of of the compassion and

182
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:07,799
program I guess it was in March how

183
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,680
effective has it been

184
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:14,370
I you know I I guess I'm asking in the

185
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:16,620
context of a pandemic you know which was

186
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:20,370
like the instigation for us wanting to

187
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:25,259
have this conversation patience you know

188
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:28,049
it's hard enough with the taxes how are

189
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:31,230
they surviving in the current situation

190
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:33,089
and so in that context how is the

191
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:40,110
compassion program doing like

192
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:43,170
anecdotally from y'all from nearly as

193
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:47,399
far as I can tell people are trying but

194
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:49,169
it is a very difficult time one shop is

195
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,449
starting in compassion programs

196
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:54,029
specifically for veterans

197
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:57,270
some of the bigger shots that do a lot

198
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:59,909
of volume have instituted it's very nice

199
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:02,730
is counts for senior citizens and

200
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:07,259
veterans I believe there is a very

201
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:09,120
famous compassion program that's run for

202
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:12,059
veterans and I think they are up and

203
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,480
running as nearly as I can tell in Los

204
00:11:12,059 --> 00:11:20,909
Angeles people badly want to reinstate

205
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:24,000
their compassion programs but the crown

206
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:28,769
of iris is just screwing everything up

207
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,049
does anybody else have any insight you

208
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:32,610
really have to ask I mean I think that I

209
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:35,069
haven't been in a lot of shops that you

210
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:39,600
know where they're asking you ask us

211
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:42,600
about our compassion program it's it's

212
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,040
it's really I think it's relatively new

213
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,930
and I think it's going to take a little

214
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:48,539
while to take hold and I think that a

215
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:51,629
lot of but also I think there's been

216
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:53,789
real sea change among ownership of

217
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:59,009
dispensaries I mean it used to be true

218
00:11:53,789 --> 00:12:02,549
mom and pops and now I mean I can't tell

219
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:05,370
you how many dispensaries in LA where I

220
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:08,689
used to know the owners well now they've

221
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:12,330
been basically bought by you know

222
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:14,340
charitably hedge fund guys and and

223
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,960
really they've changed their pricing

224
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:19,320
they've gotten much more aggressive on

225
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,570
their markups it used to be basically

226
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,160
everything was Keystone so when a

227
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,900
dispensary bought something they

228
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:27,299
basically just doubled the price like

229
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:29,220
most retailers do these days the average

230
00:12:27,299 --> 00:12:33,059
is 2.7 times

231
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:34,230
markup and that's dramatic increase and

232
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:37,250
they're saying oh well that's because we

233
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:39,539
have to pay taxes on the products but

234
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:44,940
doesn't the math doesn't really work out

235
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:48,179
so I think I think California cannabis

236
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:52,970
industry is really suffering some issues

237
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:56,189
that predate the pandemic but were

238
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:57,509
exacerbated by the pandemic and so I

239
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,120
think it's gonna be a little while -

240
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:03,509
we're out of the woods and till these

241
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,129
businesses are a little healthier

242
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:07,769
and I think that that's gonna that's

243
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:11,220
really impacts patient access I mean and

244
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:12,659
then also the truth is most dispensaries

245
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,149
really don't train their staff

246
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:17,730
particularly well and they never they

247
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:20,970
they've often been very compassionate

248
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:23,550
towards patients but they can't really

249
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,680
help patients because they don't know

250
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:27,959
what's in the products I mean I was in a

251
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:32,000
big fancy dispensary the other day and I

252
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:37,440
asked some really basic questions and

253
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:40,409
you know the staff looked at me like you

254
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,300
know it was like asking a cow what were

255
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:44,959
some example questions that you were

256
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:49,079
asking how much are these clothes

257
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:50,759
how you have terpene testing listed on

258
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,889
every one of your products

259
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:58,409
who does the terpene testing does the

260
00:13:52,889 --> 00:14:01,919
cultivator do it or does a lab to it who

261
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:04,259
determines I mean do these change batch

262
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,789
to batch there was so you know they were

263
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:07,319
listening and all the varieties and

264
00:14:05,789 --> 00:14:10,049
they're the three predominant terpenes

265
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,000
and of course in my experience that

266
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,109
those can move a little bit crop to crop

267
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,730
depending on storage conditions

268
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:19,139
depending all constants and and so

269
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:22,639
basically I was asking is is this

270
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:24,659
information accurate and prove it and

271
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,799
that seems like a reasonable question

272
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:32,549
because if I walk into like CVS and ask

273
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:37,319
to see you know their coa for valium

274
00:14:32,549 --> 00:14:40,769
they have one okay and these places just

275
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:43,800
aren't really in the medicine business

276
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:46,129
well you're right Michael I you know but

277
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:49,500
you know the state doesn't require a

278
00:14:46,129 --> 00:14:50,970
dispensary to train their staff no not

279
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,299
at all flattered oh by the way but not

280
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:56,910
at all and and it's and it's literally

281
00:14:54,299 --> 00:15:00,359
it's gonna be the public that demands

282
00:14:56,909 --> 00:15:01,649
the dispensaries train their staff but

283
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,570
the problem is you got to educate the

284
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:07,649
public too and that's so that's another

285
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:10,680
thing but um yeah kind of it's

286
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:13,500
responsibility honestly I you know they

287
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:16,019
they feel very responsible in making

288
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,100
sure you track your products you label

289
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:18,989
them correct

290
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,379
but they're okay with letting anyone

291
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:25,319
step into a dispensary and pretend to

292
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:27,839
know how it works as medicine you know

293
00:15:25,318 --> 00:15:32,068
and you like you said they don't know

294
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:34,139
the the CVS has licensed pharmacists

295
00:15:32,068 --> 00:15:35,938
yeah I mean you know the classic thing

296
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:37,798
is that you know basically the

297
00:15:35,938 --> 00:15:39,480
distinguishing factors to recommending

298
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:41,818
medicine to patients are indica and

299
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,259
sativa but as I said I was on the

300
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:46,708
spreadsheet can only think the other day

301
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:51,169
and I said that indica and sativa is

302
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:53,849
this good at predicting effect as

303
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:57,088
thinking you can tell the taste of a nut

304
00:15:53,850 --> 00:16:00,089
by looking at the shape of the tree and

305
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:02,819
I mean yeah these people don't have no

306
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:04,889
scientific background at all and they're

307
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:06,778
not they're not trained so you know I'm

308
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:09,749
not really pointing fingers at them I

309
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:13,558
feel kind of that we've got to change

310
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:15,808
that culture because people are coming

311
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:18,269
in asking for medicine and to be really

312
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:20,458
great if the complete responsibility

313
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:22,889
wasn't on the patient I mean that's what

314
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:25,258
I tried to do back at cornerstone was

315
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:28,289
start to change that equation by making

316
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:29,490
my staff read papers and understand some

317
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:32,698
of the more technical details of

318
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,558
cannabis and really I agreed completely

319
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:36,389
with you my class and really the you

320
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:39,990
know going back to the patient the

321
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:43,350
patient is experiencing the effect and

322
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:46,980
are we asking the patient I mean every

323
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:51,269
day I talk to patients and I asked them

324
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:53,600
what they were affect is but no one's

325
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:56,850
really asking or collecting that data

326
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:00,778
you know that's what I've begun to do so

327
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:02,548
that we can correlate the active

328
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:04,259
ingredients the active product

329
00:17:02,548 --> 00:17:07,798
ingredients within the fact it's a

330
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:11,278
pretty simple thing to do we can

331
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:13,318
crowdsource and find out and you know

332
00:17:11,278 --> 00:17:18,119
I'd love the for the regulatory

333
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:20,730
practices to be to have that in thought

334
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:24,629
you know involvement rather than call

335
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:27,028
about tht getting high and and being

336
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:30,220
worried about adverse events like

337
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:32,710
driving t8 CNS that seems to be the

338
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,659
this of any research but really what we

339
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,829
should be looking at or the

340
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:38,080
characteristic effects

341
00:17:35,829 --> 00:17:42,129
I mean cannabis cannabis science still

342
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:45,668
suffers from kind of NIDA on down which

343
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:47,289
is you know as as Nora bloke out is the

344
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:50,620
head of the National Institute of drug

345
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:52,440
abuse said that weren't out the National

346
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:56,168
Institutes of drug use

347
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:58,029
we just are into how it's abused and

348
00:17:56,169 --> 00:18:00,309
therefore that's what our research is

349
00:17:58,029 --> 00:18:03,339
going to focus on or focus on abuse and

350
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:05,279
that's to this day I mean it's improved

351
00:18:03,339 --> 00:18:09,099
a little bit but not much

352
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:12,668
right I mean most mostly doses restored

353
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:13,808
the death of doing cannabis research

354
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:17,080
because they're afraid they're going to

355
00:18:13,808 --> 00:18:20,339
use lose their DEA license you know

356
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,339
which they need to do a lot of research

357
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:26,619
and at the local level I go in all the

358
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:29,379
time show my driver's license and make a

359
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:32,048
little bi talk to the bud tenders and

360
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,090
one of the most unfortunate things is

361
00:18:32,048 --> 00:18:36,970
they really don't know their medicine

362
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:40,240
but they sure know how to upsell they're

363
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,480
very sales oriented and if you're

364
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,400
patient and you're sick most likely you

365
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,339
don't have all the money in the world to

366
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,100
spend and if you're being told oh well

367
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:55,269
if you need this effect you have to

368
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:56,678
spend Y amount of money that's kind of a

369
00:18:55,269 --> 00:19:01,658
hard thing to hear when you're really

370
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:03,250
sick yeah and the truth is the the

371
00:19:01,659 --> 00:19:05,679
badhak and they it's really inexpensive

372
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,390
medicines I mean because I've seen this

373
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,788
before I've seen compassion programs

374
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:11,950
that basically scoop from the bottom of

375
00:19:09,788 --> 00:19:12,609
the barrel to help patients and the

376
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,730
truth is

377
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:17,769
patients often need the cannabis that's

378
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:20,230
in the best shape not the cannabis

379
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:22,658
that's indifferent ly cultivated and has

380
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:26,319
been poorly stored and was grown a long

381
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:28,630
time ago and yeah I mean and and I've

382
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:32,168
fought I fought with with you know

383
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:34,240
partners and dispensaries to raise the

384
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:35,830
quality of medicine that is provided

385
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,069
under compassion programs because I

386
00:19:35,829 --> 00:19:41,048
think that often you know patients don't

387
00:19:39,069 --> 00:19:43,369
need one more problem which is to get

388
00:19:41,048 --> 00:19:45,549
you know indifferently pretty

389
00:19:43,369 --> 00:19:49,369
cannabis and try to use it as a medicine

390
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:52,460
so I have a question if if patients and

391
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:55,639
I'm one of them and I totally concur if

392
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,500
you cannot derive that information that

393
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,320
you need from the budtender at the

394
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,150
dispensary where do you get it Alice

395
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:08,599
where do you go where do you go and get

396
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:11,150
the data and information hi guys yeah as

397
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:14,089
a patient myself I just thank you for

398
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:16,040
pointing me out you know I definitely

399
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:19,129
want to say you know I have cerebral

400
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:24,289
palsy and my wife has multiple sclerosis

401
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:26,000
and we're both on SSI you know we do not

402
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:29,720
have all the money in the world to spend

403
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,319
on quality you know quality care we

404
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:37,640
basically had to create our own platform

405
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:40,159
called we are rollingstone.com to to

406
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,880
figure out which medicines were were

407
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:46,160
doing the good stuff and and that we

408
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:50,690
could say yeah I had no ass adverse

409
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:53,720
effects it's basically been through that

410
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:56,269
platform than I've been able to you know

411
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,269
meet people that are giving me good

412
00:20:56,269 --> 00:21:01,670
medicines and you know occasionally

413
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:03,529
they'll kind of throw me a bone but I

414
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:07,640
feel like there's not enough of that at

415
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:13,399
all it's all about money money money

416
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:15,500
it's not really about healing when but

417
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,269
there are certain places like three

418
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,640
sheep farms that are doing really great

419
00:21:17,269 --> 00:21:21,769
things with their medicines but that's

420
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,790
few and far between especially here in

421
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:25,190
Los Angeles

422
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:30,980
absolutely but when I first started

423
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:34,220
medicating in 2007 I could tell you that

424
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,589
I half the time I would panic when I was

425
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,410
medicating and I was medicating to stop

426
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:43,069
seizures at that point so there was

427
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:44,660
large points in time where I would stop

428
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:47,990
medicating because it would just you

429
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:50,179
know it would defeat the purpose of why

430
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:53,690
I was doing it and then once that

431
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:55,820
everything got regulated I could I could

432
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,750
medicate with whatever I want however

433
00:21:55,819 --> 00:22:01,720
much I

434
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:04,150
the sky's the limit rainy but it's crazy

435
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:07,190
crazy unaffordable

436
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,870
but there's places like Cali hatch

437
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:14,360
there's 3c farms

438
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:16,548
raw garden you know I think you know you

439
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:19,639
just have to find people that are maybe

440
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:22,250
having more or less the middle ground in

441
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:29,600
their pricing but are also getting that

442
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:32,450
top quality medicine I mean you know at

443
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:35,689
all to the patients and what you were

444
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:39,110
saying I mean I hate it when I go to go

445
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:42,919
in and talk to whoever people that I

446
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:43,879
know and I said oh what about this it

447
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:45,650
drives me nuts

448
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,789
I mean it's great because there aren't

449
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:52,400
there are extra companies now that are I

450
00:22:48,788 --> 00:22:54,200
mean extracts are really put through the

451
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,330
mill because what it is is that if they

452
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,120
get that cannabis that problem gets

453
00:22:56,329 --> 00:23:01,158
concentrated in the concentrate and so

454
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,609
and so what's good is is when you get a

455
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:05,900
clean concentrate and and you get

456
00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:09,859
companies that really know how to make

457
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:11,840
them the good news is is that it often

458
00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:13,519
could provide more affordable medicine

459
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:17,119
to patients I mean I really like raw

460
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:19,759
garden because there's inexpensive and

461
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:21,939
there's a lot of bang for the buck they

462
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:25,579
know how to protect terpene content

463
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:28,000
though often the retailers don't I mean

464
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:31,129
the thing is is that from as medicine

465
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,429
cannabis should be kept cold and it

466
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:37,039
rarely is and and extracts are even more

467
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:40,159
delicate and so if you're using cannabis

468
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:42,319
as a extracts as a medicine you kind of

469
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,080
have to find people that understand that

470
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:49,609
the supply chain it's more like produce

471
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:50,990
than it is cardboard and so you have to

472
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:53,149
you know just like you wouldn't leave a

473
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,038
head of lettuce out for four months you

474
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,929
probably don't want to leave a cannabis

475
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:58,970
extract at room temperature for four

476
00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:00,009
months because a lot of it's going to

477
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:06,769
break down

478
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:09,900
interesting interesting go ahead I mean

479
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:11,339
I'm just rambling go ahead

480
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,290
you know I'm just wondering if they

481
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:15,809
break does the breakdown happen over

482
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:17,849
four months or is it is it gradual over

483
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:20,099
that time Michael actually in the case

484
00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:23,159
of some of the lighter monoterpenes like

485
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:27,179
like mere scene you can lose half of

486
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:30,900
your Mercian content in less than 45

487
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:32,490
days you don't refrigerate and so my

488
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:36,269
recommendation for people who use

489
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:38,130
cannabis as a medicine is don't assume

490
00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:40,410
it's been handled correctly before it

491
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:43,170
gets to you but take responsibility once

492
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:45,450
it does and what I do is I recommend you

493
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:46,769
keep your cannabis in the freezer and

494
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:50,039
just take out what you're going to use

495
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:52,710
and don't let it thaw think of it like

496
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:57,210
like ice cream okay you want to keep it

497
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:58,680
cold so that's why that's why rock

498
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:00,750
garden is as good as they are because

499
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,549
they use that fresh frozen technique

500
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,569
yeah a lot of people on people are now I

501
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:05,639
mean the thing is if you're using

502
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:07,470
hydrocarbon extraction you want to use

503
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:09,600
fresh frozen cannabis and the reason is

504
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:11,759
is it's just it's it's just how the

505
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:14,429
extraction machines work I mean I've

506
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:17,519
gotten really into extraction technology

507
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:19,259
and and so yeah I mean I bought a

508
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:22,170
low-temperature freezers it keeps

509
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:23,759
everything at you know minus 76 and you

510
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:25,740
know it's really and then and then when

511
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,799
you extract you extract at a hundred and

512
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,329
twenty degrees below zero and what that

513
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,409
does is that allows you to make high

514
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:35,960
terrific Strax

515
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:38,220
and it's these high terpene cannabinoid

516
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,079
combinations that I find have the most

517
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:44,180
medicinal efficiency whether you're

518
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,179
talking about THC or CBD or whatever

519
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:51,210
exactly exactly so it's really it's a

520
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:54,629
yes it's a really fascinating thing I

521
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:56,309
mean that we you know I was on here

522
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:58,860
basically to talk about cornerstone corn

523
00:25:56,309 --> 00:26:00,419
Stone started we knew nothing about the

524
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:02,250
science we couldn't find anything with

525
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:05,100
CBD in it the first time I ever got a

526
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:06,900
plant that supposedly had CBD in it we

527
00:26:05,099 --> 00:26:09,509
went through a whole crop cycle to find

528
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:12,690
out that the person was mistaken they've

529
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:16,440
given us Harlequin and and when we

530
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:18,029
tested it it was pure THC and and we

531
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,920
found out when what we liked we were so

532
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:21,089
excited we got our first crop of CBD we

533
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,600
gave it to a bunch of people and they

534
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:28,089
immediately called within hours

535
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:30,038
man I'm really stoned this kind of that

536
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:32,500
was kind of misfires I mean when we

537
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:35,200
started looking for CBD of down in

538
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,509
Southern California Northern California

539
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,819
was already ahead of us and so folks

540
00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:42,879
like Martin Lee and Fred garner who

541
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:46,829
formed Project CBD work with gardeners

542
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,179
like Wayne lost we lost her and and

543
00:26:46,829 --> 00:26:52,990
warrants Ringo and these guys who were

544
00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:56,559
the first people to find plants that

545
00:26:52,990 --> 00:27:00,220
that had any CBD this is before the pure

546
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:02,109
CBD varieties there was whoa the the

547
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,850
story of CBD in the West is really

548
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:07,109
fascinating and I don't know if a lot of

549
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:12,399
people know it but what happened was a

550
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:14,408
kid bought a kilo of New York East Coast

551
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,559
Sour Diesel seeds from selma in

552
00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:19,950
amsterdam didn't pay for them went down

553
00:27:17,558 --> 00:27:26,019
to Spain and grot a bunch of them and

554
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:29,409
one of those seeds became the pure CBD

555
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:32,288
line which was called catatonic when it

556
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:34,270
was in Spain and when it was stolen and

557
00:27:32,288 --> 00:27:37,150
brought to Northern California they

558
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:38,918
renamed it ac/dc and then the Stanley

559
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,690
Brothers stole it and they took it to

560
00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:44,620
Colorado and they called it Charlotte's

561
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:46,600
Web and and the thing is is that I mean

562
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:48,658
but but that's not like pointing fingers

563
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:52,000
that's how it's done people lift

564
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:55,150
genetics all the historically all the

565
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,109
time and so there were these groups of

566
00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:01,090
type two genetics like Harlequin and

567
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:04,839
that were THC and CBD

568
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:07,058
but when ac/dc first showed up that

569
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:10,089
revolutionized California cannabis

570
00:28:07,058 --> 00:28:11,798
because that led to it being used as a

571
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:14,168
effective treatment for epilepsy and

572
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:16,869
seizures and people starting to ask what

573
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:22,150
is this and it's pure CBD and then you

574
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:24,819
know Gupta does the you know the CNN

575
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:26,650
special and it takes off but in the

576
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:29,168
early days when I was just starting in

577
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:31,419
like 2007 we didn't know anything about

578
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:35,080
terpenes Ethan Rousseau were on a paper

579
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:36,220
about it in dysfunction 2008-2009 that I

580
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:39,819
just devour

581
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:42,100
and but until steep hill opened up in

582
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:44,079
the Bay Area there was no place to test

583
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:46,750
cannabis in California for a cannabinoid

584
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:49,178
terpene content but seeking Angela the

585
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:50,798
best thing he ever did was he got ahead

586
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:52,720
of the curve in cannabis science in

587
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,579
California and he opened the first lab

588
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,679
and then that led to the formation of

589
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:59,619
other labs folks from steep hill went

590
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:01,960
informed SC labs today there are a lot

591
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:04,689
of reasonably decent labs there's some

592
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:07,450
pretty bad ones but but there are some

593
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,250
good ones and that allows us to know

594
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:11,889
what's in the plan and when I started at

595
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,480
Cornerstone we didn't know but we really

596
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:16,148
try to pay attention to our patients and

597
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,069
also us in the super exotic genetics so

598
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:21,788
I was always trying to find land races

599
00:29:18,069 --> 00:29:24,490
and weird stuff and some of those proved

600
00:29:21,788 --> 00:29:26,919
to be reasonably effective I have this

601
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:29,589
note here medicine then and now which is

602
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:31,600
what you're speaking to so do you so do

603
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:34,599
you feel as though you understand the

604
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:37,719
medicinal properties of the products

605
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:43,048
you're dealing with better now than you

606
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:45,370
did back in 2007 um I assume that's true

607
00:29:43,048 --> 00:29:47,648
yeah that's true but I mean we have a

608
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:50,168
long way to go I mean the thing is is

609
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:51,489
that um our understanding is the thing

610
00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:52,750
is is now that work starting to

611
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:55,659
understand that the endocannabinoid

612
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:58,119
system in the body does not just consist

613
00:29:55,659 --> 00:30:04,629
of endocannabinoid receptors like cb1

614
00:29:58,119 --> 00:30:06,878
and cb2 or the notional cb3 now that's

615
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:09,339
it's actually interacting with a ton of

616
00:30:06,878 --> 00:30:14,949
different scepter systems serotonin and

617
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:17,589
dopamine the trip receptors of the

618
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:19,298
thermo receptors once you start to see

619
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:21,038
that these combination of plant

620
00:30:19,298 --> 00:30:23,319
chemicals are hitting all of these

621
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:26,019
different receptor systems in the body

622
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:28,210
and that's actually responsible for the

623
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:30,940
pharmacology of cannabis and and how

624
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:32,319
it's working as a medicine you know and

625
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:37,149
something like Alice is looking for

626
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:41,138
results we're just now coming out of the

627
00:30:37,148 --> 00:30:44,979
mist you know with with with doctors

628
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:46,569
like our doctor here starting to ask the

629
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,470
questions what we're starting to see is

630
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:51,720
we're applying chemistry to outcome

631
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:54,509
and starting to see patterns but we

632
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,980
haven't got a long way to go I mean you

633
00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:58,528
know the bottom line is it's still

634
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,538
trying to stick a spear and a barrel and

635
00:30:58,528 --> 00:31:04,619
get the right fish you know it's really

636
00:31:00,538 --> 00:31:06,929
tough actually John that gets to you had

637
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:08,969
mentioned before we started that what

638
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:11,909
you wrote your first prescription while

639
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:13,740
you were a read in residency and you

640
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:16,320
kind of thought it was bullshit so can

641
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:20,099
you talk about kind of the change in

642
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:23,398
kind of perception well the change for

643
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:28,980
me came from the patients that I saw

644
00:31:23,398 --> 00:31:33,288
through the years from a doctor's point

645
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:36,569
of view we rely on clinical trials

646
00:31:33,288 --> 00:31:39,179
randomly controlled double-blind trials

647
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:43,378
to prove something is medicine

648
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:47,100
quote/unquote medicine and there have

649
00:31:43,378 --> 00:31:50,490
been very very few clinical trials on

650
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:55,079
cannabis and that's due to prohibition

651
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:58,798
federal prohibition so as a doctor I've

652
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:59,699
had to switch gears and just take one

653
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:04,829
patient at a time

654
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:08,159
and over the 20 years of talking to

655
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:10,589
patients I've seen miracles that's what

656
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:16,230
convinced me that there is something

657
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:18,480
happening here but in the end whatever

658
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:20,548
how am I going to convince other doctors

659
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,970
that there's something happening I've

660
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:27,388
got to start doing these clinical trials

661
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:31,308
and that requires number one consistent

662
00:32:27,388 --> 00:32:34,878
medicine from from the manufacturers and

663
00:32:31,308 --> 00:32:38,009
and then you know the appropriate study

664
00:32:34,878 --> 00:32:41,219
so that's that's where I'm at it you

665
00:32:38,009 --> 00:32:43,798
know we're trying to take these miracle

666
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:46,710
cases and and pull them all together

667
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:48,869
it's a clinical trials so that we can

668
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:51,960
prove that there's actually something

669
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:54,959
happening but at this point to your

670
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:58,100
average doctor cannabis is not proven

671
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,929
medicine at this point and that's this

672
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:07,399
that past all these years and we're

673
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:10,910
still at step one um so do you think

674
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:12,288
that we're gonna see you know one of the

675
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:16,400
biggest things is when you see these

676
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:18,200
these Cochrane reviews of cannabis and

677
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,019
cannabinoids for different conditions

678
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:23,000
they always say all these studies is on

679
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:24,349
the studies were too small so if they're

680
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,788
any trials at all they're always too

681
00:33:24,349 --> 00:33:31,099
small you think you envision a time when

682
00:33:28,788 --> 00:33:34,669
we can do the kind of large-scale

683
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:38,329
studies that you know the establishment

684
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:41,720
appears to demand yeah absolutely well

685
00:33:38,329 --> 00:33:45,199
finding the right product is the first

686
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:48,288
step you know and it's like hunting for

687
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,048
a needle in a haystack right to find

688
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:53,900
that one product and then you know

689
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:55,759
there's a lot of variability in patience

690
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,610
everyone's got a different genetic

691
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:03,079
makeup and different metabolisms so it's

692
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:06,229
a many-to-many problem and you know our

693
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:09,168
approach i you know i founded a research

694
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:11,300
organization five years ago the clinical

695
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:14,000
endocannabinoid system consortium

696
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:16,070
mouthful but what what we're doing is

697
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,210
we're we're taking the approach of

698
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:22,369
starting with the patient and

699
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:25,820
crowdsourcing information so that we can

700
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:28,399
help so that that can direct us toward

701
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:32,269
finding that needle in the haystack and

702
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:34,940
then moving forward with with that magic

703
00:34:32,269 --> 00:34:38,840
product and truly testing it for

704
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:42,829
specific indications like pain or or ms

705
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:46,010
or or diabetes whatever claims that are

706
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:49,009
out there so yeah we envisioned it and

707
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:51,679
we believe that our approach in working

708
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:53,859
backwards essentially you know sampling

709
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:59,180
the huge amount of patients right now

710
00:34:53,858 --> 00:35:03,139
that are taking medicine and or taking

711
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:05,389
cannabis and figuring out which ones are

712
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:08,599
having some effect and then starting

713
00:35:05,389 --> 00:35:10,159
from from there to do the randomly

714
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:13,529
control

715
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:15,210
double-blind trials it's actually I

716
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:22,110
asked Alice a question Alice have you

717
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:25,019
you seen your outcomes improve uh I mean

718
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:27,510
a hundred percent a hundred percent and

719
00:35:25,019 --> 00:35:30,840
what what what's made the biggest

720
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:32,850
difference for you well like like I said

721
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,519
I used to get you know here in Los

722
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:39,059
Angeles before all the regulations went

723
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:41,849
down I would get cannabis that I knew

724
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:43,559
was probably grown by the guy that owned

725
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:45,210
the dispensary at the time it was mother

726
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:48,809
nature's remedy I believe they were

727
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:51,329
called and yeah you would just get

728
00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:54,090
cannabis with like a label what the

729
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:56,219
strain name was and that was it it was

730
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:59,130
much cheaper than but the effect was

731
00:35:56,219 --> 00:36:02,489
like I would I would have panic attacks

732
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:05,010
often you know which who knows what I

733
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:07,799
was inhaling all of us you know all the

734
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:10,410
stuff that wasn't lab tested and then it

735
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,780
was only about I would say about two or

736
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:16,109
three years but I've been able to get

737
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:18,990
you know somewhat affordable medicine

738
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:23,070
that's the that is regulated and it's

739
00:36:18,989 --> 00:36:23,809
it's just like my body has never felt

740
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:26,700
better

741
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:29,239
it's just like every you know I can

742
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:30,359
smoke most everything I still prefer

743
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:32,429
sun-grown

744
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:35,640
cannabis because I feel like there's

745
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:39,119
more therapeutic aspect to it as far as

746
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:42,119
terpene profiles and you know I feel

747
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,469
like indoor medicine is very strong but

748
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:47,309
it depends on what kind of day I'm

749
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:50,669
having you know I I have what's called

750
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:55,909
spatsy to deplete your cerebral palsy so

751
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:55,909
I have a constant body stiffness slash

752
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:00,960
you know twitch and I'm always dealing

753
00:36:58,769 --> 00:37:05,130
with I'm always tired because I'm always

754
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,320
moving so I like a balance of you know

755
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:10,349
medicine that's gonna relax my body but

756
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:12,480
also you know keep me awake so it's

757
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:13,949
always a fine balance you know like you

758
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,869
said everybody's different you know

759
00:37:13,949 --> 00:37:18,929
whereas my wife she has multiple

760
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:23,250
sclerosis and she can medicate all day

761
00:37:18,929 --> 00:37:23,639
long and have the strongest stuff and

762
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:27,570
still

763
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:29,519
great you know and I you know I feel as

764
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,320
far as that's what I why I started

765
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:36,059
rolling stone' is because my wife was

766
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:38,550
doing so well it's I feel without it she

767
00:37:36,059 --> 00:37:41,579
just be bedridden and she's not I mean

768
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:43,830
we're able to be our own advocates

769
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:47,369
I mean regulated medicine has been

770
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:49,619
amazing it's just as far as actually

771
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:57,449
making it affordable to patients it's a

772
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:59,309
joke yep other patients and other people

773
00:37:57,449 --> 00:38:02,730
who are also having similar problems

774
00:37:59,309 --> 00:38:05,880
paying for it you have any I mean in

775
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:09,780
your community that you can yeah I mean

776
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:13,170
a lot of people or they'll go with like

777
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:16,710
a lesser product or you know they won't

778
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:19,500
necessarily maybe get there the right

779
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:21,539
med you know like you find like you said

780
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:24,210
you find the right med and then all the

781
00:38:21,539 --> 00:38:26,960
sudden it's it's not there anymore or

782
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:30,500
you know if there's an issue with

783
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:33,389
getting that but I feel like so I mean

784
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:37,190
honestly I feel like so many people with

785
00:38:33,389 --> 00:38:39,239
disabilities and and severe illnesses

786
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:42,360
cannabis doesn't even enter their mind

787
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:45,299
to be honest with you which is why when

788
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,920
I started my platform I was like I don't

789
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,630
know you know I'm an actor I don't know

790
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,389
if I should get involved in this you

791
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:53,490
know blah blah but then there were so

792
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:55,829
many people that I already thought were

793
00:38:53,489 --> 00:39:01,139
already on that train and they're just

794
00:38:55,829 --> 00:39:04,920
not you know and it's it's we're still

795
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:06,659
learning and we're not even at step one

796
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,750
I think as far as people with

797
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:12,359
disabilities and oldest illnesses go so

798
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:16,590
that's why I teach you from a standpoint

799
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:18,000
of very basic you know because most

800
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:21,450
people don't even know what I'm talking

801
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,239
about which is sad because the treatment

802
00:39:21,449 --> 00:39:29,639
for someone like me would probably be

803
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:31,469
valium baclofen any of those type

804
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:34,609
medicines where you know I would have a

805
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:34,609
lesser quality of life

806
00:39:36,739 --> 00:39:43,019
Wow Jett John you're you're about to say

807
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:46,050
something oh right

808
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:48,630
well what one of my experiences outside

809
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:51,240
of the crisis the consistency as Alice

810
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:52,829
just pointed out you know she's looking

811
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:54,989
for a medicine she finds the right

812
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:59,130
medicine and then she goes back and it's

813
00:39:54,989 --> 00:40:03,599
not there as well you know I followed

814
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:06,869
patients I I was following a little girl

815
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:10,440
was Lennox Gusto's seizures similar to

816
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:12,960
Charlotte of Charlotte's Web and and we

817
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,480
were getting wonderful results and then

818
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,760
you know one day the seizures came back

819
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:21,150
and we didn't change the dose or

820
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:25,230
anything eventually we found out that

821
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:28,230
the medicine had shake like likely we

822
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:32,429
were following CBD but because terpenes

823
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:36,289
may be involved the terpenes likely

824
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:40,079
changed the effect of it and so you know

825
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:42,809
consistency and and proper labeling or

826
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:46,590
required but I don't think the terpene

827
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:49,949
profiles are completely required in

828
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:51,780
California and so well like we're all

829
00:40:49,949 --> 00:40:54,719
saying we've got a long way to go and

830
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:57,420
really understanding this and and making

831
00:40:54,719 --> 00:41:00,959
sure that the whole whole plant all the

832
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:03,930
active ingredients are considered for

833
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,619
our patients say and this is really

834
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:10,710
where I think you know advocacy groups

835
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:12,960
and the state need to get involved and

836
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:14,460
focusing on the patient and making sure

837
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,400
that they're getting the best medicine

838
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:19,920
rather than taxing them you know and

839
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,860
making sure that they get you know fill

840
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:28,250
the state's coffers it might be more

841
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:31,710
important to push toward true medical

842
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:35,659
research I'm gonna be great if it be

843
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:40,980
great if if we could actually get some

844
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:44,009
movement behind a not-for-profit medical

845
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:46,139
dispensary and and the thing is is that

846
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:48,440
you know I mean when I first got into

847
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:52,548
this the gold standard was

848
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:55,489
was Wham but up in Santa Cruz which

849
00:41:52,548 --> 00:41:57,829
which was for hospice patients terminal

850
00:41:55,489 --> 00:42:02,239
hospice patients and only provided the

851
00:41:57,829 --> 00:42:05,359
meds free to those patients and it was

852
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:09,099
great but the problem is it was very

853
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:12,199
very self-limiting because you can only

854
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:15,430
really meet the needs of X number of

855
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:20,239
patients but the good news is I think

856
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:22,399
that the technology that's used to both

857
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:25,728
cultivate and extract cannabis is

858
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:29,838
getting really really efficient and so I

859
00:42:25,728 --> 00:42:35,419
think that it may actually make a non

860
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:37,429
profit dispensary viable shortly and I

861
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:40,220
think that I think we got to stop

862
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:44,858
fooling around and and basically you

863
00:42:40,219 --> 00:42:47,058
know medical cannabis post regulation in

864
00:42:44,858 --> 00:42:50,199
California has done the same thing it's

865
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:51,319
done in every state that seen adult use

866
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:57,169
regulated

867
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:59,538
it's basically cratered and because

868
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:01,338
everybody's trying to to recoup their

869
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:03,079
investments and make their investors

870
00:43:01,338 --> 00:43:05,599
happy to all this crap and the patients

871
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:08,269
suffer and I think that the thing that

872
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,660
really is we should really start to

873
00:43:08,268 --> 00:43:13,699
treat this like medicine and medicine

874
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:16,788
that we need to make affordable for

875
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:19,848
patients and it's really gonna be

876
00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:22,789
challenging you know if you guys want to

877
00:43:19,849 --> 00:43:25,009
straight that non-for-profit I'm young

878
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:29,839
I've got a lot of years left in me yeah

879
00:43:25,009 --> 00:43:32,869
I'm old I don't but doesn't mean I'm not

880
00:43:29,838 --> 00:43:35,380
down for it it's the yeah it's it's

881
00:43:32,869 --> 00:43:39,619
something I'd love to spend more time on

882
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:43,130
the yeah it's really I I work with the

883
00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:44,599
dispensary in Hawaii and and it's been

884
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:48,318
really challenging there because it's so

885
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:52,160
highly regulated that's really expensive

886
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:54,320
to produce medicine and um

887
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:56,480
but in California I mean you know we've

888
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,470
got you know Central Valley has lots of

889
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:03,820
room to grow

890
00:43:57,469 --> 00:44:08,779
no not for profit cannabis so are are

891
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:11,059
are there any I I mean I know everyone

892
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:13,490
was a collective and not-for-profit up

893
00:44:11,059 --> 00:44:15,799
until a certain point it kind of seems

894
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:21,759
like everything shifted in the other

895
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:25,010
direction so are there are there still

896
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:30,620
could one be a not-for-profit retail

897
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:31,970
shop well no I mean I think Sarah may be

898
00:44:30,619 --> 00:44:34,309
able to address that but I think so

899
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:37,279
because with the recent changes in state

900
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:40,549
laws with the return of the compassion

901
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:44,410
programs I think there actually is room

902
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:48,440
now for this to get some traction and

903
00:44:44,409 --> 00:44:50,989
yeah it just takes just takes willpower

904
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,320
right now I mean and and money I mean

905
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:55,729
it's gonna take some way to set it up

906
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:58,039
but you know it's not going to be all

907
00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:00,289
the fancy flavored products it's going

908
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:02,449
to be looking at this as a as a medicine

909
00:45:00,289 --> 00:45:05,119
and saying okay what are the ingredients

910
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:07,489
we really need and where the patients

911
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,859
need and how can we get those

912
00:45:07,489 --> 00:45:11,899
formulations to patients and so it's

913
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:15,380
kind of bare-bones it's very very

914
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:17,090
generic okay but I think can be highly

915
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:22,160
effective because chemistry is chemistry

916
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:24,769
I you know I think that's kind of maybe

917
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:26,389
wants generic I think with a lot of how

918
00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:28,400
it is now when you go on dispensaries

919
00:45:26,389 --> 00:45:32,659
there's so many brands that you get

920
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:34,430
intimidated so if you if you get generic

921
00:45:32,659 --> 00:45:37,399
you know generic stuff it makes it

922
00:45:34,429 --> 00:45:38,629
easier for the patient I think yeah

923
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,300
maybe that's maybe that's a you know

924
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:42,530
yeah remember that remember the the

925
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,450
first generic products in the grocery

926
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:48,680
store with the white boxes and the blue

927
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:53,449
letters so maybe it's literally THC CBD

928
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:55,399
nursing and lemonade and and the numbers

929
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:58,189
on the back and you take it from there I

930
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,559
mean who knows maybe that's maybe that's

931
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:04,610
a business opportunity well and you know

932
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:05,159
and the fact is now it brands or you you

933
00:46:04,610 --> 00:46:07,710
don't know

934
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:09,420
what's in that brand just because it has

935
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:12,630
a brand on it

936
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:14,490
they could be sourcing from other we

937
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:17,099
know for a fact they are we know they

938
00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:20,159
are so you don't necessarily know the

939
00:46:17,099 --> 00:46:22,440
budtender may not know no one named in

940
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:25,440
that shop may know exactly what's in

941
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:27,358
that jar well and also a sad truth it's

942
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:34,349
a lot of a labs that are testing the

943
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:37,980
medicine are incentivized to provide the

944
00:46:34,349 --> 00:46:41,910
results that the people who are paying

945
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:44,039
for the testing want and therefore my

946
00:46:41,909 --> 00:46:46,558
concern is sometimes you'd like for

947
00:46:44,039 --> 00:46:49,430
example you know some of these labs are

948
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:53,339
terpene testing and they get results

949
00:46:49,429 --> 00:46:55,848
that don't line up with the genetics of

950
00:46:53,338 --> 00:46:59,460
what the plant can actually produce and

951
00:46:55,849 --> 00:47:01,980
that's a big deal because it means that

952
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:06,780
the results if they even get the patient

953
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:08,490
will incorrectly inform them about the

954
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:15,569
constituency of the product and that's

955
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:18,058
awful and so more oversight over a lab

956
00:47:15,568 --> 00:47:20,940
test in California is this is the right

957
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:22,048
time for it especially if we really want

958
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:23,789
to start to talk about this as a

959
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:25,829
medicine not knowing what's in your

960
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:32,250
product can really be problematic for

961
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:35,400
patients Sarah are you there yeah okay

962
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:38,489
so are those the types of conversations

963
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:41,579
you're like that eisah is having with

964
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:46,169
this state about putting some of those

965
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:49,559
practices back into play or really

966
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:51,720
focusing or emphasizing them it you know

967
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:56,099
I had a conversation a couple of years

968
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:59,068
ago with staff and she told me that

969
00:47:56,099 --> 00:48:01,710
after all of the work that ACA had done

970
00:47:59,068 --> 00:48:03,719
in States when they went rec they had to

971
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:07,108
always go you always always had to go

972
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:13,019
back into those same states to redo the

973
00:48:07,108 --> 00:48:16,420
work you had done previously she wasn't

974
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:17,759
lying I think

975
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:21,159
[Music]

976
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:25,380
the first draft of the regs in

977
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:28,449
California I wrote a 44 page response

978
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:35,530
pointing out to them the changes I

979
00:48:28,449 --> 00:48:37,659
thought were necessary sometimes things

980
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:41,500
are going to take a while and you have

981
00:48:37,659 --> 00:48:46,539
to come up with fix and ace is good at

982
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:50,260
this but a fix is not a solution I'll

983
00:48:46,539 --> 00:48:52,750
give you an example in state law I wrote

984
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:55,510
and got passed a piece that allows

985
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:57,460
patients to take their medicine to a lab

986
00:48:55,510 --> 00:49:02,620
you take your rec to go to the lab

987
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:06,309
they'll test it that's fine that's great

988
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:08,710
but it's expensive but it does give

989
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:12,579
patients who are buying in unlicensed

990
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:15,250
stores an opportunity to make sure what

991
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:19,869
they've got is safe now that's a fix

992
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:22,360
that's not a solution and it's that kind

993
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:25,480
of gotta get it done right now gotta

994
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:31,420
protect the patients what can we do that

995
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:34,119
sort of drives the conversation and one

996
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:37,059
of the great gifts is that when somebody

997
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:40,690
like Michael Backus shows up and really

998
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:43,420
knows his stuff the conversation starts

999
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:47,019
to point towards solutions rather than

1000
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:50,650
fixes and I can't wait

1001
00:49:47,019 --> 00:49:53,920
I am 66 years old I'm riddled with

1002
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:58,180
arthritis if we don't get this done soon

1003
00:49:53,920 --> 00:50:00,400
I may not live to see it happen so I'm

1004
00:49:58,179 --> 00:50:04,899
particularly incentivized to interact

1005
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:08,289
with the regulator's of the state level

1006
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:12,160
I really really pay attention to what's

1007
00:50:08,289 --> 00:50:15,519
going on there I have the gift of one of

1008
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:18,759
the great lobbyists in Sacramento Don

1009
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:20,650
Duncan and another organization I'm

1010
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:25,060
aligned with the Southern California

1011
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:28,090
Coalition has a lobbyist advocacy so at

1012
00:50:25,059 --> 00:50:29,130
least people pay attention when we're

1013
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:32,670
talking

1014
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:35,000
people pay attention when we weigh in we

1015
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:36,180
are no longer referred to as

1016
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,579
drug-dealing

1017
00:50:36,179 --> 00:50:43,469
tax cheats better I I think one thing

1018
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:46,230
that it's ironic that we're talking

1019
00:50:43,469 --> 00:50:49,679
about this but you know when Dennis

1020
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:54,150
Peron started the first cannabis buyers

1021
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:57,778
club as he called it in California maybe

1022
00:50:54,150 --> 00:51:01,639
the best solution to helping patients is

1023
00:50:57,778 --> 00:51:04,369
the return of the cannabis buyers club

1024
00:51:01,639 --> 00:51:09,750
where cannabis patients get together

1025
00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:13,349
pool their money and get you know legal

1026
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:15,719
legal medical cannabis and and basically

1027
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:17,460
it is a not for profit but it's

1028
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:22,078
literally a buyers club it's it's the

1029
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:24,869
power of of patients coming together to

1030
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,390
get the medicine they need their own

1031
00:51:24,869 --> 00:51:29,338
testing yeah but the great thing is

1032
00:51:27,389 --> 00:51:31,288
testing it's gotten I mean gasoline is

1033
00:51:29,338 --> 00:51:34,798
very competitive right now and what's

1034
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:37,950
interesting is the all the labs good and

1035
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:40,349
bad it's a very competitive market so

1036
00:51:37,949 --> 00:51:42,989
the good news is the cost of good

1037
00:51:40,349 --> 00:51:46,019
testing is coming down just like the

1038
00:51:42,989 --> 00:51:49,979
cost of bad testing coming down and so

1039
00:51:46,018 --> 00:51:51,868
so what's great is is that it's it's

1040
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:55,409
much more Bible now and I mean it really

1041
00:51:51,869 --> 00:51:58,980
addresses you know what Allison and

1042
00:51:55,409 --> 00:52:00,989
Sarah talking about in there it provides

1043
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,579
safe affordable access which was the

1044
00:52:00,989 --> 00:52:04,439
whole game the whole reason this whole

1045
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:06,329
thing exists is because of that but

1046
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:11,509
maybe it's time to go back to first

1047
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:14,309
principles here and our is a a

1048
00:52:11,509 --> 00:52:19,588
non-profit dispensary at a shop allowed

1049
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:23,009
in California now Sarah I thought 64

1050
00:52:19,588 --> 00:52:25,440
when it did away with collectives that

1051
00:52:23,009 --> 00:52:30,469
it mandated that that shops had to be

1052
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,470
for-profit now has that been changed or

1053
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:39,000
I think what they were trying to do is

1054
00:52:34,259 --> 00:52:42,900
change it from whatever it was to a

1055
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:48,599
viable industry and my understanding is

1056
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:51,858
that you can still form a small endeavor

1057
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:55,170
with four or five friends and go forward

1058
00:52:51,858 --> 00:53:01,078
the problem is that the longer we wait

1059
00:52:55,170 --> 00:53:04,200
to establish affordable safe access the

1060
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:08,039
harder it's going to become because as

1061
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:12,088
the industry coalesce is people who have

1062
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:14,240
retail licenses things like that aren't

1063
00:53:12,088 --> 00:53:17,250
going to be too pleased about the idea

1064
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:19,379
that somebody is coming in who can

1065
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:22,289
undercut them and they don't really

1066
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:24,269
think about it as being medicine that

1067
00:53:22,289 --> 00:53:29,130
patients who don't have a lot of money

1068
00:53:24,268 --> 00:53:32,939
me need they think of it as taking away

1069
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:37,318
from their market share and the more you

1070
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:39,720
have a consolidation and you see this

1071
00:53:37,318 --> 00:53:45,358
very clearly in Los Angeles it's really

1072
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:48,149
interesting how many places we have now

1073
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:50,788
that have dispensaries not only in

1074
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:53,730
California but Arizona all kinds of

1075
00:53:50,789 --> 00:53:55,528
places so there has to be sort of a

1076
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:59,068
meeting of the minds between their

1077
00:53:55,528 --> 00:54:01,619
industries have those who are just not

1078
00:53:59,068 --> 00:54:05,849
capable because they're sick and they're

1079
00:54:01,619 --> 00:54:08,490
poor of being much of the market share

1080
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:11,400
and that's one of the conversations I'd

1081
00:54:08,489 --> 00:54:13,409
like to start having sooner rather than

1082
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:19,019
later because it's hard enough right now

1083
00:54:13,409 --> 00:54:20,460
and until we see how many places in LA

1084
00:54:19,018 --> 00:54:24,449
are going to have true compassion

1085
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:28,318
programs how much of the lift they're

1086
00:54:24,449 --> 00:54:30,389
going to be able to to do it's kind of

1087
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:33,150
hard to go rushing in and go okay change

1088
00:54:30,389 --> 00:54:35,489
everything right now just this isn't

1089
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:41,940
working change everything and I have

1090
00:54:35,489 --> 00:54:45,329
seen excuse me enough will particularly

1091
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:47,429
among veteran operators to have

1092
00:54:45,329 --> 00:54:50,279
meaningful compassion programs that I

1093
00:54:47,429 --> 00:54:53,309
would sort of like to go down that road

1094
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:56,600
right now because truthfully in this

1095
00:54:53,309 --> 00:54:59,909
time in this place the only road we have

1096
00:54:56,599 --> 00:55:03,119
going forward we have to see what Cova

1097
00:54:59,909 --> 00:55:05,639
does and we have to see what the will of

1098
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:09,929
the governor is in the legislature

1099
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:13,289
there's a lot of moving parts so Mike

1100
00:55:09,929 --> 00:55:16,289
Michael says you've got to go in and ask

1101
00:55:13,289 --> 00:55:21,509
for it compassion is not going to be on

1102
00:55:16,289 --> 00:55:25,440
that board so hopefully by this time

1103
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:28,650
next year I'll have compassion programs

1104
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:30,720
all over Los Angeles and even if they

1105
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:33,389
don't cure the problem at least they'll

1106
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:35,759
address it to a certain extent the

1107
00:55:33,389 --> 00:55:37,769
legislature this year is not addressing

1108
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,760
anything but kovat wildfires and

1109
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:42,929
homelessness

1110
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:47,190
they're asking specifically that people

1111
00:55:42,929 --> 00:55:55,199
pare down their legislative asks their

1112
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:57,059
bills to accommodate that and what it

1113
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:58,859
means is that again and again I've been

1114
00:55:57,059 --> 00:56:02,070
told by people well we're not going

1115
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:04,530
forward with that cannabis though so

1116
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:06,720
we're in tough spot but if we keep going

1117
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:09,990
forward together we will get somewhere

1118
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:11,239
soon I mean I think also in the interim

1119
00:56:09,989 --> 00:56:14,250
I think we should hack the system

1120
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:16,219
because I mean as Alice knows I mean

1121
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:19,230
she's found value products out there

1122
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:20,099
she's found products that you know and I

1123
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:21,809
don't want to put words in your mouth

1124
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:23,610
but you know when you talk about

1125
00:56:21,809 --> 00:56:25,920
companies like raw garden which I have

1126
00:56:23,610 --> 00:56:27,300
nothing to do with except for admiring

1127
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,639
the fact that they could bring a

1128
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:33,840
reasonably priced high potency product

1129
00:56:29,639 --> 00:56:36,420
to market it's almost like we need to

1130
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:39,750
like you know find those and publicize

1131
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:43,289
those because that's what is needed

1132
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:45,480
right now until other things can be put

1133
00:56:43,289 --> 00:56:50,610
into play later this all right I got you

1134
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:54,079
on that for sure you know I publicize

1135
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:54,079
them all the time on my website

1136
00:56:54,349 --> 00:56:59,798
you know Sarah who would I

1137
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:09,409
who would I ask who

1138
00:56:59,798 --> 00:57:11,389
you know well at the local level when

1139
00:57:09,409 --> 00:57:16,219
you go into a dispensary or you look up

1140
00:57:11,389 --> 00:57:19,278
their menu on weed maps a truly good

1141
00:57:16,219 --> 00:57:21,318
dispensary has what they call bottom

1142
00:57:19,278 --> 00:57:23,318
shelf which is their less expensive

1143
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:27,858
strains they don't have much bag appeal

1144
00:57:23,318 --> 00:57:30,108
but a really skilled buyer knows how to

1145
00:57:27,858 --> 00:57:35,179
find those things cornerstone had them

1146
00:57:30,108 --> 00:57:38,509
la PCG still has them so that's the

1147
00:57:35,179 --> 00:57:42,019
first thing if they don't have some

1148
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:45,980
affordably priced cannabis ask them for

1149
00:57:42,019 --> 00:57:48,650
that at the state level you have to find

1150
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:51,170
and and this is true at the city level -

1151
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:57,170
you have to find your champions people

1152
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:59,059
who will commit to being the author with

1153
00:57:57,170 --> 00:58:02,630
you being the sponsor of a bill that'll

1154
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:06,079
move things forward I like to try and do

1155
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:08,298
things at the local level first because

1156
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:10,720
locally I only have to convince eight

1157
00:58:08,298 --> 00:58:13,068
people to do what I want them to do

1158
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:17,239
California Legislature you gotta

1159
00:58:13,068 --> 00:58:19,338
convince a lot more people and a lot of

1160
00:58:17,239 --> 00:58:22,278
those people aren't too enthusiastic

1161
00:58:19,338 --> 00:58:23,960
about cannabis to begin with and if you

1162
00:58:22,278 --> 00:58:27,289
don't watch them closely they can do

1163
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:30,019
some very hurtful things while trying to

1164
00:58:27,289 --> 00:58:32,510
be helpful I would say never ever

1165
00:58:30,019 --> 00:58:35,210
approach an elected official with your

1166
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:37,369
complaint unless you have the solution

1167
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:39,608
in your hand and it's got to be a

1168
00:58:37,369 --> 00:58:42,829
workable solution if you've got that

1169
00:58:39,608 --> 00:58:46,219
you're halfway to three-quarters way

1170
00:58:42,829 --> 00:58:48,410
home and if you look at the legislative

1171
00:58:46,219 --> 00:58:51,649
calendars you'll see again and again and

1172
00:58:48,409 --> 00:58:53,889
again Bill Quercus putting forward bills

1173
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:57,349
there's something called the sexy five

1174
00:58:53,889 --> 00:58:59,900
the join jones-sawyer talks about a lot

1175
00:58:57,349 --> 00:59:04,460
about because those were the legislators

1176
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:07,750
who worked on first the medical

1177
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:12,369
marijuana legislation and then later on

1178
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:16,389
legalization and those guys they will

1179
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:19,630
comedian Lavigne passed a bill that put

1180
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:23,909
forward a bill that ASA wrote Don Duncan

1181
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:27,009
regard they got a pass which starts

1182
00:59:23,909 --> 00:59:29,409
transplant patients from being thrown

1183
00:59:27,009 --> 00:59:32,889
off transplant list which is a death

1184
00:59:29,409 --> 00:59:35,949
sentence and but frankly organ failure

1185
00:59:32,889 --> 00:59:37,838
is just a horrible way to die so look

1186
00:59:35,949 --> 00:59:40,838
for those guys who have been our

1187
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:44,288
champions in the past and ask them for

1188
00:59:40,838 --> 00:59:46,869
what you need I it helps if you can

1189
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:48,759
write the bill yourself and if you can

1190
00:59:46,869 --> 00:59:52,240
gather some sort of grassroots support

1191
00:59:48,759 --> 00:59:55,389
my Princeton's for patients it would be

1192
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:57,639
ASA the veterans groups that try and get

1193
00:59:55,389 --> 01:00:01,028
affordable cannabis or free cannabis to

1194
00:59:57,639 --> 01:00:03,608
veterans those kind of people they get a

1195
01:00:01,028 --> 01:00:07,028
lot of respect at the at the state level

1196
01:00:03,608 --> 01:00:08,788
you get a big labor union behind you

1197
01:00:07,028 --> 01:00:11,349
like the UFCW

1198
01:00:08,789 --> 01:00:20,759
770 here in Los Angeles you're halfway

1199
01:00:11,349 --> 01:00:25,359
home they really pay attention to it

1200
01:00:20,759 --> 01:00:29,699
Sarah could you could you explain to us

1201
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:36,690
exactly what SB 34 does what it allows

1202
01:00:29,699 --> 01:00:39,068
dispensaries to do in detail that was

1203
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:43,420
required a lot of legislation over

1204
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:46,568
several years because they didn't figure

1205
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:50,528
in the big thing that was stopping

1206
01:00:46,568 --> 01:00:52,239
compassion which was the taxes right you

1207
01:00:50,528 --> 01:00:55,389
start with cultivation

1208
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:57,639
I think it's nine dollars and sixty

1209
01:00:55,389 --> 01:01:00,159
cents an ounce or sixty-five cents an

1210
01:00:57,639 --> 01:01:02,588
ounce some ridiculous amount and then

1211
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:06,940
you've got your excise tax your sales

1212
01:01:02,588 --> 01:01:10,920
tax your local taxes that all had to be

1213
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:15,400
done away with because as long as that

1214
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:18,278
existed it was just too expensive to try

1215
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:21,818
and get free cannabis to people who

1216
01:01:18,278 --> 01:01:24,358
really needed it so first they they had

1217
01:01:21,818 --> 01:01:26,079
one piece of legislation that sort of

1218
01:01:24,358 --> 01:01:27,489
allowed

1219
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:31,690
fashion programs and then they came back

1220
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:36,750
and I believe it was SB 34 that got rid

1221
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:43,570
of the taxes I know it seems weird that

1222
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:46,630
that was the big sort of stone in the

1223
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:48,880
road for compassion but it really was

1224
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:52,210
and some of the most heartbreaking

1225
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:54,640
testimony I ever heard a public comment

1226
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:57,280
was people who had been running these

1227
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:59,469
big compassion programs for veterans and

1228
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,290
other people who just couldn't do it

1229
01:01:59,469 --> 01:02:03,969
anymore because it's taxes and I'm

1230
01:02:02,289 --> 01:02:06,880
telling you it brought tears to my eyes

1231
01:02:03,969 --> 01:02:11,319
and I don't cry easy so I'm really

1232
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:15,130
excited that the taxes gone away Michael

1233
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:19,000
you're you're known for crying fairly

1234
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:23,680
frequently Kent can you just give us a

1235
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:25,480
quick timeline of you know we talked the

1236
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:27,759
other day and you gave me like you know

1237
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:30,550
the first shops in the Bay Area and then

1238
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:32,920
the first ones in LA and then can you

1239
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:35,260
and Sarah give kind of I assume

1240
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:37,030
politicians weren't always cannabis

1241
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:40,150
friendly so can you give some of the

1242
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:44,019
salacious stories of dealing with the

1243
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:46,660
political bureaucracy in LA and Eagle

1244
01:02:44,019 --> 01:02:49,059
Rock and I mean I got a few of those

1245
01:02:46,659 --> 01:02:52,239
let's see so the best one was the first

1246
01:02:49,059 --> 01:02:55,809
time I had two council members come to

1247
01:02:52,239 --> 01:03:00,819
Cornerstone neither of them had ever

1248
01:02:55,809 --> 01:03:04,139
stepped foot in a dispensary it was and

1249
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:09,760
what year was this this would have been

1250
01:03:04,139 --> 01:03:13,839
mm mm okay

1251
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:16,990
it was Dennis sign who was the former

1252
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:20,590
cop that Sarah spoke about who became a

1253
01:03:16,989 --> 01:03:26,469
champion of medical cannabis access in

1254
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:29,829
California no I and Jose Huizar who was

1255
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:32,439
my council member in the district that

1256
01:03:29,829 --> 01:03:34,389
my dispensary was in and I guess it was

1257
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:38,619
it was he also a champion of medical

1258
01:03:34,389 --> 01:03:39,500
cannabis he's a champ man hard to talk

1259
01:03:38,619 --> 01:03:42,380
about Jose

1260
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:44,750
is he's got he's got quite a few

1261
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:49,220
nicknames around City Hall and and he

1262
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:49,670
has an active FBI investigation right

1263
01:03:49,219 --> 01:03:51,679
now

1264
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:54,230
but he did tell me a funny story I went

1265
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:56,299
to his office on Colorado Boulevard in

1266
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:58,460
Eagle Rock and he told me about how he

1267
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:02,960
used to grow pot in his dad's front yard

1268
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:04,909
and so you really I mean he really likes

1269
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:08,050
to ingratiate himself but what was great

1270
01:04:04,909 --> 01:04:11,598
about having them come to my shop was

1271
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:15,609
cornerstone was really designed to look

1272
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:20,630
like a dentist's office I mean really

1273
01:04:15,608 --> 01:04:23,809
sterile and our waiting room just looked

1274
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:26,030
like you are kind of in a reasonably

1275
01:04:23,809 --> 01:04:31,190
tasteful dentist's office so much so

1276
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:33,530
that we had a we had a an OG Kush grower

1277
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:37,880
driving down the street in his new

1278
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:40,580
sports car and run he was on our way to

1279
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:46,789
us but he's just blasting down the road

1280
01:04:40,579 --> 01:04:48,980
and he nicked a SUV trying to make a

1281
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:53,809
left turn and they plowed through the

1282
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:57,199
window of our sales room and we were so

1283
01:04:53,809 --> 01:04:59,539
low-key that we that when Fox News

1284
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:02,088
showed up to cover it they said we were

1285
01:04:59,539 --> 01:05:06,108
a dentist's office and didn't know we

1286
01:05:02,088 --> 01:05:08,239
were dispensary so in those days the

1287
01:05:06,108 --> 01:05:13,159
whole game was to try to be as discreet

1288
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:17,299
as possible because you really wanted to

1289
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:22,480
try to avoid notice of the DEA or LA no

1290
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:22,480
Green Cross yeah and

1291
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:29,270
so yeah it was um those were really

1292
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:30,890
interesting times and so it was a it was

1293
01:05:29,269 --> 01:05:35,659
really thing I mean I think there were

1294
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:39,460
there were several council members who

1295
01:05:35,659 --> 01:05:41,989
were very very genuine in their support

1296
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:44,300
Dennis sign being one of them Paul

1297
01:05:41,989 --> 01:05:46,219
Koretz being one of them

1298
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:48,410
and they were great and then there were

1299
01:05:46,219 --> 01:05:50,009
other other people on the island City

1300
01:05:48,409 --> 01:05:52,259
Council who were

1301
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:55,140
opponents and really tried to fight

1302
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:57,120
against it and Huizar actually started

1303
01:05:55,139 --> 01:06:00,210
out being kind of a supporter and then

1304
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:03,539
ended up being kind of a an opponent and

1305
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:06,170
you know just flipping and flopping away

1306
01:06:03,539 --> 01:06:08,699
and so yeah it's always been interesting

1307
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:12,230
with dealing with politicians I mean

1308
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:16,279
Sarah is much more experienced than I am

1309
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:20,219
it hasn't made me to love them anymore

1310
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:23,640
it is a source of great satisfaction to

1311
01:06:20,219 --> 01:06:27,329
me that Englander who has already

1312
01:06:23,639 --> 01:06:30,349
pleaded guilty and Weiser who is on his

1313
01:06:27,329 --> 01:06:34,110
way to pleading guilty were historically

1314
01:06:30,349 --> 01:06:37,650
two of the biggest opponents to safe

1315
01:06:34,110 --> 01:06:39,690
access in Los Angeles and now they're

1316
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:41,910
exposed as people who have done some

1317
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:45,720
very bad things far worse than anything

1318
01:06:41,909 --> 01:06:50,579
I've known a despair pre ICO to ever do

1319
01:06:45,719 --> 01:06:51,989
in Los Angeles so you have to pick your

1320
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:55,650
battles you have to get along with

1321
01:06:51,989 --> 01:06:58,889
everyone but there are people who have

1322
01:06:55,650 --> 01:07:01,910
another agenda and all across the state

1323
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:04,469
you've seen whistleblowing going on with

1324
01:07:01,909 --> 01:07:08,519
local politicians who are demanding

1325
01:07:04,469 --> 01:07:11,549
bribes doing different things and most

1326
01:07:08,519 --> 01:07:13,679
often the reason the FBI gets involved

1327
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:16,830
is a dispenser I whose trying to get a

1328
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:18,869
license goes and says you know I've been

1329
01:07:16,829 --> 01:07:20,819
approached about this and this isn't

1330
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:25,799
right this isn't the way it's supposed

1331
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:29,490
to go so I believe that the cannabis

1332
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:34,050
industry has a lot of problems to

1333
01:07:29,489 --> 01:07:37,339
overcome but I think people who want to

1334
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:41,340
be licensed to want to follow the rules

1335
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:45,030
should not be treated any differently

1336
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:47,100
than any other business and that is one

1337
01:07:45,030 --> 01:07:49,740
of the big sticking points because it's

1338
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:51,599
marijuana the rules are always going to

1339
01:07:49,739 --> 01:07:54,649
be a little different for you than

1340
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:58,949
everybody else who runs a business and

1341
01:07:54,650 --> 01:08:01,289
I'm hopeful that is the years ago by a

1342
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:04,059
cannabis dispensary you will be treated

1343
01:08:01,289 --> 01:08:06,739
just like any other retail operation

1344
01:08:04,059 --> 01:08:08,539
and everything else

1345
01:08:06,739 --> 01:08:11,149
I think the sticking point there is

1346
01:08:08,539 --> 01:08:14,029
trust I mean the thing is is that you

1347
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:15,910
know there's a reason that people want

1348
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:19,640
to sniff the jar when they come in the

1349
01:08:15,909 --> 01:08:21,319
shops is they don't trust what they're

1350
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:24,109
being sold

1351
01:08:21,319 --> 01:08:27,710
they're often sold things by people who

1352
01:08:24,109 --> 01:08:30,980
don't know what they're selling and so

1353
01:08:27,710 --> 01:08:35,750
every I mean I think that as the

1354
01:08:30,979 --> 01:08:37,219
cannabis industry earns trust I think a

1355
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:40,069
lot of things are going to be relaxed

1356
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:42,850
but but we're still not there yet I mean

1357
01:08:40,069 --> 01:08:47,239
in the case of cannabis to some degree

1358
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:49,520
were you know we're still a lot of us

1359
01:08:47,239 --> 01:08:52,849
still act like moonshiners all right who

1360
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:55,010
are trying to go legit and you know I

1361
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:58,940
mean you see these famous cultivators

1362
01:08:55,010 --> 01:09:02,420
around you know California who used to

1363
01:08:58,939 --> 01:09:04,699
be gangsters and the truth is is just

1364
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:06,350
because they've got a fancy shop on

1365
01:09:04,699 --> 01:09:10,250
Melrose doesn't mean they're still not

1366
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:11,870
gangsters so I think I think there's are

1367
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:13,130
some reasons to be concerned I mean I

1368
01:09:11,869 --> 01:09:17,180
think we sought to clean up Iraq a

1369
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:19,159
little bit oh yeah least the guy that

1370
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:22,670
you know one of the main dispensaries I

1371
01:09:19,159 --> 01:09:25,069
used to go to before you know cope it

1372
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:27,500
happens I don't think they figured out

1373
01:09:25,069 --> 01:09:29,449
delivery yet for whatever reason but you

1374
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:32,300
can see that they're enjoying that

1375
01:09:29,449 --> 01:09:34,909
lifestyle too and it's like you could

1376
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:36,890
see from the cars they drive and it's

1377
01:09:34,909 --> 01:09:41,269
like okay well why why are you about

1378
01:09:36,890 --> 01:09:45,410
this you know yeah I mean again it's

1379
01:09:41,270 --> 01:09:48,950
some you know moonshiners used to saw it

1380
01:09:45,409 --> 01:09:51,349
at the back of trucks you know in the

1381
01:09:48,949 --> 01:09:53,269
old days everybody sold other from the

1382
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:55,160
farm gate and I think that we still have

1383
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:56,780
to get used to the changes it doesn't

1384
01:09:55,159 --> 01:09:58,250
mean shit we should cut out the people

1385
01:09:56,779 --> 01:10:00,619
who traditionally were involved in this

1386
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:02,720
business but we should hold everybody

1387
01:10:00,619 --> 01:10:04,579
you know hire staff so just quickly

1388
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:08,570
Michael I mean we talked about kind of

1389
01:10:04,579 --> 01:10:11,809
you know 20 years ago it was people

1390
01:10:08,569 --> 01:10:14,389
whose hearts were in it who were opening

1391
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:15,980
these shops and there's kind of been a

1392
01:10:14,390 --> 01:10:16,810
changing of the guard so people who are

1393
01:10:15,979 --> 01:10:19,509
maybe a little more about

1394
01:10:16,810 --> 01:10:22,960
money can you give some love to some of

1395
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:25,090
the people who were around when when you

1396
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:28,539
ran cornerstone who you thought were

1397
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:31,300
kind of truly champions of providing

1398
01:10:28,539 --> 01:10:33,670
medicine to patients well I mean you

1399
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:35,920
know we already mentioned wham so you

1400
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:38,079
know Mike and Valerie Corral were kind

1401
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,789
of the gold standard I mean I used to

1402
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:41,920
say that you know valor and corral was

1403
01:10:39,789 --> 01:10:43,899
the mother Teresa of cannabis in any

1404
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,460
room she walked into she tried to make

1405
01:10:43,899 --> 01:10:47,949
every single person in the room

1406
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:49,539
feel comfortable and do anything she

1407
01:10:47,949 --> 01:10:52,059
could to make sure their needs were met

1408
01:10:49,539 --> 01:10:55,600
I mean she was really she is really

1409
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:58,120
extraordinary my Corral was just a

1410
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,490
brilliant cultivator who just really

1411
01:10:58,119 --> 01:11:04,180
paid attention to what kinds of cannabis

1412
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:07,899
might meet people's medicinal needs and

1413
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:09,579
you know he's a real handful but I gotta

1414
01:11:07,899 --> 01:11:13,359
give a shout out to Steve DeAngelo

1415
01:11:09,579 --> 01:11:17,199
because the truth is is that he's I mean

1416
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:19,000
the truth is he really did take a lot of

1417
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:21,069
arrows for people had a meeting with

1418
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,989
George Lucas one time and you know Lucas

1419
01:11:21,069 --> 01:11:26,019
said first one up the hill Oh catches

1420
01:11:22,989 --> 01:11:28,149
all the arrows and Mandy Angela took a

1421
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:32,260
lot of arrows I mean he's a colorful guy

1422
01:11:28,149 --> 01:11:33,969
with a colorful past but we wouldn't

1423
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:34,989
have lab testing in California without

1424
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:38,530
him

1425
01:11:34,989 --> 01:11:40,359
I mean he really and that's a huge huge

1426
01:11:38,529 --> 01:11:44,219
thing because patients have to know

1427
01:11:40,359 --> 01:11:48,369
what's in their medicine I mean you know

1428
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:52,360
ASA I mean Aysen really carried the

1429
01:11:48,369 --> 01:11:55,269
water for this whole concept of access

1430
01:11:52,359 --> 01:11:58,960
and and they were really effective

1431
01:11:55,270 --> 01:12:00,310
because the combination of Steph Shara

1432
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:03,520
and Don Duncan

1433
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:07,600
there were answer hearts fun they're

1434
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:11,830
just relentless and Yami bolaños here in

1435
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:13,870
town with glocca also just relentless

1436
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:16,029
and that's what it takes

1437
01:12:13,869 --> 01:12:18,279
it just takes people who are not going

1438
01:12:16,029 --> 01:12:20,019
to take no for an answer who know that

1439
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:23,199
they're that they're on the right side

1440
01:12:20,020 --> 01:12:25,870
of history and and then there are all

1441
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:28,000
kinds of people in the Emerald triangle

1442
01:12:25,869 --> 01:12:30,859
who were looking for a cannabis

1443
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:34,460
varieties that had things like CBD

1444
01:12:30,859 --> 01:12:37,519
and and still you know when the DEA

1445
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:40,340
showed up the DEA didn't care that had

1446
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:43,340
CBD in it and so they were taking great

1447
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:45,889
personal risks and also we're growing a

1448
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:48,469
plant that wasn't commercially viable

1449
01:12:45,889 --> 01:12:50,270
most people had no idea what CBD was so

1450
01:12:48,469 --> 01:12:53,539
they wouldn't pay for it so it was

1451
01:12:50,270 --> 01:12:56,540
really from the heart and so I think the

1452
01:12:53,539 --> 01:12:59,090
pioneers I mean you really got to read

1453
01:12:56,539 --> 01:13:02,510
Martin Lee's book oh and Martin Lee and

1454
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:03,770
Fred Gardner for project CBD and Martin

1455
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:06,260
Lee had written a book called smoke

1456
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:08,000
signals which the social history of

1457
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:10,610
cannabis the United States and really

1458
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,829
worth reading because it really tells

1459
01:13:10,609 --> 01:13:15,049
the story of a lot of these early fights

1460
01:13:12,829 --> 01:13:20,479
like with Tod mikuriya who was this

1461
01:13:15,050 --> 01:13:22,880
doctor who like just before anybody was

1462
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:25,609
like talking about the medicinal uses of

1463
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:32,300
cannabis for dozens of conditions and

1464
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:34,189
he's been proved right and so yeah so

1465
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:35,929
yeah a project oh and then so Fred

1466
01:13:34,189 --> 01:13:38,629
gardner also started o'Shaughnessy's

1467
01:13:35,929 --> 01:13:40,460
which was this amazing newspaper that

1468
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:42,650
collected all the latest scientific data

1469
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:45,230
about the MOA list of medicinal uses of

1470
01:13:42,649 --> 01:13:47,149
cannabis and he interviewed ethan russo

1471
01:13:45,229 --> 01:13:51,129
and Rafi Missoula and all these

1472
01:13:47,149 --> 01:13:54,679
pioneering cannabis scientists and

1473
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:56,900
o'Shaughnessy's to this day it still has

1474
01:13:54,679 --> 01:13:58,850
been you know a fantastic resource for

1475
01:13:56,899 --> 01:14:01,689
people trying to use cannabis and

1476
01:13:58,850 --> 01:14:11,600
medicine so that's just my two cents I

1477
01:14:01,689 --> 01:14:15,469
wish I'd taken notes you you can watch

1478
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:18,010
the video again later yeah sweet you

1479
01:14:15,469 --> 01:14:20,179
know also just friend me wherever and

1480
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:24,260
ask me any questions you want anytime

1481
01:14:20,179 --> 01:14:29,779
I'm gonna interview you for my site no

1482
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:32,389
problem um I got a question

1483
01:14:29,779 --> 01:14:35,658
while we have Michael I'm looking at an

1484
01:14:32,389 --> 01:14:38,810
article now that was posted today on

1485
01:14:35,658 --> 01:14:41,658
fresh toast can marijuana terpenes treat

1486
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:44,600
kovat these scientists believe so with

1487
01:14:41,658 --> 01:14:49,599
no referencing the Israeli research

1488
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:53,810
there's three different studies yes yeah

1489
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:55,250
Israel and DD miry has been it was

1490
01:14:53,810 --> 01:14:56,780
holding his results really close to us

1491
01:14:55,250 --> 01:14:58,159
just for a long time because I think it

1492
01:14:56,779 --> 01:15:00,649
was trying to raise venture capital so

1493
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:02,809
he'd done tests on cannabis compounds

1494
01:15:00,649 --> 01:15:04,609
and cancer lines and these are cell

1495
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:06,170
studies typically so what happens is

1496
01:15:04,609 --> 01:15:08,269
they'll take a pure compound of pure

1497
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:11,180
therapy and pure cannabinoid yada yada

1498
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:14,180
and they'll put it on a culture plate of

1499
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:17,300
a cancer cell or another kind of cell

1500
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:20,150
and then watch to see how it interacts

1501
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:23,029
okay and there are all these assays out

1502
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:27,259
there that allow you to do testing on a

1503
01:15:23,029 --> 01:15:31,130
solo now that's called in vitro testing

1504
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:33,590
okay and it's of limited use so what it

1505
01:15:31,130 --> 01:15:36,020
may be is they're watching how these

1506
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:38,119
pure compounds interact with this

1507
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:40,060
particular type of corona virus and

1508
01:15:38,119 --> 01:15:45,920
whether or not it can make a difference

1509
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:48,680
is it likely it can yes is it but how

1510
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:50,720
likely it is at the dose that people are

1511
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:53,329
normally exposed to or can tolerate

1512
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:55,280
that's another question and there are

1513
01:15:53,329 --> 01:15:57,170
bigger concerns about cannabis and kovat

1514
01:15:55,279 --> 01:15:59,779
right now the biggest conference urn

1515
01:15:57,170 --> 01:16:01,640
comes out of a unrelated study from

1516
01:15:59,779 --> 01:16:04,130
University of Arizona it was published a

1517
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:06,130
couple weeks ago and what they looked at

1518
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:10,940
is they look at blood clotting and

1519
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:13,690
trauma victims whose blood tested

1520
01:16:10,939 --> 01:16:17,119
positive for THC and they were finding

1521
01:16:13,689 --> 01:16:20,929
increased blood clotting that's a real

1522
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:23,899
problem with coated because kovin

1523
01:16:20,930 --> 01:16:27,350
appears to drange blood clotting in

1524
01:16:23,899 --> 01:16:29,509
younger patients infected with kovin and

1525
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:32,090
can lead to strokes and heart attacks

1526
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:36,199
all kinds of stuff so the question is

1527
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:38,630
how does THC play in the Kogan world and

1528
01:16:36,199 --> 01:16:41,449
the initial evidence is a little

1529
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:44,569
concerning so what I've been telling

1530
01:16:41,449 --> 01:16:46,929
people is regardless of the terpene

1531
01:16:44,569 --> 01:16:51,649
regardless of the cannabinoid you use

1532
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:54,770
take the minimum effective dose okay

1533
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:56,829
this is not a time to try to beat your

1534
01:16:54,770 --> 01:17:00,760
personal dabbing record

1535
01:16:56,829 --> 01:17:04,510
okay because it could have really really

1536
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:05,920
bad outcomes and obviously I mean in the

1537
01:17:04,510 --> 01:17:07,869
case of the trauma thing I mean that's a

1538
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:11,440
bit of a stretch to say Oh Kovac lauding

1539
01:17:07,869 --> 01:17:14,079
a trauma quadding but it's the same

1540
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:16,659
cascade within the body so we have to

1541
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:18,699
pay attention to are there forms of

1542
01:17:16,659 --> 01:17:21,849
ingestion that you feel are probably

1543
01:17:18,699 --> 01:17:25,289
safer than others at this time right now

1544
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:28,150
so it's also a study that was that was

1545
01:17:25,289 --> 01:17:31,710
discussed last week on the American

1546
01:17:28,149 --> 01:17:34,829
Chemical Society can meeting about

1547
01:17:31,710 --> 01:17:38,980
breakdown products from terpenes in

1548
01:17:34,829 --> 01:17:41,619
vaporizers depends and the results are

1549
01:17:38,979 --> 01:17:44,469
ugly okay the higher the temperature the

1550
01:17:41,619 --> 01:17:46,809
higher the voltage on the pen the more

1551
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:49,539
these breakdown products are created and

1552
01:17:46,810 --> 01:17:52,360
to the breakdown products are the

1553
01:17:49,539 --> 01:17:55,149
principal dangerous components in most

1554
01:17:52,359 --> 01:17:56,679
air pollution okay because there are a

1555
01:17:55,149 --> 01:17:59,229
lot of terpenes in nature and when they

1556
01:17:56,680 --> 01:18:01,210
break down in certain conditions they

1557
01:17:59,229 --> 01:18:04,389
can interact with things and form ozone

1558
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:07,810
and all kinds of nasty things but the

1559
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:10,440
the thing that's the takeaway is is that

1560
01:18:07,810 --> 01:18:14,020
you want to use the lowest temperature

1561
01:18:10,439 --> 01:18:17,439
ingestion system if you're going to

1562
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:18,610
inhale alright and some people just get

1563
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:19,960
better effects from an inhalation

1564
01:18:18,609 --> 01:18:22,299
because it's a different pathway

1565
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:25,420
effectively different metabolic pathway

1566
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:29,110
and so my advice is move towards flower

1567
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:33,340
vaporizers whenever possible or low

1568
01:18:29,109 --> 01:18:34,960
temperature vaporizers diffusing my

1569
01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:36,730
chronic vaporizers use the lowest

1570
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:41,230
vaporization setting which is typically

1571
01:18:36,729 --> 01:18:43,029
3 point 2 volts and don't crank the

1572
01:18:41,229 --> 01:18:45,549
temperature yeah and the problem with

1573
01:18:43,029 --> 01:18:48,670
vaping is vaping is effectively like

1574
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:49,869
smoking in ultra slow motion so you get

1575
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:52,180
the turps off first and then the

1576
01:18:49,869 --> 01:18:54,789
cannabinoids and most people don't like

1577
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:57,250
vaporizers because it feels different

1578
01:18:54,789 --> 01:18:58,779
they're just not being patient enough if

1579
01:18:57,250 --> 01:19:00,550
you're a patient with the vaporizer you

1580
01:18:58,779 --> 01:19:02,829
will get exactly the same effect you get

1581
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:04,779
from smoking it's just gonna be spread

1582
01:19:02,829 --> 01:19:06,880
out a little bit more and people need to

1583
01:19:04,779 --> 01:19:09,309
understand that it just to clarify are

1584
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,599
you talking like a drier vaporizer or

1585
01:19:09,310 --> 01:19:13,000
like a vape pen

1586
01:19:10,599 --> 01:19:15,279
yeah so my favorite my favorite my

1587
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,408
favorites I've got them nearby because I

1588
01:19:15,279 --> 01:19:19,899
use them my favorites are the mighty

1589
01:19:17,408 --> 01:19:24,009
from Storz and Bickel like right here

1590
01:19:19,899 --> 01:19:25,658
and the latest fire flow is it depends

1591
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:28,869
depends on what you want to use because

1592
01:19:25,658 --> 01:19:31,179
you know this is confection I really

1593
01:19:28,868 --> 01:19:32,589
really like the mighty it's just because

1594
01:19:31,179 --> 01:19:37,179
it's got the temperature on it so I can

1595
01:19:32,590 --> 01:19:39,099
set it to 392 yeah I saw that one for

1596
01:19:37,179 --> 01:19:42,819
the first time Tom remember when all the

1597
01:19:39,099 --> 01:19:44,590
hash maybe I'll stop by and one of them

1598
01:19:42,819 --> 01:19:47,198
pulled that out III meant that this

1599
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:49,239
one's actually in my car I don't have it

1600
01:19:47,198 --> 01:19:50,799
with me but I've been playing with that

1601
01:19:49,238 --> 01:19:53,529
one I've been getting back into drier

1602
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,000
vaporizing they're fantastic and if you

1603
01:19:53,529 --> 01:20:07,649
get my turf cannabis they're really

1604
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:07,649
great excuse me I just muted them

1605
01:20:07,770 --> 01:20:15,099
basically what are you saying that is

1606
01:20:12,010 --> 01:20:17,289
not good well yeah what you have to do

1607
01:20:15,099 --> 01:20:19,360
is you have to control your TFC dose if

1608
01:20:17,289 --> 01:20:21,760
you've been exposed to Cove it because

1609
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:23,859
we don't know we don't know if it could

1610
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,230
potentially if you start to develop

1611
01:20:23,859 --> 01:20:30,368
clotting issues related to kovat

1612
01:20:26,229 --> 01:20:31,868
infection THC may exacerbate those and

1613
01:20:30,368 --> 01:20:33,098
we're not going to know because there's

1614
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:34,719
not gonna be studies done for a little

1615
01:20:33,099 --> 01:20:36,578
while remember we're just dealing with

1616
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:38,649
carbon right now but season low

1617
01:20:36,578 --> 01:20:40,539
happening epidemiologists oh look at the

1618
01:20:38,649 --> 01:20:42,069
blood samples of coated patients to come

1619
01:20:40,539 --> 01:20:43,750
in in the screen them for cannabinoids

1620
01:20:42,069 --> 01:20:46,299
and then they'll start to look for

1621
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:48,279
patterns to say oh people who had high

1622
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:50,250
amounts of THC metabolites had worse

1623
01:20:48,279 --> 01:20:53,349
outcomes we don't know that yet but

1624
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:56,319
don't be surprised so I have a question

1625
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:58,810
so you're launching some new products

1626
01:20:56,319 --> 01:21:00,880
now in the middle of all this how do you

1627
01:20:58,810 --> 01:21:03,520
do that taking into account everything

1628
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,679
that you've just said it done basically

1629
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:08,170
designed vaporizer bowl products I mean

1630
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:09,960
we're a flower product or what I've done

1631
01:21:08,170 --> 01:21:14,050
is I've stabilized the terpene French

1632
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:15,639
okay and so yeah and the way I use the

1633
01:21:14,050 --> 01:21:17,710
products is in a flower feet I mean I

1634
01:21:15,639 --> 01:21:19,510
just love them so you know I would say

1635
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:21,180
all I was trying to do with my new

1636
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:25,079
company was really invent a product

1637

1647
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:09,990
anyway I'll be back in a minute I have

1648
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:13,760
to drop some samples I got sieves in

1649
01:22:09,989 --> 01:22:13,760
front of my house okay all right see it

1650
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:22,230
so John I think this could be for you

1651
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:24,779
and Sarah Sarah we had talked about kind

1652
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:28,919
of barriers to safe access and we talked

1653
01:22:24,779 --> 01:22:31,369
about economic and then obviously local

1654
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:34,770
control which means that their deserts

1655
01:22:31,369 --> 01:22:37,019
the no compassion programs or samples

1656
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:39,930
which is now kind of hopefully changing

1657
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:42,060
it went way in one direction of nothing

1658
01:22:39,930 --> 01:22:44,369
and now it's hopefully coming back but

1659
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:53,730
can you talk about barriers to safe

1660
01:22:44,369 --> 01:22:56,039
access going forward in order to be

1661
01:22:53,729 --> 01:23:02,250
truly accessible it's got to become a

1662
01:22:56,039 --> 01:23:05,909
lot cheaper and that that's a very

1663
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:10,619
complex discussion the other thing that

1664
01:23:05,909 --> 01:23:15,180
I'd like to see is the last time I saw

1665
01:23:10,619 --> 01:23:17,039
Jean talk he talked about and this was

1666
01:23:15,180 --> 01:23:22,010
several years ago he talked about how

1667
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:25,949
there had been no trials on humans for

1668
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:29,369
how cannabis might help with cancer and

1669
01:23:25,949 --> 01:23:31,559
I think getting the research done people

1670
01:23:29,369 --> 01:23:33,029
like Michael Backus and everything it

1671
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:38,539
will lead you to

1672
01:23:33,029 --> 01:23:41,340
a more cost-effective and viable product

1673
01:23:38,538 --> 01:23:43,920
but we can't stop with the research

1674
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:47,250
either there have been thousands of

1675
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:49,649
studies done and it just amazes me that

1676
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:54,719
we still have a way to go the third

1677
01:23:49,649 --> 01:23:58,618
problem is that from a political point

1678
01:23:54,719 --> 01:24:03,300
of view many many many legislators at

1679
01:23:58,618 --> 01:24:05,308
all levels federal state local are still

1680
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:08,550
convinced that cannabis is not medicine

1681
01:24:05,309 --> 01:24:12,650
and even though their electorate has

1682
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:17,520
frequently voted to have safe access

1683
01:24:12,649 --> 01:24:22,038
they find a number of ways to impede

1684
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:25,739
that progress so you got your economics

1685
01:24:22,038 --> 01:24:28,319
you need more research and you need to

1686
01:24:25,738 --> 01:24:33,928
really get in the face of legislators

1687
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:38,069
and talk to them in such a way that they

1688
01:24:33,929 --> 01:24:41,279
can no longer stall on bringing safe

1689
01:24:38,069 --> 01:24:44,429
access to every community community that

1690
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:48,960
loaded for first in 1996 for medical and

1691
01:24:44,429 --> 01:24:51,328
then again for record adult use so I'll

1692
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:55,559
let Jean telling you the rest of it

1693
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:59,639
because I know he's got some thought to

1694
01:24:55,559 --> 01:25:07,710
many thoughts thanks Sarah and I've got

1695
01:24:59,639 --> 01:25:12,538
a question for you outside of well my

1696
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:15,510
question is is and I already know the

1697
01:25:12,538 --> 01:25:20,670
answer but the Compassionate Use Act

1698
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:25,340
prop 215 still is in effect as far as I

1699
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:28,469
know and maybe you can comment on that

1700
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:32,309
and that's because you know the patients

1701
01:25:28,469 --> 01:25:35,538
to me are the ultimate warriors and

1702
01:25:32,309 --> 01:25:40,079
outside of the patients are folks like

1703
01:25:35,538 --> 01:25:42,300
Dennis Peron and Tod mikuriya who who

1704
01:25:40,078 --> 01:25:45,059
created this axe you know

1705
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:49,170
in with the intention of compassion for

1706
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:52,110
for the patient's plight and in that act

1707
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:55,529
they allowed folks get access to their

1708
01:25:52,109 --> 01:25:58,979
own medicine and I had to step away just

1709
01:25:55,529 --> 01:26:02,399
now to talk to a patient who reminded me

1710
01:25:58,979 --> 01:26:04,859
you know she she's able to grow her own

1711
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:09,750
medicine unfortunately she gets this

1712
01:26:04,859 --> 01:26:13,469
reaction from certain types some English

1713
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:15,930
varietals she calls where she gets an

1714
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:18,659
infection or an inflammation in her

1715
01:26:15,930 --> 01:26:21,030
sinuses but she needs the medicine and

1716
01:26:18,659 --> 01:26:24,090
so she's got to figure out which

1717
01:26:21,029 --> 01:26:26,849
medicines will not give her the negative

1718
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:29,730
effect in which well and she's able to

1719
01:26:26,850 --> 01:26:32,400
do that because she lives in the Santa

1720
01:26:29,729 --> 01:26:35,519
Cruz Mountains and around her many

1721
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:38,099
people who grow and she feels confident

1722
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:41,010
in their source and so she's in the

1723
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:44,430
lucky position but many patients

1724
01:26:41,010 --> 01:26:47,489
especially in the LA area are relying on

1725
01:26:44,430 --> 01:26:52,020
labeling and you know don't live next to

1726
01:26:47,489 --> 01:26:56,729
a cultivator that that can reliably give

1727
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:59,840
them medicine but what I am excited

1728
01:26:56,729 --> 01:27:02,959
about is and what I believe is that the

1729
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:07,350
Compassionate Use Act still is in effect

1730
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:11,609
maybe you can you can help me firming

1731
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:14,070
that for me the biggest problem is that

1732
01:27:11,609 --> 01:27:18,569
yes it is and you can get a medical

1733
01:27:14,069 --> 01:27:20,210
license but patients over the years have

1734
01:27:18,569 --> 01:27:23,639
suffered from such invasive

1735
01:27:20,210 --> 01:27:24,779
discrimination that when legalization

1736
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:28,440
hit

1737
01:27:24,779 --> 01:27:30,059
they stopped renewing their racks and I

1738
01:27:28,439 --> 01:27:32,039
got to tell you of all the things that

1739
01:27:30,060 --> 01:27:34,770
patients do that makes me the most

1740
01:27:32,039 --> 01:27:37,529
nervous because frequently the only

1741
01:27:34,770 --> 01:27:43,320
person you're going to talk to who could

1742
01:27:37,529 --> 01:27:45,359
really tell you what what if you're very

1743
01:27:43,319 --> 01:27:48,569
sick you may be taking ten different

1744
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:51,029
kinds of pharmaceuticals you need a

1745
01:27:48,569 --> 01:27:54,869
doctor you need to work with a doctor

1746
01:27:51,029 --> 01:27:57,170
and when patients stopped renewing their

1747
01:27:54,869 --> 01:27:57,170
rat

1748
01:27:57,319 --> 01:28:04,199
there was a very firm Network across the

1749
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:06,390
state gene one of genes doctors in his

1750
01:28:04,199 --> 01:28:10,199
network actually saved my life at one

1751
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:11,789
point so these were dedicated doctors

1752
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:13,949
who really knew their stuff and all of a

1753
01:28:11,789 --> 01:28:15,810
sudden patients aren't renewing their

1754
01:28:13,949 --> 01:28:20,119
acts so they're not getting that input

1755
01:28:15,810 --> 01:28:23,970
from a medical doctor anymore

1756
01:28:20,119 --> 01:28:26,250
patients make up from what dispensary

1757
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:28,070
operators tell me between seventy and

1758
01:28:26,250 --> 01:28:30,930
eighty five percent of their clientele

1759
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:35,069
yeah they're just not renewing their

1760
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:38,850
acts and on top of it back in the day

1761
01:28:35,069 --> 01:28:41,069
before legalization passed if you wanted

1762
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:46,380
to work in a dispensary you had to have

1763
01:28:41,069 --> 01:28:50,929
a rack so the workforce is still very

1764
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:55,710
much patient and from my point of view

1765
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:58,740
once you stop having experts in the mix

1766
01:28:55,710 --> 01:29:02,039
and it's just people trying to sell you

1767
01:28:58,739 --> 01:29:05,969
product you can get into some very

1768
01:29:02,039 --> 01:29:08,729
dangerous spaces I still renew my right

1769
01:29:05,970 --> 01:29:12,900
every year and I still got my county

1770
01:29:08,729 --> 01:29:14,250
card through the state program because I

1771
01:29:12,899 --> 01:29:16,529
don't want to be able to sit down and

1772
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:18,779
talk to a doctor and ask the kind of

1773
01:29:16,529 --> 01:29:21,719
questions that nobody gender is ever

1774
01:29:18,779 --> 01:29:25,349
going to be la answer so that's one way

1775
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:27,990
that compassionate use has kind of gone

1776
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:32,010
south and it's a very dangerous

1777
01:29:27,989 --> 01:29:35,000
development the other problem with this

1778
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:39,480
is that patients are no longer

1779
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:42,689
identifiable as a discrete group they

1780
01:29:39,479 --> 01:29:46,109
are now lumped in with recreational

1781
01:29:42,689 --> 01:29:48,779
users I personally feel that all uses

1782
01:29:46,109 --> 01:29:50,609
medical I think Peron was right and I've

1783
01:29:48,779 --> 01:29:53,699
never had a lengthy conversation with

1784
01:29:50,609 --> 01:29:56,909
the recreational user who didn't quickly

1785
01:29:53,699 --> 01:29:59,189
own up to the fact that marijuana was

1786
01:29:56,909 --> 01:30:02,039
wonderful because it took care of things

1787
01:29:59,189 --> 01:30:04,559
like sleeplessness or anxiety or pain

1788
01:30:02,039 --> 01:30:07,289
those are medical users those are not

1789
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,320
the that is not have a glass of wine and

1790
01:30:07,289 --> 01:30:10,868
relax

1791
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:14,139
that is treating some pretty core

1792
01:30:10,868 --> 01:30:16,509
problems so compassionate you still

1793
01:30:14,139 --> 01:30:18,880
exist at the state level I think you

1794
01:30:16,510 --> 01:30:21,550
check one box for medical and one box

1795
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:24,099
for recreational I would advise

1796
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:26,610
everybody to always get a medical

1797
01:30:24,099 --> 01:30:30,880
license if you can operate a dispensary

1798
01:30:26,609 --> 01:30:34,029
because ASA got the CGS amendment in in

1799
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:35,920
2014 it's been renewed every year that

1800
01:30:34,029 --> 01:30:40,238
means that the federal government cannot

1801
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:42,899
rage you or bother you if you're obeying

1802
01:30:40,238 --> 01:30:45,519
the laws of your home state and that

1803
01:30:42,899 --> 01:30:48,238
more than any other development that

1804
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:51,969
ending of the raise the federal raids

1805
01:30:48,238 --> 01:30:53,848
helped the industry in Los Angeles and

1806
01:30:51,969 --> 01:30:56,980
all across the state

1807
01:30:53,849 --> 01:31:01,659
compassionate uses widely misunderstood

1808
01:30:56,979 --> 01:31:03,729
these days it's almost become like this

1809
01:31:01,658 --> 01:31:06,219
thing your grandparents did back in the

1810
01:31:03,729 --> 01:31:08,468
day but I believe it's very much alive

1811
01:31:06,219 --> 01:31:12,429
and that we have a lot of a long way to

1812
01:31:08,469 --> 01:31:15,130
go before patients have true access and

1813
01:31:12,429 --> 01:31:17,529
I just hope that I'm well enough to

1814
01:31:15,130 --> 01:31:22,630
continue the fight until I can't anymore

1815
01:31:17,529 --> 01:31:24,939
and that when I lay down my burden that

1816
01:31:22,630 --> 01:31:27,929
I can look out on a landscape where I

1817
01:31:24,939 --> 01:31:35,229
will never be denied safe access again

1818
01:31:27,929 --> 01:31:43,859
so that's all I got I like it great

1819
01:31:35,229 --> 01:31:47,319
answer sir there's a dog cameo yeah I

1820
01:31:43,859 --> 01:31:49,500
posted that I posted a message to all of

1821
01:31:47,319 --> 01:31:54,250
you about the University Arizona study

1822
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:58,779
that about the my concern about kovat in

1823
01:31:54,250 --> 01:32:00,819
certain patients and TC know yeah you

1824
01:31:58,779 --> 01:32:02,710
should you should check it out if you're

1825
01:32:00,819 --> 01:32:04,500
so good it's a really good study these

1826
01:32:02,710 --> 01:32:07,599
people are know what they're done

1827
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:10,779
another reasons I really love having

1828
01:32:07,599 --> 01:32:13,840
doctors in charge of this is and people

1829
01:32:10,779 --> 01:32:17,769
like Michael Backus too is there's this

1830
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:21,248
I don't know what to call it

1831
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:23,199
like a fantasy the marijuana

1832
01:32:21,248 --> 01:32:24,849
is the end-all be-all it'll cure

1833
01:32:23,198 --> 01:32:28,658
everything it'll take care of everything

1834
01:32:24,849 --> 01:32:31,300
and my experience has been quite often

1835
01:32:28,658 --> 01:32:33,029
it does but when it doesn't it can

1836
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:37,710
really have some that effects

1837
01:32:33,029 --> 01:32:41,618
so having educated people talking in a

1838
01:32:37,710 --> 01:32:43,929
science-based language about this can

1839
01:32:41,618 --> 01:32:46,569
only be good even if it means sometimes

1840
01:32:43,929 --> 01:32:49,690
you have to say there may be a problem

1841
01:32:46,569 --> 01:32:51,488
here that's all I got you know I mean I

1842
01:32:49,689 --> 01:32:53,228
think I mean and that's why it's got to

1843
01:32:51,488 --> 01:32:55,238
be doctors it's not never gonna be me

1844
01:32:53,229 --> 01:32:57,909
all I do is pointed doctors and

1845
01:32:55,238 --> 01:33:01,388
translate for patients all right so

1846
01:32:57,908 --> 01:33:04,359
typically most people who get a medical

1847
01:33:01,389 --> 01:33:05,889
recommendation in my opinion don't have

1848
01:33:04,359 --> 01:33:07,719
enough interaction with their doctor

1849
01:33:05,889 --> 01:33:09,639
it's not necessarily because the doctor

1850
01:33:07,719 --> 01:33:11,380
doesn't want it but it's just the

1851
01:33:09,639 --> 01:33:15,069
patient doesn't take advantage of the

1852
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:19,269
access and so I like appointed doctors

1853
01:33:15,069 --> 01:33:23,228
and say ask them because they're doctors

1854
01:33:19,269 --> 01:33:25,960
I agree with being a doctor I agree with

1855
01:33:23,229 --> 01:33:29,619
you guys but I do have to say you know I

1856
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:34,679
get my information from patients a lot

1857
01:33:29,618 --> 01:33:38,469
and it's a community I create everyone

1858
01:33:34,679 --> 01:33:40,868
for contributing to the community we're

1859
01:33:38,469 --> 01:33:45,729
gonna figure out how this is gonna help

1860
01:33:40,868 --> 01:33:49,029
more people so just quickly on a fun

1861
01:33:45,729 --> 01:33:52,050
note the inspiration for pulling this

1862
01:33:49,029 --> 01:33:55,300
whole conversation together was a was a

1863
01:33:52,050 --> 01:34:00,880
coronavirus beginning of lockdown story

1864
01:33:55,300 --> 01:34:03,309
that crossed my radar which was Alice so

1865
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:05,288
Alice can you talk I guess the shop you

1866
01:34:03,309 --> 01:34:07,659
normally went to wasn't delivering so

1867
01:34:05,288 --> 01:34:11,889
can you tell the story and give everyone

1868
01:34:07,658 --> 01:34:19,719
on the back is a great shot but I know

1869
01:34:11,889 --> 01:34:21,788
Sarah had talked about you know it's not

1870
01:34:19,719 --> 01:34:24,489
lower level it's still my quality but

1871
01:34:21,788 --> 01:34:28,149
they sell it for maybe 20 bucks an

1872
01:34:24,488 --> 01:34:29,649
eighth or possibly less but they just

1873
01:34:28,149 --> 01:34:34,409
weren't working out the whole delivery

1874
01:34:29,649 --> 01:34:37,259
service and you know for my wife and I

1875
01:34:34,409 --> 01:34:39,899
cannabis is ultimately I mean I'm on

1876
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:44,159
like Sara said I'm on six to seven

1877
01:34:39,899 --> 01:34:46,289
different medications but I'm not on any

1878
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:50,309
pain medications and that's largely due

1879
01:34:46,289 --> 01:34:52,260
to cannabis as far as my wife there's no

1880
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:55,560
medications for the multitude of

1881
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:56,670
symptoms that she that she goes through

1882
01:34:55,560 --> 01:35:02,190
every day

1883
01:34:56,670 --> 01:35:04,079
cannabis is it basically and yeah so our

1884
01:35:02,189 --> 01:35:05,699
main dispensary that he goes to you

1885
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:08,909
which is not ten minutes away from my

1886
01:35:05,699 --> 01:35:11,789
house you know wasn't doing the delivery

1887
01:35:08,909 --> 01:35:13,529
services and I one of my favorite brands

1888
01:35:11,789 --> 01:35:16,350
that they were selling was this brand

1889
01:35:13,529 --> 01:35:19,619
called Cali hash and they do cold water

1890
01:35:16,350 --> 01:35:22,170
extraction so another another source

1891
01:35:19,619 --> 01:35:24,510
that you know is pure and doesn't have

1892
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:30,060
any you know they know what they're

1893
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:31,770
doing I sort of reached out to him you

1894
01:35:30,060 --> 01:35:34,200
know through my network rolling stone

1895
01:35:31,770 --> 01:35:36,570
which I also have an Instagram so that's

1896
01:35:34,199 --> 01:35:39,000
how I got to know many of these men

1897
01:35:36,569 --> 01:35:41,880
makers was I would get their medicine

1898
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:45,180
and I would CAD them in my daily posts

1899
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:47,069
you know and Michael has always been

1900
01:35:45,180 --> 01:35:49,950
very supportive

1901
01:35:47,069 --> 01:35:51,960
Michael Dominique and I reached out to

1902
01:35:49,949 --> 01:35:54,720
him and I said hey is there any chance I

1903
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:57,720
could get any of your hash you know

1904
01:35:54,720 --> 01:36:00,990
they're not issuing delivery at this

1905
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:04,829
point and he came straight to me the

1906
01:36:00,989 --> 01:36:07,619
next day and just said you know here you

1907
01:36:04,829 --> 01:36:09,720
know and I was I was thrilled by that

1908
01:36:07,619 --> 01:36:12,439
I'm touched by that and he also

1909
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:17,579
introduced me to one of his hash makers

1910
01:36:12,439 --> 01:36:21,689
who also that I had never met this this

1911
01:36:17,579 --> 01:36:23,609
young man before and he's also sort of

1912
01:36:21,689 --> 01:36:26,069
supplying me with with medicine as well

1913
01:36:23,609 --> 01:36:29,039
so I I kind of for the first time

1914
01:36:26,069 --> 01:36:32,729
inadvertently have my own compassionate

1915
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:36,600
care set up you know because of because

1916
01:36:32,729 --> 01:36:41,609
of koban interestingly enough extractors

1917
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:43,410
make great friends the best friend yeah

1918
01:36:41,609 --> 01:36:45,750
I mean the thing about it is is that

1919
01:36:43,409 --> 01:36:47,189
what I've noticed about and it's funny

1920
01:36:45,750 --> 01:36:47,859
because for years I was much more on the

1921
01:36:47,189 --> 01:36:50,739
flower side

1922
01:36:47,859 --> 01:36:52,420
thing then the extract side of things

1923
01:36:50,739 --> 01:36:53,920
but that's changed in the last two years

1924
01:36:52,420 --> 01:36:57,449
and I've learned a lot more about

1925
01:36:53,920 --> 01:37:01,690
extraction and been involved in it and

1926
01:36:57,449 --> 01:37:03,399
for me it's it's flour and hash that's

1927
01:37:01,689 --> 01:37:08,019
that seems to be my bread and butter

1928
01:37:03,399 --> 01:37:10,779
okay with flour it flour I would say

1929
01:37:08,020 --> 01:37:13,360
takes away the pain but it doesn't take

1930
01:37:10,779 --> 01:37:16,059
away in this spasticity but you put the

1931
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:18,399
two together and it's like the best tips

1932
01:37:16,060 --> 01:37:21,880
THC sandwich you could ever hope to have

1933
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:24,279
right and I mean I think honestly that

1934
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:28,390
I'm really fascinated by the combination

1935
01:37:24,279 --> 01:37:32,349
of flour and extract what I what I call

1936
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:34,539
infuse flour and yeah and that's again

1937
01:37:32,350 --> 01:37:37,360
in a vaporizer it's just a way to go

1938
01:37:34,539 --> 01:37:38,859
just ah yeah you're right I need to get

1939
01:37:37,359 --> 01:37:40,719
back on that train because for the

1940
01:37:38,859 --> 01:37:44,229
longest time that's what I was doing and

1941
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:47,650
you know it no you're right it's a slow

1942
01:37:44,229 --> 01:37:52,389
creep but it's fantastic right right and

1943
01:37:47,649 --> 01:37:54,789
it's um yeah my what keeps your interest

1944
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:57,220
with extract going forward do you see

1945
01:37:54,789 --> 01:37:59,859
more opportunities with them and

1946
01:37:57,220 --> 01:38:03,070
distinguish between solvent and solvent

1947
01:37:59,859 --> 01:38:05,649
lists are you exploring both yeah so

1948
01:38:03,069 --> 01:38:08,859
mechanical extraction that's things like

1949
01:38:05,649 --> 01:38:12,279
water hash rosin technology where you

1950
01:38:08,859 --> 01:38:14,319
actually squeeze the cannabis and and

1951
01:38:12,279 --> 01:38:16,710
effectively you're getting maple syrup

1952
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:16,710
out of it

1953
01:38:17,220 --> 01:38:23,380
the truth is I'm kind of agnostic about

1954
01:38:20,260 --> 01:38:26,470
about methods right now because I'm

1955
01:38:23,380 --> 01:38:29,699
noticing chemical differences that are

1956
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:32,560
of utility and solvent based extracts

1957
01:38:29,699 --> 01:38:36,460
that I expected to see in solvent list

1958
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:39,789
base extracts so solvent extracts take a

1959
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:41,560
lot more off the plant okay and that can

1960
01:38:39,789 --> 01:38:44,710
be problematic or that can be beneficial

1961
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:49,840
I'm finding it in my particular use case

1962
01:38:44,710 --> 01:38:51,850
to be beneficial but I'm very I'm very

1963
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:53,470
agnostic when it comes to technology I

1964
01:38:51,850 --> 01:38:55,450
just want to make sure that it tests

1965
01:38:53,470 --> 01:38:57,670
really clean can you just give an

1966
01:38:55,449 --> 01:39:01,079
example of something that it has that

1967
01:38:57,670 --> 01:39:05,039
you like or are looking for

1968
01:39:01,079 --> 01:39:09,479
yeah so what I find is I get higher Terp

1969
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:14,100
fractions when I use solvents to extract

1970
01:39:09,479 --> 01:39:16,379
and what's great is is that I'm

1971
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:19,920
incredibly patient with my solving

1972
01:39:16,380 --> 01:39:22,770
extracts so I extract them and excite

1973
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:26,760
insanely low temperatures like 120 minus

1974
01:39:22,770 --> 01:39:31,530
hundred one and then what I do is I very

1975
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:35,369
very carefully remove purge the solvent

1976
01:39:31,529 --> 01:39:39,599
and what I end up with is I end up with

1977
01:39:35,369 --> 01:39:42,989
a with a sauce product that then I

1978
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:46,020
nucleate the THCA out of so I end up

1979
01:39:42,989 --> 01:39:49,889
with THC a crystals and hi Turkey and

1980
01:39:46,020 --> 01:39:52,890
extract and to me then I can start to

1981
01:39:49,890 --> 01:39:58,110
play with cannabinoid ratios and terpene

1982
01:39:52,890 --> 01:40:00,329
ratios in a very very rich manner if I

1983
01:39:58,109 --> 01:40:02,670
use mechanical extraction like taking

1984
01:40:00,329 --> 01:40:04,769
water hash and pressing rosin from it

1985
01:40:02,670 --> 01:40:06,480
I'll get an insanely high quality

1986
01:40:04,770 --> 01:40:08,700
product but it doesn't have quite the

1987
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:11,189
range of chemistry that I'm looking for

1988
01:40:08,699 --> 01:40:13,889
so I think it's fantastic I mean my

1989
01:40:11,189 --> 01:40:16,349
friends at 7:10 lab basically the best

1990
01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:19,079
solvent less extract in California and

1991
01:40:16,350 --> 01:40:23,880
getting at affordable but they're not

1992
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:26,659
affordable because it they're they're

1993
01:40:23,880 --> 01:40:30,510
maniacs they do everything by hand and

1994
01:40:26,659 --> 01:40:32,819
and and they they and I mean that

1995
01:40:30,510 --> 01:40:35,820
there's no automation basically in their

1996
01:40:32,819 --> 01:40:38,909
facility so their costs are just

1997
01:40:35,819 --> 01:40:41,819
ridiculous and and they could do

1998
01:40:38,909 --> 01:40:43,949
efficiencies but they want to do it

1999
01:40:41,819 --> 01:40:46,099
their way so that's why companies like

2000
01:40:43,949 --> 01:40:49,470
rock garden can provide you with a much

2001
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:53,789
less expensive product they can scan

2002
01:40:49,470 --> 01:40:55,470
that's clean you know everything has to

2003
01:40:53,789 --> 01:40:56,789
be clean now I mean because everything

2004
01:40:55,470 --> 01:41:01,140
has to be tested if it's going through

2005
01:40:56,789 --> 01:41:04,560
the system my assurance that you know

2006
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:06,539
metals and pesticide residues and

2007
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:07,830
solvents are not going to be there are

2008
01:41:06,539 --> 01:41:10,229
pretty high because I can look at the

2009
01:41:07,829 --> 01:41:12,779
COA and and also I mean there are

2010
01:41:10,229 --> 01:41:14,819
certain labs if I see their CoA

2011
01:41:12,779 --> 01:41:16,739
and I'm suspicious about what

2012
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:19,710
the results all the senate through a lab

2013
01:41:16,739 --> 01:41:21,359
i trust to see if i'm if they're

2014
01:41:19,710 --> 01:41:22,859
accurate not sometimes they aren't and

2015
01:41:21,359 --> 01:41:23,369
the reason they aren't is there in a

2016
01:41:22,859 --> 01:41:26,099
rush

2017
01:41:23,369 --> 01:41:29,939
a lot of these labs pump stuff through

2018
01:41:26,100 --> 01:41:32,460
and that can end up with sloppy

2019
01:41:29,939 --> 01:41:34,109
chemistry and just quickly what's your

2020
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:38,069
solvent of choice when you keep

2021
01:41:34,109 --> 01:41:40,199
mentioning solvent again i'm kind of

2022
01:41:38,069 --> 01:41:43,380
agnostic about that i mean i i've had

2023
01:41:40,199 --> 01:41:45,210
like i used to detest butane until I

2024
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:48,960
read that the federal inhalation

2025
01:41:45,210 --> 01:41:51,840
standards for butane are 40% of what

2026
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:55,289
you're inhaling for 11 minutes that's

2027
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:58,199
considered completely safe alright so

2028
01:41:55,289 --> 01:42:01,260
concerns about butane residues there

2029
01:41:58,199 --> 01:42:03,539
right now for me non-existent what I

2030
01:42:01,260 --> 01:42:05,970
used what I what I was actually really

2031
01:42:03,539 --> 01:42:09,300
scared of back in the day is that they

2032
01:42:05,970 --> 01:42:11,789
used odorants in butane so you could

2033
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:13,710
smell it if it was leaking and those

2034
01:42:11,789 --> 01:42:15,359
odorants typically are their captains

2035
01:42:13,710 --> 01:42:19,289
and they're really dangerous especially

2036
01:42:15,359 --> 01:42:22,409
if you heat them and so so the old open

2037
01:42:19,289 --> 01:42:24,960
blasting days of butane extracts that's

2038
01:42:22,409 --> 01:42:31,229
the reason I never quit or ABC with with

2039
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:32,670
PVC pipes what scares you now that's

2040
01:42:31,229 --> 01:42:34,739
curious thing let's see what scares me

2041
01:42:32,670 --> 01:42:38,399
now the only thing that really scares me

2042
01:42:34,739 --> 01:42:40,859
now is a bad laugh so in other words a

2043
01:42:38,399 --> 01:42:41,399
lab saying that something's clean when

2044
01:42:40,859 --> 01:42:44,009
it's not

2045
01:42:41,399 --> 01:42:46,559
that's why I've kind of I really like I

2046
01:42:44,010 --> 01:42:49,199
check out my labs like I check out my

2047
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:52,200
personal physicians I want to know that

2048
01:42:49,199 --> 01:42:54,689
they're really into it they really like

2049
01:42:52,199 --> 01:42:56,250
what they're doing and really want to

2050
01:42:54,689 --> 01:42:58,349
learn more about what they're doing I

2051
01:42:56,250 --> 01:43:00,359
mean the great thing is like personally

2052
01:42:58,350 --> 01:43:02,340
I use se labs a lot I've worked them for

2053
01:43:00,359 --> 01:43:05,069
a long time I've watched the quality of

2054
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:07,860
their chemistry go up and up and up

2055
01:43:05,069 --> 01:43:09,389
while those their throughput goes down

2056
01:43:07,859 --> 01:43:11,159
and down and down there they have the

2057
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:13,410
longest terpene method in California

2058
01:43:11,159 --> 01:43:15,899
right now their run their runs in like

2059
01:43:13,409 --> 01:43:17,880
60 minutes for Turk's which means the

2060
01:43:15,899 --> 01:43:21,960
peaks in the result are going to be

2061
01:43:17,880 --> 01:43:23,699
accurate so yeah so yeah what concerns

2062
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:25,409
me now is just said the labs gonna fool

2063
01:43:23,699 --> 01:43:28,590
me and that the state does not have

2064
01:43:25,409 --> 01:43:30,630
enough oversight over the labs to take

2065
01:43:28,590 --> 01:43:33,239
not just a bad apples yet I mean I'm

2066
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:35,429
hoping that will come but it really does

2067
01:43:33,238 --> 01:43:38,118
need to come because certain things like

2068
01:43:35,429 --> 01:43:40,889
I don't want somebody to cut corner on

2069
01:43:38,118 --> 01:43:44,519
aflatoxin testing because alpha toxins

2070
01:43:40,889 --> 01:43:46,699
can cause liver cancer and so I don't

2071
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:48,840
want somebody to get Aspergillus

2072
01:43:46,698 --> 01:43:51,719
infested need that's putting out these

2073
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:57,119
toxins and ingest it and then have liver

2074
01:43:51,719 --> 01:43:59,849
problems because of it so I is it just a

2075
01:43:57,118 --> 01:44:02,130
thing to ask your dispensary you know

2076
01:43:59,849 --> 01:44:04,909
where they get their testing from just

2077
01:44:02,130 --> 01:44:07,020
ask for their cos they have to have them

2078
01:44:04,908 --> 01:44:09,118
they have to have them in there and then

2079
01:44:07,020 --> 01:44:14,010
and you're gonna get the blank look from

2080
01:44:09,118 --> 01:44:19,348
most staff so just be very very very

2081
01:44:14,010 --> 01:44:21,270
nice and very very insistent say I've

2082
01:44:19,349 --> 01:44:26,940
got this rare condition and I've got a

2083
01:44:21,270 --> 01:44:28,889
great attorney CoA because if something

2084
01:44:26,939 --> 01:44:32,428
happens to me it's really out of my

2085
01:44:28,889 --> 01:44:35,819
hands my my attorney and his law firm

2086
01:44:32,429 --> 01:44:39,118
engulf and devour just has a reputation

2087
01:44:35,819 --> 01:44:45,109
for you know owning businesses that mess

2088
01:44:39,118 --> 01:44:49,039
with me all right well it's 2 o'clock so

2089
01:44:45,109 --> 01:44:51,750
I guess last words

2090
01:44:49,039 --> 01:44:55,529
Michael had said we were talking

2091
01:44:51,750 --> 01:45:01,560
concerns from the doctor what concerns

2092
01:44:55,529 --> 01:45:07,039
you and and what one or two final

2093
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:10,500
thoughts looking forward 2020 and beyond

2094
01:45:07,039 --> 01:45:13,800
well you know pushing the idea that you

2095
01:45:10,500 --> 01:45:17,988
know moving cannabis from where it is

2096
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:22,380
now to really making it medicine and

2097
01:45:17,988 --> 01:45:26,729
pushing our studies forward is really my

2098
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:30,210
goal and I don't think we can rely on

2099
01:45:26,729 --> 01:45:33,089
the state or the federal government to

2100
01:45:30,210 --> 01:45:39,000
do this this is a movement started by

2101
01:45:33,090 --> 01:45:42,060
people patients and and patient groups

2102
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,470
like dispensaries in manufa

2103
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:45,990
actors and they think we need to get

2104
01:45:43,470 --> 01:45:49,500
together and then contribute in a

2105
01:45:45,989 --> 01:45:52,769
nonprofit way to improving the studies

2106
01:45:49,500 --> 01:45:55,819
improving the research on these products

2107
01:45:52,770 --> 01:46:00,180
so that patients are getting the best

2108
01:45:55,819 --> 01:46:02,279
medicine and absolutely I'm completely

2109
01:46:00,180 --> 01:46:05,850
concerned that this medicine is not

2110
01:46:02,279 --> 01:46:09,719
subsidised I talk to many patients all

2111
01:46:05,850 --> 01:46:13,039
the time and do not have money the state

2112
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:17,520
the federal government can't think about

2113
01:46:13,039 --> 01:46:21,720
cannabis as a way to raise funds by

2114
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:25,160
taxing patients its impotence not the

2115
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:28,490
right way to go as a compassionate

2116
01:46:25,159 --> 01:46:31,289
society that we're worried about Koated

2117
01:46:28,489 --> 01:46:34,920
we're worried about each other being

2118
01:46:31,289 --> 01:46:41,310
exposed to this virus and we need to

2119
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:46,649
also worry about draining money from our

2120
01:46:41,310 --> 01:46:49,050
suffering population it's it's insane to

2121
01:46:46,649 --> 01:46:54,920
think about to think about it that way

2122
01:46:49,050 --> 01:46:57,659
and so financially and rigorous science

2123
01:46:54,920 --> 01:47:00,239
to improve the medicine definitely those

2124
01:46:57,659 --> 01:47:01,289
are my two biggest thoughts these days

2125
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:04,710
okay

2126
01:47:01,289 --> 01:47:16,010
policy expert what are your final

2127
01:47:04,710 --> 01:47:19,829
thoughts don't give up kind of basic but

2128
01:47:16,010 --> 01:47:22,920
looking back on it we only got to this

2129
01:47:19,829 --> 01:47:26,519
point and believe me if somebody was

2130
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:30,000
born in 1953 and really knows what

2131
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:33,180
prohibition looks like I never dreamed

2132
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:36,539
we'd get this far so don't give up and

2133
01:47:33,180 --> 01:47:39,860
when you can do what you can do how

2134
01:47:36,539 --> 01:47:44,850
about nobody expects somebody who is

2135
01:47:39,859 --> 01:47:47,279
poor and sick to make the same kind of

2136
01:47:44,850 --> 01:47:52,350
effort that somebody who's wealthy and

2137
01:47:47,279 --> 01:47:53,829
well cat but when that plea comes across

2138
01:47:52,350 --> 01:47:55,960
your Facebook page

2139
01:47:53,829 --> 01:47:59,109
they want you to click on a link and

2140
01:47:55,960 --> 01:48:03,130
fill out a few fields so a letter goes

2141
01:47:59,109 --> 01:48:05,409
to your representatives do it because

2142
01:48:03,130 --> 01:48:07,810
you may think that's a small thing but

2143
01:48:05,409 --> 01:48:11,500
those small things man they add up to

2144
01:48:07,810 --> 01:48:14,530
something big and all we have to do is

2145
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:17,229
keep marching forward now we have turned

2146
01:48:14,529 --> 01:48:21,009
the corner believe it or not so don't

2147
01:48:17,229 --> 01:48:25,299
give up so I have a last quick question

2148
01:48:21,010 --> 01:48:27,550
for you insurance companies I thought a

2149
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:29,829
few years ago that they were starting to

2150
01:48:27,550 --> 01:48:31,869
step up and they were gonna cover a

2151
01:48:29,829 --> 01:48:34,239
cannabis I don't know if that's

2152
01:48:31,869 --> 01:48:37,449
happening how do we put pressure on them

2153
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:42,579
what can we do to to move that forward

2154
01:48:37,449 --> 01:48:44,139
because it's so important it depends on

2155
01:48:42,579 --> 01:48:47,470
what their links to the federal

2156
01:48:44,140 --> 01:48:50,590
government are that may well be the

2157
01:48:47,470 --> 01:48:54,579
sticking point I have long to be able to

2158
01:48:50,590 --> 01:48:58,720
deject my cannabis expenses either off

2159
01:48:54,579 --> 01:49:02,140
my state income tax or get reimbursed by

2160
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:04,500
insurance but I get a real feeling that

2161
01:49:02,140 --> 01:49:07,240
when it comes to your health insurance

2162
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:09,760
that there's meaningful ties to the

2163
01:49:07,239 --> 01:49:14,859
federal government and until we can sort

2164
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:18,010
of untie that Gordian knot the health

2165
01:49:14,859 --> 01:49:22,000
providers are going to be reluctant you

2166
01:49:18,010 --> 01:49:24,039
know the different companies so that's

2167
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:28,710
another good battle

2168
01:49:24,039 --> 01:49:35,260
believe me it's really really effort I

2169
01:49:28,710 --> 01:49:39,340
also think that we can prove that

2170
01:49:35,260 --> 01:49:41,190
cannabis saves the money it's not as

2171
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:44,529
expensive as a lot of the

2172
01:49:41,189 --> 01:49:47,529
pharmaceuticals out there and if that's

2173
01:49:44,529 --> 01:49:49,599
what's motivating them there I think

2174
01:49:47,529 --> 01:49:54,550
it's a good good way to convince the

2175
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:57,910
surance contactus okay and the final

2176
01:49:54,550 --> 01:50:01,289
word will go to Alice our patient and

2177
01:49:57,909 --> 01:50:07,489
the next generation of advocates who

2178
01:50:01,289 --> 01:50:10,460
will carry the baton all right well

2179
01:50:07,489 --> 01:50:14,000
I would like to hope that we continue

2180
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:16,909
talking after all this because all right

2181
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:20,420
now I all I have is a network of

2182
01:50:16,909 --> 01:50:22,189
patients which is fantastic and I can do

2183
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:25,250
that all day long but I hope that we all

2184
01:50:22,189 --> 01:50:27,559
stay in contact and we can all make sure

2185
01:50:25,250 --> 01:50:32,050
make some change together I think that

2186
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:34,760
become housing and you know I think

2187
01:50:32,050 --> 01:50:36,890
disability is nothing to be ashamed of

2188
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:38,840
illness is nothing to be ashamed of and

2189
01:50:36,890 --> 01:50:43,550
I think that's what it boils down to as

2190
01:50:38,840 --> 01:50:45,610
well is that most of our government you

2191
01:50:43,550 --> 01:50:48,199
know I kind of feel maybe doesn't have

2192
01:50:45,609 --> 01:50:50,119
use for people with disabilities or

2193
01:50:48,199 --> 01:50:54,170
illnesses and I think that it's total

2194
01:50:50,119 --> 01:50:57,859
hogwash because you look at where right

2195
01:50:54,170 --> 01:51:01,550
now I mean that we're unused to sorry my

2196
01:50:57,859 --> 01:51:04,339
dogs are excited I'm used to staying at

2197
01:51:01,550 --> 01:51:06,710
home you know and now the vast majority

2198
01:51:04,340 --> 01:51:09,380
of people are getting sick and they're

2199
01:51:06,710 --> 01:51:11,090
not used to being at home and we're the

2200
01:51:09,380 --> 01:51:12,829
ones that are gonna need the difference

2201
01:51:11,090 --> 01:51:18,949
people with disabilities are the true

2202
01:51:12,829 --> 01:51:21,800
Buddha's of the world I think all right

2203
01:51:18,949 --> 01:51:25,000
and on that it's a wrap I appreciate it

2204
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:27,140
everyone thanks for participating and

2205
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:30,409
we'll continue these types of

2206
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:32,150
conversations going forward so have a

2207
01:51:30,409 --> 01:51:35,439
good rest of your Tuesday thank you

2208
01:51:32,149 --> 01:51:35,439
everyone thank you
