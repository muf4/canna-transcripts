2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:16,740
we got air Branson here announce

3
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:21,300
advisory group and also we're super came

4
00:00:16,739 --> 00:00:21,839
in for a box car Supply Co lovely wife

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,670
Sam

6
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:27,629
she works for oppressive saw services

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:31,219
which provides microscope analysis for

8
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:33,780
soils nice microscope analysis for soils

9
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:36,090
so we got the batting warm-ups out of

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,950
the way how you doing now I'm doing good

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:41,100
the cup is awesome this year it hasn't

12
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,079
rained yet today so everybody's seeming

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,120
in good spirits you know even though

14
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,230
it's changed this year different than

15
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:52,019
last year with the prop 215 going into

16
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:54,269
the prop you're definitely not seeing

17
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,309
dudes with backpacks of pounds walk

18
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,140
around this year oh no there's no packs

19
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:59,429
and the lines are a little different in

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,128
the way you got to buy things but

21
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:04,049
overall everybody can blaze you don't

22
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:06,989
need to get a wristband in a certain

23
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,290
area everybody's kind of unified now I

24
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:12,149
believe so I like that part of it

25
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,890
several years ago the first Emerald cup

26
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,659
I came to I was the first cannabis event

27
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,820
I didn't bring my medical card and even

28
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,170
know that was a thing and had to meet up

29
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:22,319
with Eric we had to do the old little

30
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,799
Watusi well they still swap arena yeah

31
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:28,469
exactly that's right yeah I learned that

32
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,860
back in the day yeah put them on loose

33
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:33,109
I'm allergic

34
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:35,659
well well I appreciate it because I

35
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:37,719
drove 480 miles come to event without my

36
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:40,159
driver's license so I was pretty stupid

37
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:42,650
we've come a long way since then I

38
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,140
believe I mean you guys are you know now

39
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:49,070
leading the way in the soils deal on the

40
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:52,129
lanes webinar like that's big it is it's

41
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:54,199
pretty surreal you know I you know a few

42
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:56,209
years ago we came hoping to just try and

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,590
meet people from the industry and tried

44
00:01:56,209 --> 00:01:59,809
to get connected with the movers and the

45
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,540
Shakers and you know thankfully

46
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,310
dragonfly earth medicine and Eric you

47
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,720
know allowed me to hang out I was just

48
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,810
the weird dude with a microscope book

49
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:10,789
trying to talk about math and you know

50
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,930
just really grateful this year you know

51
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:14,539
we have products that are on display

52
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,950
that we designed you know we've been

53
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:18,259
working with some farmers that entered

54
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:20,509
the cup and so you know we just feel

55
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:22,039
really grateful that you know so much

56
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:23,719
has developed in the first few years

57
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:27,829
since just trying to be involved you

58
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:29,810
know yeah yeah I agree I know that it's

59
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,640
very you know controversial right now

60
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,009
with the big farms and the small farms

61
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:36,859
are you seeing any big differences in

62
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:38,449
your line of work with soils and you

63
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,550
know the bigger farms versus the smaller

64
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:42,709
farms I mean this is the microscope see

65
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:45,200
the difference and you know those kind

66
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:47,959
of things or is your business still kind

67
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,139
of the same plan big or small you know

68
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,159
fix the soil look it up the microscope

69
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:54,018
what do something

70
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,199
our approach is always the same

71
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:59,750
regardless of how big the farm is and so

72
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,189
we just come in and we analyze what

73
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,949
they're working with what the issue is

74
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:05,659
try to take some measurements you know

75
00:03:03,949 --> 00:03:07,909
the biggest issue we see in any facility

76
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:09,919
whether it's whether it's a tent or

77
00:03:07,909 --> 00:03:12,379
whether it's a 40,000 square foot

78
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,299
greenhouse it's it's the variation from

79
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:15,889
the wettest pot to the driest pot is

80
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,800
what really gives people a headache and

81
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:20,599
so as we're moving into scale we really

82
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,870
try to quantify those variations you

83
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:26,870
know yeah and one of the biggest

84
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,840
challenges if any farm really is mindset

85
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,549
change and so you have to be able to

86
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,560
look at what you're doing and and

87
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:36,409
scrutinize and say what is working and

88
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,000
what is not working and and even if

89
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:40,759
you're married to a certain type of

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,599
program is that actually working for you

91
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:45,389
is that actually bringing

92
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,009
and why why or why not and so those are

93
00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:51,119
the questions that every farm has to

94
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:52,889
answer as they move forward and we love

95
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,819
to help them out with those answers so

96
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:59,369
yeah I love I love the the getting to

97
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,169
somewhere you know like everybody kind

98
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,719
of bottle necks and kind of what to do

99
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:05,459
and a lot of times people do nine

100
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:07,439
different things you know they change

101
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,780
this they change that there's so many

102
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,150
changes it's hard to track where the

103
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,030
success is but it's easy to you know

104
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,459
notice the failure or the problems that

105
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:20,009
exist and so I know you know for you

106
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,019
guys and myself we spend a lot of time

107
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:24,449
trying to you know do these things to

108
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:28,229
help people solve these problems whether

109
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:31,949
it's the environment above down below

110
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:33,450
and you know like I said with the small

111
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:34,889
farms and the big farms I'm kind of

112
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:36,870
wondering because now that I'm doing the

113
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:39,689
trim procurement I'm seeing a lot of the

114
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,939
big farms too and you know it's kind of

115
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:43,469
this bittersweet situation where I'm

116
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:45,689
working with small farms working with

117
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,970
big farms believe it or not the big

118
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:50,250
farms are trying to do good things and

119
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,170
somewhat you know I mean I see a lot of

120
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,189
them with organic approaches in trying

121
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:55,379
to do you know the right thing

122
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:59,490
ultimately but they have that name big

123
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:00,569
farm and I kind of laugh a little bit

124
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,189
because I thought of something the other

125
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:04,649
day and maybe you guys can help me with

126
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:06,750
this or see if it makes sense but the

127
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:09,779
regenerative soil food web you know

128
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:13,230
general population of organic soil

129
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:15,299
people look at that slide that you and

130
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:18,090
Elaine and people use of how the forest

131
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,720
takes care of itself right the forest is

132
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:20,609
huge

133
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,050
it doesn't need to feed itself it

134
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,569
doesn't need to do all these things but

135
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,930
yet everybody's focusing on the small

136
00:05:24,569 --> 00:05:29,819
farmer to do this regenerative work but

137
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,280
you know can't the big farmers do it

138
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:34,199
because it's the big forest and it seems

139
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:36,719
to me the biggest of farmers could do

140
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:39,209
this because it's the biggest of forests

141
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,890
like where where's the hang-up or the

142
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:43,680
disconnect where it's only the small

143
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:47,219
farmer that you know I guess I feel like

144
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,009
is over some not over supported but just

145
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,320
you know hyper focused on where you know

146
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:55,069
the big farmer also needs a little bit

147
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,300
because I don't want them making a mess

148
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:59,879
and that's you know that's really what's

149
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,500
scary it's like you know a lot of these

150
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:03,659
farms a lot of these people moving into

151
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,939
the old cut flower houses like those

152
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,260
those water sources are so destroyed

153
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:10,170
they're forced to use reverse osmosis

154
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,909
and so you know these big commercial RO

155
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:14,370
systems with these really contaminated

156
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,590
water I mean there are three four twelve

157
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,180
to one waste and so you know some of

158
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:20,159
these facilities are using 30,000

159
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,410
gallons a day and you know we recently

160
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,689
converted a farm that was 40,000 square

161
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:28,350
feet that was doing drained waste in

162
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:31,050
cocoa and you know they were averaging

163
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,490
you know almost a thousand gallons for

164
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,579
one little small area and we cut that

165
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,168
down to 180 gallons and so one area was

166
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:39,120
taken seven hundred to a thousand

167
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:43,349
gallons drain to waste and we cut it

168
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,730
down to less than 200 and so you know if

169
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,919
you're talking about the argument of

170
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,600
this high production salt model it's

171
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,250
like well when you're dumping a thousand

172
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,320
gallons of water into a space every day

173
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,910
that's a lot of water that becomes a dew

174
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,500
point that becomes visible mold and

175
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:57,450
botrytis and this isn't the connection

176
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,089
that people are making and so you know

177
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:02,759
we go into a room we cut that cut that

178
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:04,889
water usage by three by four by five by

179
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,709
seven sometimes and the mold pressure

180
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:09,959
reduces you know and so we're able to

181
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:11,399
quantify the organism populations which

182
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,829
can give us an indication of disease

183
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,109
pressure and so we can tweak these

184
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:18,240
little values reduce the water usage and

185
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,500
we're lowering our carbon footprint

186
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,449
we're lowering our destruction to the

187
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,339
planet we're lowering our usage of water

188
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:25,740
and we're getting a mold-free higher

189
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:27,119
quality product you know and so that's

190
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,340
what Sarah and I have really been trying

191
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,319
to do is push these concepts into the

192
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:32,549
commercial space so that people can see

193
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:34,469
that it is a real thing

194
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,329
you know and and the the biggest

195
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:38,430
opposition we always get is like well if

196
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:40,439
we put everything all these plants into

197
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,090
a single bed how are we gonna keep the

198
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:44,189
disease from moving from one place to

199
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:46,560
another and I just pull up an image of

200
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:48,360
Africa on my phone and point to Africa

201
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,899
is one motherfreakin container you know

202
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,150
it I mean it's like it is

203
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:56,258
one container all roots in the same

204
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:58,739
container you know so yeah regenerative

205
00:07:56,259 --> 00:08:02,650
soul solutions are scalable it's just

206
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:04,629
the real obstacle is that the techniques

207
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,788
that people are teaching aren't

208
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:08,500
necessarily necessarily that conducive

209
00:08:06,788 --> 00:08:10,449
to success in the commercial market and

210
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,069
so what Sarah and I've really tried to

211
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:14,228
do is figure out like how do we

212
00:08:12,069 --> 00:08:16,180
functionally put those natural systems

213
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:18,069
into the commercial space and get them

214
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,930
to work for us and you know

215
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:23,110
unfortunately the organic farmers the

216
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,819
regenerative people are you know they're

217
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,410
getting a lot of waste streams you know

218
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:28,389
and it's hard to be successful while

219
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:31,090
cultivating out of a waste stream you

220
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:34,629
know when I think that we actually do

221
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:37,208
best is to make living soil absolutely

222
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:40,000
scalable and very simple so it has to be

223
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:42,189
something very simple that every single

224
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,240
move that you do at scale becomes very

225
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:48,580
precise and totally reproducible across

226
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,580
the system so you make sure that every

227
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:54,040
single component your water your soil

228
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,350
are on point before you get started and

229
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:58,208
so that you have control and a baseline

230
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:01,330
as you move forward and you roll it out

231
00:08:58,208 --> 00:09:03,309
across across a big area and that

232
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,200
becomes that becomes something very

233
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:07,269
attainable very manageable then you have

234
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,459
labs that you look at and you're you're

235
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:11,649
watching what's going on so that before

236
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:13,329
you start seeing it in the plant you're

237
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:15,730
seeing it in the soil and you have time

238
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:18,009
to address it and that's really what

239
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,649
helps people scale and get a handle on

240
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:22,539
success and in the end so yeah it's

241
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:24,250
funny to me because I see people with a

242
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:26,549
lot of the products and certain things

243
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:29,230
and maybe biologicals and whatnot and

244
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:31,240
they're not using a soil analysis to

245
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:32,889
determine what needs to be added and so

246
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,740
after hanging out with you guys for so

247
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:38,379
long I just yeah I see a lot of waste

248
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,909
and spinning our wheels and is this the

249
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:41,799
right thing or not how do you base that

250
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:44,469
where do you get that metric or if this

251
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,179
is what I need versus what you don't

252
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,370
need people do have a habit of this is

253
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:50,049
when I throw a little dash of this you

254
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,789
know I'm end with a little of that don't

255
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:53,528
get me wrong we do have our methods to

256
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:55,179
our madness but when we're getting to

257
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:57,159
this regulated area where cost of

258
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:59,698
production is everything and you're on a

259
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:02,668
larger scale or even a small craft farm

260
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:04,769
you spend money on to put in has to

261
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:07,519
count it's gotta work it can't be a game

262
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:09,720
where oh I didn't work let's go try this

263
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,639
and so yeah

264
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,809
working with you guys and seeing what

265
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:18,720
you do it just blows me away the lack of

266
00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:21,719
use that's being put towards you know

267
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,609
resolving these things every place that

268
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,259
I go to because it's really spinning the

269
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:28,499
wheels and somebody that doesn't really

270
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:30,749
do the microbiological counting and

271
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:35,459
testing to quantify exactly what is

272
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:37,379
going on well and I think that the other

273
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:40,498
thing is that you know there's a lot of

274
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:43,139
talk that we need living soils and we

275
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:44,939
all know we want living soil but unless

276
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:47,068
you're quantifying it there's probably

277
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:49,618
something living in it but what is it is

278
00:10:47,068 --> 00:10:52,349
it pathogens that you're stimulating is

279
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:54,119
it only bacteria and what does that mean

280
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,489
so it's like bringing that knowledge

281
00:10:54,119 --> 00:10:59,129
into something tangible and useful that

282
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:01,739
that translates into yield and health

283
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:04,019
and harvest ability but you know the the

284
00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:06,660
below-ground is one thing but if you're

285
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:08,369
if you're cultivating up above and in

286
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:10,108
the atmosphere as well and looking at

287
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:12,809
that plant mass you got to have the

288
00:11:10,109 --> 00:11:14,850
right greenhouse environment or the

289
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:16,588
right above ground with the airflow and

290
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,778
the leaf temperatures and all that so

291
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:21,179
what you bring to the table is that

292
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:23,519
perfect marriage with us and the below

293
00:11:21,178 --> 00:11:25,528
ground so thank you for what you know I

294
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,239
mean it's it's worked great for both of

295
00:11:25,528 --> 00:11:31,139
us because we kind of needed each other

296
00:11:27,239 --> 00:11:32,850
we didn't really know it but it has

297
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:34,619
worked out great because I've learned a

298
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,048
lot and I've seen a lot of great results

299
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:40,109
come out of a lot of the projects that

300
00:11:37,048 --> 00:11:43,619
we've worked on together or you know on

301
00:11:40,109 --> 00:11:45,269
the side together to help people out so

302
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:48,329
I mean yeah it's been really it's been

303
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:49,980
really eye-opening for me and and going

304
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:53,608
some of the places we've been to you

305
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:55,438
know the trip to Macedonia and things in

306
00:11:53,609 --> 00:11:57,480
other countries of what's going on has

307
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:59,428
been really interesting and you know I

308
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,048
think it's really neat to go to some of

309
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:04,108
those places that are really eager and

310
00:12:01,048 --> 00:12:06,289
blossoming for living soils and to grow

311
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:08,240
you know nutrient-dense

312
00:12:06,289 --> 00:12:11,240
cannabis which are trichome dense

313
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,060
cannabis because we gotta make oil right

314
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,589
you know do we bring in native soil what

315
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:18,229
kind of inputs are people working with

316
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:19,670
what do we use and that's a variation

317
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,050
you know one of the things that we do is

318
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:23,809
we try not to stick to any specific

319
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:25,879
dogma we don't try to stick to any sort

320
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,508
of religion we just analyze what's in

321
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,220
front of us

322
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:30,949
what is the farm have and then we make

323
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:32,930
the best use of that and so you know me

324
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:34,698
personally I like to have anxiety and

325
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:36,679
lose sleep and stress about stuff so

326
00:12:34,698 --> 00:12:39,139
that's why I learned to quantify things

327
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,338
so I could send it out for a lab result

328
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:42,500
and I could look at the numbers and the

329
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:44,389
numbers don't have any emotion and I can

330
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,458
make decisions without emotion and so

331
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:48,049
you know whether the farms planting a

332
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:50,179
native soil or they're buying a

333
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:51,948
commercial soil product we still do the

334
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:53,568
mineral analysis we still do the

335
00:12:51,948 --> 00:12:56,448
biological analysis and we look at

336
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:59,208
what's in front of us and unfortunately

337
00:12:56,448 --> 00:13:01,068
for cannabis farmers is you know the

338
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:03,138
supply of soil that's coming into them

339
00:13:01,068 --> 00:13:04,789
is remarkably inconsistent and from my

340
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:07,818
mathematical standpoint really

341
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:10,009
unsuitable for the goal at hand and so

342
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:12,229
there's a massive demand across all

343
00:13:10,009 --> 00:13:13,818
states especially in Californians so

344
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:17,360
there's a legitimate supply issue with

345
00:13:13,818 --> 00:13:19,159
soils and so the variation in the

346
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,740
nutritional values of those soils are

347
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:23,809
varying widely from batch to batch to

348
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,879
batch from farm to farm to farm and so

349
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:28,729
in my opinion that's one of the greatest

350
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:30,860
benefits to permanent living soil is we

351
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:34,100
quantify our inputs we send them in for

352
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,019
testing we verify what we have we add

353
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,720
what's missing to bring it into balance

354
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:40,610
and then we just maintain it once and so

355
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,290
all these farms that are trying to do

356
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,180
this really high production organic

357
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:46,278
model and they're bringing in new soil

358
00:13:44,179 --> 00:13:48,528
each time you're bringing in a new set

359
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:51,110
of variables into the most difficult

360
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:52,938
thing you've ever had to navigate and so

361
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:55,100
you know that's one of my biggest

362
00:13:52,938 --> 00:13:57,289
advocates for living soil whether it's

363
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,930
what I care about believe about or think

364
00:13:57,289 --> 00:14:02,259
is what people should do in my opinion

365
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:05,269
it's it's the easiest way to mitigate

366
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:06,470
variation and risk moving into an area

367
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:08,929
when the profit is declining

368
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:11,209
significantly and so you know some of

369
00:14:08,929 --> 00:14:13,188
the analysis we do you know a lot of

370
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:15,409
these soils that people are producing

371
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:18,230
have potassium and salt levels that are

372
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:20,209
so high it's impossible to bring these

373
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,370
soils into what we would call balance

374
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:24,620
and these salts and these potassium

375
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,750
start to antagonize other nutrients

376
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,149
namely calcium manganese and things like

377
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,129
that and so you start to have really

378
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:34,100
really really difficult time having

379
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:36,169
plant health at this new largest scale

380
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,330
with this widest level of variability

381
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:40,459
you know and and some of these soils

382
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:42,259
that we've been relying on for all these

383
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,300
years with these brands that we become

384
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:46,279
accustomed to like you know some of them

385
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:48,559
are sending out soil that has compost

386
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:50,539
from Hurricane Katrina you know I mean

387
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,879
it's like the compost component of some

388
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:54,769
of these bagged soils are the waste and

389
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,960
debris that was being composted from

390
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:59,509
Hurricane Katrina and so we're seeing

391
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,220
like you wouldn't name it you you

392
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:02,689
wouldn't believe what's in there in some

393
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,879
of these soils and so that makes it

394
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,790
difficult for cannabis cultivators to

395
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,929
execute this task and so people scoff at

396
00:15:07,789 --> 00:15:11,120
the price a lot of time and they'll

397
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:13,339
choose like a seventy dollar municipal

398
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,070
waste soil fight pests and disease and

399
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:19,160
they'll scoff at our $300 soil but that

400
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,840
$300 soil is a forever soil and you know

401
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:22,730
every harvest through every Second

402
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,590
Harvest you got to do like twenty to

403
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,600
forty dollars worth of mineral amending

404
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,580
to each yard in the building and so the

405
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,379
savings begins to build year after year

406
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,509
after year while the quality gets better

407
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:34,549
it just becomes more predictable you

408
00:15:32,509 --> 00:15:36,769
know we just try to meet people wherever

409
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:38,659
they're at so if they if they're doing

410
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,279
indoor if they're doing greenhouse or

411
00:15:38,659 --> 00:15:42,169
doing native soil they're bringing it in

412
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:43,789
we just try to meet them wherever

413
00:15:42,169 --> 00:15:45,529
they're at and make that better and

414
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:47,719
simplify what they're doing so if

415
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:49,339
they're putting in all these inputs and

416
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,620
topdressing and all that stuff we just

417
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,570
make sure that that isn't swinging our

418
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,700
biology any one direction we're not

419
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:57,620
necessarily saying I mean sometimes we

420
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,330
will say don't use that particular

421
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,370
product but sometimes we're just saying

422
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:03,530
yes that's a good product but maybe

423
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:05,060
scale it down to a proper dose so that

424
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:07,279
when we're dealing with biology

425
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:09,319
everything becomes a food source and

426
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:11,089
we'll swing your biology and those are

427
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,750
the those are the principles that we

428
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:16,040
teach and so anything can become

429
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,659
nutrients anything can swing your

430
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:20,949
biology but but even if you're not doing

431
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:23,659
soil though just teaching people about

432
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:25,410
nutrition and spraying to heal things

433
00:16:23,659 --> 00:16:27,179
rather than kill things

434
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:28,649
and that's really what this is about is

435
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:30,989
making sure that the plants thrive

436
00:16:28,649 --> 00:16:36,299
making sure that our mindset enables

437
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:37,589
that spray for health not for war well

438
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:39,120
and that's the thing it's like you know

439
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:40,470
some of these older farmers we worked at

440
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,818
they've been growing for 20 years and

441
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,680
it's like you know they'll say stuff

442
00:16:41,818 --> 00:16:46,528
like when I first started I never would

443
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,328
have imagined preventively spraying for

444
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:50,909
pests we should didn't have mold we

445
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:54,088
didn't have pests and so now we're into

446
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:57,600
this mindset of fear of losing of crop

447
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:59,569
loss and people are basing their program

448
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,500
around spraying poisons or spraying

449
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:04,288
compounds that are designed to kill

450
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,640
things without accounting - how does

451
00:17:04,288 --> 00:17:07,259
that affect nutrition and plant

452
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,780
development one of the effects the

453
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:12,419
quality not the quality but the end

454
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:15,418
product because as you've been hearing

455
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:17,520
me rant and rave about was with the trim

456
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:19,650
procurement you know that gets made into

457
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,650
oils so we have a lot of flour and a lot

458
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:24,329
of trim that passes cat one and cat two

459
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,939
testing but when it's condensed or

460
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:28,798
concentrated into an oil that's where we

461
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:31,740
see the Detex and the failure rates

462
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:34,019
start to go up so in order to find clean

463
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:37,130
product and make sure that every step of

464
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:40,589
the way your product has viability and

465
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:42,900
value you have to find better ways

466
00:17:40,589 --> 00:17:44,908
people have to find better ways it's

467
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,350
just that's the way it's gone and now

468
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:48,270
we're going in a category three where

469
00:17:46,349 --> 00:17:50,459
the heavy metals are kicking in and I

470
00:17:48,269 --> 00:17:52,168
think that's a whole new ball game that

471
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,720
people aren't really ready for because

472
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:57,000
of the soils the compost the things that

473
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,329
you're talking about cannabis is a bio

474
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,950
accumulator or a bio remediates trying

475
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:04,740
to do its friendly job of cleaning the

476
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:06,480
air cleaning the soil and what it's

477
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,599
doing is actually picking up all this

478
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,460
stuff and causing you know detectable

479
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,009
amounts even on the flour I mean I judge

480
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,048
the flour and there was just a

481
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:18,000
detectable amounts for certain things I

482
00:18:16,048 --> 00:18:20,099
know that microbials were up so that's a

483
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,409
whole nother you know different category

484
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,839
to look at - so I mean there's a lot of

485
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:25,490
transparency of work and things that we

486
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:27,769
all need to be

487
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:30,440
to do together and unfortunately

488
00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:33,889
sometimes we're bound by MDAs and

489
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,150
certain things but there's ways around

490
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:38,090
those two to help

491
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:40,610
I think Express you know without giving

492
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:42,919
too much away here's what's going wrong

493
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:45,500
here's how to fix it and it's backed up

494
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,440
by math and also the support of a lot of

495
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,700
other people that we felt turn around

496
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,769
one of the things that we've seen in our

497
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,230
work is because a lot of our work is

498
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:55,639
analyzing crop loss and analyzing issues

499
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,730
and helping people through difficult

500
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:02,120
scenarios normally since we're kind of a

501
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:03,920
new era math I guess you could say we're

502
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:05,359
kind of an emerging market people aren't

503
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,570
really used to what we do so they don't

504
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,549
seek us out first typically and so a lot

505
00:19:08,569 --> 00:19:12,769
of times we come in after products been

506
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:16,159
confiscated destroyed for contaminants

507
00:19:12,769 --> 00:19:19,339
and after a massive crop loss has

508
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,720
happened and so what we what we found is

509
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:22,399
there's actually a lot of contamination

510
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,410
coming from other areas that we didn't

511
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,080
know about you know I'm like our food

512
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:29,090
isn't being tested every five pounds

513
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:32,029
like cannabis is in Nevada for example

514
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:33,799
and so you know Nevada had really really

515
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:36,289
really tight constraints we learned a

516
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:37,669
lot helping farmers navigate that and we

517
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:39,349
worked for several farms trying to make

518
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:42,320
it through that and what we're starting

519
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:43,399
to see is that there's contamination and

520
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,558
some of these products that we've been

521
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,120
relying on and you know the Department

522
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:49,759
of Ag from Oregon has done a fantastic

523
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,169
job at doing their own testing and

524
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,029
quantifying some of these products and

525
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,500
posting on their website and so I'd

526
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:56,539
encourage everybody to go check that out

527
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,670
and see what the Oregon Department of Ag

528
00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:00,349
is already identified and we try to

529
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:03,440
encourage people to test their own

530
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:05,149
materials you know we're starting yeah

531
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,160
everything you bring in the building and

532
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:09,440
so we're starting to see pesticide

533
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,750
contamination come in through organic

534
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,269
products like we saw with it is a

535
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,220
drachten based sprays oregon you know

536
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:18,470
all in the drift because the drift is

537
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,779
really big and what I found out working

538
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:23,839
with big AG guys in Salinas area not

539
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:26,480
cannabis one's the real AG is how drift

540
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:29,058
will actually go from town to town city

541
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,849
to city it can actually start out in one

542
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:32,710
place and

543
00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:35,319
end up in Baker's the stuff they sprayed

544
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:38,680
in Salinas yeah that story you told me

545
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:41,079
about was mind blowing so we're you know

546
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:43,029
we're starting to see a lot of issues

547
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:45,699
with contamination so one of the things

548
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:47,319
we talk about in our workshops are you

549
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,330
know testing your inputs so you don't

550
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:51,730
get a surprise fail detect that causes

551
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:53,349
you issues down the line and you know

552
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,630
we're starting to see drift issues like

553
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:57,579
you've seen a couple scenarios where the

554
00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,160
pesticides from an agricultural field

555
00:20:57,579 --> 00:21:01,689
actually somehow merged with the weather

556
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,430
system went up and over the hill and

557
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,289
caused a contaminant and they were able

558
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:07,210
to prove that which is mind-blowing you

559
00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:09,759
know and yeah and so when I'm doing the

560
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,980
trim procurement a lot of the oil I mean

561
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,779
the flour and the trim will pass but we

562
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,039
make oil and concentrate it and that's

563
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:17,440
where we see the Detex

564
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,119
so a lot of the farms I go to you when I

565
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,279
see great vineyards in the area I

566
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,379
already start to get a little worried

567
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:25,149
I've been in places where there's a lot

568
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,630
of strawberries and it actually did okay

569
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:31,060
but then again the farms know when they

570
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:34,060
sprayed I went back and did a quarantine

571
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:36,190
and that stuff had a DJ so it's really

572
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:38,889
tough being surrounded by the grapes by

573
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,990
the strawberries you know like I said

574
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:43,090
the flower and the trim will pass but a

575
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,490
lot of times you need your product to be

576
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:48,039
valuable all the way through whether

577
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,839
it's the smalls the shake maybe the

578
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:52,119
stems if you can make paper out of them

579
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:54,639
or whatever but nevertheless you know

580
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:57,099
the value starts to be diminished as

581
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,020
these contaminants float around from

582
00:21:57,099 --> 00:22:01,389
other farms and it's carried by the fog

583
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:03,460
you know the wind when you spray at the

584
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:05,200
wrong time you know not everybody pays

585
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,240
attention to the wind they're supposed

586
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,559
to spray and how these things are

587
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,079
applied according to the weather

588
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,029
patterns and yeah if they can track it

589
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:15,399
in regular AG eventually they'll be able

590
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:16,359
to track it with cannabis and because

591
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,330
cannabis

592
00:22:16,359 --> 00:22:21,308
Maira mediator and and it tries to clean

593
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:23,980
things up I mean it just sticks like a

594
00:22:21,308 --> 00:22:26,410
magnet and it's different contaminants

595
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:29,380
from farm to farm it's never just the

596
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:32,410
same one and no it's not all my club

597
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:35,170
butanol Eagle twenty shit it's all these

598
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:37,480
other words I can't pronounce and the AG

599
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:41,080
guys say oh that's found in you know you

600
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:43,929
can google them and they're found in it

601
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:46,210
you know whatever they are fungicides a

602
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:48,070
lot a lot of the fails is that one

603
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:50,110
that's a what is a surfactant and

604
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:51,970
organic fungicides or something it's

605
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:59,439
causing yeah it's causing a lot of

606
00:22:51,970 --> 00:23:01,289
problems yeah then we get into category

607
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,720
three testing with the heavy metals

608
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:06,399
microbials pop up so I mean it's just

609
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,710
gonna get a little bit more difficult as

610
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,470
we go and people have to refine their

611
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:14,319
skills each time and work with people

612
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:16,600
that can test stuff you know that's what

613
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,428
we've been about is since since our work

614
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:19,839
has come in after the car crash has

615
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:22,150
already happened we've seen how these

616
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:25,240
problems develop and you know the best

617
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,950
way to to not have a crop confiscated

618
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,230
and destroyed from contaminants or get a

619
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:31,269
very very low value that isn't conducive

620
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,069
to a profitable model like we need to do

621
00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:35,289
some predictive testing we need to test

622
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:36,700
the pesticides that we plan to use you

623
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:39,039
know we're seeing contamination in the

624
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:43,120
bottles and so there's a certain aspect

625
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:46,149
of hiding products through waste streams

626
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:48,699
I guess you could say and the solution

627
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,230
is this solution and so but that's the

628
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:54,190
thing we were kind of joking around I

629
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:55,539
was a judge for the flowers and you know

630
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:57,880
I don't know if it was me or you

631
00:23:55,539 --> 00:24:00,668
ordering the you know help helping me

632
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,830
judge you know at one point the joke was

633
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:06,340
after we tried the flower we were like

634
00:24:02,829 --> 00:24:10,019
oh this trim wouldn't pass one of the

635
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:10,019
end one of the unfortunate

636
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:19,340
I think I'm most a little sensitive

637
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:21,860
though like my job includes going into a

638
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:23,779
disaster and trying to fix it and one of

639
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:25,490
the funny things about cannabis people

640
00:24:23,779 --> 00:24:26,690
is before they start working with you

641
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:30,529
they always want you to smoke their

642
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:31,850
cannabis and which is cool but like you

643
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:34,009
know if you brought if you brought me

644
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:35,839
for an issue I'm smoking to detect and

645
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:37,819
so I've you know I've seen the look of

646
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,990
the flower I've seen the pass I've seen

647
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:41,089
the bottles on the wall

648
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:43,640
I've seen the detect and I have a

649
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:45,559
physical sensation to correlate that too

650
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,170
and so yeah I'm definitely quite

651
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:49,250
sensitive to the commonly used

652
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,710
agricultural pesticides you know what I

653
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:54,200
mean but I do gotta say the quality

654
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:57,529
though is up detect or not the entries

655
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:01,069
were super fire the personal entries the

656
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:03,379
license entries like the mix light I was

657
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:06,049
super pumped the top four was in my top

658
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:08,810
four that you helped me with and you

659
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:11,419
even helped and took notes and it was an

660
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:13,909
insane task but the entries were fire

661
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,410
and it has a lot to do with you know

662
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,600
these techniques that we talked about

663
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:19,490
and we see a lot of this through you

664
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,469
know over the course of time the mix

665
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,870
light looking like indoor everybody has

666
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:26,839
this level of I want it to look like

667
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:29,599
indoor is the same you know and how do

668
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:31,279
they are so how do they so what is the

669
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:33,379
difference like the full Sun sometimes

670
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,000
takes some weathering or has a look and

671
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:37,820
it's like why does some of these newer

672
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,500
coverings in the greenhouses start to

673
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:41,720
change that look like what's happening

674
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,670
in that space that allows that flower to

675
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,680
look more like indoor well it's mostly

676
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:48,410
how the light hits the plants these

677
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,180
microclimates you know help in some

678
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,340
cases too because i have found a couple

679
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,980
indoor grow or I mean sorry

680
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:57,259
outdoor growers that I was like how is

681
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,700
this even possible but when you get into

682
00:25:57,259 --> 00:26:01,369
the greenhouse there's many things that

683
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,930
you can do wrong rather than you know I

684
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:04,699
guess you could do right and greenhouse

685
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:06,890
becomes this global term well if I have

686
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,840
a greenhouse I'm gonna get this great

687
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:09,440
product and that's not necessarily the

688
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:11,599
case

689
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,320
and it also leads to that idea that we

690
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,839
can control everything in control

691
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:17,970
gets to be futile and costly at times

692
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,678
too so at the end of the day the

693
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:21,298
greenhouse cover is really important

694
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,149
because we can either magnify the light

695
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:26,009
or we can diffuse the light which is

696
00:26:24,148 --> 00:26:27,359
calming down the sun's intensity and

697
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:29,519
doing that with shade cloth and

698
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,288
restricts the light but a good diffused

699
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,630
cover will split the light and actually

700
00:26:31,288 --> 00:26:35,970
create more light particles and cannabis

701
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:38,250
does love a lot but doesn't love a lot

702
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:40,079
of light but it doesn't like too much

703
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:42,839
because we can scorch and burn off those

704
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:45,898
terpenes and valuable oils and

705
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:47,908
cannabinoids like CBD and so how do we

706
00:26:45,898 --> 00:26:50,548
retain those things and usually it's

707
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:52,259
with the use of good soils good airflow

708
00:26:50,548 --> 00:26:54,808
and a good greenhouse cover that

709
00:26:52,259 --> 00:26:57,329
actually does help calm down the sun's

710
00:26:54,808 --> 00:26:59,519
intensity intensity which lowers the

711
00:26:57,329 --> 00:27:01,528
leaf surface temperature and so with a

712
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,349
lower leaf surface temperature we avoid

713
00:27:01,528 --> 00:27:05,819
condensation and you know which is plant

714
00:27:04,349 --> 00:27:08,369
transpiration at the end of the day

715
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:10,888
which makes for better water usage in

716
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:13,469
living soil techniques when we use a lot

717
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:15,508
of water and we run into drying out you

718
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:17,819
know it compromises our soil structure

719
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:20,190
or quality of soil you know they call in

720
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:21,599
one of us or both of us they call me in

721
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:24,149
and then I go well now we got to call

722
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:26,878
you guys in because we fix one thing we

723
00:27:24,148 --> 00:27:28,918
got to fix the other and so at the end

724
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:31,798
of the day it just always adds to the

725
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:36,000
quality of the plant and so with less

726
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:38,970
inputs less sprays for war we have

727
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,659
better terpene cannabinoid production

728
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:45,298
and overall just you know better look

729
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:47,940
taste everything so it just starts to go

730
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:49,710
up and those levels go up and and now we

731
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:51,000
get people saying it to us they stop us

732
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:54,390
at these events you

733
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,058
I can't believe yeah and so I mean it's

734
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:59,580
not something that you know we're trying

735
00:27:57,058 --> 00:28:02,428
to sell as a product so to speak it's

736
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:04,139
just as the truth I think it's the

737
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:05,400
approach you know and we're you know

738
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,990
we're really trying to change the

739
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,909
mentality and one of the things we've

740
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:10,440
noticed in our work is you know we'll

741
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:12,750
get called into a green house that's

742
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,720
maybe a retrofit or a poorly designed

743
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:17,640
style maybe and we'll get brought in to

744
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,038
quantify why there's pockets of plant

745
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,809
health and you know our microscope work

746
00:28:20,038 --> 00:28:24,480
and our mineral analysis can certainly

747
00:28:21,808 --> 00:28:26,250
show why there's variations and there is

748
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,200
and those variations in the soil

749
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,058
absolutely lead to plant health problems

750
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,529
but then when I stand there in the

751
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:34,259
greenhouse and I look up and they're

752
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:36,960
doing some combination of pulling the

753
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:38,879
shade cloth halfway or pulling the DEP

754
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,730
curtain half way in an effort to shade

755
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:45,059
and what people aren't realizing is that

756
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:47,099
creates the most dynamic variation and

757
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:49,048
microclimate from one plant to the next

758
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:50,819
and what happens is they're using the

759
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:54,089
wrong climate screen they look the same

760
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:55,558
they similar looking and I don't know if

761
00:28:54,089 --> 00:28:57,149
the greenhouse companies pumping it

762
00:28:55,558 --> 00:28:58,649
because of cheapness but it doesn't

763
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:01,140
breathe so then what we're doing and

764
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:03,059
trying to bring relief to the plants by

765
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,009
using a climate screen or a shade cloth

766
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:07,038
that doesn't breathe we're trapping air

767
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:10,558
thus creating the greenhouse effect

768
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:13,019
again in an area that's cut off from the

769
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,849
ridge vent for ventilation and so it's

770
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:16,829
almost like two wrongs that aren't

771
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:18,750
making anything right so then we're

772
00:29:16,829 --> 00:29:21,569
opening the shade cloth to burp the

773
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:23,519
greenhouse close the blackout system to

774
00:29:21,569 --> 00:29:25,678
calm down the sun's intensity but we're

775
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,970
restricting a ton of light in the heat

776
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,500
of the day I mean it's just these

777
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:31,110
combinations and nobody's following

778
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,490
anybody or everybody's following the

779
00:29:31,109 --> 00:29:34,129
neighbor but the neighbors doing ten

780
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:37,529
different things every different run

781
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:38,520
yeah it's impossible to set standards

782
00:29:37,529 --> 00:29:41,158
with some of these things because

783
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:44,429
everybody's moving at such a fast pace

784
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:47,309
that they don't have time to ask any

785
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:48,929
questions they just go and act and you

786
00:29:47,308 --> 00:29:50,379
know maybe hire somebody that tells them

787
00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:52,509
to do this but I mean

788
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,830
I don't know I don't know who I don't

789
00:29:52,509 --> 00:29:55,720
know who it is or where they're getting

790
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:56,859
the info from well you're that guy they

791
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,829
need to bring you in and make sure you

792
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:04,209
got the right combination where do they

793
00:29:59,829 --> 00:30:07,269
find us I'm almost impossible to get

794
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:13,049
ahold of I avoid I avoid

795
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:13,049
I avoid most people I dip in the shadows

796
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:23,799
so it's cress of soil calm cressida see

797
00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:25,750
re s see I ve soil calm yeah so you can

798
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:28,930
find us there Instagram we do have a

799
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:31,240
crisp crust of soil Instagram we haven't

800
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:34,000
worked it all that much he works his own

801
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:37,769
Scott Tola granola I'm nursing the dirt

802
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,049
yeah so soil is our passion but also

803
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:43,359
this concept of nutrient-dense food and

804
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:45,220
sort of setting the bar what is it that

805
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:47,439
you know here's the interesting thing

806
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:50,289
about what humans do we get busy

807
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,900
creating something is it devastation is

808
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:55,059
it war or do we really want to thrive

809
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,250
and that's what that's what lights me up

810
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:59,200
so like let's get busy thriving looks

811
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:02,140
like you know make plants that like a

812
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,750
total new nutrient density to feed our

813
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:07,538
bodies and feed our souls

814
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:10,419
and cannabis cuz that's the bridge she

815
00:31:07,538 --> 00:31:13,538
is the bridge off pharmaceuticals folks

816
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:15,909
be bridge that's the truth
