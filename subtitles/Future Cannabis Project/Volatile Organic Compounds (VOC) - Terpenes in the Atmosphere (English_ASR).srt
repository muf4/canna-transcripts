[Music]

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,660
so we're talking volatile organic

3
00:00:09,468 --> 00:00:13,548
compounds and one thing that kind of

4
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:18,410
blew me away is every time I've ever

5
00:00:13,548 --> 00:00:20,899
thought about you know greenhouse or

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,118
indoor cultivation and having kind of

7
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:26,118
odor control systems it's always been

8
00:00:23,118 --> 00:00:27,320
about the smell like the neighbors don't

9
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:29,689
like the smell or you don't want people

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,338
to know you're growing a sense

11
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:33,320
perspective or a security perspective

12
00:00:31,338 --> 00:00:38,449
but there's actually a totally different

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:40,820
reason why you don't want the terpenes

14
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,500
floating out of your facility and into

15
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,039
the neighborhood so you talk about that

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,500
yes happy to sow terpenes are volatile

17
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,270
organic compounds volatile organic

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,969
compounds are important because they're

19
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:55,190
an ingredient to ozone and ozone

20
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,870
although it's protective in the

21
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:58,698
atmosphere when it's up high it's kind

22
00:00:56,869 --> 00:01:01,640
of acts as an insulating blanket for our

23
00:00:58,698 --> 00:01:03,500
atmosphere but down low in you know

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,209
where we're breathing the air it's

25
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,799
actually a toxic air pollutant it

26
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:09,739
oxidizes our lungs that actually

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,479
oxidizes plants as well you actually see

28
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:14,530
the plants almost like turn black and

29
00:01:11,478 --> 00:01:18,379
look bruised in a high ozone environment

30
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,700
so ozone is formed when volatile organic

31
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:21,949
compounds are released into the

32
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,259
atmosphere and react with nitrogen oxide

33
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,079
emissions nitrogen dioxide emissions are

34
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:29,118
combustion emissions cars power plants

35
00:01:27,078 --> 00:01:31,069
anytime we're burning anything we get

36
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,200
nitrogen oxide as a result so when

37
00:01:31,069 --> 00:01:35,000
nitrogen oxide and volatile organic

38
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,680
compounds meet in the presence of

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,019
sunlight they form that ground-level

40
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,130
ozone which is toxic for us to breathe

41
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:45,319
in Colorado it's it's a it's an issue

42
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:48,199
that we're looking into because all of

43
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:50,569
our cannabis cultivation is in our urban

44
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,728
environment co-located next to all of

45
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:55,459
our our major highways our cars our

46
00:01:52,728 --> 00:01:58,310
power plants about 60 to 70 percent of

47
00:01:55,459 --> 00:02:00,769
our marijuana cultivation is within our

48
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,170
urban environment and so we want to know

49
00:02:00,769 --> 00:02:05,328
how many pounds of VOCs are emitted per

50
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,609
pound of marijuana grown and then what

51
00:02:05,328 --> 00:02:10,368
is the ultimate influence on that ozone

52
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:12,560
reaction because it's a public health

53
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:13,719
issue it's toxic for us to breathe it's

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,879
toxic fire and by

55
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:17,859
and so we want to be its a heightened

56
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:19,719
and it puts a new perspective on your

57
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,250
odor control system right a heightened

58
00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:23,710
sensitivity because now you're not only

59
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,569
controlling odor for nuisance reasons or

60
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:27,070
for security reasons you're actually

61
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:28,629
contributing to the public health of

62
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:31,030
your community by controlling those

63
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:32,620
odors because of the rat secondary

64
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,419
reaction that can happen with ozone

65
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,590
formation right so just to be clear if

66
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:37,689
you're growing and somewhere like

67
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:41,229
humboldt or Mendocino or somewhere kind

68
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:43,599
of removed you're not really creating

69
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:45,280
that problem but if you're right you

70
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,159
have a big greenhouse next to the

71
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,419
highway in Santa Barbara or down in LA

72
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,560
you have an indoor grow and you're

73
00:02:49,419 --> 00:03:00,699
pumping what smells to me beautiful out

74
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:02,949
you're you know a NOx rich area and so

75
00:03:00,699 --> 00:03:05,019
when you have a NOx rich area like in an

76
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:06,609
urban environment like downtown LA

77
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:12,159
there's a smog problem you guys haven't

78
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:13,930
there industrial sources as well that

79
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,879
you know provide combustion emissions

80
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,879
and so when you bring in this new source

81
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:20,889
of volatile organic compounds that

82
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,530
traditionally wouldn't be there you get

83
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:25,659
new ozone formation I have a question

84
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,209
so terpenes are obviously found in other

85
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:29,560
products as well are they problematic

86
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:33,310
there are tours there's something about

87
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:36,729
cannabis that is especially problematic

88
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:39,400
sure so VOCs come come in many different

89
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:41,590
products anything that traditionally you

90
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,989
know has an odor with it is you're

91
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,300
smelling the volatile organic compound

92
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:48,580
coming off of that so you know personal

93
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,620
care products deodorants you know

94
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,380
perfumes and then industrial sources

95
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,659
would be like solvents and paints you

96
00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:57,479
know but any other agricultural source

97
00:03:55,659 --> 00:04:00,189
pine trees they're all putting off

98
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:02,560
different volatile organic compounds but

99
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:04,810
what's unique about cannabis is that we

100
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,689
took it from the forest and put it in

101
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,400
the the urban environment to create

102
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:11,590
those reactions and then also it just

103
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,080
happens to be that the terpene profile

104
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,660
associated with cannabis those terpenes

105
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,699
are highly reactive on the scale for our

106
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,950
ozone formation compared to other

107
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:25,009
terpenes so one of the things I feel

108
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:27,349
like Mira Singh pioneering limonene

109
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:29,449
was the other like top the top Turpin

110
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:33,550
Alina pennilyn like those are some of

111
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:37,189
the most egregious in terms of ozone and

112
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:41,210
what's the nitrogen oxide yes you can

113
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:45,579
short as NOx nos yeah so does it make

114
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:49,279
sense for a state to mandate where

115
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:53,899
terpene rich products and agriculture

116
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:56,659
are grown within the state but I mean

117
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:59,060
that's one factor you know in Colorado

118
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:02,570
we had a lot of regulatory drivers that

119
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:04,129
drove our our industry indoor and in you

120
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:06,709
know our urban environment zoned

121
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:09,230
industrial co located next to these

122
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:10,789
sources and so it just you know the

123
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,590
environmental impacts of that was a

124
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,750
little bit of an afterthought and so

125
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:17,389
we're trying to just quantify what is

126
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,250
you know what is the impact it's really

127
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:21,439
important to point out that there's no

128
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,899
regulatory drivers here because cannabis

129
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,600
is an agricultural process at least the

130
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:28,669
cultivation of it and agricultural

131
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,000
processes are exempt from air quality

132
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:35,060
regulations this is unique agricultural

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,430
process in that no other agricultural

134
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,530
commodity has the profit margins for it

135
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,629
to make sense to grow it in the way that

136
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:43,939
we grow cannabis we would never grow

137
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:46,399
tomatoes downtown next to Coors Field

138
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:49,310
you just wouldn't do it we do that with

139
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:52,399
cannabis you talked a little bit in your

140
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:57,550
panel today about how carbon filtration

141
00:05:52,399 --> 00:06:01,579
can be designed specifically to you know

142
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:04,579
to correlate with phytochemical data how

143
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:07,339
can phytochemical data collection be

144
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:10,129
standardized at state and hopefully one

145
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:13,879
day federal levels to improve that

146
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:15,829
outcome and also I hope improve consumer

147
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:18,079
outcomes as well because now they have

148
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:21,019
the ingredients available to them yes so

149
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:23,149
knowledge is very powerful once we know

150
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:25,250
the dieter Pina mission profile is

151
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:27,229
specific to these cannabis facilities we

152
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,449
can design carbon filtration that's

153
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:32,240
customized to capture those molecules

154
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:34,550
because carbon filtration is a physical

155
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,230
solution to a chemical problem the way

156
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,790
the carbon filtration works is there's a

157
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,689
lots of pores within the carbon filter

158
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,129
and

159
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,110
actually physically traps those

160
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:43,429
molecules so if those carbon pores are

161
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,899
too big or too small

162
00:06:43,428 --> 00:06:46,548
we're not effectively capturing those

163
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:48,468
molecules so we want to design the

164
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:49,548
carbon filter specifically for the

165
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:52,338
pollutants that we're trying to capture

166
00:06:49,548 --> 00:06:54,438
and so in this case those top four

167
00:06:52,338 --> 00:06:56,749
terpenes they're each physically a

168
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:58,939
specific size so you'd have a carbon

169
00:06:56,749 --> 00:07:01,819
filtration system that had pores that

170
00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:04,369
were each of those sizes so it's going

171
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:06,289
to captured yeah and it might be you

172
00:07:04,369 --> 00:07:07,849
know those four might have like they

173
00:07:06,288 --> 00:07:10,128
might be in a family where it's even a

174
00:07:07,848 --> 00:07:12,978
similar size where we're targeting that

175
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:15,019
specific molecules but and very

176
00:07:12,978 --> 00:07:17,389
different carbon filtration for plant

177
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:19,908
molecules versus you know industrial

178
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:22,309
sources of VOCs like maybe an ethanol or

179
00:07:19,908 --> 00:07:24,379
something like that right okay so now

180
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:27,588
the other interesting thing we were

181
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:30,528
talking about was the wine industry and

182
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:32,860
they're noticing kind of neuter paint

183
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:35,598
like someone makes their Cabernet in

184
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,749
Sonoma and they're noticing a new

185
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,428
terpene yeah they're cherry that wasn't

186
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:42,800
there before and they're attributing it

187
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:45,078
to cannabis cultivation yes that is

188
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,968
happening in the wine industry and

189
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:48,739
they're interested in my vo C research

190
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:50,149
from that perspective because they want

191
00:07:48,738 --> 00:07:52,128
to know what are the dominant terpenes

192
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:54,228
coming off of cannabis cultivation and

193
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:56,809
are those dominant terpenes showing up

194
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:59,389
in our final wine profile and what is

195
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:01,849
the consumer response to that do we

196
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:04,038
embrace it as you know only Santa

197
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:07,009
Barbara wine has these cannabis terpenes

198
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:08,509
in it or you know do do we fight against

199
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:10,848
the grain there and so that's something

200
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:13,848
that the wine industry is having to

201
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:16,308
adapt to you know with this this new

202
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:18,288
influx of industry being co-located next

203
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:20,599
to them but then also from the cannabis

204
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:22,428
you know farmers perspective they're

205
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:25,128
heavily regulated on what pesticides

206
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:27,438
they can use versus the wine industry is

207
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,389
not so you can see from you know the

208
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:31,669
transport cannabis is transporting

209
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:33,908
terpenes to the wine wineries and then

210
00:08:31,668 --> 00:08:38,870
the wineries are transferring you know

211
00:08:33,908 --> 00:08:40,578
pesticides to the chemicals it's really

212
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,948
interesting because the beer industry or

213
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:45,349
parts of it are embracing terpenes and

214
00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:47,778
actually putting them into him creating

215
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,009
new products that are terpene rich and

216
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:51,799
killing it

217
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:53,419
yeah yes yeah I mean I mean there's also

218
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:55,219
cannabis products to where people are

219
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:56,599
adding terpenes you know concentrated

220
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:02,329
terpenes and to get different flavor

221
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:04,639
profiles you know what is it yeah I had

222
00:09:02,328 --> 00:09:06,888
a really interesting lesson about

223
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,389
extraction or very early on because I

224
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:10,430
was naive and thought well why doesn't

225
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:12,440
everybody do co2 extraction so we don't

226
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:14,809
get those volatile organic compounds off

227
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,360
of solvents someone had to educate me

228
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:19,338
and tell me well with co2 extraction

229
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,810
you're not getting the terpene profile

230
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:22,910
extracted you're only getting the

231
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:25,099
cannabinoids so that'd be akin to like

232
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:27,889
you know drinking Everclear versus a

233
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,930
fine craft beer or a wine where you're

234
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:31,490
getting those flavor profiles so I had

235
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:33,319
to really shift my perspective to

236
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:36,500
understand the consumer needs that are

237
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:39,470
driving these processes peanut gallery

238
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,809
any other questions are you guys just so

239
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,028
overwhelmed by these details you know

240
00:09:41,809 --> 00:09:46,849
well the one thing I thought of was that

241
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:50,269
even if it's not regulated the argument

242
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:56,180
to get cultivation out of urban areas

243
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:59,269
into you know rural areas or even

244
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:03,049
farther out is a really strong one and

245
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:05,000
might counter the NIMBY a fact that is

246
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:07,009
you know really problematic in

247
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,769
California you know so many

248
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:12,110
municipalities that you know are saying

249
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:14,149
no to cannabis um if they could be

250
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:17,209
incentivized or you know they had a

251
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:20,360
really powerful reason which this is you

252
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:23,869
know these industries will if they're in

253
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,850
in if they're in your area it's it's a

254
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,889
it's a it's a it's a quality it's a

255
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:30,290
quality of life benefit you know the

256
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:32,329
environment benefits in a big way so I

257
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:33,828
mean that's one of the things that I

258
00:10:32,328 --> 00:10:37,159
thought about I don't think it could be

259
00:10:33,828 --> 00:10:40,609
regulated but it's one way or another

260
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:43,028
you know the the production and the can

261
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:47,360
you know in California the patchwork

262
00:10:43,028 --> 00:10:49,399
system is just not working so I you know

263
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,709
that was one of the I think the the

264
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,299
biggest lesson we can learn you know

265
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:56,419
collectively for the cannabis industry

266
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:58,578
from Colorado is the willingness to be

267
00:10:56,419 --> 00:11:00,500
nimble and adapt our regulatory

268
00:10:58,578 --> 00:11:01,679
structure to the needs of the cannabis

269
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,419
industry

270
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:07,079
you know very early on with us being one

271
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:08,729
of the first regulated markets we all of

272
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,800
our regulations were focused on safety

273
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:13,769
security no diversion to the black

274
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,659
market the the environment wasn't

275
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:17,519
necessarily considered in that

276
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:19,879
regulatory structure and so now that

277
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,528
we're you know a couple of years into

278
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:25,830
legalization and and the house didn't

279
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:27,929
fall down and so to speak we can start

280
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:30,420
circling back and finding efficiencies

281
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:32,669
in our regulatory structure and working

282
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:34,679
with the cannabis industry to still meet

283
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:36,329
all of the needs of safety security no

284
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:39,019
diversion to the black market but in a

285
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,490
more logical sensible way I think the

286
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:43,740
best example of that would be you know

287
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,839
either the 50/50 waste rule with plant

288
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,970
mixing half team to mix with 50 percent

289
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,860
non marijuana waste which doubles our

290
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,600
landfill footprint or you know from the

291
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,370
packaging perspective of childproof

292
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,680
packaging yes we want to protect our

293
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,810
youth but can we do it in a way that's

294
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:00,419
not five layers of packaging could we

295
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:03,409
manage to do it in one and then I always

296
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:06,539
you don't need a packaged flower well I

297
00:12:03,409 --> 00:12:07,980
I also like to throw it out there from

298
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:09,750
an environmental perspective now the

299
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,070
public health side of the house doesn't

300
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,830
like this perspective but from an

301
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:16,110
environmental perspective we don't do

302
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:19,680
childproof packaging on alcohol or

303
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:21,720
tobacco why cannabis or keeping it in

304
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,899
the family and you know focusing our

305
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:27,720
efforts on creating hemp cellulose

306
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:29,909
packaging that is far more sustainable

307
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,129
yeah we're starting to see advances and

308
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:35,009
hemp-based plastics certainly in

309
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:37,679
Colorado and they they do have they

310
00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:39,929
break down a lot quicker than plastics

311
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,639
traditional plastics well and I talked

312
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:43,739
to brands that are kind of making these

313
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:46,259
packaging decisions because it costs

314
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:49,528
more so it's kind of like does the

315
00:12:46,259 --> 00:12:52,139
consumer care enough to pay a tiny bit

316
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:58,230
more you know that's the question right

317
00:12:52,139 --> 00:13:01,470
now at least so before you go is there

318
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:03,389
research on your next well no she I'm

319
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,820
joking yeah it's 520 so she has to go

320
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:08,519
but is there research being done to

321
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:12,570
assess like what like what the impact is

322
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:14,429
of these terpene VOCs like what are they

323
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:17,640
how much they

324
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:20,459
like the amount actually yeah I'm doing

325
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:22,379
that research yeah so I am collecting

326
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:25,889
air quality samples from commercial

327
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:28,950
cannabis cultivation facilities getting

328
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:31,139
speciation results what are the terpenes

329
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:33,089
being emitted and in what concentrations

330
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:35,309
and then we will be putting that into

331
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:36,899
very sophisticated air quality models

332
00:13:35,309 --> 00:13:39,239
that already know what are the sources

333
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:41,250
of of nitrogen oxide what are all the

334
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,159
other sources of volatile organic

335
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:46,320
compounds and put that all together add

336
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,480
the layer of cannabis emissions what's

337
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,330
the resulting impact on ozone this is a

338
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,649
very complicated scientific process and

339
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,020
you're in the earliest stages of this

340
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:57,839
research um well we actually we hope to

341
00:13:55,019 --> 00:14:01,708
publish the results this summer so so

342
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,360
we're we're pretty far along but this

343
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:06,000
summer hopefully initial findings are

344
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,339
like oh the biggest thing that I can can

345
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,139
share at this point is just the the

346
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:13,290
dominant terpene emission profile that

347
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:15,269
we're seeing is you know mersin pining

348
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:17,490
limiting and Turpin alene I mean those

349
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:19,588
are by far the dominant terpenes that

350
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,299
we're seeing we're we're definitely

351
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:23,790
seeing a whole family of other terpenes

352
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:25,229
but at much much lower concentrations

353
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:26,219
those are the dominant ones that we're

354
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,440
seeing and I think that's really

355
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,850
important information to know because

356
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,620
now we know what we're controlling right

357
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,480
we don't know the concentrations yet but

358
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:35,669
we know what we're controlling at least

359
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,250
so at the end of this you'll have a

360
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:41,549
sense of say in Denver here's how much

361
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:43,528
ozone is being emitted as a result of

362
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:46,169
these practices correct

363
00:14:43,528 --> 00:14:47,700
awesome that should be the results of

364
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:50,610
that should be super interesting and

365
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:53,550
should have an impact yes absolutely um

366
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:56,220
you know in Colorado we're using it as

367
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:57,778
an educational piece you know we want to

368
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,639
know we want to understand where our

369
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:01,578
ozone is coming from and all this

370
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:05,490
building block information absolutely

371
00:15:01,578 --> 00:15:09,088
and it will have impacts nationwide and

372
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:11,959
across the globe for sure thank you yes

373
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:11,959
thank you for having
