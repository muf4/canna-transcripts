1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,609
Matt cumin you represent a new client

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:08,280
that was a licensed transporter that I

3
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:11,359
had $230,000 seized by the Department of

4
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:14,250
Homeland Security this is the first

5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,410
seized by the CHP had turned over to the

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,960
Department of Homeland Security since

7
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,359
this technically is the first shot

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,939
across the bow against the license

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,910
industry by the federal government I am

10
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,859
curious does that licensed operator owed

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,839
taxes on that money or are we gonna wait

12
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,399
until a settlement is reached before

13
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:36,869
that's determined hell if I know

14
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,640
you know first of all that

15
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:40,349
should I take two minutes to tell the

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:46,739
story or do you want to hear about

17
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:49,140
what's going on this this is a great

18
00:00:46,738 --> 00:00:51,718
case that we're going to use to smash

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,909
open the contradictions so keep

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:58,859
following it support us

21
00:00:53,909 --> 00:01:01,019
the CHP did stop my clients first for a

22
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,629
mudflap violation on their pickup truck

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,820
then let him go and then they followed

24
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:09,780
him up the road stopped him again

25
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:12,449
because it turned out that the CHP had

26
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:15,359
it in for my clients who had both been

27
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,840
in the CHP and had left the CHP one of

28
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:21,209
the clients had been fired from the CHP

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,009
he got reinstated and then he resigned

30
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:25,500
the other one was accused of stealing

31
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,269
from a locker room at the CHP he was

32
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,578
actually charged criminally and the jury

33
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:32,090
did not find him guilty and he is

34
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:34,289
therefore innocent but the CHP

35
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,579
terminated him for insubordination

36
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,740
because he wouldn't tell them what

37
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:40,078
happened upon his advice of his lawyer

38
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:42,060
during that criminal proceeding so he

39
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:44,219
was fired for insubordination those are

40
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,618
my guys so when you hear all the press

41
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,298
stuff about how dirty my guys are just

42
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:50,609
remember that these were guys who were

43
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,280
just doing their job and neither of them

44
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:56,728
you know were I mean there was a real

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,649
story behind who they were what happened

46
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:01,618
was once they were stopped on the second

47
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:05,159
stop they were treated like animals by

48
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:10,259
the CHP officers they were taken to the

49
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:12,209
Merced CHP station the CHP called

50
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,229
the Fresno office of the United States

51
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,930
citizens

52
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:18,179
ship and Immigration Services had an

53
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,569
officer from that office in Fresno come

54
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,290
up to Merced and take the $230,000 into

55
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,750
custody

56
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:26,310
this was a clear workaround to the Royal

57
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,530
barque or bloom and our amendment for

58
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:32,128
those who don't know federal law that

59
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:35,098
prohibits the Department of Justice from

60
00:02:32,128 --> 00:02:37,348
spending money on cannabis interdiction

61
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:39,179
in medical cannabis states that

62
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:42,179
Department the Department of Homeland

63
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,069
Security has a separate budget so isn't

64
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,939
that tricky the federal government has

65
00:02:44,068 --> 00:02:49,889
shown us what they're doing now when the

66
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:52,049
when we challenge and I just will be

67
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:53,159
filing forfeiture administrative claims

68
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:54,480
and so forth and we're gonna be

69
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:56,219
challenging that in federal court in the

70
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,598
Eastern District when the Eastern

71
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,979
District forfeiture attorney for the

72
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,750
United States Attorney walks in the

73
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,848
courtroom guess when I'm gonna tell the

74
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,500
judge he can't be here because your

75
00:03:02,848 --> 00:03:07,139
budget his budget doesn't allow him to

76
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,299
be here so I've spoken to a couple of

77
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:10,949
other attorneys notably Eric Shevin I

78
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:12,689
haven't gotten a lot of details from him

79
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:15,149
but we know this is a trend they're

80
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:17,430
gonna take the money and give it to DHS

81
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,099
as a workaround around Rohrbacher blumen

82
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:23,219
our that should really really make

83
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:25,530
everybody stand up and shout and I hope

84
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:27,239
everybody will do that and that's the

85
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,400
basic story we're gonna be filing all

86
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,349
sorts of actions I'm already talking to

87
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,269
you know clients around the state we're

88
00:03:31,348 --> 00:03:35,608
gonna mark Wasserman and his brother

89
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:39,000
Craig where are you guys raise your

90
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:41,310
hands my co-counsel we're going to be

91
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,959
creating a huge stir about this we're

92
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:44,430
gonna be getting attorneys I want to get

93
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,439
an attorney from every county in the

94
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,419
state to be on the pleadings we're gonna

95
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:52,709
get a class-action injunction against

96
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:54,780
the CHP and then oh yeah and then when

97
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,299
we're then when this thing is revealed

98
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,549
for its absurdity then the Legislature

99
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,609
will hopefully fix this because this is

100
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:04,980
all about a legislative fix the courts

101
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:07,680
are gonna just follow the law call balls

102
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,659
and strikes you know and so forth

103
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,430
they're not going to give us anything

104
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:13,500
they really haven't and they they don't

105
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,168
plan on it that's not where you go it's

106
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,038
in the legislative arena so that's

107
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:19,889
what's gonna happen

108
00:04:17,038 --> 00:04:21,870
keep-keep wallet follow us there's gonna

109
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:26,150
be lots of stories about this don't

110
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,149
believe a goddamn word the CHP is saying
