1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,109
[Music]

2
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:10,469
we got all kinds of stuff we're doing a

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,699
collaboration actually that's cold

4
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:12,928
Adam and I have the demo out

5
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:15,359
collaboration and that's going through

6
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:20,820
seeds here now in the very future

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:22,350
basically we have all the probably start

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,129
off with explaining who we are

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,130
yeah let's do that

10
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:33,149
obviously everybody knows right but

11
00:00:31,379 --> 00:00:34,589
let's start with you first yeah so my

12
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,679
name is James loud I've been breeding

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,410
for over ten years I've been with

14
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,269
working with the plant for over 25 years

15
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:47,459
I started a company called loud seeds in

16
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:49,649
the Netherlands and in Spain in 2013 I'm

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,469
writing a book on breeding and currently

18
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:56,489
I'm reading everything regs films auto

19
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,800
flower genetics and I'm working on a

20
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:00,390
whole bunch of different projects

21
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:02,069
stabilizing genetics for the longest

22
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,500
time I was bringing a lot of F ones like

23
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,959
everybody because the demand and now I'm

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,790
kind of gearing towards AG product that

25
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:14,280
can be sold to big AG and so my name is

26
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,840
Adam Dunn and I've been growing since

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:23,909
around 93 sort of seriously and that was

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,560
in Amsterdam I've you know I started to

29
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,770
seek company back when I when it was

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,100
more of a because I wanted to bring

31
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:33,750
American genetics to Europe that was

32
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:37,048
kind of my goal at the time because I

33
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,359
felt it was a little stagnant and you

34
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:42,150
know lo and behold here we are 25 years

35
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:45,149
later and it's like the Europeans are

36
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,759
looking towards America again because of

37
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,640
the you know I feel like the heart and

38
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,950
soul of cannabis is sort of here here in

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,618
California here in America where I live

40
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,600
in Colorado there's no spots all over

41
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:58,828
the states but the the passion has

42
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:01,500
always been here so I've kind of

43
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:03,089
followed that like again like when I

44
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,069
went to Amsterdam I was 19 years old

45
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,409
didn't realize I was gonna be working

46
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:09,538
for sensi seeds which I did for about

47
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:11,520
three years and then start my own seed

48
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:13,859
company and it was all based on just

49
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,900
seeing that the all the customers were

50
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,060
and also here I am an American living in

51
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,490
Amsterdam and every guy who walks

52
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,219
through the door is a you know living in

53
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,900
some small town and got some seats from

54
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:26,729
Neville a few years ago and now they

55
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,039
came back and Neville is nowhere to be

56
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:31,319
found and we filled the void you know

57
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:35,549
and so it's kind of like those special

58
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:36,930
times make it easy now to kind of you

59
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,360
know interject into the into the

60
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,830
industry as far as it's all cycles you

61
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,700
know if you're a grower you realize that

62
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:48,750
you know five years ago you know people

63
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:50,609
had a different taste and right now the

64
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,349
gaps are getting kind of tighter and

65
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,880
tighter because less people know what's

66
00:02:52,349 --> 00:02:54,900
going on so it's good to be onstage and

67
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,879
hanging out with these guys and that

68
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,390
James back in Amsterdam when he came

69
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,219
over there he was also like another wave

70
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:03,989
because it's like every few years a new

71
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:04,919
wave of American Burton Grover's goes

72
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,900
over there and they all have the same

73
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,569
sort of thing where they see it because

74
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,510
it's like a sea of genetics over there

75
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:14,359
and you kind of get lost in the shuffle

76
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:18,299
so we're here to kind of clear that up

77
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,610
cool I'm James bean I'm CEO of sea cheer

78
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,620
now calm I ran what I believed to be the

79
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:26,940
largest banks in those states if not

80
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:29,730
that world I work with 52 breeders I'm a

81
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:30,750
breeder hunter if you will one thing

82
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:33,090
about working with all these different

83
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,530
breeders is all wood all the breeders

84
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,599
that work with all work with a different

85
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,759
male as far as I'm concerned that's the

86
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:41,159
only way to really separate who's doing

87
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,870
work who's not doing work for instance

88
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,859
if you bred with an MK ULTRA across it

89
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:46,259
with the coast out cookie

90
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,940
I really can't represent that like you

91
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,669
didn't do any work here you took

92
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:53,579
somebody else's cookie who will say st.

93
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:57,958
George st. George did the cookie I

94
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,070
believe 60 miles is cooking it took them

95
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,530
kale check cross to put them together

96
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:02,609
and they you know mkay cookies I don't

97
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,180
want to represent that you know this

98
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,799
guy's not getting paid off of it

99
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,599
why won't I represent the guy who did

100
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,239
the thing through the first place a lot

101
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:13,000
of the old-timers and so I have to do a

102
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,378
lot of sleuthing if you will to figure

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,810
out the history of things and make sure

104
00:04:14,378 --> 00:04:19,329
the stories all collide and they surely

105
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:22,329
all make sense but it's been my thing

106
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:24,220
and I've worked with 52 All American

107
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:28,508
breeders right now so we happy about

108
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:30,669
that yeah just just to add on breeding

109
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:32,830
with males you know I feel like the

110
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:34,599
second you sell seeds sold lots of

111
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:36,490
different varieties over the years and

112
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,770
the second use of those seeds if you

113
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,720
have males and they're I'm totally happy

114
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:43,389
with people using my males but I feel

115
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,590
like there's integrity involved if

116
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:46,210
you're gonna use them to start a seed

117
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:48,429
line that's different than if you're

118
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:51,219
using them to create other strains if

119
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:53,650
you know it's again is this sort of like

120
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,910
it comes down to you can do whatever you

121
00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:56,739
want with it but the minute you start

122
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:58,539
making money it starts to become a

123
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,889
little bit tense because it's very much

124
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:02,019
like music I always try to put it out

125
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:04,240
like that like like look we we create

126
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:05,769
something that's a sort of a vibe and

127
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,269
it's a thing but it's actually a you

128
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:09,698
know it's work behind it so like if you

129
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:12,879
I give you some seed if I sell you seed

130
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:14,770
yes you own it to a point but I feel

131
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,300
like when you start to make seeds from

132
00:05:14,769 --> 00:05:18,430
those seeds and sell those see

133
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,550
self-preservation of not trying to

134
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:24,430
either have to either just work with the

135
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,259
person and get their kind of blessing

136
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:27,759
you don't have to but it feels like it

137
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:31,240
gives a better vibe to the whole

138
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,560
situation and you know and it'd be great

139
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,930
if they kicked down but that doesn't

140
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,000
ever happen I'm like I could be living

141
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,769
off bubblegum for the rest of my life

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,658
just on the amount of people that have

143
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:42,879
used it in crosses but I've never seen a

144
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:44,348
dime you know I talked to bog about it

145
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,399
at one point and he didn't even know

146
00:05:44,348 --> 00:05:47,469
where it came from and I was kind of

147
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:49,269
like well you do realize that the guy

148
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,789
that you got it from got it from me and

149
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:53,168
that still doesn't you know you know it

150
00:05:51,788 --> 00:05:55,478
wasn't that long ago it was a couple

151
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:57,219
years ago and he had no clue but it's

152
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:58,800
you know at the end of the day I think

153
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,270
if you work with other people's stuff

154
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,478
it's nice to have some arrangement

155
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:06,399
whether it be verbal you know we're just

156
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,728
doing a collab like we're doing with the

157
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:12,370
done loud series is he selected a sage

158
00:06:09,728 --> 00:06:13,240
and sour male around three out of five

159
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,269
hundred right

160
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,009
yes dead water 50 males 50 there's 50

161
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:20,049
males that I selected from over from the

162
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:21,689
Tony sees the tunnel seeds I had 50

163
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,550
males and then I went in and I took

164
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:26,829
males that represented like oh gee cush

165
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,660
that were more shorter I took something

166
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:29,918
that were more on that Hayes side and

167
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,039
then there was one that was really

168
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:35,799
sourish when his stem Robin so I figured

169
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,750
using that cuz breeding F ones the more

170
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,879
variety you have the more diversity you

171
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,709
have the more options you'll have to

172
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:42,430
select from you know from the progeny

173
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:47,158
mm-hmm

174
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:49,598
yeah and something that was about your

175
00:06:47,158 --> 00:06:51,189
as you told me yeah I harvested the

176
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,649
seeds over a year ago and they're just

177
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:54,788
you've been tested they're about to go

178
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:56,258
online here shortly

179
00:06:54,788 --> 00:06:57,759
right and so it was one of those like

180
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:00,819
yeah sure you know that's the whole

181
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:04,439
point of putting out regular seeds

182
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:07,509
because III saw the market change and

183
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:09,579
you know it really threw the idea for

184
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:13,419
feminized seeds in Halle which works you

185
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:14,740
know totally started their Dutch passion

186
00:07:13,418 --> 00:07:17,620
seed company was kind of the first guy

187
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,389
who really put it out commercially and I

188
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,069
don't know just somehow right out of the

189
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:25,329
gate I just didn't like it like I was

190
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:27,519
really against the idea of sort of

191
00:07:25,329 --> 00:07:29,258
pigeon holing your work or kind of like

192
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,448
giving it a dead end it felt like

193
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:35,639
because if everybody starts to work with

194
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:38,319
only feminized and this is also you know

195
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,788
in a place where everything's about

196
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,759
money and all and right everybody's just

197
00:07:39,788 --> 00:07:44,139
money money money and the Dutch are

198
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,030
notoriously lazy and the Spanish are

199
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:47,918
notoriously lazy growers none of them

200
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:49,929
want to do selection they just want it

201
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,689
to work right they don't want to they

202
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:55,209
don't like F ones they don't like things

203
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:57,250
that are have any kind of variables but

204
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,788
in a way like I feel like when you buy

205
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,029
seeds

206
00:07:57,788 --> 00:08:02,500
whether it's f1 and a lot of times f1 is

207
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:04,478
where all the magics happening anyway so

208
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,370
you're actually doing better than

209
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:08,649
letting a guy screw it all up and get it

210
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:12,098
to like f3 and have terrible selections

211
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:14,228
and just somehow miss the mark and now

212
00:08:12,098 --> 00:08:15,668
you're the victim of their terrible

213
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:18,339
selection you know what I mean where as

214
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:20,740
with f1 it's like you have to if it's a

215
00:08:18,339 --> 00:08:23,619
true f1 which is almost impossible these

216
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:26,228
days because whether or not you know it

217
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,050
most stuff is interrelated in some way

218
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:28,728
shape or form and

219
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:30,370
closer to videos think a lot of times

220
00:08:28,728 --> 00:08:33,740
where you're like oh actually those are

221
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,209
cousins laser cousins and so what do you

222
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,000
think is gonna happen is you're gonna

223
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:39,918
end up you know you always have shiny

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,288
examples in the trailer park right but

225
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,759
it doesn't mean that that the genetics

226
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,500
are strong right so it's like one of

227
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,419
those situations where you're gonna have

228
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,708
one or two pop up wow this is beautiful

229
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:50,419
but if you're looking for stability

230
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:52,639
that's when you really want to run down

231
00:08:50,419 --> 00:08:54,259
the line and get it 2 F 2 F 3 F 4 and

232
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,569
the thing is the problem is we don't

233
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:58,069
actually want that you know or an

234
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,270
industry that wants that because once

235
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,770
you're in agriculture they don't want to

236
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:01,730
have any variables right they want it to

237
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:04,220
be exactly the same

238
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,200
yeah but the biggest problem that we're

239
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,970
running into like stabilizing stuff to

240
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,459
an f7 and that's where you take it back

241
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:12,050
cross it with an inbred line to 7

242
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:15,319
generations where you can stabilize it

243
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:17,240
is a heterosis the black of vigor so you

244
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,860
have this lack of vigor now you either

245
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,389
need to breed parallel lines and cross

246
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,850
those together or you need to back cross

247
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:25,250
it to the original f1 and that thing is

248
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:26,509
is with that you want to breed when

249
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,828
you're breeding that inbred line you

250
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:30,139
want to breathe stuff that's very

251
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:31,939
similar so you have less Fino typical

252
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:35,899
variation when you make that back cross

253
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,260
but again like I think a lot of us you

254
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:41,000
know unless you are growing on a scale

255
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:42,289
and that with a price point that's so

256
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,639
important and you can't have any

257
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:46,549
variables if you want to grow that way

258
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:48,078
yeah sure but for the average guy and

259
00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:49,759
especially for what you're gonna get

260
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:52,429
when you get a selection of seeds that

261
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:56,000
still have that hybrid vigor based on

262
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:57,169
the fact that there's still some there's

263
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,149
there's like an actual you know

264
00:09:57,169 --> 00:10:01,039
hopefully they're not too interrelated

265
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:03,078
but at the same time even with that you

266
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,208
can sometimes get you know shining

267
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:06,649
examples coming out and really I think a

268
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:08,449
lot of times now it's separating

269
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:10,190
yourself from all their other guys and

270
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:13,070
people finally got to the point where

271
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,510
you know they've seen these clone onlys

272
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,060
that have been around for 20 plus years

273
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:18,289
sometimes they're more trouble than

274
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:20,689
they're worth you know that man because

275
00:10:18,289 --> 00:10:24,289
of the other day maybe they have viruses

276
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:26,720
or problems and and or they're just you

277
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:28,939
know been worked way too hard so it's

278
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,190
like sometimes nice when you see a whole

279
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:33,200
tray of new fresh genetics and then

280
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,850
that's like literally again where the

281
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,589
magic is happening and then it comes

282
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,778
strictly down to the selection and

283
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:40,279
that's where people can either make or

284
00:10:38,778 --> 00:10:46,559
break

285
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:47,789
yeah yeah yeah yeah welcome to the gun

286
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,198
show

287
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:52,078
well you know and it's really

288
00:10:49,198 --> 00:10:53,549
interesting because I see a lot of work

289
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,649
being done by a lot of breeders out

290
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:58,139
there and I I don't see a lot of novel

291
00:10:55,649 --> 00:10:59,429
genetics coming out I think one of the

292
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:02,278
things that's kind of sticking this up

293
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:04,318
right now is people are buying based on

294
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:05,490
THC levels and dispensaries especially

295
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:07,679
on the rec market because they go

296
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,629
industries are buying on sea levels yeah

297
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,919
so the first thing they do is they go in

298
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:14,338
and they're gonna buy the highest THC

299
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:17,039
and well you know I understand that but

300
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:20,519
that we've smoked a lot of different

301
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:22,078
cultivars different strains that are 14%

302
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:24,600
like Sour Diesel that'll knock your

303
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,388
knock your socks off compared to some of

304
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,129
those that tested 30% well yeah and it's

305
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:30,810
really down to like I mean how many

306
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:33,480
times have you gone to some place and

307
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:34,768
had got some really shitty looking weed

308
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,778
that you were like this is definitely

309
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:38,429
not gonna get me high and then somehow

310
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:40,679
you're like in your hotel room all

311
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:41,729
fucking cool oh dude I don't know then

312
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,559
we got that high and I've been smoking

313
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,420
all this candy and all these all their

314
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,439
strains but you're just so used to that

315
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:48,599
you know what I mean like in just

316
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,459
tickling those other spots it doesn't

317
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,750
maybe last very long after the second

318
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,969
drug or like I don't know how that did

319
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,039
it but it fucking it got a super big do

320
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:58,379
those green eye crack and that could be

321
00:11:56,039 --> 00:12:00,149
like a nine percent or it's you know

322
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:01,889
super low even lower but it's just

323
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:04,889
because it's the right Pro you know can

324
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:07,470
cannabinoid profile at that point for

325
00:12:04,889 --> 00:12:08,940
you yeah and changeably methyl is good

326
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:10,980
it's funny because some of the shittiest

327
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,899
looking weed back in the day was the

328
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,000
best we had cat piss that was one of my

329
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,220
all-time favorite strains still is and

330
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,750
I've been seeing it in 20 years the real

331
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,040
cat piss and you know we've been I've

332
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,350
been talking to people I talked to JJ

333
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:23,938
when we're at lunch a couple weeks ago

334
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,800
and he was saying it's probably from an

335
00:12:23,938 --> 00:12:28,230
a5 lineage well I was told originally

336
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,299
was nl5 Hayes cross but that really

337
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:33,389
doesn't make sense with that but that

338
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:36,469
strain was lost 20 years ago at the big

339
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:38,730
gunfight in California with AJ's and

340
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,709
nerves well you know yeah that's gonna

341
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,120
say like the the victim of your own

342
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,708
success was probably the biggest problem

343
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,409
back in the day is at all like

344
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:47,818
everyone's always like looking you know

345
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:49,919
where's that old skunk and where is that

346
00:12:47,818 --> 00:12:51,809
old skunk and it's like the reality is

347
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,849
it's because those old skunk smelled

348
00:12:51,809 --> 00:12:54,619
like fucking skunk

349
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,449
they got people arrested and you know

350
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,399
they're walking to their local shop and

351
00:12:56,448 --> 00:12:59,750
they're stink like a skunk and they tell

352
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,490
the cop and the cop would you know

353
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,839
follow over to their house whatever all

354
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:04,698
those people got caught and that's why

355
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,740
like there was a point in time where you

356
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:09,049
know people would come to Holland didn't

357
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,818
ask you like do you have anything that

358
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:13,909
doesn't have any smell to it you know it

359
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:17,028
may be like you know there's things that

360
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:18,828
don't have a lot of smell but that's

361
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:20,659
usually an indicator of good weed right

362
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:21,979
but it's also the fact that that's the

363
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:23,659
reason why a lot of people find lost

364
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,089
those and then the cactus had that

365
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:28,610
lingering fucking 1/10 of a gram would

366
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:33,440
make your whole house smell yeah the

367
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:36,980
premotor filter days yeah well that was

368
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,829
like from the early 90s maybe 93 to 2001

369
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:44,569
and it smelled they had this strong

370
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:47,149
ammonia smell with skunk and it was like

371
00:13:44,568 --> 00:13:49,729
that's it was after that dry no it was

372
00:13:47,149 --> 00:13:51,589
after it dried and it like some of those

373
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:54,350
like the a5 haze has that it's that

374
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:56,480
really it's accurate almost it's like it

375
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:57,920
burns your nose and then with a skunk

376
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,569
along with it it would just like

377
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,500
literally a tenth of a gram if you had

378
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:02,629
it in your shirt pocket

379
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:06,438
you'd be looking for the bud like for

380
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:07,429
four hours and that's it's been gone for

381
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:09,110
a long time but a lot of those old

382
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,958
school smells I mean I think they've

383
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,068
evolved but I haven't seen a handful of

384
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,479
them in many years I think the other

385
00:14:13,068 --> 00:14:16,188
funny thing too is that we're like back

386
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,149
in the day everybody was drying in these

387
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:21,980
like dank little nasty spots and growing

388
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:23,929
and drying in the same room all the time

389
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,519
because that's all they had and it was

390
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:27,948
like the only place that ventilation was

391
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,328
the grow room so you just dried it in

392
00:14:27,948 --> 00:14:31,549
the grill room and they'd still have the

393
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:32,989
pots in the corner and the things kind

394
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:34,938
of breathe there's some decomposing

395
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,560
going on and it would all end up in the

396
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:39,250
bud too because you know how it was he'd

397
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,448
be like kind of smells like a basement

398
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,159
and I think that was the thing about

399
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:44,659
that particular we did it never really

400
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:46,458
dried very good it wasn't a very easy

401
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:49,549
drying like thing it was very leafy

402
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:51,469
right and very but but it had that very

403
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:53,929
heavy oil coat on it so like you know

404
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:59,060
the oil air but which is not dry

405
00:14:53,929 --> 00:15:02,088
particularly it was greasy yeah and so I

406
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:03,229
think a lot of those strains I mean it's

407
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:04,130
funny because the ones that are the most

408
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,870
difficult

409
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:08,088
back in the day at that moment they were

410
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,860
kind of difficult to grow and not very

411
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:10,819
great yielding and the only reason you

412
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,818
kept it around this because of that

413
00:15:10,818 --> 00:15:16,189
particular function and you know that's

414
00:15:13,818 --> 00:15:17,929
a lot to do with I think the success and

415
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,360
failure of a lot of strains because

416
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:23,659
people now or so not only is the THC but

417
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,449
you know as a grower when you have to

418
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:29,509
grow a plant that's needs support by 15

419
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:32,088
Stakes or it just grows like a soldier

420
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:33,860
you know theoretically doing way better

421
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:35,839
if you grow and that's why strains like

422
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,789
yeah like blue dream become popular

423
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,170
because it's like yeah believe it you

424
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:40,278
could pretty much shit in the reservoir

425
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:46,189
and then you'll yield at least two

426
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:48,259
pounds I hate sort of lesson well I

427
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:49,579
think the the success of blue gem is

428
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:51,139
based on the fact that it's stored

429
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:52,729
really well compared to other we'd like

430
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:54,980
there's a lot of strains that are great

431
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,629
when you first harvest them and though

432
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,579
if you're lucky enough to be that guy

433
00:15:56,629 --> 00:16:00,259
who's that you know got it within a

434
00:15:58,578 --> 00:16:02,239
certain time frame it's still got that

435
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:05,329
pop to it but then after a little while

436
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,829
it dies off and blue dreams the opposite

437
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:08,809
where if you store that shit and sit on

438
00:16:06,828 --> 00:16:10,219
her for a year or two years and pop it

439
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:11,809
out it's like that actually still smells

440
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:14,360
pretty good like it always gets better

441
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:16,429
yeah it's better exactly so age is

442
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,620
really well I mean so that that was that

443
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:21,938
was a bonus yeah like so limonene I

444
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:25,100
believe limonene makes the weed

445
00:16:21,938 --> 00:16:27,828
deteriorated definitely like shortens

446
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,959
the time well this is a story that I was

447
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:33,649
told by somebody in this room so maybe

448
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:35,750
he can confirm if it's true but back in

449
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:39,350
the day when they would put rubber bands

450
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:42,620
around bags of haze it would eat through

451
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:47,028
the rubber band is that true mysterious

452
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:48,919
man in the back yeah mon-sol so the fact

453
00:16:47,028 --> 00:16:50,929
that it would eat through rubber bands

454
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:52,849
kind of tells you that it's got a

455
00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:54,438
different sort of reaction than other

456
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,028
sort of because he could put that same

457
00:16:54,438 --> 00:16:57,500
rubber band around some other plan and

458
00:16:56,028 --> 00:17:02,360
nothing would happen to it so there's

459
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:04,308
something going on there yeah and no no

460
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,788
around a bag of weed so it's just like

461
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:09,588
like literally through everything man it

462
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:11,328
was just like it's like enter the tops

463
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:14,029
of the seals of the things right on the

464
00:17:11,328 --> 00:17:15,318
tops of the mason jars and stuff they

465
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:16,799
would get sore to eat up so you can

466
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:18,629
imagine that there's some

467
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,879
a reaction without anything happening

468
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,470
going on there and that means shits

469
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,420
working on your brain probably

470
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:31,650
something's going down by day I digress

471
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:33,600
yeah so as far as like we can definitely

472
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:36,030
talk about Europe and how they kind of

473
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,699
homogenized all the strains and and also

474
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:44,490
oh yeah anything was evil people

475
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:48,180
invented cheese no I mean the thing is

476
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:50,819
it was really like it goes in cannabis

477
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,500
has these waves and like things don't

478
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,939
change for say six or seven years

479
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,230
sometimes in these little waves and then

480
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,799
all of a sudden there's a massive change

481
00:17:55,230 --> 00:18:00,569
and and it's usually based on just

482
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,609
exposure from wherever like and so

483
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:05,730
Holland had that thing where you know

484
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:07,709
those those people that brought genetics

485
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,809
there in the beginning you know blew

486
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:11,430
people's minds because they were trying

487
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:13,319
to grow a bunch literally of like bird

488
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:15,090
seed and shit they were not they were

489
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:17,460
not doing their selection you know and

490
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:20,579
all of a sudden it took the outsiders to

491
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,740
come there wake him up you know and and

492
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:23,789
the problem is a day they also had a

493
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,930
business running right they had a

494
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:27,480
business model that they're trying to

495
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,640
keep going that was totally illegal yet

496
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,460
illegal but whatever and so at the end

497
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,930
of the day now the people here figure

498
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,670
out that that's actually really hard

499
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,350
when you have customers coming in every

500
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,210
single day demanding the same quality

501
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:41,189
we'd like which as you know as a grower

502
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,690
it's really hard to deliver year-round

503
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,360
and stuff and so I think that they were

504
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:47,070
the first ones to take that model and

505
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,549
try to work with it and so from a

506
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:53,250
breeders point of view I feel like they

507
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:56,069
did a great job of keeping it alive for

508
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:57,539
everybody sure on a creative side they

509
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:59,220
just didn't quite have that creative

510
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,659
thing go and they were didn't care about

511
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,860
weed that's the problem all the people I

512
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,300
cared about weed there were Americans

513
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:03,809
they were when they were breeding for

514
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:07,889
different things

515
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:09,569
breeding in Europe I feel like the the

516
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:12,960
traits they were breeding for was vigor

517
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:14,339
and yield course and smell and not

518
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,049
really smell because look what happened

519
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:19,019
with OG kitchen over there so Oh G cush

520
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:22,430
which amazing came from California the

521
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:22,430
second at hip how to get there

522
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:30,319
we should probably have well you want to

523
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:32,840
come out to clear that up so yeah so og

524
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:35,960
cush I feel like the seeds I I bought

525
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:39,589
seeds of OG Kush in probably 2009

526
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,690
waiting my seeds of could yeah well no

527
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:44,629
that was his og cush times white widow

528
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:46,548
and maybe that crossed OG Kush or

529
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:48,409
something but it definitely wasn't a

530
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:50,629
very good representation of OG Kush it

531
00:19:48,409 --> 00:19:53,480
was garbage - no it was feminized and I

532
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:54,919
realized the issues like all the wrong

533
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,259
thing you went for like literally like

534
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:58,100
wrong everything yeah give me that

535
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:00,589
feminized

536
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:04,038
og cush something from Europe that

537
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:06,259
really you know I must have been oh yeah

538
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:11,750
the amount of I'm not going on and that

539
00:20:06,259 --> 00:20:14,329
is terrible yeah I did ninety-eight

540
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:15,679
percent chance it wasn't I'd say it was

541
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:19,339
just white widow probably I would guess

542
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:21,620
to me yes right and so there's a there's

543
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:24,889
a white widow male that people use over

544
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:27,019
there for sure that's been out and used

545
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,880
like no other

546
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:32,240
all the big seed companies used it back

547
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,070
in the day for their feminizing but that

548
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,710
kind of goes into what James was talking

549
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:38,990
about earlier about giving credit to

550
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:40,819
where credit to do I think a lot of the

551
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,788
in and I'm totally guilty of this I

552
00:20:40,819 --> 00:20:45,678
released the AJ's Sour Diesel pack a

553
00:20:43,788 --> 00:20:48,470
long time ago but it wasn't a J's Sour

554
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,788
Diesel as AJ sour diesel crossed with

555
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,620
white widow we were working with some

556
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:54,230
guys over there and then they put that

557
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:56,148
back on the the AJ Sour Diesel cut that

558
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:59,240
I had and so we called AJ Sour Diesel

559
00:20:56,148 --> 00:21:00,469
but like moving forward I feel like we

560
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,109
were doing the wrong thing back then and

561
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:04,519
we didn't really know it I saw Kim 23

562
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:08,119
the other day I was like what the hell

563
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:09,679
is m23 so I mean it's it's getting to

564
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:12,019
that point now where people have already

565
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,159
forgotten like it's been the thing about

566
00:21:12,019 --> 00:21:17,839
the ho G in Europe was you know like

567
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:19,278
when it first arrived there of course

568
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,109
people who smoked a lot of weed like

569
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,859
we're like well this is good but why all

570
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:23,750
the people over there they don't even

571
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:26,119
like really strong weed like if you give

572
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:28,880
it's too strong nobody wants it like

573
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:30,709
what like this is the exact opposite of

574
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,840
reason why we're growing

575
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:35,000
but you know that was part of the thing

576
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:36,709
was figuring out the packaging of this

577
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,720
product and which was now kind of like

578
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,509
like they kind of like as long as the

579
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,038
buds were a certain weight and size hey

580
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:44,720
it was good you know I mean they don't

581
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:45,798
want to think about it too much they

582
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,480
wanted to really put it on the scale

583
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:50,000
lesson on a brick you come in there with

584
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,200
a big giant giant bud it was like no

585
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,579
this is not happening you know who

586
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,149
looking crazy of course

587
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:57,349
and so everything had to be toned down

588
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:58,489
that was the first thing you learn as an

589
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,109
American grower over there was like

590
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:03,169
probably should tone it down a little

591
00:22:00,109 --> 00:22:04,788
bit yeah that's just a hard place to

592
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:06,830
grow in that's got to be like one of the

593
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:07,849
worst places well from readers point of

594
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:09,528
view though the one thing that I did

595
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:12,859
find interesting was that a lot of the

596
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:14,329
seeds that like that we would grow there

597
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:16,849
if you imagine where they're growing

598
00:22:14,329 --> 00:22:18,710
right it's like dank and nasty and it's

599
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:20,178
not like California or something like

600
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:22,399
that right then so then you get those

601
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:23,960
seeds and somebody magically like flies

602
00:22:22,398 --> 00:22:26,689
home with them wherever they took them

603
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,269
and then unbelievable right like those

604
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:31,850
plants just fucking loved life whereas

605
00:22:29,269 --> 00:22:33,859
when you grow in a beautiful climate and

606
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:35,178
then those seeds end up going back to

607
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:38,329
like Holland or somewhere shooting like

608
00:22:35,179 --> 00:22:39,409
that I bet that they're not so happy you

609
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:41,119
know what I mean like they're not

610
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:43,940
they're not as a Stoke to like when they

611
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:46,069
come out they're like what yeah but I

612
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,860
came from California I want to go home

613
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:51,678
and so you know there's memories with

614
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:55,398
and and epigenetics with everything and

615
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,048
in like when you grow you know for the

616
00:22:55,398 --> 00:22:58,339
right reasons and you see the plan at

617
00:22:57,048 --> 00:23:00,288
the right time and everything comes all

618
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:01,369
the things are working you almost like

619
00:23:00,288 --> 00:23:03,259
as you're handing those seeds to

620
00:23:01,369 --> 00:23:05,058
somebody you just know like guaranteed

621
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:06,859
like those are those are gonna be so

622
00:23:05,058 --> 00:23:08,148
good you know because yeah it was all

623
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:10,398
good whereas if you have a situation

624
00:23:08,148 --> 00:23:11,928
where yeah they were in a room and then

625
00:23:10,398 --> 00:23:13,099
the lights went out cuz the power went

626
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:14,720
out for three days and then the plants

627
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:16,099
kind of suffered a little bit and the

628
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,659
seeds still came through it's not like

629
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:18,889
you're gonna not sell any of them but at

630
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:20,720
the same time you do know that there was

631
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:23,120
a little stress involved on that

632
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,190
particular run and it is again it's it's

633
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:28,729
epigenetics it's like something where we

634
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:30,230
we as breeders try to put something into

635
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:32,480
it and that the problem with Holland was

636
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,130
a lot of those guys it was all fat it

637
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,298
was it was without even them that none

638
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:38,830
of them cared you know they smoked

639
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:40,819
shaggy's in tobacco from

640
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:42,980
you're like but you grow weed all day

641
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:44,960
long no I smoked a pack girls guys

642
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,789
didn't breed right half of them they

643
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,990
just buy seeds from other people you

644
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:50,389
know I feel like that was the biggest

645
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,859
thing over there yeah and you know sad

646
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:54,860
but it's you don't part of the things

647
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:57,529
every time you see a mislabeled seed

648
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:58,789
sold or cloned going out with the wrong

649
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:02,119
name on it you know it's just like

650
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:03,529
causing just endless problems down the

651
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:05,179
road like so many people are gonna say

652
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:07,339
oh I've smoked this and it was either

653
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:09,440
shitty or it was great and it could be

654
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:12,109
the opposite the way or no credit is

655
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,640
given where it should be done and yeah

656
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:14,809
so from a growers point for from a

657
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,060
breeders point of view I kind of feel

658
00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:18,950
like if you're in the perfect places

659
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:20,690
sometimes not the perfect place you know

660
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:23,000
so that was the one thing they had going

661
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:34,430
for them is it anything that came out of

662
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:43,130
their seem to thrive I just allegedly

663
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:43,549
thank you also thank you allegedly thank

664
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:48,600

667

consult thank you very much but yeah I

668
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:27,159
cancel for a lot of people when I travel

669
00:25:24,849 --> 00:25:29,980
a lot so there's always good food I used

670
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:32,500
to be a chef as well so I graduated the

671
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:36,640
cordon bleu top of my class a long time

672
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:40,390
ago yeah thank you no thank you very

673
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,660
much appreciate you know it's great to

674
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:44,740
be able to get people if you know if

675
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:46,090
people come out of their comfort zone to

676
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:47,289
come to a thing like this I got a little

677
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:49,059
little a little bit of heart and

678
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:52,230
dedication to the work that we're doing

679
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:55,899
and that's also part of this industry is

680
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:58,240
kind of a lot of camaraderie between

681
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:01,180
people which is also nice and like we

682
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,890
like our collab yeah customers Jameson

683
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,180
it's big too you know I think a lot of

684
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:06,040
people are losing that they just

685
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:07,990
expected customers and it's one of the

686
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:10,119
things we're big on is ancas customer

687
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:11,470
service if you have a situation with the

688
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:12,399
back you know you email us you tell us

689
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:14,350
what happened I'm going to send you a

690
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,790
free back no questions asked I mean I

691
00:26:14,349 --> 00:26:18,240
can ask you how you germinate of them

692
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:20,769
but my way is not always the right way

693
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,539
your yeah just because I do it one way

694
00:26:20,769 --> 00:26:23,589
doesn't mean you do it that way and the

695
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,940
way we works you're not supposed to

696
00:26:23,589 --> 00:26:27,639
germinate in many ways don't get him wet

697
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,860
or dirty so if you have a situation with

698
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,810
them with things to do is just replace

699
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:33,219
that back and then you're happy to go

700
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:34,629
again and then I have happy customers

701
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:37,660
like that so I appreciate you coming out

702
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,890
and and Shanti's cuz I think everybody

703
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,840
should definitely grow but definitely

704
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,130
grow from a seed that's it's a big

705
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:43,720
difference between buying a clone and

706
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:46,210
taking home putting in some dirt they're

707
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,470
like oh how I got a clone in order

708
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,000
taking a little seedling and actually

709
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:51,009
watching a pop and enjoying it and then

710
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,240
has a tapper that's the potential it

711
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:56,298
could be they're all gonna be different

712
00:26:52,240 --> 00:27:01,410
you know it's a lot

713
00:26:56,298 --> 00:27:08,879
awesome brings its seeds look under your

714
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:10,500
seat everybody and that's also the cool

715
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,480
part like as you see like giving away

716
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:16,950
like you know from such a small thing

717
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,960
compared to like clothes you're kind of

718
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:20,548
working with other people's selection

719
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,319
right so like dude you're not gonna be

720
00:27:20,548 --> 00:27:24,150
able chances of you growing a better

721
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,939
version of the guy who gave you the

722
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:28,169
clones is pretty slim you might be a

723
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,000
better grower and you might get a

724
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:31,169
fraction of a bit better but when you go

725
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,089
from see there's like a rolling dice

726
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:34,890
every time so like you might just hit

727
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:36,959
that you just might nail it right where

728
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:39,059
you just like a hole man not only is it

729
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,220
bigger faster or tasty or whatever all

730
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:42,808
the things you're looking for

731
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,730
and in the best part is like a lot of

732
00:27:42,808 --> 00:27:46,349
things it's like I used to always joke

733
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:47,548
that you know the best thing about the

734
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:49,168
cannabis industry is the fact that

735
00:27:47,548 --> 00:27:51,150
there's so much testing involved and

736
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:52,860
work involved and trying to figure it

737
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:56,159
out right so like that was never never

738
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:57,839
felt like work sitting and doing a fee

739
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,549
no hun and having all these different

740
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:02,548
strains to kind of know these different

741
00:27:59,548 --> 00:28:05,730
cultivars at the same time and narrowing

742
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:07,168
it down to one and you know tell me

743
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,730
where the breeders don't even have the

744
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:10,200
best cuts anymore half the guys that are

745
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,409
selling their seeds the seeds here now

746
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:15,240
half the time the the best phenotype is

747
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:16,860
probably out with the consumer I've

748
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,058
actually been at the booth or someone

749
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:19,798
come up with that and to me I think

750
00:28:18,058 --> 00:28:21,839
that's the true representation of a good

751
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,730
breeder he's trying to improve the line

752
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:25,230
you should come back with something

753
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,788
better than he has if you don't you

754
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,808
should be disappointed if you don't have

755
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:30,298
a keeper if you don't get something

756
00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:32,460
better than yes I think that's a good

757
00:28:30,298 --> 00:28:34,109
representation of that is I like

758
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,548
breeders when they bring me seeds or

759
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:37,859
everyone to bring me gear that I love

760
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:39,389
flower with it too and so that lets me

761
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:41,250
know that they grew an out they tested

762
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,990
on it passed all their checks dollar all

763
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:45,119
their boxes and they're comfortable with

764
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:47,099
it and so I think that's really big when

765
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,989
you guys go for for buying and selecting

766
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:50,519
genes is make sure whoever you're behind

767
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,109
from testing them out you know look for

768
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:53,788
pictures make sure they give you data

769
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:56,428
make sure they give you info because

770
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:58,378
they if a real breeder did it or if they

771
00:28:56,429 --> 00:29:02,309
to do it for one they'll have the mail

772
00:28:58,378 --> 00:29:03,480
service it's a lot of things right there

773
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:04,878
a lot of things were accident so we

774
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,259
don't have the mail they didn't do it

775
00:29:04,878 --> 00:29:08,759
there's a lot of guys like JJ doesn't

776
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:10,048
keep his mails you know I mean there's

777
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:11,339
some people everybody kind of has their

778
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:13,408
own style too I see other funny thing

779
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:14,970
about breeding it's like we're all doing

780
00:29:13,409 --> 00:29:18,149
the same thing but we have kind of our

781
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:19,919
own style it's a look like it's like

782
00:29:18,148 --> 00:29:21,508
making hash same sort of thing we're all

783
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,580
kind of trying to do the same thing but

784
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:25,679
somehow somebody does it better than the

785
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:27,839
other guy and it's just because they

786
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,090
have better patients or their timing or

787
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:31,829
their their their temperature sort of

788
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:33,148
knowledge of being on point is a little

789
00:29:31,829 --> 00:29:35,069
bit on you know better they don't know

790
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:36,479
usually it's a lazy factor you don't I

791
00:29:35,069 --> 00:29:47,398
mean it's one of those anything that's

792
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:48,868
hard to do like making a lazy he doesn't

793
00:29:47,398 --> 00:29:50,609
keep his own doesn't keep males it just

794
00:29:48,868 --> 00:29:53,009
kind of moves on keeps on moving on

795
00:29:50,609 --> 00:29:55,558
which you know is good if you're if you

796
00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:57,659
keep your if you really are good at sort

797
00:29:55,558 --> 00:30:01,618
of seeing what's coming up around the

798
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:02,970
corner but I do try to keep males as

799
00:30:01,618 --> 00:30:05,459
long as I can that's kind of one of

800
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:10,110
those if I can you know yeah what's so

801
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:11,819
difficult keeping me let me for you

802
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:13,528
I mean I've lost most of my males but

803
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:15,178
now I have a handful that I'm keeping it

804
00:30:13,528 --> 00:30:17,579
a nursery and now with the rec market

805
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:20,610
we're able to kind of move forward with

806
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:21,898
keeping things alive a lot longer tissue

807
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:23,459
culture I think is gonna be a good

808
00:30:21,898 --> 00:30:26,038
solution currently I don't think it's

809
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,048
ideal but I think it's not promoting

810
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:31,048
Klan stir - yeah it's not practical yet

811
00:30:28,048 --> 00:30:32,579
I mean it's great for for personal in

812
00:30:31,048 --> 00:30:35,339
keeping it like for your in house sort

813
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:36,388
of being able to clean things up that's

814
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:39,538
kind of where right now

815
00:30:36,388 --> 00:30:41,609
yeah and just meristem propagation well

816
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:43,408
now that we can recognize like a V roads

817
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:45,209
and viruses and all these things that we

818
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:47,039
can actually clean up and then put

819
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:50,429
through tissue culture get a new start

820
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:52,558
of that plant that is clean and healthy

821
00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:53,909
I mean there's there's so many old

822
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:57,079
plants that need to go through tissue

823
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:59,460
culture yeah it's I think that's that's

824
00:30:57,079 --> 00:31:00,599
only way that people on large-scale

825
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,769
production are gonna be able to do it

826
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:04,899
anyways just because they need to have

827
00:31:02,769 --> 00:31:07,029
clean fresh healthy claims and a start

828
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,769
and be able to look back and put a date

829
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:11,410
on it you know because you could just

830
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:13,900
imagine how many facilities got ruined

831
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,040
without you know by taking in that again

832
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,720
that's the problem with clones in

833
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,339
general is yours

834
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,380
there's pathogen problems you know

835
00:31:18,339 --> 00:31:21,909
there's viroids and there's hundred

836
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:24,130
mildew and if you have any kind of

837
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:25,600
medium going with it it's all that - you

838
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:27,640
know like how did Europe get better

839
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:36,549
powdery mildew oh no I definitely

840
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:39,940
brought that now is that 100% verified I

841
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:41,950
never seen it before and I was super

842
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,870
proud because I had OG and and sour D

843
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:45,519
and I was all stoked and had my friends

844
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:46,839
from Minnesota come into town and the

845
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,519
first time they said is uh dude you got

846
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:50,409
pm and I'm like what like what are you

847
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:52,990
talking about it I literally did not

848
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:56,110
even see it and it was just at that

849
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:57,849
stage where it was just coming in enough

850
00:31:56,109 --> 00:31:59,679
that if you once you see it you can't

851
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:02,589
unsee it now all of a sudden you're like

852
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:05,470
oh my god is everywhere like it's and it

853
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:07,359
wasn't bad but it was just coming on and

854
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:08,620
so you know they're from Minnesota

855
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:10,839
they're they're used to seeing that

856
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:12,879
they're like no problem get some time

857
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:14,799
exude it's got to get to get to work on

858
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,300
it but if I didn't have them come

859
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,069
through I would have just completely

860
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:19,990
wiped out my things but that's because I

861
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:23,230
brought those cuts from here literally

862
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:25,450
from Cali and straight to Amsterdam and

863
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:28,029
just like yep there you go all those

864
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:29,650
cuts I gave you so I got what did you

865
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:32,529
use because there was no eagle to pony

866
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:34,900
over there I used to I went for sulfur

867
00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:37,029
uh early on just but it was also burners

868
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:39,310
yeah and the burners were kind of a

869
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:41,259
bitch because they they get everywhere

870
00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:44,169
like and now I realize I would never use

871
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:45,700
burners I'd only use micronized sulfur

872
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:47,350
because that way you can apply it

873
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:50,319
directly to where you want to apply it

874
00:32:47,349 --> 00:32:52,209
and not just like I'm going to nuke the

875
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:54,609
entire facility because we can never get

876
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:55,960
it out like that stuff is like fire

877
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:58,089
because you like you feel like you're in

878
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,039
a firecracker factory like okay this is

879
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:02,049
not good no it's not good and it's

880
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:04,029
because it's micronized or because it's

881
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:06,009
been the burners it's going up and

882
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:07,210
getting like so for me my problem was I

883
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:07,480
was using a lot of light members at the

884
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,850
time

885
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:11,500
and it was so slick that it made my

886
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:12,699
wheels on the light members just spin

887
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,740
and I wouldn't that's not come in the

888
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:17,169
room and be like god damn sulfur burners

889
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:18,669
so I stopped using them for that but

890
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:20,080
then I realized later like man I just

891
00:33:18,669 --> 00:33:21,700
didn't like the way that it was applied

892
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:23,138
but it worked I mean it definitely got

893
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,590
rid of it but there's a there's a

894
00:33:23,138 --> 00:33:25,839
product called

895
00:33:23,589 --> 00:33:28,808
micro Thyle dispersant it has two S's on

896
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:30,788
it it's a it's amazing it's micronized I

897
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:32,798
used to use the brown bags of micronized

898
00:33:30,788 --> 00:33:34,629
sulfur and then put a wetting agent this

899
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:36,369
has it all in there and it's like $50

900
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:38,289
for fifty pounds you can buy it I you

901
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:41,528
can order it for you typing in Google it

902
00:33:38,288 --> 00:33:43,000
shows up and it's perfect in every way

903
00:33:41,528 --> 00:33:44,859
it's good for us it might it's good for

904
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,419
powdery mildew if you have to use it if

905
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:49,269
you have to use a sulfur product and I

906
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:51,549
believe it's all recertified yeah it's

907
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:53,819
amazing when you because that because of

908
00:33:51,548 --> 00:33:57,009
the bad taste of my mouth literally from

909
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:59,769
from the burners I just never really got

910
00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:03,519
it was like no sulfur did it not gonna

911
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:05,349
do it and then about a year ago somebody

912
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,940
again same problem someone gave me some

913
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:08,858
phones and then I was like all you

914
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:11,440
mother fuckers I can't get into this go

915
00:34:08,858 --> 00:34:12,969
like yeah the nuke oh my so I hit him

916
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,858
with I was like this I got to do him

917
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:17,199
this time I got to do it I don't want to

918
00:34:14,858 --> 00:34:18,730
just go straight to try to use something

919
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,648
chemical because it's like you gotta you

920
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:22,269
gotta it's the only way to do proper

921
00:34:20,648 --> 00:34:23,500
organic is to start organic you know I

922
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:25,929
mean I've done work it all the way

923
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,838
through cuz it's pretty much you know

924
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:30,190
it's in there so use sulfur and I was

925
00:34:28,838 --> 00:34:31,869
amazed I was like wow this soap does

926
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:34,059
this work better than all the other

927
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,500
things I've been using so and she well

928
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:37,568
we used to think powdery mildew was

929
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,579
systemic at least I did and then I

930
00:34:37,568 --> 00:34:41,829
learned that you can have Grove powdery

931
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:43,089
mildew it's not systemic so yeah it's

932
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:45,310
way well it's just one of those things

933
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:47,440
where it latches it gets into the plant

934
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:49,838
technically so it feels like it's

935
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,398
systemic but it's not it's it's not

936
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:56,318
permanent I mean it can be it can be

937
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:58,239
beat but yeah I think I think just it's

938
00:34:56,318 --> 00:34:59,739
a lot easier when you're growing plants

939
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,379
that don't get powdery mildew it's just

940
00:34:59,739 --> 00:35:03,639
like hey look this plan doesn't get

941
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,800
powdery mildews like if I could just

942
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:09,269
grow that like if that's possible and

943
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,920
you can somehow you know get rid of that

944
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:13,139
sour D or that cut that you actually are

945
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,548
just so

946
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:15,538
attached to that always gets it you know

947
00:35:14,548 --> 00:35:16,920
which is always a problem there's

948
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:19,140
certain plants that just do pushes

949
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,000
pushes are really susceptible typically

950
00:35:19,139 --> 00:35:23,219
the power to mildew just in Europe it

951
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,068
was HP 13 that was the worst right that

952
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:28,108
plant came around and just anybody who

953
00:35:26,068 --> 00:35:29,849
got that cut especially a lot of the

954
00:35:28,108 --> 00:35:31,710
Dutch growers didn't recognize what it

955
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:33,088
was and they were all proud when they

956
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,528
handed it to you and you're like whoa

957
00:35:33,088 --> 00:35:36,989
what's all that they're like what do you

958
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:39,960
mean it's all trichomes or something I'm

959
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:41,699
like no that is powder fuckin mildew and

960
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,010
then they've won see once they figured

961
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:46,108
it out yeah it was like you know dude I

962
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,490
thought everything I have because what

963
00:35:46,108 --> 00:35:49,528
it's exactly what all my plants look

964
00:35:47,489 --> 00:35:52,318
like back home so yeah it's definitely

965
00:35:49,528 --> 00:35:53,909
like that particular cut was a nightmare

966
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:55,288
and soma sold a lot of that a lot of

967
00:35:53,909 --> 00:35:57,268
people that was just around for a short

968
00:35:55,289 --> 00:36:00,299
amount of time long enough to really

969
00:35:57,268 --> 00:36:03,419
infect a lot of people's gardens so but

970
00:36:00,298 --> 00:36:07,619
that wasn't me technically it's somebody

971
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:08,940
else right but that wouldn't seem to be

972
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:10,559
inherent and that there's an old plant

973
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:13,409
from New York in Hawaii and all that

974
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,700
that plant which is another one of those

975
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:16,199
weird think about strains is that you'll

976
00:36:14,699 --> 00:36:18,268
notice that there's a lot of drama based

977
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:20,838
around a lot of these strains and it's

978
00:36:18,268 --> 00:36:22,828
like there's certain ones like HP 13

979
00:36:20,838 --> 00:36:26,538
because especially because it was a

980
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:28,859
Hawaii New York kind of thing drama like

981
00:36:26,539 --> 00:36:30,799
unbelievable amounts people a lot of

982
00:36:28,858 --> 00:36:33,778
groups broke up over it fights

983
00:36:30,798 --> 00:36:35,940
infighting Sour Diesel he got his name

984
00:36:33,778 --> 00:36:38,309
from being a causing people to become

985
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,838
sour from you know not lack of getting

986
00:36:38,309 --> 00:36:43,079
access you know I mean so there was just

987
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:46,608
like and you know obviously og has its

988
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:48,690
own history and it wasn't necessarily as

989
00:36:46,608 --> 00:36:50,369
brutal as some of the other ones but

990
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:53,429
I've seen other strains causing all

991
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:56,670
sorts of drama and it's because I think

992
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:59,548
it's just because well back in the day

993
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:00,659
it was power struggle more or less and

994
00:36:59,548 --> 00:37:03,659
now it's the same powers forever let's

995
00:37:00,659 --> 00:37:06,659
just in a in a legal way you know yeah

996
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:08,250
which is worse of course way worse is

997
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:11,358
way different you know the white market

998
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:14,130
in the black market way different

999
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:16,429
traditional market traditional

1000
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,430
traditional

1001
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:23,980
yes the traditional market yeah and you

1002
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:25,509
know used to be more honor code let's

1003
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:27,670
say or something like that and now it's

1004
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:29,380
we worked on handshakes back in the day

1005
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:30,970
it was it was handshakes we didn't sign

1006
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,740
papers it was like you work with people

1007
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:34,750
to eat trust you get burned occasionally

1008
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:36,759
and you grow and you learn who you can

1009
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,960
work with and you work with those people

1010
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,470
and then the shitheads you get rid of

1011
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:43,030
now it's like you gotta sign papers and

1012
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:44,559
well yeah there's a lot of names lots of

1013
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,940
contracts there's a lot of lunches now

1014
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:48,279
it's what you get you get a lot of lot

1015
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:52,809
of lunches everybody getting a fuck

1016
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:54,460
little lunches a couple dinners usually

1017
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:56,860
at that point they've done the brain

1018
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:59,559
drain enough to like there's somebody in

1019
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:00,610
the back just the sketchpad and and

1020
00:37:59,559 --> 00:38:02,440
that's the thing about this industry's

1021
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:07,329
like it's very much

1022
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:09,130
you know saturated in many ways but in a

1023
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:11,019
weird way reinventing itself all the

1024
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:14,320
time too so I think if you can kind of

1025
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:16,539
stay slightly ahead of the curve and or

1026
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:20,800
just sort of figure out your your

1027
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:22,750
position within this industry you can be

1028
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,300
comfortable but at the same time it

1029
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:28,090
sucks to try to be on that front end of

1030
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:30,460
what's going on because things are until

1031
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:31,990
it goes federally legal there's no point

1032
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:33,250
of even investing a ton of money and

1033
00:38:31,989 --> 00:38:34,239
trying to put all your energy into it

1034
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:36,309
you know you're gonna get your ass

1035
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:39,009
handed to you the minute it goes into

1036
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:41,110
that zone so you kind of almost want to

1037
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:42,460
either had you've already been doing it

1038
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:45,700
you know and I mean taking that risk

1039
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:48,099
early on because now the the to get

1040
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:50,259
involved it is kind of a bit much

1041
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:52,150
and on a breeding point of view he's

1042
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:55,000
nice because it's a hub can be like a

1043
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:58,510
hobby style side thing you could you

1044
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,090
could go full steam but again you're

1045
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:02,320
gonna see it's gonna get less and less

1046
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:04,690
interesting the higher up you go up the

1047
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,580
ladder because yeah wow your hands are

1048
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:08,619
tied once again because you're now

1049
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:10,119
limited to these particular strains that

1050
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:11,589
may have already been put through the

1051
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:12,639
system and now it's like well how am I

1052
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,960
gonna do anything with that because it

1053
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:15,789
has nothing to do with what I'm doing so

1054
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:17,860
well then even trademarks so we had the

1055
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:19,829
trademark for loud for the longest time

1056
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:23,710
me and my partners with loud seeds and

1057
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:25,420
it got to a point where it just wouldn't

1058
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:26,920
be enforceable everyone wanted a loud

1059
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:28,030
Kevin we were the first we're the first

1060
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:32,079
there was no other loud

1061
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:34,180
for us but then like 2014 people started

1062
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:38,380
hearing there's a lot of farms and in

1063
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:39,639
Kansas now and Oklahoma not Kansas but

1064
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,710
like and there's there's another loud

1065
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:43,179
company in Seattle but there's probably

1066
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:44,769
a hundred different loud companies now

1067
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:47,139
so it gets to a point because it's not

1068
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:48,759
federally illegal to where how do you

1069
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:50,650
enforce it and how much money do you

1070
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:53,790
really want to spend enforcing something

1071
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:56,200
like a trademark yeah it's it's

1072
00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:59,559
unenforceable at this point like anybody

1073
00:39:56,199 --> 00:40:01,750
who goes down that sort of rapid hole is

1074
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:03,099
either well funded and they don't care

1075
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,269
about losing money because that's about

1076
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:07,539
the only people that you could really do

1077
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:09,070
it or or they just don't quite get to

1078
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:10,960
how the system works because once you

1079
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:12,250
get there's no way to take it to the

1080
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,570
next level because the next level is

1081
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:15,070
gonna laugh at you and say well it's not

1082
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:16,809
legal so what I'm gonna do so you can

1083
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:19,420
only do it at a state level which

1084
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:20,710
doesn't make it nationwide anyway how

1085
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,880
can you be you can't be nationwide if

1086
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:25,630
you're doing it at a state level right

1087
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:27,940
so there's you kind of get yeah you're

1088
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:30,910
stuck yeah if you look at like runts

1089
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:33,519
Gorilla Glue skittles these names these

1090
00:40:30,909 --> 00:40:36,009
guys have had uphill battles because of

1091
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:37,960
their names it was a dumb idea I think

1092
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:40,000
that I think the fact that people can't

1093
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,940
think outside the box and put something

1094
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,550
at least sort of original like I mean

1095
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:49,300
it's like if it's not Lucasfilm or

1096
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:51,100
Disney or Nestle or you know one of

1097
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,210
these big curtains like who really

1098
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:54,789
thinks that they're gonna be able to

1099
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:55,990
take that anywhere federally once it

1100
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:57,940
gets to the federal level they gonna get

1101
00:40:55,989 --> 00:40:59,399
Tom they're gonna get creamed because

1102
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,539
there's gonna be like 50 lawyers

1103
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,460
laughing at you like you really put all

1104
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:05,259
your money and just use naming

1105
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,050
everything after Star Wars like come on

1106
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:09,220
it's like a little more original that's

1107
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:11,670
and that's the problem is that the

1108
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:15,099
cannabis industry is kind of like always

1109
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:17,980
worked off of like we get it we all love

1110
00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:19,480
puns and we all love to ripoff logos and

1111
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,650
we all think it's funny when you come up

1112
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,320
with something that looks like something

1113
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,639
but you really got to think like okay if

1114
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,410
I'm gonna put too much energy into this

1115
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:28,750
I might get my ass handed to me just

1116
00:41:26,409 --> 00:41:30,609
like a hit man with his debauchee nose

1117
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:33,039
you know it's like you you you copied it

1118
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,760
a little too close I mean it was a pipe

1119
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:36,230
that was not a you know

1120
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,520
copyright infringement in any way shape

1121
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:39,889
or form except for the fact that it was

1122
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:42,500
called the dabba Chino and it looked

1123
00:41:39,889 --> 00:41:46,339
like their thing so Starbucks you know

1124
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,780
they won so it's just a matter of time

1125
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,519
before those people get caught up I

1126
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,080
think when they you know put too much

1127
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:54,429
energy into that kind of stuff so I

1128
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:57,500
think with trademarks either gotta be

1129
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:59,210
dedicated because we've trademarked as

1130
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,500
many strains as I could a lot of stuff I

1131
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:02,720
couldn't trademark like it couldn't

1132
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,400
trademark bubblegum but then somehow

1133
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:06,589
Simon from seriously it's gotten too

1134
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,389
rigid I was like wait how did you do

1135
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:10,400
that they told me I wouldn't have that

1136
00:42:08,389 --> 00:42:12,139
because it was too general but there's

1137
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,490
you know but they did give me MKULTRA

1138
00:42:12,139 --> 00:42:15,230
which which I thought was funny so I'm

1139
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:17,509
like oh so I got the trademark for

1140
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:19,010
MKULTRA is that here over I got that

1141
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:20,680
here that's later you know and so it's

1142
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:22,850
like I'm like oh so I can get government

1143
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:24,469
experiments and trademark their names

1144
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:28,369
but I can't trademark the word bubblegum

1145
00:42:24,469 --> 00:42:30,289
for seeds but I think it's well we call

1146
00:42:28,369 --> 00:42:32,150
it is like surrounding the the wagon

1147
00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:34,480
right now so basically you just cover

1148
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:37,820
your ass and trademark everything around

1149
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,780
the product and when you legally can do

1150
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,240
the product when you're in a state like

1151
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:43,390
California you do it but it costs a

1152
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:46,609
fuckload of money dude like we've spent

1153
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:48,349
tens if not hundreds of thousands over

1154
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:51,680
the last 15 years on just trademarks

1155
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:53,420
that we never ever ever ever used in any

1156
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:56,750
way shape trademarks and website names

1157
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:58,010
except having that little TM and knowing

1158
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:00,860
it's real you know it has something

1159
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:02,780
behind it but it's rough right yeah

1160
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:05,660
you're all over this stuff it's on bitch

1161
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:08,330
and you've got 52 growers who are all

1162
00:43:05,659 --> 00:43:09,289
like have no clue half of them or what

1163
00:43:08,329 --> 00:43:11,659
they're even doing when it comes to

1164
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:13,190
business right everything imagine you

1165
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:15,079
can't tell them that though nobody I

1166
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:17,539
know cuz I'm one of them I'm one of them

1167
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:17,989
I know exactly I'm like like how he's

1168
00:43:17,539 --> 00:43:20,969
doing this

1169
00:43:17,989 --> 00:43:22,439
oh no well we're doing

1170
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:24,358
and that is a part of the industry is

1171
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,670
like we got to make it up as we go along

1172
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:28,769
because yeah when it comes to seasonal

1173
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:30,139
pleasures well see it's always weird cuz

1174
00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:32,579
seeds are like one of those things where

1175
00:43:30,139 --> 00:43:33,989
it's either the most benign thing

1176
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:36,060
because you can't get high from it right

1177
00:43:33,989 --> 00:43:37,529
did you just City think you have a

1178
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:39,119
thousand pounds of seeds in the room and

1179
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,589
we couldn't get high from it we found

1180
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,410
some weed that was mixed in between it

1181
00:43:40,588 --> 00:43:44,578
but when you grow that thousand pounds

1182
00:43:43,409 --> 00:43:45,750
you could take up the whole the whole

1183
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:47,849
town you could get the whole town you

1184
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:50,309
know you can get those everybody high

1185
00:43:47,849 --> 00:43:51,838
for miles you know so it's like the most

1186
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:54,420
dangerous thing in the world in one way

1187
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:55,980
to them and it's the most benign because

1188
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,200
if you get the right guy he's just like

1189
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:00,690
yeah yeah yeah nobody you know explained

1190
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:03,239
there's not well more than 0.3 percent

1191
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:04,980
THC in an entire bag of some seeds so

1192
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:06,598
we're kind of in a weird zone where it's

1193
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,639
theoretically we should be able to sell

1194
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:10,559
those things in every 7/11 and

1195
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:12,989
everywhere in town because they they are

1196
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:14,578
just like any other CBD product out

1197
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:17,459
there they're 0.3 they're like they

1198
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:19,050
follow all those things but we haven't

1199
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,000
quite got there yet so and when's that

1200
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:23,609
coming

1201
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,679
I don't know that the farm bill passed

1202
00:44:23,608 --> 00:44:27,739
the 2018 fungo pass which stated

1203
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:30,809
anything below point zero three percent

1204
00:44:27,739 --> 00:44:32,608
THC was considered Hamptons was to be

1205
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:35,759
removed from the control show Substances

1206
00:44:32,608 --> 00:44:37,230
Act which legally made seeds legal it

1207
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,030
can only have there's you take ten seeds

1208
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:40,650
you take hundred seed you take 10,000

1209
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:43,560
seats squish them all up you're not

1210
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,950
gonna get a 0.3% THC it's just not gonna

1211
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:45,690
happen

1212
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:48,419
there's no cannabinoid to the embryo of

1213
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:50,789
a seed whatsoever and so it's really

1214
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:53,309
hard you have to explain your case to

1215
00:44:50,789 --> 00:44:54,869
like the mastercard visa and tell them

1216
00:44:53,309 --> 00:44:56,338
why they're different when I shut you

1217
00:44:54,869 --> 00:45:02,250
down did they actually listen to you

1218
00:44:56,338 --> 00:45:03,690
that there was lawyers yeah but yeah so

1219
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:07,289
we're in this weird zone where it's like

1220
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:09,690
you know theoretically we should be able

1221
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:11,550
to you know conduct business like

1222
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:13,380
anybody else and sell our stuff to

1223
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:15,450
anybody but we have to be you know

1224
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:16,920
that's why I mean I only have he's my

1225
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:20,189
only distributor because of that I kind

1226
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,539
of I don't trust the having it because I

1227
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:23,250
feel like we're still are kind of like

1228
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:24,838
overstepping still by the fact that

1229
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:26,489
we're crossing state lines things

1230
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:27,960
getting weird like the whole seed game

1231
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:30,389
is definitely one of those things where

1232
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,059
it's it's it's kind of like the Wild

1233
00:45:30,389 --> 00:45:34,409
West still out there you know and it is

1234
00:45:32,059 --> 00:45:35,849
but it's also the best part of the

1235
00:45:34,409 --> 00:45:39,778
industry because of the fact that is

1236
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:41,400
changing and evolving and getting you

1237
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,909
know genetic spread out throughout the

1238
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,829
world

1239
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:45,808
yeah people you know that was one of my

1240
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:47,609
mottos of our company was always drop

1241
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:48,989
seeds not bombs because we felt like

1242
00:45:47,608 --> 00:45:50,578
every time somebody bought a pack of

1243
00:45:48,989 --> 00:45:52,318
seeds they were going to their

1244
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:54,568
neighborhood and just like you know like

1245
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:58,978
there's some pretty sure DNA trademark

1246
00:45:54,568 --> 00:46:01,619
that they're ten years behind I do my

1247
00:45:58,978 --> 00:46:03,179
friends that's fine but and and so me

1248
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:04,858
used it too for a long time so I'm going

1249
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:07,739
to go out there and what I always said

1250
00:46:04,858 --> 00:46:12,478
drive seed bomb so I was like are you

1251
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:14,759
kidding good shirts posters come on but

1252
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:16,649
but I mean we don't really care we want

1253
00:46:14,759 --> 00:46:19,199
more people to use the motto because the

1254
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:21,239
idea is it's real you know I mean like

1255
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:24,449
when when you see neighborhoods change

1256
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:26,400
because somebody grew some fireweed it's

1257
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:27,989
like especially back in the day now of

1258
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,358
course it's kind of people are spoiled

1259
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:32,278
as usual oh there was times when people

1260
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:35,098
would come to the shop in Amsterdam

1261
00:46:32,278 --> 00:46:37,170
and tell me how like by buying a pack of

1262
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:38,430
Chocolate Chunk seeds or whatever they

1263
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,489
bought at that time it went back to

1264
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:42,389
their placing screwed up really well

1265
00:46:40,489 --> 00:46:44,150
everything changed you know what I mean

1266
00:46:42,389 --> 00:46:46,318
like now all of a sudden people are like

1267
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:47,818
finally knew what good we was you know

1268
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:49,920
and that's the good feeling as a grower

1269
00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:51,150
cuz that's like with clones you don't

1270
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,338
get that because there's no trap you

1271
00:46:51,150 --> 00:46:55,559
know very a little bit yeah you might

1272
00:46:53,338 --> 00:46:58,288
want to you might go here to there and

1273
00:46:55,559 --> 00:47:01,349
but it's always like it's weird just

1274
00:46:58,289 --> 00:47:02,489
like a clones make people weird very

1275
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:04,499
important there's a lot of hoarding

1276
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:06,329
going on and a lot of sneakers that goes

1277
00:47:04,498 --> 00:47:07,439
to the cat suit Bluebird cat because

1278
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:10,259
were familiar with that I can't see

1279
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,900
Bluebird online you know as a genetics

1280
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:15,568
out but he bought the he bought the

1281
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:17,369
bubble cutter cut and I do in 2001 when

1282
00:47:15,568 --> 00:47:20,219
it had a little too much money and not

1283
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:21,838
more money than he had cents they bought

1284
00:47:20,219 --> 00:47:23,729
the cow for five to five hundred bucks

1285
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,920
after you got it yeah so you guys have

1286
00:47:23,728 --> 00:47:27,298
all treated greatly compliant we did I

1287
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,559
called him said you can't give away cats

1288
00:47:27,298 --> 00:47:30,239
you can't sell clones

1289
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,860
he's like hey that wasn't that wasn't

1290
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:34,079
part of the fucking deal and so for

1291
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:35,640
about four years online if you emailed

1292
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,380
him he'd send you a cut only that you

1293
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:39,539
only covered it being you have to give

1294
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:41,250
away five cuts and so if you were

1295
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:43,050
anybody and you mailed him you know you

1296
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:45,780
that clone and that's how Bubba got out

1297
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:47,220
everywhere and that's a if you can

1298
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,390
imagine like you're in Illinois you're

1299
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:50,309
on the forum sheet you know this guy

1300
00:47:48,389 --> 00:47:51,809
emails you the bubble cat you know like

1301
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:53,400
the king of your fucking block like

1302
00:47:51,809 --> 00:47:54,630
you've got the fire I stay on the block

1303
00:47:53,400 --> 00:48:01,619
everybody loves you they're blowing up

1304
00:47:54,630 --> 00:48:03,660
your phone and the guard tubes cigar

1305
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:08,460
tubes you pack a cigar and then you'd

1306
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:11,099
cut the top off get some tobacco mosaic

1307
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,590
virus with it here you go yeah have that

1308
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:15,839
have that along with your cut no problem

1309
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:17,760
yeah you you would get the you know

1310
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:20,700
there's small plugs not the standard

1311
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,620
rock Wilke of slugs with the small so I

1312
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:25,739
always felt like I was similar I would

1313
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:27,179
do opposite I would cut fresh and I

1314
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:29,069
would stick a whole bunch into like one

1315
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:31,710
piece of rock wool and then wrap that in

1316
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:34,170
plastic and then put that into a poster

1317
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:35,849
tube and then wedge it in there so that

1318
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:38,010
you could flip it over either way and

1319
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:40,710
then that would go through no problem

1320
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:41,970
and and the thing is if you do them when

1321
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:44,099
they're fresh and you don't have any

1322
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:46,199
roots there's no stress right because

1323
00:48:44,099 --> 00:48:48,119
when your plant has roots and you bounce

1324
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:50,159
it all around and you take it gets cold

1325
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:51,929
and hot and all that there's there's

1326
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,099
again that's the same problem that we

1327
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,989
were saying earlier were you kind of

1328
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:56,610
like yeah you kind of it's like you drop

1329
00:48:54,989 --> 00:48:57,599
the baby it's like you drop the baby you

1330
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:59,400
know what I mean you're like it's gonna

1331
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,679
be fine honey don't worry

1332
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:04,220
and then like third grade you're all I

1333
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:07,259
think it dropped a pretty heart you know

1334
00:49:04,219 --> 00:49:08,639
that was a problem and with the can with

1335
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:10,410
these plants you you know you see that

1336
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:11,879
quicker because you'll see one plant

1337
00:49:10,409 --> 00:49:13,049
you'll track one plant through and

1338
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,970
you'll realize like oh that's the one

1339
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,560
that I fuck the root ball up on or

1340
00:49:14,969 --> 00:49:18,389
whatever and you will see that that

1341
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,549
plant does not succeed as well as the

1342
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:21,809
other ones because it had trauma at that

1343
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:25,080
time so I feel like when you take the

1344
00:49:21,809 --> 00:49:26,340
cuts fresh it's like ER thing it's like

1345
00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:28,409
you're as long as you get it within a

1346
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:31,380
certain time frame and in the beginning

1347
00:49:28,409 --> 00:49:34,589
this is pre 9/11 but I used to we put a

1348
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:36,329
little LED light on the top of the tube

1349
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:37,440
and thinking like oh it's gonna keep the

1350
00:49:36,329 --> 00:49:39,250
photo period but then later on I

1351
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,929
realized these elbows

1352
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,489
the matter and then nowadays you can get

1353
00:49:40,929 --> 00:49:45,399
clone tubes you can get the whole clone

1354
00:49:42,489 --> 00:49:47,559
box and stuff Isis I still feel like to

1355
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,849
send it with roots is unless you're

1356
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:51,039
gonna do it yourself like if you're

1357
00:49:48,849 --> 00:49:52,539
gonna transport it in a cooler and bring

1358
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:53,980
it to your friend's house and all that

1359
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:57,099
is cool but the thing you put into a

1360
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:59,170
mailbox that guy just goes ok thanks and

1361
00:49:57,099 --> 00:50:01,000
throws it behind him you know that

1362
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:02,740
things on a rough ride so I had I had

1363
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,989
clones shipped to my friend's mom's

1364
00:50:02,739 --> 00:50:07,029
house back in the day and he forgot to

1365
00:50:04,989 --> 00:50:09,129
pick him up and it was 2 weeks later I'm

1366
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:10,630
like so do you have those are they are

1367
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:12,789
they growing and he's like oh I forgot

1368
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:14,230
to get him and sound like fuck they're

1369
00:50:12,789 --> 00:50:15,699
probably dead so he went over and got

1370
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:17,409
him and they were still alive they were

1371
00:50:15,699 --> 00:50:21,279
just fine and they were in the dark for

1372
00:50:17,409 --> 00:50:23,289
two weeks that's crazy so well then you

1373
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,570
want roots at that point you want roots

1374
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:28,570
but I've had I've had I've had clones

1375
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:30,309
arrive that like didn't go on a direct

1376
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:31,990
shipment I got stuck for three or four

1377
00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:35,230
days and then it's just like

1378
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:37,119
thanks for the box of frog dehydrated or

1379
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:40,210
just basically spinach that's defrosted

1380
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:43,000
I was like wow that didn't work out so

1381
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:44,619
well but I think it's funny because

1382
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,510
people think it's so crazy

1383
00:50:44,619 --> 00:50:47,739
moving cuts around like that but you

1384
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:51,010
know back in the day it was just like

1385
00:50:47,739 --> 00:50:52,419
you got to do what you got to do and it

1386
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:54,070
made a huge difference when they did

1387
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:55,420
when it's such a good feeling when you

1388
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:57,370
get a clone from a thousands of miles

1389
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:59,320
away and get it's a root and you're like

1390
00:50:57,369 --> 00:51:01,420
alright you know now it's fucking on

1391
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:03,160
because and plus when it starts fresh

1392
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:05,019
there and it's got no snow to stress

1393
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:12,420
he's like it's all on you at that point

1394
00:51:05,019 --> 00:51:12,420
yeah James yeah you stop talking so much

1395
00:51:12,449 --> 00:51:16,719
yeah oh man that's all he wanted that's

1396
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:21,539
all he wanted was the breeder drum I

1397
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:21,539
hate to see this oh good you got some

1398
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:41,970
alpha females is it alpha females alpha

1399
00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:41,969
her oh my god so tell us what happened

1400
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:56,529
okay so I got the insane I got a banana

1401
00:51:52,329 --> 00:51:59,559
hammock the crescendo the some other

1402
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:02,440
cross he gave me as a freebie all of em

1403
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:05,289
I couldn't I just couldn't get it to go

1404
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:07,900
so I was wondering what you guys thought

1405
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:12,608
of it his thumb crosses have you grown

1406
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:14,079
any of them out and so when I said they

1407
00:52:12,608 --> 00:52:18,608
didn't go what do you mean like they

1408
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:21,219
either did I didn't germinate or to like

1409
00:52:18,608 --> 00:52:23,289
where they showed a little bit out of

1410
00:52:21,219 --> 00:52:26,829
this it was like dampening off it just

1411
00:52:23,289 --> 00:52:29,619
yeah like showed itself either died but

1412
00:52:26,829 --> 00:52:32,889
the ones that I did get to go they were

1413
00:52:29,619 --> 00:52:34,260
fired and I've been following him for a

1414
00:52:32,889 --> 00:52:36,009
minute

1415
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:38,740
hermaphroditic she's you said taught

1416
00:52:36,010 --> 00:52:42,220
yeah so the insane half of them harmed

1417
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:45,549
the other two I kept and I braided I hit

1418
00:52:42,219 --> 00:52:47,319
them with a male but like I understand

1419
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:48,970
that's just how fuckin shit goes it's

1420
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:51,580
like you're breeding these crazy-ass

1421
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:53,500
things it I know plants will show their

1422
00:52:51,579 --> 00:52:56,199
substrates but they shouldn't show that

1423
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:58,000
know one thing that I think breeders

1424
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:59,019
aren't doing right now and this is

1425
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,849
something that I've been doing the last

1426
00:52:59,019 --> 00:53:05,079
a year especially especially with all

1427
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:06,489
the feminized work is stress testing you

1428
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:08,139
want to stress this a shit out of the

1429
00:53:06,489 --> 00:53:10,479
plants you're breeding with because if

1430
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:12,069
you stress test them then when you breed

1431
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,139
with them you're less likely because

1432
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:16,390
those I was talking to rob Clark and

1433
00:53:14,139 --> 00:53:24,549
Mojave don't even know I don't know who

1434
00:53:16,389 --> 00:53:26,920
they are so we're talking about manisha

1435
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:28,690
species dioecious so Manisha's plants

1436
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:31,000
basically are the plants that

1437
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:33,490
hermaphrodite they have both male and

1438
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,480
female organs on them and how do you

1439
00:53:33,489 --> 00:53:40,118
feel about that as his feminized lung

1440
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:41,769
like are you seeing that a lot it's not

1441
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:45,010
just him it's a lot of people and I feel

1442
00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:48,309
like I you know I I haven't seen it

1443
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:49,930
personally I can't comment on that but I

1444
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:52,358
just feel like a lot of readers aren't

1445
00:53:49,929 --> 00:53:54,049
properly stress testing their plants if

1446
00:53:52,358 --> 00:53:55,789
they're trying to breed stuff that does

1447
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:58,030
and have hermaphrodite rates I mean the

1448
00:53:55,789 --> 00:54:00,489
biggest problem is that a lot of people

1449
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:02,960
you know you can stand behind

1450
00:54:00,489 --> 00:54:04,819
feminization and all you want but the

1451
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:08,900
reality is that these plants are just so

1452
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:11,120
fucking sneaky they're not gonna wait

1453
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:12,460
around for you not listening to rules

1454
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,719
put it that way when you're like it's

1455
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:15,889
impossible it's like no it is not we've

1456
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:18,259
seen it happen the thing is especially

1457
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:20,210
when we're now talking about millions

1458
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:21,470
and millions and millions of seeds at a

1459
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:23,360
time that are actually getting grown

1460
00:54:21,469 --> 00:54:24,919
because before there wasn't that many

1461
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,440
places that you could get to see

1462
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:28,610
somebody put down four million seeds you

1463
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,559
know I mean but now it's happening

1464
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:32,180
because that's because the hemp crops so

1465
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,309
people are seeing four million seeds and

1466
00:54:32,179 --> 00:54:36,219
they're going like okay well 275

1467
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:39,409
thousand of those four million are

1468
00:54:36,219 --> 00:54:40,669
autoflowering and the other 275 thousand

1469
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:42,829
are doing this and then you know so

1470
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:44,450
there these are real like true numbers

1471
00:54:42,829 --> 00:54:46,460
that are coming out that are like okay

1472
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:49,009
now we're gonna get some real data and

1473
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:51,349
yeah I'm not trying to like bash on the

1474
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:55,460
guy like no I mean he has great stuff

1475
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:59,659
but just from the comas problem is that

1476
00:54:55,460 --> 00:55:01,579
he's so cocky that like I don't think

1477
00:54:59,659 --> 00:55:05,029
he'll gain he will probably replace as

1478
00:55:01,579 --> 00:55:07,610
she replaced everything I had plus okay

1479
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:09,320
so here so beef with that I'm just

1480
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:11,090
saying like with all this feminized

1481
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:14,690
stuff and especially with the hemp

1482
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:16,910
that's coming online yeah all the organ

1483
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:18,829
hemp company oh that's like so the hemp

1484
00:55:16,909 --> 00:55:21,019
industry they're some of the companies I

1485
00:55:18,829 --> 00:55:22,909
feel like that's a scaling issue that

1486
00:55:21,019 --> 00:55:25,340
we're seeing with hemp right now it's

1487
00:55:22,909 --> 00:55:26,690
cuz what happened is we need all these

1488
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:28,130
hemp seeds cuz everybody's come online

1489
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:29,539
to grow hemp and so everyone's growing

1490
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:30,590
all those hemp seed outdoors and we're

1491
00:55:29,539 --> 00:55:32,960
getting cross-pollination

1492
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:34,760
but when these companies first started

1493
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,590
they had like intersexual traits of like

1494
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:39,890
Oh point zero two percent which is like

1495
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:41,840
one in 5,000 male or hermaphrodite but

1496
00:55:39,889 --> 00:55:44,449
this the fact is that if you're growing

1497
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:46,280
seeds outdoors you're more than likely

1498
00:55:44,449 --> 00:55:47,119
gonna get cross pollinated by other

1499
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:50,510
stuff right

1500
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:52,670
whether it's regs from you know THC or

1501
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:54,380
whether it's other hemp you're gonna get

1502
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:56,269
that cross-pollination and I feel like

1503
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:58,730
the government is gonna start regulating

1504
00:55:56,269 --> 00:56:01,250
its and make people either grow in

1505
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:03,199
greenhouses that are basically with wet

1506
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:05,269
walls that prevent cross-pollination or

1507
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:06,439
indoors and you can't even sell seeds to

1508
00:56:05,269 --> 00:56:09,519
Germany right now like

1509
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:11,990
hemp seeds unless you have phytosanitary

1510
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:16,190
certification and I believe you need a

1511
00:56:11,989 --> 00:56:17,929
cgmp certification okay well that's the

1512
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:19,159
most anal place in the world of course

1513
00:56:17,929 --> 00:56:21,679
of course they're gonna make you

1514
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:24,379
effective they want legend rockwool yeah

1515
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:28,190
I'm not gonna let you come through easy

1516
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:31,190
yeah and it's but it's cool to see that

1517
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:33,650
because we're figuring out quickly also

1518
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:36,858
that as far as the hemp game goes that

1519
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:38,630
the window for all the CBD guys is

1520
00:56:36,858 --> 00:56:41,538
closing a real fast you know I mean like

1521
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:43,940
there gonna be some sore people this

1522
00:56:41,539 --> 00:56:46,160
year when they realize that what they

1523
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:47,599
you know thought was gonna be 30 million

1524
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:49,399
dollars worth of something is gonna be

1525
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:50,900
worth three hundred thousand or

1526
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,670
something and if they if they can get it

1527
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:54,530
even to process you know I mean that's

1528
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:57,289
that's the issue that we're running into

1529
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:59,390
a lot of bottom oh this is so much hot

1530
00:56:57,289 --> 00:57:00,440
so much I imagine what imagine like he

1531
00:56:59,389 --> 00:57:02,358
was saying with a cross-pollination

1532
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,858
imagine what's gonna happen in both

1533
00:57:02,358 --> 00:57:05,509
directions right like there's gonna be a

1534
00:57:03,858 --> 00:57:07,009
whole bunch of shitty weed being grown

1535
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:08,510
cuz people are gonna be like oh I got

1536
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:10,609
this fire well when they're growing in

1537
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:13,180
making seeds from seed rather than using

1538
00:57:10,608 --> 00:57:15,650
clones so like if you really want to do

1539
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:17,778
breeding I feel like it's more ideal to

1540
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:19,880
use a clone for your receiver and then

1541
00:57:17,778 --> 00:57:21,619
you know it's like with your donor as

1542
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,240
well selecting that donor that you know

1543
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:24,440
that's tried-and-true when you're making

1544
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,699
your seeds but a lot of people aren't

1545
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:28,940
even testing their seeds they're just

1546
00:57:25,699 --> 00:57:30,169
selling bulk seed you know at a dollar

1547
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:31,519
apiece they're selling a hundred

1548
00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:33,108
thousand two hundred thousand a million

1549
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:35,239
seeds to some of these companies and

1550
00:57:33,108 --> 00:57:41,900
they're not even testing oh we saw stuff

1551
00:57:35,239 --> 00:57:46,068
that was 13% zero for all the zero

1552
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:47,480
percent CBDs that's general I think

1553
00:57:46,068 --> 00:57:49,608
we're fucked

1554
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:51,260
yeah you have nothing to harvest at all

1555
00:57:49,608 --> 00:57:53,509
there you know well and we haven't

1556
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:54,980
figured out cannabis whether it's hemp

1557
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:56,630
or whether it's marijuana we haven't

1558
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:58,400
figured out like the tomato industry is

1559
00:57:56,630 --> 00:58:01,430
gonna wanna I mean it's all cannabis

1560
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:04,579
it's all cannabis but you don't karen

1561
00:58:01,429 --> 00:58:06,679
oncidi i can't believe it yeah it's all

1562
00:58:04,579 --> 00:58:10,339
cannabis right and that's all you know

1563
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:12,558
we've can like we have waved in their

1564
00:58:10,338 --> 00:58:13,969
face so hard with this smokeable hemp

1565
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,610
right now like to the point where it's

1566
00:58:13,969 --> 00:58:19,429
like like I know I'm not smoking smoking

1567
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:21,890
but all shitload of people are out there

1568
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:24,109
and it's weird because like we the whole

1569
00:58:21,889 --> 00:58:26,420
point of us getting it legal is to say

1570
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:28,340
hey it's not only we're gonna smoke it

1571
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:30,349
or anything but Austin was like that's

1572
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:34,360
all our doing what's marijuana so easy

1573
00:58:30,349 --> 00:58:36,079
so it's just high cannabinoid low THC

1574
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,670
cannabis you know I mean that's this

1575
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,699
pretty much and that's why the people

1576
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:42,530
that are growing good are getting you

1577
00:58:40,699 --> 00:58:44,779
know 300 bucks a pound let's say four

1578
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:46,250
four they're smokable him but that

1579
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:47,540
market is gonna drop soon too because

1580
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:48,980
we're so I can't wait to see all the

1581
00:58:47,539 --> 00:58:50,420
smokeable have this super fire though

1582
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:55,219
that's coming out for sure

1583
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:57,139
oh it's there's not as it's there's

1584
00:58:55,219 --> 00:58:59,059
technically but it's not there no one's

1585
00:58:57,139 --> 00:59:01,519
been producing it and large greenhouses

1586
00:58:59,059 --> 00:59:05,559
are not that I'm sliding though not in

1587
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:09,170
quantity is there gonna be a drought 2.0

1588
00:59:05,559 --> 00:59:11,869
no no not like what again somewhere

1589
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:13,760
where shit went up to like 20 something

1590
00:59:11,869 --> 00:59:16,309
honey problem is like the problem is

1591
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:19,400
that everybody saw that happening and

1592
00:59:16,309 --> 00:59:21,019
our our reactions are so slow they're

1593
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,760
quick and yet slow at the same time cuz

1594
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:24,619
for stoners right so our reactions are

1595
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:26,360
like we're all thinking the same thing

1596
00:59:24,619 --> 00:59:27,739
but no one's really getting up to do it

1597
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,570
yet and then all of a sudden it's like

1598
00:59:27,739 --> 00:59:31,519
one day no one shows up and they're all

1599
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:33,320
out doing it and then they all come back

1600
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:35,719
online and it's like oh shit now we're

1601
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,370
all getting that we're all cashing in at

1602
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:39,619
the same time and what we thought was

1603
00:59:37,369 --> 00:59:43,460
all you know so that those markets I

1604
00:59:39,619 --> 00:59:45,019
feel like we're you know the problem

1605
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:46,970
there's always going to be a shortage of

1606
00:59:45,019 --> 00:59:48,619
good weeds right there's always a

1607
00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:51,799
shortage of good week but there's gonna

1608
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:53,029
be way too much weed way too much

1609
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,560
you know the black markets really

1610
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:56,480
changed - because metrics aren't in

1611
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:59,150
place in California so we have all these

1612
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,409
license companies that who knows where

1613
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:02,450
it's coming from it could be coming from

1614
01:00:00,409 --> 01:00:04,250
those license companies and cuz the

1615
01:00:02,449 --> 01:00:06,559
black markets died that those guys have

1616
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:08,510
been humbled and in Sonoma and in

1617
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:10,340
Mendocino this is guys and even down

1618
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:12,470
here those guys got hit hard this year

1619
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:19,059
but there's still a lot of black market

1620
01:00:12,469 --> 01:00:24,429
pot out there so I have no idea no idea

1621
01:00:19,059 --> 01:00:27,049
it's cut the moon it's a it's

1622
01:00:24,429 --> 01:00:29,839
interesting how like I saw it maybe

1623
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:32,240
about five years ago maybe even longer

1624
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:35,960
maybe seven years ago somebody in New

1625
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:37,489
York was telling me about like $1500

1626
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:40,190
packs of Sour Diesel right and it was

1627
01:00:37,489 --> 01:00:42,529
all from from from out here somewhere

1628
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:44,780
and it was like that's it it's over you

1629
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:46,610
know it's over if it's the same price on

1630
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:48,530
both coasts see that I mean like what is

1631
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:50,900
there to be said anymore and that was

1632
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:52,040
you know like I said seven years ago or

1633
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:54,289
something like that so the saturation

1634
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:56,360
points are getting like Oregon's a good

1635
01:00:54,289 --> 01:00:58,009
example if you go to Oregon and see what

1636
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:00,079
like they have six years worth of weed

1637
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:01,550
and storage six years and it's all just

1638
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:03,019
rotting and you know I really like it

1639
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:05,000
it's nothing nothing's getting better

1640
01:01:03,019 --> 01:01:08,900
I mean it's oh yeah it's gonna be the

1641
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:12,739
state of CDN for sure and and and just

1642
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:14,450
the fact that like that's one that's

1643
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:16,219
because they could they can grow pretty

1644
01:01:14,449 --> 01:01:18,169
pretty good there you know it's it's

1645
01:01:16,219 --> 01:01:20,869
like NorCal has become Southern Oregon

1646
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:22,099
really when it comes to the the way even

1647
01:01:20,869 --> 01:01:25,400
the way the weather is moving like it's

1648
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:27,170
all kind of moving up this sweet spots

1649
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:30,559
are all up there and they just can grow

1650
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:32,960
too good you know so and I think once it

1651
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:35,389
goes national then Central California

1652
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:39,139
will control the market as they do with

1653
01:01:35,389 --> 01:01:41,119
all the other agriculture too so yeah

1654
01:01:39,139 --> 01:01:43,400
yeah once interstate sales go online

1655
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,829
that's gonna be big-time game-changer

1656
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:51,170
for Oregon well they're the one I mean

1657
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:53,269
they actually pushed and for ya to be

1658
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:59,450
able to sell out of state which since

1659
01:01:53,269 --> 01:02:01,159
its usual thot it's pretty awesome if

1660
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:02,629
they can if they can pull that off then

1661
01:02:01,159 --> 01:02:03,649
that's really like the beginning of the

1662
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:05,809
end of the whole thing I mean that's

1663
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:07,250
when it starts to crumble because it'll

1664
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:09,130
just set precedents for other states to

1665
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:10,719
follow now

1666
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:12,789
organ stops for doings are switching

1667
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:14,679
over to hemp licenses because in places

1668
01:02:12,789 --> 01:02:16,059
are cheaper you don't have to deal with

1669
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:17,919
all the headache and all the bullshit in

1670
01:02:16,059 --> 01:02:18,940
all the hoops so we're just paying 500

1671
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,769
bucks couldn't have license and

1672
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:22,539
switching over I was there a few weeks

1673
01:02:20,768 --> 01:02:24,758
ago and it was it was pretty amazing to

1674
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:27,519
drag and to drive to the one farm that I

1675
01:02:24,759 --> 01:02:29,889
had to go to I just passed probably 15

1676
01:02:27,518 --> 01:02:32,768
or 20 farms and didn't see a single

1677
01:02:29,889 --> 01:02:34,750
person out and it was kind of like eerie

1678
01:02:32,768 --> 01:02:36,159
because it was like wow there's a lot of

1679
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:37,900
harvesting to be done here and a lot of

1680
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:40,000
work and I don't see a single person out

1681
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:41,548
there doing any proof like no one's kind

1682
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,929
of felt like they were ready for it and

1683
01:02:41,548 --> 01:02:46,659
this is no this is a few weeks ago so

1684
01:02:43,929 --> 01:02:48,399
it's Peru before the that kind of snap

1685
01:02:46,659 --> 01:02:49,960
came through but and we had it in

1686
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,579
Colorado we had one day like we had just

1687
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:54,548
like all of a sudden out of nowhere we

1688
01:02:51,579 --> 01:02:59,019
had one day that dropped down to the low

1689
01:02:54,548 --> 01:03:01,298
of 20 and the high of 38 and snow and

1690
01:02:59,018 --> 01:03:04,000
then the day before was 70 degrees and

1691
01:03:01,298 --> 01:03:06,518
the day after or was 87 degrees the day

1692
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,619
before in 78 degrees the day after so

1693
01:03:06,518 --> 01:03:10,088
just this weird like one day snap but

1694
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:12,700
there's a lot of hemp farmers losing

1695
01:03:10,088 --> 01:03:13,719
money of cost they scale too big they

1696
01:03:12,699 --> 01:03:16,088
don't know what they're doing

1697
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:18,459
I mean I heard about some farmers in

1698
01:03:16,088 --> 01:03:20,259
oiled committing suicide I don't know if

1699
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:23,230
you guys heard about that no no it was

1700
01:03:20,259 --> 01:03:26,108
that real I don't know but it seemed

1701
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:27,880
Wade you know a lesson for everybody you

1702
01:03:26,108 --> 01:03:29,288
know that even if it's not real it seems

1703
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:32,440
very orchestrated it was one of those

1704
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:34,660
stories where you're like okay maybe it

1705
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:36,730
seems very yeah I mean you lose a bunch

1706
01:03:34,659 --> 01:03:42,159
of someone's money like that I don't

1707
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:43,929
know no you picked the right stocks yeah

1708
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:46,210
you definitely picked the right plant

1709
01:03:43,929 --> 01:03:47,558
for hanging yourself that's that's what

1710
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:50,380
she was if you wouldn't deal with your

1711
01:03:47,559 --> 01:03:53,170
own with your own hard-earned I mean I

1712
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:56,220
paid money to the GoFundMe page so

1713
01:03:53,170 --> 01:03:56,220
there's really kidding

1714
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:59,980
no I saw that story and I was a little

1715
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:01,089
bit like skeptical because it was almost

1716
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:03,010
like it was one of those deals where

1717
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:04,269
you're like I was standing in line and

1718
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:05,380
the girl turn around you read the whole

1719
01:04:04,269 --> 01:04:09,150
thing and then you realize this is just

1720
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:09,150
a trolli thing like what

1721
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:16,799
so what else what's up

1722
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:16,800
what grinds your gears
