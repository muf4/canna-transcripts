1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,048
we've got to support the consumer I

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:06,599
think the consumers the person in the

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:09,929
room they legitimately is the most

4
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:12,718
marginalised I if you go into a store

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:16,890
just to buy an eighth of cannabis it is

6
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:19,739
upwards of $90 $90 week cannabis is

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,050
taxed at 30 to 50 percent it is one of

8
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:24,358
the highest taxed commodities that there

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,880
is and higher than cigarettes and

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,980
alcohol which kill you by the way and

11
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,899
cannabis does not that this is

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,000
legitimately medicine for some people

13
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:36,689
that they cannot get and they cannot

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,700
afford got vicodin and a hydrate or

15
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:41,128
vicodin and opiates there are 5 dollars

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,590
and 14 cents when you go to the pharmacy

17
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:45,659
so if your medication is 5 dollars and

18
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,280
14 cents and you'd rather get off of it

19
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,078
and get on to cannabis but your

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,179
insurance company won't cover it and

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:57,739
it's $90 per 1/8 it's $100 to get CBD at

22
00:00:54,179 --> 00:01:01,679
like cannabis CBD 8g into one pills are

23
00:00:57,738 --> 00:01:05,188
$90 for account of less than 60 it's

24
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:07,739
it's uh it's incorrigible that the

25
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:09,359
industry is out for this 125 million

26
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,789
dollar payday that we're bringing in

27
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,319
capital and we're not screaming from the

28
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,659
rooftops that the taxes are too high

29
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,629
because there is nobody to sell it to

30
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,479
you if they cannot afford to buy it and

31
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:24,390
so if you are spending as much time

32
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:27,299
supporting these legislative efforts

33
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:29,579
then you will have no market share to

34
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,368
speak of because nobody will be able to

35
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:34,379
afford it I can find my medicine I have

36
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:36,118
clients that I'm able to you know

37
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:38,548
procure product from but that's not

38
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,019
everybody's situation clearly but I'm

39
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,450
not just talking about medical the

40
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:44,670
medical market is truly suffering but if

41
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,219
the recreational market if the adult use

42
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,368
market can't afford to pay then the

43
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:52,590
entire system collapses so I sometimes

44
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:54,359
gets cast in in a way where we're

45
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,790
because medical is so important and it's

46
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:59,519
suffering more I want you to understand

47
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,799
that if you have no customers the rest

48
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:03,420
of the supply chain doesn't matter so it

49
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,969
is your problem because I have operators

50
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,978
that will say or I've heard operators

51
00:02:05,968 --> 00:02:10,439
say well that's not really my problem my

52
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:12,479
problem is is running my business you

53
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,990
have to have a market and we will have

54
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:14,879
over

55
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,640
surgence of the black of the illicit

56
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,509
market if we are not careful in

57
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:24,000
protecting the the taxation issue also

58
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:26,399
just you know fun little facts if a city

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,919
charges you a tax to operate that is not

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,460
then attacks that you assess to the

61
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:35,339
customer that is your tax to operate

62
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:39,900
your business that allows you to make

63
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:42,120
money is i think that's a real important

64
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,510
issue that when CDI TFA comes and starts

65
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,120
doing these audits it is actually not

66
00:02:44,509 --> 00:02:49,979
lawful to pass on that tax so when you

67
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,980
write or receipt and i have seen this

68
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:54,929
happen there is a sales and use tax the

69
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,519
excise tax that somehow is applied at

70
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,530
the retailer which its first have

71
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,870
already being in the cost of the of the

72
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:04,469
product so you've got sales and use tax

73
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:09,360
excise tax city an additional city tax

74
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:12,870
and then the final cost that last item

75
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,030
that lasts like oh they charge me five

76
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,900
dollar five percent gross sales receipts

77
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:21,900
tax that's your company's tax that is

78
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,700
not the consumer tax be forewarned we're

79
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,010
gonna see lawsuits surrounding that

80
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:30,169
either from the public to those

81
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:30,169
operators or fines from CD t fa
