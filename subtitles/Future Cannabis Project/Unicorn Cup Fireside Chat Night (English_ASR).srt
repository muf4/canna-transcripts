all right cool uh welcome to the Unicorn

60
00:03:13,378 --> 00:03:17,098
cup

61
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,379
we're here for the fireside chat and a

62
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:21,359
question was asked about perspective I

63
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:22,859
think so I'm not the only uh Californian

64
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,140
here

65
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,340
two two like like currently like

66
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,318
operating though in terms of like

67
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,800
operational right and so the question

68
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,958
was what's my view on the Canadian

69
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,920
cannabis industry as I sit here in

70
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,719
person

71
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,818
and

72
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,620
it's interesting because to me I mean I

73
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,259
I'm familiar with the industry right in

74
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,319
in Canada and the evolution of it became

75
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:48,780
almost identity-less where your package

76
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,759
looks like I have no idea what's in the

77
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,000
package they don't even have an identity

78
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:56,399
on the pack except a a stick on label so

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,780
I I look at it and I'm like you're

80
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,719
taking the identity away from the

81
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,419
cultivators and so Canada

82
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,818
it over corporatized it to the point

83
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:08,878
where it's almost impossible for a small

84
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:11,280
person to gain traction without some

85
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,199
collaborative effort and it's odd

86
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,199
because to me you know Canada had such a

87
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,759
thriving craft Community for so long

88
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,220
and

89
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,899
the the lack of ability to be seen in

90
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,400
any way that lets you highlight your

91
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,478
differences that lets you showcase what

92
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,978
you do

93
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,599
um some kind of identity on a package

94
00:04:25,978 --> 00:04:29,699
you know like I like looked at the walls

95
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,320
and I knew some of the companies so we I

96
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,699
decided somebody take me to a store so I

97
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:34,500
was able to kind of understand how do

98
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:38,759
you purchase at a store here

99
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,379
and it was just very hard to identify

100
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,479
with the product and understand what you

101
00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:44,159
wanted to get and then expectations of

102
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,500
what the quality was in the bag

103
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,880
and so hopefully you know just like us

104
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,560
in California we go through an evolution

105
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:51,719
here

106
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,100
I just think that really we're early and

107
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,280
we are we're early in the new world of

108
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,720
industry and there's teething pains and

109
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:59,698
the truth of it is that the people who

110
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,860
regulate and control have very little

111
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,240
understanding and the truth that I

112
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,060
learned is that

113
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,280
they regulate us so hard because they

114
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,720
believe we're so sneaky and the only way

115
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:11,159
you could believe that is if you were

116
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,680
sneaky yourself

117
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,020
and so what I learned was that you guys

118
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,879
are really dirty and you think we'd

119
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:19,680
screw you this hard and this is why

120
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,959
you're doing it to us so it's really

121
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,000
inside I nailed it with the uh stealing

122
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:26,279
of the identity I I don't know how to

123
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,019
buy in a cannabis store in Canada when I

124
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:29,939
walk into it everything looks the same

125
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:31,620
all the packaging looks the same I'm

126
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:33,779
often like where's the hash like where's

127
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,939
the extract and sometimes they'll have a

128
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:37,739
little sort of spot I mean down to the

129
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,319
covering of the windows you see all of

130
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,960
that is done under the guise of

131
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,339
protecting children that's how that's

132
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,198
how they do it you can't have the

133
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:48,000
windows open you have to make it very

134
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,560
safe for people to come in and Rob you

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,478
so they don't get caught and so you

136
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,699
cover all the front windows because God

137
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:56,399
forbid if a child walked by that store

138
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:58,259
and saw through the window it's okay if

139
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,879
they see the you know massive amounts of

140
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,620
alcohol that kill millions of people

141
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:04,379
annually right next door at the liquor

142
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,959
store but if they see cannabis products

143
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:09,959
through the window you've now broken a

144
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:13,019
federal law in Canada and so and also

145
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:15,180
the packaging you can't you can't have

146
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:17,819
fun fonts you can't have anything that

147
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,160
looks like it was a cartoon or any type

148
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,139
of unique cool packaging because of

149
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,699
course that as well is with their

150
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:26,100
marketing to children that's what

151
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,919
they're doing so they they allowed us to

152
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,780
have Federal legalization in Canada but

153
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:32,399
under the guise that it's a dangerous

154
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:34,258
thing that children need to be protected

155
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,519
from and that's what's led us to where

156
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:38,879
we are right now

157
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,219
I think a lot of the laws were copy and

158
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,918
pasted directly from alcohol and tobacco

159
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,319
and and we're forced to to shoulder our

160
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:49,978
way out of them so in Canada I think

161
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,479
it's it's the issue becomes when you

162
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:54,478
can't

163
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:57,180
when when the two goals of legalization

164
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:00,240
are protecting children from Cannabis

165
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,800
and converting the black market but the

166
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,660
regulations are written in such a way

167
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,280
that the only way

168
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,680
somebody can move quickly in this market

169
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:11,279
is to raise an egregious amount of money

170
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,800
legally and then deploy that Capital it

171
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,478
turns to Bay Street which is Canada's

172
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,240
Wall Street to raise all this Capital

173
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:19,560
quickly and then completely misallocate

174
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,598
it and that's what's happening in Canada

175
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,478
where we had an incredible opportunity

176
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,459
to become a world leader in cannabis and

177
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:30,538
what happened was

178
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:34,019
greet greet White Collar businessman and

179
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:36,300
stock Brokers and analysts who took the

180
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:37,740
square footage of your property and not

181
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,720
the square footage of the building on

182
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,978
that property and appraised the value of

183
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,020
your company and how many buildable

184
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:45,598
square feet there were on your acreage

185
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:48,180
versus your 10 000 square foot building

186
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:50,219
and then raise Capital based on that are

187
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,560
the the the the problem in this industry

188
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,840
and if we were too able if we were able

189
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,680
to properly allocate half of the capital

190
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:00,299
that was raised in Canada we would be in

191
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,180
a much better position than we are today

192
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:06,478
and we've lost all trust in retail

193
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:09,538
investorship and so there's a lot of uh

194
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:11,758
jaded individuals who listen to a lot of

195
00:08:09,538 --> 00:08:13,199
people who promised that they were here

196
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,759
to build this industry in here for the

197
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,860
Long Haul and they're no longer here

198
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:18,360
anymore and it's three years later

199
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,860
um they're they're literally some of

200
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,000
them are raising money to go fucking

201
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,800
mine asteroids so you know we we have an

202
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,379
issue here where the people who actually

203
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,720
care are left pick up the pieces of a

204
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:34,099
system that doesn't cater to the people

205
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,099
who got it to where it is today

206
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:40,259
there is the First Nations part of

207
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,419
Canada too which does have a lot more

208
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:44,519
open

209
00:08:41,418 --> 00:08:46,559
availability to do different things so

210
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:49,379
if you go into a dispensary on a First

211
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,659
Nations like land you can't have a

212
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:53,958
different experience so yeah American

213
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:56,579
average individual go there yeah yeah

214
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:58,500
you know and when you when you link up

215
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,820
with uh you know the First Nations who

216
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,720
want to do something different you know

217
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,720
it really does help

218
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,360
and they have the ability to create

219
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,940
their own laws and their own abilities

220
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,000
uh through packaging and working with

221
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,779
farms and stuff so there there is

222
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,539
um

223
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:17,639
a way to affect federal laws through

224
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:19,679
that to show them you know with maybe

225
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:20,879
different Taxation and different uh

226
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,179
brackets and different ways of working

227
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,919
at farms direct sales

228
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:27,059
um that you know that that can make a

229
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,278
change

230
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:31,619
well and just to touch on that the the

231
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,240
the first nations are actually not

232
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,440
working with the feds at all they've

233
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,879
totally decided that they're not going

234
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,980
to have anything to do with the feds and

235
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,600
then when you ask the feds which we've

236
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,820
had plenty of meetings with the Fed so

237
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,139
like hey what are you guys going to do

238
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,000
about this what do you plan on doing

239
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:47,159
like

240
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,240
anybody want to answer that question you

241
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:50,639
know they're all looking at each other

242
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,879
on the panel so really there's an

243
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:56,659
incredible power in Canada with the

244
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:59,458
First Nations to be able to do it better

245
00:09:56,659 --> 00:10:03,000
and to be able to step out and really

246
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:05,518
check out how badly that we did it and

247
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,039
be able to step in with some better

248
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,259
protocols some better action forward and

249
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:12,059
better education to the community I just

250
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:14,278
think that you know they have gold in

251
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:16,018
their hands to maybe save this industry

252
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:18,000
honestly

253
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:21,240
oh there's definitely space this this

254
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,620
space to go forward it's just you know I

255
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,220
was I was in Berlin a number of years

256
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:29,519
ago and I was on a uh I was speaker at

257
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,980
an event and I get on this tour bus with

258
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,659
the with maybe 40 or 50 other people to

259
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,220
go to this club and everybody's asking

260
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:37,019
each other what they do

261
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,060
and everyone was some kind of investment

262
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:40,200
broker and I was the only grower on the

263
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:41,819
entire bus

264
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,080
and when people found out I was a girl

265
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,760
on the bus have you ever seen the EF

266
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,800
Hutton commercial where when EF Hutton

267
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,899
speaks everyone listens when when when

268
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,519
it you could see the murmur through the

269
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:52,500
whole bus and you could see everyone

270
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,899
turn around and go wow that's a grower

271
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,399
because they had never met one and so I

272
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,500
was like this is fascinating and I'm

273
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,659
like what are you guys doing here and

274
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,120
they said oh our world is really hard

275
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:04,439
and cannabis to us is really easy and I

276
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,419
said so you're gonna come in here and

277
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,800
they go yeah we're like locusts we go

278
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:09,539
and take everything we can and then we

279
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:12,719
move to the next industry

280
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:15,719
and it was such a a relatory

281
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,519
statement because it it helped you

282
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,620
understand the mindset of the Investment

283
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,360
Group that was coming in and so what I

284
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,399
knew at that moment was that we were

285
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,019
about to get into Carnage because the

286
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,299
people that were coming in were here not

287
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,980
to stay they were here to take as much

288
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:30,838
as they could and then go on to the next

289
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,480
industry they didn't have an emotional

290
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:35,100
connection to people or cannabis so

291
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,300
there was they were not they would it

292
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,639
was just herb it was it was a

293
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:40,679
sociopathic tendencies

294
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,078
and I was it was such a

295
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:44,699
an eye-opening moment because these were

296
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,799
the groups that were about to demolish

297
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,560
the world and they did

298
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,479
and I got to see it firsthand and so in

299
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:52,739
the U.S same issues Canada same issues

300
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,420
but I'm in I'm in a lot of countries

301
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,278
working this doesn't matter where you go

302
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:59,519
the craft Community is just getting

303
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:01,200
buried and the people that are trying to

304
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,720
bury us aren't doing a very good job

305
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,278
they're failing and that's the irony is

306
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,680
that it's almost I hate to see people

307
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:10,139
fail but I kind of don't hate to see you

308
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,778
fail it kind of makes me feel kind of

309
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:15,059
good because your intent was to destroy

310
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:17,399
everyone around you and that wasn't our

311
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:18,778
intent we we just wanted to exist as

312
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,799
producers and have a cannabis

313
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:22,019
relationship

314
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:23,759
and everyone else had this intent to

315
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,200
where we're going to take over and not

316
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,759
just get market share but we're going to

317
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,620
take your share

318
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:31,679
and that's not

319
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,720
unique to Canada or or California you

320
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,819
know that every country I'm in it's the

321
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,800
same story and the only way any of these

322
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,019
groups succeed is to actually work

323
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:42,059
collaboratively in some capacity

324
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,980
well when you said they want to bury us

325
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:45,539
you know it's an accurate metaphor and

326
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,120
the reason they didn't do a good job is

327
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:49,980
because they didn't realize that we were

328
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,159
seeds

329
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,200
and when you bury a seed

330
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:58,039
it grows

331
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,160
I mean I think it comes down to you know

332
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:04,078
when you come from that Community

333
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:07,199
you care how that Community views you

334
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:09,239
and and and and and and and sees and and

335
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,620
judges you whereas when you're not

336
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,299
connected to that Community you're

337
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,220
playing by a completely different set of

338
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:16,919
rules than somebody who has a deep

339
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,500
connection to this plan and and I think

340
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:21,838
that we all make our decisions you know

341
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,399
not based on financial enrichment but

342
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,019
you know what is best for the community

343
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,879
what's best for the plant and and

344
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:28,919
ultimately what's best for us and our

345
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,100
families but I think that you know

346
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:33,419
multiple considerations are taking place

347
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:36,120
whereas we're competing against people

348
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:37,559
who have very limited considerations the

349
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,000
consideration is listen am I going to be

350
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:41,099
financially enriched from this scenario

351
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,480
yes or no yes okay let's fucking do it

352
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,159
so

353
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,539
um you know I think that when you're

354
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,278
dealing with these these people you're

355
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:48,958
you're dealing with individuals who are

356
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:51,679
playing with a much thinner rule book

357
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,679
than you're playing with

358
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,879
you know but I also think that

359
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,379
we're kind of moving on to the next one

360
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,240
I also think that we're kind of moving

361
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,559
on to the next phase where the

362
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,120
corporations came

363
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:04,379
the big guys came they tried to make a

364
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,399
bunch of money some of them did some

365
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:11,338
didn't and now it's where does it sit

366
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,740
and it was the the concept of can you

367
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:15,600
actually do it can you actually grow

368
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,579
good cannabis at a scale

369
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,278
and now I think that we're looking at

370
00:14:17,578 --> 00:14:22,919
how since I've been to Canada I realized

371
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,838
this is a craft built Community it's a

372
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:27,419
local built community and I hope that we

373
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:30,600
see us move into more micros which is

374
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:33,958
we're about to do and really uh be able

375
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,519
to see the craft uh people get a chance

376
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,078
at this

377
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,419
um because

378
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:40,559
the the corporations did fail they're

379
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,419
they're they're making it some are

380
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,458
making it but it's not so great out

381
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:46,259
there for them and it's a and it's a

382
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:48,659
Time Cannabis has the ability to build a

383
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:51,019
completely new paradigm of corporate

384
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:51,019
structure

385
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:57,360
so you know do you see a future in the

386
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,360
micro cultivation license in cannabis

387
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,560
with the current 2150 square foot canopy

388
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,659
cap

389
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,458
I I don't think that works I think it's

390
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:10,399
set up for failure

391
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:10,399
it has to be it has to be adjusted

392
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:15,000
if they got a couple people that knew

393
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,698
what the heck they were talking about

394
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,879
and what it takes to make a buck in this

395
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:22,379
industry and still cover the coas the

396
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,838
employees that you need the record

397
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:26,519
keeping the the vaults that everything

398
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:28,680
has to be done in the infrastructure

399
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,778
that they require there's no way that

400
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:33,179
you can make money with a micro that

401
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:36,480
they just set it up for failure so until

402
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:38,698
Canada decides that you know what if if

403
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,860
if we're a flea and we got to eat on the

404
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:42,659
dog the dog's got to be alive or there's

405
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,740
going to be no blood there and so until

406
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:48,179
they figure out a way to make it

407
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,740
profitable people can't keep losing

408
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:51,599
money because the money's bleeding out

409
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,399
of investors into cannabis I see it

410
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,379
that's what it is rich people got money

411
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:59,100
and it just goes right down the tubes

412
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:01,439
and it's gone so I I hate to be negative

413
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,180
about it you know people say oh you know

414
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,040
it's bad saying you're like a bunch of

415
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:07,019
crabs in a pot you know and everybody's

416
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,819
climbing over each other and a guy

417
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,659
underneath but it's it's kind of like

418
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,000
that

419
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:13,439
well they're they're structuring it like

420
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,179
that like where we live

421
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,779
I can give you some ideas of like the

422
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:20,939
the compression so Humboldt County when

423
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:22,860
they when they flew us with the

424
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,019
satellite to really figure out how many

425
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:26,759
active grows there were they figured you

426
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:28,980
know they were able to easily pick out

427
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,059
about 35 000. and I figured there was

428
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,220
probably another ten thousand they

429
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:33,899
didn't pick up so we're talking about 45

430
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:35,339
000 grows that were present so

431
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:37,559
Humboldt's the size of the state of

432
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:39,540
Connecticut we only have 120 000 people

433
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:41,458
we would generate in about 8 billion a

434
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:43,019
year wholesale and that comes out to

435
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,939
every single human being in Humboldt

436
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:46,139
County was getting 70 grand a year so if

437
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,160
you had five people in your house you're

438
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:51,839
making 350 000 every house everybody the

439
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:53,759
money in Humboldt was Supernatural and

440
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,860
so you got to see what happened when

441
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,560
regular people get paid

442
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,320
and so we had 35 000 I think if there

443
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,778
was 45 000 how many active licenses that

444
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:07,259
occurred so they went from that 40 down

445
00:17:03,778 --> 00:17:08,578
to 1100 how many active of this year 250

446
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:11,818
and I'm one of them

447
00:17:08,578 --> 00:17:14,399
so and I I have two cultivation licenses

448
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:17,639
three that I'm tied into so I'm I'm

449
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,040
three of that 250.

450
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,720
and so how about Trinity County the

451
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,298
whole County Trinity was big so humble

452
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,519
as as an entity did 8 billion the

453
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:28,318
Emerald Triangle did 14 billion so I did

454
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,599
the economic essay for Humboldt County

455
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,460
meaning that the university came to me

456
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:34,500
for assistance years ago saying we want

457
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,779
to do the first economic index of the of

458
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,700
the impact of Black Market cannabis on

459
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:40,558
the economy and they couldn't get any

460
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,660
data and so they came to me and said

461
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,178
could you help us because and I knew we

462
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,100
needed that number to quantify our value

463
00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:48,360
as cultivators and Humboldt and I was

464
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,579
able to come up with half a billion

465
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:52,500
dollars of quantifiable data that the

466
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:54,480
that the university could use to create

467
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,160
the first economic index for cannabis

468
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,960
well I didn't know that I was going to

469
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,058
get credit for the study I just helped

470
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,620
the university out my name got put on

471
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:05,000
the study as the source of the

472
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:07,859
information it brought an ocean of

473
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,359
politicians and tax Specialists to my

474
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:11,459
office from that moment forward because

475
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,038
they said you have a unique

476
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,480
Vision into the game because no one else

477
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:18,058
is coming up with these numbers that we

478
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,980
can quantify so we want to let you know

479
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:21,298
the real numbers because we know how

480
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,740
much money is coming out of here because

481
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:24,960
we measure the cash coming out of the

482
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,940
trucks where the go where the government

483
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,980
they go you're doing 8 billion wholesale

484
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,740
and the whole triangle is doing 14. so

485
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:34,798
Mendo and Trinity were doing six so we'd

486
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:37,200
say Mendo is four Trinity is two how

487
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,000
many active licenses exist in Trinity

488
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,558
today

489
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,380
seven

490
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,819
seven active licenses right and so the

491
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,140
problem is is that everyone's like we're

492
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:48,418
all going to die off but what's really

493
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,700
taking place is we as the people are

494
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:53,160
dying off the licenses are being sold

495
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,340
and Acquired and held so that as the

496
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,558
evolution goes on those real estate

497
00:18:55,339 --> 00:19:00,599
valuations can re-rise and the value of

498
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,759
the crop can re-rise and New farmers

499
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,959
will emerge and I don't think that

500
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:06,058
they're bad people that are coming in

501
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:07,558
for the craft licenses it's just it

502
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:09,359
kills me to see every one of my

503
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:11,519
neighbors sell their farm and run for

504
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,918
their fucking lives there's also the

505
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,298
hard work variable oh yeah yeah you'll

506
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,860
love it you know what I mean you're

507
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:19,859
gonna love it you gotta fucking love

508
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:21,479
this and also you know there were a

509
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:23,699
number of individuals that got into the

510
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,019
cultivation of cannabis especially in

511
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,660
Northern California but all over the

512
00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:30,538
world globally to

513
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:33,660
um be able to execute on a certain

514
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:34,319
lifestyle that they wanted to

515
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,179
um

516
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,319
that they wanted to employ whether that

517
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:42,140
be like you know snowboarding or or or

518
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:46,558
surfing or whatever that was and and

519
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:48,120
maybe the Cannabis wasn't you know the

520
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,460
front and center thing in their lives

521
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:53,399
and and maybe

522
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,440
being dedicated and and

523
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,640
you know honing in on a hard work ethic

524
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,558
wasn't something that they were doing

525
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,360
over the years they were enjoying life

526
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,460
and doing other things and I think that

527
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:05,219
now in this legal industry where your

528
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,319
margins are slim and measurable

529
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,120
um there's a lot of individuals that

530
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:12,000
maybe don't want to do the leg lifting

531
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,279
required to to operate in the space and

532
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,538
and we're hearing a lot of complaints

533
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,460
around that and

534
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:19,619
some of that we just have to understand

535
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,120
is you know there was a lot of margin

536
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:25,319
for a long time

537
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:27,239
and so the paid guy most people most

538
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,639
people I met I mean really honestly

539
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,319
there's there's there's two cultivators

540
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,580
ones that own cultivation and ones who

541
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:34,558
cultivate

542
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:36,659
ones that own cultivation have

543
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,519
infrastructure and employees and they

544
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:40,080
get paid but they're not the ones who

545
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:41,940
physically are on the job

546
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,439
they're the ones that are leaving as

547
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,880
rapidly as possible trying to go find

548
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,259
new money but the problem is there's no

549
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,179
money to find so I'm watching them run

550
00:20:46,259 --> 00:20:50,279
from state to state to state to state to

551
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:51,840
state and I'm just like holy shit you do

552
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:53,099
better just to stay home and then

553
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,519
there's real cultivators that really

554
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:57,839
love the craft the cultivation

555
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,759
and they're still sticking with it

556
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,459
they're just trying to figure out what

557
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,079
scale they can operate and then like if

558
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,519
you ask in my opinion on stuff I'm

559
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,319
trying to tell you how to like diversify

560
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,639
and and don't whatever you do don't lose

561
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:09,720
your land don't lose your license don't

562
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,160
lose your farm

563
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,740
figure out what you got to do to keep it

564
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,900
alive and allow this Evolution to occur

565
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,460
because it will and then you're back

566
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:19,140
into the world you were supposed to be

567
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,579
and it's just that the transition is

568
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:23,340
painful

569
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:25,139
well and I think just to say to what you

570
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:26,159
were saying Jameson and also to sort of

571
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,380
touch on what you were talking about

572
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,440
Kevin is that I think that we were

573
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,900
cultivators and in that our community

574
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,900
members we are Hustlers we were talking

575
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,159
to each other and also our Equity was

576
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,700
seasonal

577
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,860
having seasonal Equity means that you

578
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,740
have Equity at a certain time of year

579
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:48,779
but that doesn't mean that all of the

580
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,279
licensing and all of the people and all

581
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:52,019
of the banks and everybody that wants

582
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:55,798
your money is working on that same

583
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:58,980
seasonal you know Equity that you have

584
00:21:55,798 --> 00:22:01,200
so that right there is one of the most

585
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,419
difficult things because I know for sure

586
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,400
in California as well as here everybody

587
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:07,980
comes for you in the spring

588
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,900
well I mean you know if if you've been

589
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,779
cultivating for a long time you know

590
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:16,140
your funds are low in the springtime so

591
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:18,379
it really isn't just people not wanting

592
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:22,140
to work hard it's people not

593
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:24,659
understanding what the work is now it's

594
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,940
like we were speaking one language and

595
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:28,860
we were doing it really well and we were

596
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,840
all speaking the same language and now

597
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:32,819
sort of this whole other thing came in

598
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:35,519
and said now we're forcing you to speak

599
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:37,740
another language well a lot of us have

600
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:40,379
been so busy continuing to work we

601
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,298
didn't have time to open up the books

602
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:45,000
and learn and speak the other language

603
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:47,099
as well as the seasonal Equity wasn't

604
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,798
there so it's just it's really important

605
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:52,798
to look at like all aspects as to why

606
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:55,259
you know the cultivators aren't the ones

607
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:57,480
who are holding the majority of licenses

608
00:22:55,259 --> 00:23:00,000
or the or the Legacy Market you know a

609
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:03,240
lot of us are still holding on but you

610
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,759
know it's challenging because you know

611
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,779
basically they're asking a fish to be a

612
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,819
tiger

613
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:11,759
and we've all been working really hard

614
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:13,918
at being fishes and we're great at it

615
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,658
so you know there's a lot of different

616
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,980
things in here oh yeah and it's not it's

617
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:19,140
definitely not just the cultivator but

618
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:21,058
like like where we are you know you're

619
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,440
different your government does distro so

620
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:24,298
government handles distro for you so

621
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,919
it's distro the the issue though is that

622
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:27,900
they're definitely not handling that

623
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,720
product gently and so you're having

624
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:33,059
distro that's destroying the quality of

625
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,860
your consumption and that's not the

626
00:23:33,058 --> 00:23:36,418
cultivator's fault but no one knows how

627
00:23:34,859 --> 00:23:38,158
to blame anybody but the cultivator but

628
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:40,200
what we are it's the distribution

629
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,460
straight up steals your money I'm

630
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,200
talking straight up steals your money

631
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:46,200
and Falls up and leaves and you have

632
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,419
zero the only company that I can trust

633
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,679
is is a giant one and everyone trips on

634
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:51,538
dealing with giant companies they're the

635
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,460
only ones to pay every one of these

636
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:54,839
other distros screws you and all they

637
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,759
have to do is make a single error they

638
00:23:54,839 --> 00:24:00,599
make a single era and they lose a

639
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:02,579
license for 24 48 72 hours they have to

640
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:05,099
unload their entire business and then

641
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:07,038
get so you make any errors in lab or you

642
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:10,019
make any errors in distro

643
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:12,480
you destroy I mean we're talking tiny

644
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:14,400
errors you're destroyed and the amount

645
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,220
of oversight is heavy my storefront

646
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,360
we've had eight inspections now eight

647
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,919
with I mean I'm talking they come

648
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:21,240
through and dump out the garbage they go

649
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,280
through all the stuff and I go what are

650
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,558
you looking for they go tobacco residue

651
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,819
and and consumption of alcohol evidence

652
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:28,019
and I'm like who the fuck's smoking

653
00:24:26,819 --> 00:24:30,178
cigarettes and drinking booze in the

654
00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:34,220
dispensary I'm looking at him I'm like

655
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,220
this is crazy but that's what we got

656
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:36,839
[Music]

657
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,360
um

658
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:41,178
I I think I'm a bit stubborn where I

659
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,639
refuse to fail

660
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:45,900
and uh and I think part of that is

661
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,960
because

662
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,759
um I care so much about our community

663
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:53,400
and all of the Legacy Growers and the

664
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:56,099
plant and I can see all the negative

665
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,919
aspects of legalization and how things

666
00:24:56,099 --> 00:25:00,779
have unfolded and and quite honestly I

667
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:02,340
knew it was going to go down like that

668
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:04,259
because I knew the moment that

669
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:07,798
legalization happened and all these

670
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:09,960
large corporations got into power that

671
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:12,480
they wouldn't want to you know pay their

672
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,759
labor to prune and they would scale up

673
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,980
so you know large that they would have

674
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:20,460
to use pesticides and they would fail

675
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:23,279
and I saw like I predicted all of that

676
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,980
and I knew that Mama cannabis is

677
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:29,480
actually in charge and we're all as

678
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:33,480
Growers infused with her and

679
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:36,120
greed is never going to win and the only

680
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,179
thing that's going to win is

681
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:42,000
um you know people coming together as a

682
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:45,240
community and as a collective and that's

683
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,839
part of legalization too it's forcing us

684
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:52,079
to evolve it's forcing us to come out of

685
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:54,538
our own individual lives and come

686
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,740
together and work hard together and

687
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:58,619
that's something that we've been doing

688
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:01,440
here in the Kootenays as well and you

689
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:03,418
know I understand the regulations suck

690
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,159
and that it's hard and difficult to

691
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:07,799
understand and I understand that the

692
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:10,980
government did this in a way to destroy

693
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:13,619
our culture but we still like I just

694
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:16,620
refuse to give up and I and it's like we

695
00:26:13,619 --> 00:26:18,599
need to come together as a collective we

696
00:26:16,619 --> 00:26:21,959
need to work we need to find the

697
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:24,139
administrative people and you know do it

698
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,000
as a giant team and as a community

699
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:30,179
because the world needs us

700
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,759
and the world needs cannabis Growers and

701
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:36,120
the Cannabis Community to help us evolve

702
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:38,700
and shift into a new Direction

703
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:40,019
I think that the faster the craft

704
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,000
community

705
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:44,599
can understand that they're no longer

706
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,579
just selling a a

707
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:49,859
biomass but they're they're also selling

708
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:53,460
their story they're creating their brand

709
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:55,859
and they're telling telling us a a tale

710
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:58,500
of days gone by I mean we have to

711
00:26:55,859 --> 00:27:00,719
understand that you know Seagrams was

712
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,720
once some of the most badass gangsters

713
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,640
around and and not with with not a

714
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,960
pristine reputation and a hundred years

715
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,919
later they're one of the most respected

716
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:13,500
uh families in Canada and so we have to

717
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,299
apply that same understanding to our

718
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:18,058
culture that is slowly going to be

719
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:19,558
eroded and and destroyed over this next

720
00:27:18,058 --> 00:27:21,298
hundred years where we have to Champion

721
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:23,278
it and we have to tell those stories So

722
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:25,259
the faster that these small craft

723
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,900
producers understand that they're not

724
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:30,000
just selling

725
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,400
hash rosin or they're not just selling

726
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,019
cured flour but they're selling a brand

727
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,360
and a story behind that and they're

728
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:38,278
selling you know their their Equity

729
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:39,119
partners and and the way that they take

730
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:41,220
care of the flower and what

731
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:43,979
differentiates them and and where they

732
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:45,480
came from I think the faster that

733
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,700
those individuals are going to be able

734
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,380
to really short lure out that Niche that

735
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,140
they need in the market and identify

736
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,400
their consumers because realistically we

737
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,600
know the consumers are out there we just

738
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,759
got to fucking identify them and get

739
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:58,980
them into the stores

740
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:01,140
I think there there's an evolution

741
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,400
happening too with just plant medicine

742
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,100
in general

743
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,960
so there's a lot with Legacy and craft

744
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:09,839
Growers that they can do in the new

745
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,360
paradigm of new plant medicines and so

746
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:15,778
maybe it's not just Mama ganja which we

747
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:17,879
love so much and that's led the way into

748
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:20,339
these new laws coming in so it's really

749
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,640
important for us to continue to advocate

750
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:26,278
for this new plant medicine laws and I

751
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,259
think as we also recognize part of

752
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:30,599
building regenerative Farms or having

753
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:32,220
you know the Dem peer certified Farms or

754
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:34,619
whatever was to build a sanctuary

755
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,058
because it was like oh it makes the

756
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:38,339
gardens healthier and it makes the

757
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:40,019
trichomes more alively and stuff but

758
00:28:38,339 --> 00:28:43,019
then you also realize wow it makes me

759
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:45,058
feel so good in here and everyone that

760
00:28:43,019 --> 00:28:46,500
comes by is like wow you have this Oasis

761
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:49,619
and all this food I didn't know that

762
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:52,200
food looked like that little lilocois or

763
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:54,418
kiwis whatever it is male and female you

764
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,460
know some plants won't bloom and then

765
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:59,038
all of a sudden you realize wow I

766
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,778
couldn't start a nursery of just super

767
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:03,298
foods and just bringing people in and

768
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:05,700
then even just now the whole new

769
00:29:03,298 --> 00:29:07,980
wave of Tourism you know and bringing

770
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,720
people in and camping setups and having

771
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:12,058
people just breathe the air and being

772
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,558
able to walk the gardens and we talked

773
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:15,119
about like it'd be fun to like have like

774
00:29:13,558 --> 00:29:16,678
you pick where someone comes and they

775
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:17,939
camp and they like I'll buy that plant

776
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,278
at the end of the year that would be

777
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:24,058
amazing you know but just the idea of

778
00:29:20,278 --> 00:29:26,519
you know bringing the micros up to a the

779
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:29,038
research I mean uh the farm gate sales

780
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,079
you know where we can

781
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,298
we need to be able to give the medicine

782
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:35,639
which created the whole thing you know

783
00:29:33,298 --> 00:29:37,859
so if if we are having a hard time

784
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,778
selling the weed which you know I'm

785
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:43,859
saying the lifestyle that's creating the

786
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:46,859
weed now is like becoming valuable as

787
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:49,500
a retreat center or something that's

788
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:51,479
giving people New Life on energetic

789
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,398
levels you know because people need to

790
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,259
be healed not just with medicine but

791
00:29:53,398 --> 00:30:01,139
with healing other healing modalities

792
00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:03,359
and I also think that you know

793
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,919
cannabis has always been deemed the

794
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,558
gateway drug

795
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:10,259
and so cannabis and we've been working

796
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:14,099
really hard to give her a place

797
00:30:10,259 --> 00:30:16,339
in the world and a lot of us all of us

798
00:30:14,099 --> 00:30:19,619
here have been incredibly already

799
00:30:16,339 --> 00:30:22,740
successful at that so now we really need

800
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:26,099
to discuss you know are we saving

801
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:28,679
ourselves or are we saving cannabis

802
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:30,839
because if you ask me I believe that

803
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:33,179
cannabis is

804
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:37,079
is well on her way

805
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:38,880
I think that she has taken Leaps and

806
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:41,879
Bounds through the education that we've

807
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,200
been put forth already I'm not saying

808
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,140
hello because I'm going to be the last

809
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,840
one holding on for sure but I also think

810
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:52,140
that it's important for us to recognize

811
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:53,639
and not have so much ego that it's not

812
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:56,038
about us

813
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,380
it's about the plan it's about the

814
00:30:56,038 --> 00:31:01,259
medicine going forward and she has

815
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,240
different modalities that she needs to

816
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:06,298
walk through and different doors that

817
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,399
she needs to be and maybe the Legacy

818
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:10,259
Market is not one that's going to get

819
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:12,778
her to the next stage that she wants to

820
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:14,460
be either not saying that the Legacy

821
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:17,278
Market is going to be done and we're

822
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,798
going to stop growing or anything like

823
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:21,298
that but just like Josh said if cannabis

824
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:23,339
is the gateway drug then that's the

825
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:25,500
gateway to ayahuasca ceremony that's the

826
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:28,500
gateway to MDMA that's the gateway to

827
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,519
LSD therapy mushrooms psychedelics all

828
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,460
of it

829
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:35,339
which we do now have the ability to jump

830
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:37,919
onto and say oh maybe it's not just

831
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:40,079
about the cannabis plant like Josh was

832
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,538
saying but it's about all of the plants

833
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:45,778
that change our lives and that we now

834
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:47,278
have this ability in Canada 2.5 grams of

835
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:49,079
any

836
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:51,179
psychedelic plant

837
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:54,359
like holy

838
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:56,640
we can really and a lot of the Legacy

839
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:58,740
Market people are the people who have

840
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,580
been doing plant medicine ceremony for

841
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:03,960
30 40 years already and we already have

842
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:06,538
been sitting with our friends in

843
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,159
psychedelic therapy for so long and a

844
00:32:06,538 --> 00:32:09,960
lot of the doctors that are taking it on

845
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,460
much like the corporate cannabis

846
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,298
industry that came in in the beginning

847
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:17,038
are going to also bastardize the message

848
00:32:14,298 --> 00:32:19,980
that that plant medicine has so I think

849
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:22,440
that we need to pull up our overalls and

850
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,940
get out there and start ushering in all

851
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,019
of the rest of the plants that need to

852
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,019
follow after cannabis

853
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,538
yeah I think I think you know I'm I'm

854
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:35,460
lucky enough because I most my family

855
00:32:33,538 --> 00:32:37,740
comes from a state that will probably be

856
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,740
the last state to legalize or medicalize

857
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:43,500
cannabis it's about five kilometers that

858
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,880
way and if I go try and drive across the

859
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,200
state with what I brought to the

860
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,960
Festival this week and they'll throw me

861
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,538
in jail for 10-year minimum but that led

862
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,419
me to becoming a cannabis Refugee moving

863
00:32:51,538 --> 00:32:56,759
to many of the early states that passed

864
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:59,399
medical and recreational laws and

865
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:02,278
allowed me to see kind of the laws pass

866
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:04,739
first in the U.S and then now here in

867
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:07,140
Canada a lot of the states when they

868
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:10,440
pass those early laws they passed fairly

869
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:12,360
restrictive laws and since then they've

870
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,000
actually come out with kind of fixer

871
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:17,278
bills that eased some of those early

872
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,980
regulations and they did that because

873
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:22,500
they didn't want to have a proliferation

874
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,298
of black market sales Etc so they rather

875
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,119
than making the industry a little bit

876
00:33:24,298 --> 00:33:29,398
too lenient they started to too tight

877
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,500
and now that there's been kind of a wave

878
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:33,658
of legalization or medicalization kind

879
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,640
of grow across the U.S now you're

880
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:38,460
starting to see States actually trying

881
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:41,460
to compete in order to be a competitive

882
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,259
market for cannabis Canada did the same

883
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,000
thing you hit on it earlier the state

884
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:47,099
the federal government the provincial

885
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,558
governments creating a government-driven

886
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:52,798
monopoly on distribution has essentially

887
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:54,960
crushed the market it was a sent DOA

888
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,879
before the industry came out because the

889
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,038
government officials did not even

890
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,500
understand the cold chain associated

891
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:03,298
with a perishable product the minute the

892
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,679
cannabinoids are harvested the minute

893
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:08,039
the plants are harvested you're starting

894
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:09,960
a decomposition that we as processors

895
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:11,519
are going to try and minimize but it

896
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,898
just like grapes and wine it's a

897
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,199
perishable product that needs to be

898
00:34:12,898 --> 00:34:17,759
maintained and

899
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,219
even though I can produce a kilo of

900
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,879
isolate for less than the kilo craft

901
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:26,638
flower in the CBD hemp Realm

902
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:28,799
we're not going to see the world you

903
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,659
know get flooded by poor low-grade

904
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,700
isolate the isolate is going to be just

905
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:34,858
like distillate a bull commodity into

906
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:37,079
the manufactured product but ultimately

907
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:39,119
like alcohol you know I can go buy I can

908
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,679
make a gallon ethanol at home for less

909
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,358
than a dollar a gallon I can go to the

910
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,398
store and buy go to the gas station and

911
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:47,039
buy it for less than two or three or

912
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:48,779
five here in Canada But ultimately if

913
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,398
I'm gonna go buy a bottle of wine at

914
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,519
liqueur I'm going to be spending

915
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:54,960
whatever 20 50 up to 100 because of the

916
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:56,460
story that's behind it because of the

917
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,920
terpenes that are present in it and

918
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,900
because I know it's supporting kind of a

919
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,079
craft Market of quality produced

920
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,000
products and I think while the big

921
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,440
producers were able to get to Market a

922
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,139
little bit faster due to the capital

923
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,460
expenditures ultimately the companies

924
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:13,920
that are going to be able to operate on

925
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,539
Lower margins with better profitability

926
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,220
are going to be the ones that kind of

927
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:19,679
focus on the higher end quality products

928
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:21,000
within the market I definitely agree

929
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:22,919
with that statement but the previous

930
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,099
statement to just play Devil's Advocate

931
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,300
I from a North American standpoint I see

932
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:29,280
it a little bit differently when we look

933
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,320
at State legalization when we look at

934
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,540
215 in California when we look at

935
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,059
Washington when we look at Colorado we

936
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:38,039
see the first wave of legalization and

937
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:40,320
regulation being very

938
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:44,460
I would more so argue towards loose

939
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,980
where you can have uh products being

940
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:51,420
manufactured in less than commercial

941
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:54,179
settings being put into a medical

942
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:58,139
and or recreational system dependent on

943
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:59,879
the state and those products with very

944
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:01,618
little oversight being delivered to end

945
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:03,000
consumers and I think this creates

946
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:05,880
tremendously positive effects because

947
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:09,139
even if this is a short window before in

948
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:12,838
future regulation I think that it allows

949
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:14,639
the new consumers who are entering the

950
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:16,500
market now that cannabis has been

951
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:19,139
legalized to be exposed to a myriad of

952
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:21,599
different products and and learn and

953
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:24,440
explore what products work for them we

954
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,599
did not have that opportunity in Canada

955
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:29,760
whatsoever we have to jump through so

956
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,880
many regulatory hoops and create such

957
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,220
large skus as Marcus can talk to to be

958
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,858
able to get a product to Market

959
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:39,719
um that there was no window of

960
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:42,598
innovation where we had a quick

961
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:45,480
opportunity to draw in a number of New

962
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:47,579
Market entrants by offering them a bunch

963
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,519
of different products and so we really

964
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:53,519
suffered where the current consumers

965
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:56,099
frequenting uh retail stores in Canada

966
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:58,259
are primarily new consumers and the the

967
00:36:56,099 --> 00:37:01,380
consumers that have been consuming prior

968
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:04,079
to October 17 2017.

969
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:05,400
um are you know more than likely

970
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,740
sourcing from

971
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,838
different channels you know the thing

972
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:11,519
about it though right is that

973
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:14,279
I mean I've been I've been a nerd like a

974
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:16,920
long time but 15 years now of of like

975
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:21,060
public front public operational license

976
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:22,740
kind of stuff or allowed to be licensed

977
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:25,380
um and what you got is you had such an

978
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:28,739
incredible time period during prop 215

979
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:30,780
the diversity was Supernatural we had I

980
00:37:28,739 --> 00:37:33,539
want to say we had like 30 000 stores or

981
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:37,260
something in Cali right with down 1100.

982
00:37:33,539 --> 00:37:39,599
um so you had tremendous uh access you

983
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:41,520
had the ability for small batches to be

984
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,800
moved so you had many many cultivators

985
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,858
feeding us operation so what you got was

986
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,720
you got really fresh flour

987
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:51,119
diverse flower and flower from people

988
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:53,219
who were about producing flour and then

989
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,960
you had excellent extract makers and you

990
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:57,239
had there was it was the beginning of

991
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,338
the hash Revolution but this was still

992
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:00,419
really the like the butane was moving

993
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:02,820
forward

994
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,500
and when we went into this full legal

995
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,838
what you have is this radical

996
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,880
disappointment and

997
00:38:06,838 --> 00:38:11,099
it's

998
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,440
it's so odd because it's almost

999
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:15,539
impossible to get anybody happy with the

1000
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,220
circumstances because you're really not

1001
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:19,199
in control of them you don't have

1002
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:21,059
control of all the variables we used to

1003
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:24,000
have control all the variables from from

1004
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:25,920
inception to set from to consumption

1005
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,420
and now you don't control everything and

1006
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,920
I'm a vertical so like in some

1007
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,780
operations I actually do control

1008
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,300
everything from genetic development to

1009
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:34,800
sale of the product out the store so

1010
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,500
every license all the way through the

1011
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,420
chain except lab I'm holding

1012
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,039
so it lets me see what happens when you

1013
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,380
have control of everything but that's

1014
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:45,659
pretty rare and so most people are in

1015
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:46,619
this situation where they have zero

1016
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:49,078
control

1017
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:51,119
and they have an expectation of a

1018
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:53,820
product at a store so for most people

1019
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,280
that go legal they only had

1020
00:38:53,820 --> 00:39:00,420
they went from street corner to

1021
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:02,760
storefront California had 20 20 21 since

1022
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:05,639
that came out in like 96 so prop to 15

1023
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,500
come out 96 so yeah 25 years of

1024
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:10,259
storefront sales

1025
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:12,119
so the people are just furious that they

1026
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,680
can't get what they used to get they

1027
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:15,599
can't get that same treatment they don't

1028
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:18,299
get the same prices they get worse

1029
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,820
quality flour and so there's this anger

1030
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:23,460
and resentment which then allows the

1031
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:25,619
traditional to fill it but the problem

1032
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,240
is the people with licenses are dumping

1033
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:29,220
so hard into the system that they

1034
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,319
collapse the traditional so right now

1035
00:39:29,219 --> 00:39:34,799
you can get indoor

1036
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:37,559
in La for 800 bucks a pound indoor you

1037
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,200
you there's there's I want to say

1038
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:42,299
outdoor units are like a buck 50 200

1039
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:44,039
fresh depth just went from four to six

1040
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:46,140
at the storefront right so four to six

1041
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:48,358
if you're moving it through the chain

1042
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:52,500
if it's in the traditional that shits at

1043
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:56,098
250 right if you can sell it and so

1044
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:58,800
we're seeing an 80 reduction in the

1045
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:01,380
economy we're seeing 80 reduction in in

1046
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,060
in all aspects of anything peripherally

1047
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,880
touching cannabis

1048
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:08,338
and and all that'll it'll move forward

1049
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,980
but our problem is that you know we had

1050
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:13,019
so many years of this system that was

1051
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:16,199
actually pretty cool too like for me I'm

1052
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:17,940
from traditional prior so I never use

1053
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:19,679
the storefronts in that way we just sold

1054
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:22,200
product to them I didn't need to access

1055
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:24,000
product that way so I was never a

1056
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:25,500
consumer of the of the product through a

1057
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,480
store I didn't really go into a

1058
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,039
dispensary until I took one over

1059
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,199
and then it allowed me to understand

1060
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:33,300
who's coming in what they need and how

1061
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:34,739
they need it and what their expectations

1062
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,300
are and when you fulfill it you have

1063
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:38,039
loyal customer

1064
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,200
um relationships

1065
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:42,239
but even now if we try as hard as we

1066
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:45,118
want we still can't satisfy the people

1067
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:47,699
because the way the system is set up

1068
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,160
and it's just this

1069
00:40:47,699 --> 00:40:52,799
it's tumultuous and but you have to just

1070
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,719
kind of like I I key on it I look at it

1071
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,000
identify it and then I just push it the

1072
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,639
fuck aside and I keep going

1073
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,260
because I know that there is a future

1074
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:02,759
and it's just really having to be able

1075
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,680
to move through it and the issue for us

1076
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,660
is smaller operators I mean so I have to

1077
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:08,759
go grab investment for projects too but

1078
00:41:06,659 --> 00:41:09,719
I'm for the majority of my life I built

1079
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,960
everything

1080
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:15,059
and most people did and the problem is

1081
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,380
that they can't sustain that Capital

1082
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:18,900
bleed

1083
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:21,000
and you're not big enough and when you

1084
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,559
run your projections the the monies

1085
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,260
aren't great enough to Warrant

1086
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:27,179
investment from a larger entity and so

1087
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:29,280
it's always a scale up everybody wants

1088
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:32,338
to scale up but for craft you can't

1089
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,800
scale up there's a limit you can't keep

1090
00:41:32,338 --> 00:41:36,719
getting bigger and still call it craft

1091
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,820
and and that's really the issue you know

1092
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:41,939
is that we have a limit to what we can

1093
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:44,519
do we can't gather the funds and so like

1094
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:46,019
my the way I operate is I try to be

1095
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:48,119
collaborative with the people in my

1096
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:49,800
community so that what it does it allows

1097
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,940
us to kind of Share info and I can say

1098
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,680
look this is moving and this is not

1099
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,420
moving these things are happening and

1100
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:57,358
these things are not happening and it

1101
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:58,619
just lets you see let you get facts that

1102
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:01,139
this is what's going down this what's

1103
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:02,880
not and that way people who aren't in my

1104
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:04,980
position can benefit from that

1105
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,720
information so what it does it lets you

1106
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,519
know that's a bad route but that's a

1107
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:11,098
safe route and that's a great route

1108
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:13,440
and and that's what we have always tried

1109
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:16,440
to do as as community members is be cool

1110
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,119
amongst each other and and it's really I

1111
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,920
think more crucial than ever to behave

1112
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,240
that way right now

1113
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,858
because you don't have anybody but your

1114
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:24,779
neighbor it's really you look across

1115
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:28,039
that's this is your allies

1116
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,040
not not anybody else

1117
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:33,000
I just think it's hard that you guys

1118
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,519
keep talking about you know Legacy

1119
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,260
markets in different states and it's yet

1120
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,539
to be mentioned um you know we keep

1121
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:42,780
using consumer but nobody's used patient

1122
00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:45,719
really and I think that is a huge gap uh

1123
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:47,400
in this transition and I just spent

1124
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:49,259
the first four months of this year in

1125
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,619
New York and have been working in uh

1126
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:54,839
tri-state area in work in licensing down

1127
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:56,640
in the states or have traditionally

1128
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:58,858
um and

1129
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:01,078
it's really interesting to see

1130
00:42:58,858 --> 00:43:03,059
um you know this Scramble for the

1131
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:05,280
definition of legacy in New York and New

1132
00:43:03,059 --> 00:43:07,139
Jersey which are obviously huge cannabis

1133
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,119
consumer markets they dictate a ton I

1134
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:11,699
mean you have a lot to say on that

1135
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,920
that's like brilliant and so it dictates

1136
00:43:11,699 --> 00:43:15,779
the trends everywhere but that being

1137
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,980
said like I was going to mention it was

1138
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,900
interesting I whispered to Kelly I was

1139
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,338
like you're a fantastic grower and you

1140
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,019
have all this clout for that but then

1141
00:43:20,338 --> 00:43:24,119
your

1142
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:26,159
your take on the Canadian Market was as

1143
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:29,039
a consumer you know and that's that's

1144
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:32,098
the point that there is and so I think

1145
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:34,500
you know the the term Legacy which is so

1146
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:36,420
hard to Define like really involves

1147
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:39,858
medicinal it's the connection with

1148
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,858
cannabis as a medicine and

1149
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:48,730
that is very real yeah

1150
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:48,730
[Laughter]

1151
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:01,680
all right

1152
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,719
which is the thing the thing is no keep

1153
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:06,000
going because that's valid yeah well and

1154
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:07,559
it's even just as Kel mentioned like um

1155
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,300
you know with with different seasonal

1156
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:10,858
Equity a lot of that too you were

1157
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:13,200
growing plants for patients and a lot of

1158
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:15,059
it had to do with establishing that

1159
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:16,559
community and those inroads and those

1160
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:18,358
channels and you knew that this person

1161
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:20,519
needed that plant but you could also use

1162
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:22,858
that margin to help somebody else out

1163
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:24,300
that couldn't pay you anything and so I

1164
00:44:22,858 --> 00:44:25,920
think it's just really valid to keep in

1165
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,380
mind the patient and you know in that

1166
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,760
transition of what is plant medicine and

1167
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,858
what does that mean to the standard

1168
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,359
person I mean look at this festival and

1169
00:44:31,858 --> 00:44:35,338
across the lake I mean here you have

1170
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:36,539
this fireside chat but those are the

1171
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:37,679
people that are going to be buying the

1172
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:39,358
things at the end of the day and

1173
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:42,419
determining the market and that's where

1174
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:44,098
you know the investors look at BDS

1175
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:46,440
analytics down in the state or what's

1176
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:47,940
moving and you know people say well now

1177
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,858
I should start a gummy company because

1178
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,679
look gummies are great or beverages are

1179
00:44:49,858 --> 00:44:54,420
great and it's just chasing that thing

1180
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:57,858
instead of remembering like you guys are

1181
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,858
the ones that start the trends

1182
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:04,440
we should go back just a little bit and

1183
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,180
dimension on New York I have many

1184
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,679
friends in New York and what their goal

1185
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:09,960
currently it's wild west is what they

1186
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,179
say is to build Brands and package

1187
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,880
that's something we learned as Legacy

1188
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:16,739
people we need to package and put it on

1189
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,480
and make it look nice something that we

1190
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:21,899
don't have here which is very disturbing

1191
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:25,500
to hit a point before was raw Garden put

1192
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:27,900
out 1 316 products different strains in

1193
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,219
one year cultivars in one year how many

1194
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,300
can you do in Canada

1195
00:45:29,219 --> 00:45:34,858
four

1196
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:36,420
maybe six as an LP it is one basically

1197
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:40,199
every six months let's say

1198
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:42,720
and so that really truly cuts down the

1199
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:44,578
variety and honestly I don't even know

1200
00:45:42,719 --> 00:45:46,679
if Canadians want it because I've been

1201
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:49,500
studying the Canadian market and they

1202
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:52,078
they they they're not we're not to that

1203
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:54,239
educational level yet because the

1204
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,859
consumer and we are not those people and

1205
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:57,479
we are not to judge what they want to

1206
00:45:55,858 --> 00:45:59,098
buy off of what we like because that

1207
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,559
doesn't work

1208
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:03,900
they want to buy pre-rolls

1209
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:05,940
they want to buy vape pens and they want

1210
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:08,099
to buy flowers and we can the rest of

1211
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:09,900
those percentages drop way down and it's

1212
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:11,400
all coming and it's all growing fast

1213
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,280
those other categories are growing fast

1214
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,960
100 but when you talk to the Canadian

1215
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,480
consumer

1216
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,460
I would like a reasonable price

1217
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:23,039
and I want to be cheap you guys sells

1218
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:25,019
pre-rolls by the 140 pack yeah I was

1219
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,039
like what the fuck is that I mean the

1220
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:27,079
cultivator is saying that they're

1221
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:28,920
getting more money

1222
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:30,119
pieces now than they are actually

1223
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,440
getting for the fires that they try and

1224
00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:32,940
the bottom line too is we're out of the

1225
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,980
tobacco area so nobody nobody knows how

1226
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,858
to roll weed anymore no they think so

1227
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:39,059
it's weird

1228
00:46:36,858 --> 00:46:40,739
convenience where our pen our pen Mark

1229
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:42,779
is re-blowing back up you know we're

1230
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:45,299
running like 30 we're in the mid 30s on

1231
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:49,560
flower sales I'll say as a connoisseur

1232
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:51,480
of great hash and great cannabis that

1233
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:54,000
entering the legal Market in Canada

1234
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:56,159
really kind of crushed my soul when I

1235
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,780
made my first batch of bubble and my

1236
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:00,358
qa's there and we're making it I'm like

1237
00:46:57,780 --> 00:47:02,280
this is fucking awesome whipping up you

1238
00:47:00,358 --> 00:47:04,078
know five six dried kilos at a time

1239
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:06,599
we're gonna make a kilo of bubs get it

1240
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:08,640
in the freeze dryers and I'm kind of

1241
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:10,140
like uh I only did this once I was like

1242
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:11,159
okay let's separate all the grades yeah

1243
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:13,199
we're gonna keep all the microns

1244
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:16,500
separate and yeah these are real nice

1245
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:18,539
ones here 90 73 120 oh yeah that's nice

1246
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:21,059
get it all get it all at the end of my

1247
00:47:18,539 --> 00:47:22,380
qa's like okay so how many are you gonna

1248
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:23,759
mix all this together I'm like well no

1249
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,740
no you got it we gotta keep them

1250
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,900
separate she's like okay so instead of

1251
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:31,500
1200 I'll just multiply that by eight

1252
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:34,619
twelve hundred for each COA times eight

1253
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:36,539
so now and then the next thing to crush

1254
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:38,640
me was when Ontario was like oh yeah we

1255
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:41,639
want your bubble but uh we're gonna need

1256
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:43,259
like four kilos of it or and then if we

1257
00:47:41,639 --> 00:47:45,420
sell it really fast you gotta have

1258
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,920
another four kilos right away and I'm

1259
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:50,519
thinking how the fuck am I gonna get

1260
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:52,619
eight kilos of 90 Micron bubble how the

1261
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:54,300
how am I gonna fucking I'm like and then

1262
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,980
my whole team is like you're not dude

1263
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:58,339
you're not gonna do that we need you to

1264
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:01,559
mix them all together and I'm like

1265
00:47:58,338 --> 00:48:03,858
I'm all together I'm the kind of

1266
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:03,858
creative

1267
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:09,139
I want them separate I don't want them

1268
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:09,139
together

1269
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:16,019
but surely these things just crushed me

1270
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,760
and I was like okay like I'll keep going

1271
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:20,159
and then and then what you were saying

1272
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,619
no like very accurate like

1273
00:48:20,159 --> 00:48:24,960
I want to release six star 90 Micron

1274
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:27,660
bubble but it's like those aren't my

1275
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,220
customers the customers in the Canadian

1276
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:31,679
Market is like they want something

1277
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:33,118
inexpensive they want something they

1278
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:35,639
want pre-roll so I'm like well I'm a

1279
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:38,400
hash guy what am I going to do to bring

1280
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:40,679
those those people have only one piece

1281
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,059
of paraphernalia it's a big lighter they

1282
00:48:40,679 --> 00:48:43,858
don't have rolling papers they don't

1283
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:45,960
have anything no grinder they buy

1284
00:48:43,858 --> 00:48:48,420
pre-roll joints they're about 85 percent

1285
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:51,659
of the Canadian market so now I'm like

1286
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:53,579
what can I make for them where they can

1287
00:48:51,659 --> 00:48:55,078
only use a lighter and then I had to

1288
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:58,260
come out with this product called hash

1289
00:48:55,079 --> 00:49:00,060
hits that's like really to me it's

1290
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:02,040
certainly not a six star hash it would

1291
00:49:00,059 --> 00:49:03,719
be a mediocre hash but that's what's

1292
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:05,759
supposed to go with that but man you

1293
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:07,379
know it's five it's a gram you get five

1294
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,940
paper tubes with a little stainless

1295
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:11,460
steel bowl there's point two of a gram

1296
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:13,260
of hash they're killing it like we sell

1297
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:16,079
so many of them in every Province like

1298
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:19,500
people love them because now the joint

1299
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,300
smoker can like bridge over to but that

1300
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:23,159
was hard for me not like I had to go

1301
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,380
against my own ego and my own like what

1302
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:27,118
I thought like holy shit like all I've

1303
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:29,338
been about is the best quality ever but

1304
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:31,980
now I'm in an industry that if I try to

1305
00:49:29,338 --> 00:49:33,659
make six star 90 Micron bubble that like

1306
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:36,059
people like Jameson be like yeah dude

1307
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:37,618
that's fire I will go bankrupt no you

1308
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:39,659
enter those in the comments and take

1309
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:41,519
pictures of it I'll be bankrupt company

1310
00:49:39,659 --> 00:49:42,899
will be out of business so now it's like

1311
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:45,059
we got to figure out something that's

1312
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:46,680
like that you can get to the that

1313
00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:48,838
Marketplace you know that group of

1314
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:51,239
people that are they're certainly not us

1315
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:54,179
well I think it's a separation of skus

1316
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:57,118
right we as as processors have to take

1317
00:49:54,179 --> 00:49:58,858
our products bring it in do it do what

1318
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,900
we do and pick it out and be like okay

1319
00:49:58,858 --> 00:50:02,639
well this is going to go into infused

1320
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,858
joints because now that is actually the

1321
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:06,358
number one seller because people they

1322
00:50:04,858 --> 00:50:08,039
just want to get high let's just be

1323
00:50:06,358 --> 00:50:09,358
honest get out of work and you want to

1324
00:50:08,039 --> 00:50:11,639
get high so if you can do it in one

1325
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:13,139
joint that joint is a 40 THC or go out

1326
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:14,759
40 THC

1327
00:50:13,139 --> 00:50:17,159
I don't necessarily think you care what

1328
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,359
star it is no right at all so we're

1329
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:21,838
always going to cream that at the very

1330
00:50:18,358 --> 00:50:23,039
top and hopefully sell that well here's

1331
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:25,460
the other thing because I want to do

1332
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:28,139
that so yeah

1333
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:30,179
say you do make the six star the minute

1334
00:50:28,139 --> 00:50:32,818
it leaves your facility I got it at like

1335
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:35,219
minus 30 degrees Celsius the minute it

1336
00:50:32,818 --> 00:50:37,619
leaves my facility it's now like Mike

1337
00:50:35,219 --> 00:50:40,618
was talking it's just like these people

1338
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:43,380
are shipping warm like warm spinach

1339
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:45,720
without any like it's produce you have

1340
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:48,000
to keep it cool so it just gets degraded

1341
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:49,919
on the weight of the place every single

1342
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,659
dispensary do you know what they keep in

1343
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:55,079
their cool fridges the few that they

1344
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:59,779
have fucking beverages with 10

1345
00:50:55,079 --> 00:51:01,920
milligrams of distilling Nano emulsified

1346
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:04,500
that doesn't need to stay in the fridge

1347
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,539
like let people use ice put the hash and

1348
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,338
the oil and all the weed you have in the

1349
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:10,199
building in those fucking fridges and

1350
00:51:08,338 --> 00:51:12,599
freezers because there's volatile

1351
00:51:10,199 --> 00:51:14,818
compounds Beyond terpenes and terpenoids

1352
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:17,460
into thile calls and bio weights and

1353
00:51:14,818 --> 00:51:20,039
Esters that are that are so volatile

1354
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:22,199
they are just degrading if they're not

1355
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:24,719
like cold

1356
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:26,338
that's what we're fighting

1357
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:28,558
yeah

1358
00:51:26,338 --> 00:51:30,659
I think I think the key is just

1359
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:33,680
understanding like those those zippering

1360
00:51:30,659 --> 00:51:36,480
market segments right that in 50 years

1361
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:37,919
would I go by at a bodega in New York

1362
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,500
City is going to be different than what

1363
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:43,440
I buy at a high-end canaguar Lounge in

1364
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:45,838
New York City right and you know the

1365
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,700
people the more educated consumers are

1366
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:49,259
probably going to be keeping up with the

1367
00:51:47,699 --> 00:51:51,539
Trends on what genetics are being

1368
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:54,059
developed Trends on new types of hash

1369
00:51:51,539 --> 00:51:56,639
and they'll be more likely to buy it pay

1370
00:51:54,059 --> 00:51:59,940
for a premium But ultimately in the

1371
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:02,639
early and draggingly slow rollout that

1372
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:04,858
is federally regulated products we have

1373
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:07,199
to be able to produce products that we

1374
00:52:04,858 --> 00:52:09,539
could we can sell to you know in an

1375
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:11,818
entire Province for now eventually

1376
00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:14,159
entire countries because Canada allows

1377
00:52:11,818 --> 00:52:16,500
export of products to other continents

1378
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:18,139
but we need to be able to sell products

1379
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:21,659
that can easily be replicatable

1380
00:52:18,139 --> 00:52:23,400
consumable and in the early part of that

1381
00:52:21,659 --> 00:52:25,618
market it's going to be something that

1382
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,139
follows kind of a uniform standard

1383
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:30,000
operating procedure your whereas as as

1384
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:32,159
the industry evolves you're not going to

1385
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,500
have your 20 bottle of wine or whatever

1386
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:36,000
forty dollar fifty dollar bottle extract

1387
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:38,280
you're going to start to have that

1388
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,739
diverse diversification of that of the

1389
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,839
market you'll have your 40 gram of

1390
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:45,419
extract or 100 Grand magic you'll have

1391
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:48,299
your you'll have your 40 eighth or a

1392
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:49,260
forty dollar ounce and I'm not gonna buy

1393
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,000
the 40

1394
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,859
ounce unless if I'm gonna roll up a

1395
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,519
bunch of joints to give away to a bunch

1396
00:52:52,858 --> 00:52:58,619
of tourists but I am going to be going

1397
00:52:56,519 --> 00:53:01,139
to the market and buying those 40 AIDS

1398
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:03,119
so genetics I haven't grown yet because

1399
00:53:01,139 --> 00:53:06,118
I want to see if that genetic fits with

1400
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:10,380
my patient profile my bio essay

1401
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:14,220
so in California in Canada in Washington

1402
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:16,318
in Colorado we have very very accurate

1403
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:19,019
Market data and understanding of

1404
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:20,779
consumers that are walking into the

1405
00:53:19,019 --> 00:53:23,358
doors of these retail

1406
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:26,780
consumption areas and and we even have

1407
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:30,900
polls and other questionnaires that are

1408
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:34,019
proposed by high foluting corporations

1409
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:36,358
like Deloitte and BDS and and places

1410
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:38,579
like that quantifying the market

1411
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:40,139
opportunity and telling us how much

1412
00:53:38,579 --> 00:53:42,720
money we could make and how many

1413
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:44,759
consumers there really are it's fucking

1414
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:47,039
bullshit like there's no fucking way

1415
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:49,920
that these individuals crunching numbers

1416
00:53:47,039 --> 00:53:51,179
are able to ascertain the culture or the

1417
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,338
undercurrent that has carried this

1418
00:53:51,179 --> 00:53:55,618
industry for the last however many

1419
00:53:53,338 --> 00:53:58,558
whatever number you want to pick between

1420
00:53:55,619 --> 00:54:01,200
five thousand and a hundred and so like

1421
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:03,720
my my my understanding is like okay fine

1422
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:05,759
cool we all at the whole Market

1423
00:54:03,719 --> 00:54:08,098
including the suits understands the

1424
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,140
purchasing parodies and and trends of

1425
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:11,760
the individuals walking in the door what

1426
00:54:10,139 --> 00:54:14,400
we're here to talk about and the value

1427
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,500
we're here to add is how we expose those

1428
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,180
new groups to get those groups in the

1429
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,858
doors and get markets to those

1430
00:54:18,179 --> 00:54:21,000
individuals that will transition those

1431
00:54:19,858 --> 00:54:24,000
individuals because I'll tell you

1432
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,800
somebody like me is worth a lot more

1433
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,179
than somebody walking in and buying a

1434
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,760
pack of pre-rolls at the end of every

1435
00:54:27,179 --> 00:54:32,899
week and so if you're able to convert a

1436
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:36,359
heavy use consumer who's been using for

1437
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:39,599
decades Decades of heavy use and it's

1438
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:44,039
not uncommon you're going to unlock

1439
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:46,318
a a tremendous amount of of Revenue of

1440
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:48,058
revenue for your company and so you know

1441
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:49,980
we have the road map of how to okay

1442
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:51,540
let's create pre-rolls okay fine put

1443
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:54,659
distillate in them call them rocket

1444
00:54:51,539 --> 00:54:55,800
rolls and fucking fine cool we're not I

1445
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:58,379
don't want to I don't want to talk about

1446
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:01,859
that I want to talk about how we create

1447
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:06,420
unique products that we can get

1448
00:55:01,858 --> 00:55:08,219
uh existing community members to change

1449
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:11,039
where they're accessing their medicine

1450
00:55:08,219 --> 00:55:12,299
from so we can we can change this trend

1451
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:13,800
in the right way like that's what I

1452
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,780
think we should be talking about not you

1453
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:18,070
know okay pre-rolls are growing and so

1454
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:21,179
are vape pens

1455
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:21,179
[Music]

1456
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:54,539
because what we're assuming is that your

1457
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:56,699
snapshot is correct and what it's

1458
00:55:54,539 --> 00:55:58,980
showing is this is what happens in a

1459
00:55:56,699 --> 00:56:03,179
market that is inadequately developed

1460
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:06,000
and controlled and so you've lost the

1461
00:56:03,179 --> 00:56:08,699
diversity and you've lost the ability to

1462
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,039
capture you you're not the people when I

1463
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:13,318
when I was when I was actively in this

1464
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,000
shop in the in the Heyday of of before

1465
00:56:13,318 --> 00:56:16,318
legalization

1466
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,119
people would come in and buy six or

1467
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:19,739
seven hundred dollars worth of oil at a

1468
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:21,240
time because that's what they consumed

1469
00:56:19,739 --> 00:56:23,219
and they had the income for it but they

1470
00:56:21,239 --> 00:56:24,479
would come and buy it that doesn't exist

1471
00:56:23,219 --> 00:56:28,019
anymore

1472
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:29,880
and we've lost that group because you've

1473
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:31,619
dissatisfied them with what's taken

1474
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:33,300
place and you're using headset data so

1475
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:34,619
everybody's using the same data set to

1476
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,700
build their operation and I'm just like

1477
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:36,660
whatever you want to do just don't do

1478
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:38,639
that

1479
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:40,618
foreign

1480
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:43,440
what's that

1481
00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:45,300
oh yeah oh yeah yeah this was and it was

1482
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,159
constant I mean it was it was for years

1483
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:49,260
and years and years we had these type of

1484
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:51,058
sales because that's where people who

1485
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:52,859
wanted products they couldn't because

1486
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:55,260
what they knew was that they knew

1487
00:56:52,858 --> 00:56:56,578
friends who blasted but what I had done

1488
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:58,200
is I had gone to all the friends that

1489
00:56:56,579 --> 00:57:00,780
were good blasters and said would you

1490
00:56:58,199 --> 00:57:03,239
guys start filling our stores and all I

1491
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:04,319
need to do is have our own Labs test

1492
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:06,838
your product

1493
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:07,980
and then will will if you want will even

1494
00:57:06,838 --> 00:57:09,058
brand it for you if you don't want to

1495
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,159
put your name on it so you don't get

1496
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:14,099
revealed but what we had was this

1497
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:16,078
ungodly collection of products and it

1498
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:18,480
allowed us to catch the people who

1499
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:20,039
really consumed the product they don't

1500
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,358
they don't exist in the dispensaries

1501
00:57:20,039 --> 00:57:24,619
right now

1502
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:24,619
and it's a travesty

1503
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:30,719
[Music]

1504
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,300
it is the Fireside chatting amongst

1505
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,300
ourselves

1506
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:41,639
nobody was you were saying it is

1507
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:44,219
important because what you're saying is

1508
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:46,259
that's us in BC we're all in the same

1509
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:49,139
situation in in the in the fact that

1510
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:51,359
legalization created a barrier that that

1511
00:57:49,139 --> 00:57:52,920
only allows specific people to come in

1512
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:55,380
and they come in and they're risk

1513
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:57,420
adverse so when when people say to me

1514
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:59,280
you know what do you want to do I said

1515
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:01,800
do anything that goes over 68 days

1516
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,140
because nobody's run anything over 65.

1517
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,660
it's real simple like go in the store

1518
00:58:04,139 --> 00:58:07,618
and say there's 72 choices don't do

1519
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:09,960
those

1520
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:11,760
anything that says ice cream don't do it

1521
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:13,619
I don't care people love it there's too

1522
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,839
many competitors it's okay just

1523
00:58:13,619 --> 00:58:17,099
understand that you can't follow the map

1524
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:18,078
they're giving you because they don't

1525
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:21,240
know where the fuck they're going either

1526
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:23,880
so you have to look at data and

1527
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:26,338
statistics in a manner that is relevant

1528
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:27,780
to the situation it's not like I call it

1529
00:58:26,338 --> 00:58:30,539
biblical and I'm not really even

1530
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:32,640
religious but it's not real it's a

1531
00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:36,779
snapshot of a moment in time in a

1532
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:40,379
situation that is not open to change so

1533
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:42,660
as we disrupt it we have change but I

1534
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:45,059
want to recapture those people I want to

1535
00:58:42,659 --> 00:58:47,460
recapture the people and and to me

1536
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:49,380
it's almost like it's the micro groups

1537
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:51,000
everywhere that are really the new heart

1538
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:52,858
and soul of cannabis where you're too

1539
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,139
light for light regen tent grower

1540
00:58:52,858 --> 00:58:56,159
because it's all you have to that's your

1541
00:58:55,139 --> 00:58:58,078
infrastructure you don't have the

1542
00:58:56,159 --> 00:58:59,159
ability to put a farm in and when I meet

1543
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:01,140
these people I'm seeing some of the

1544
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:04,318
nicest product I've seen because it's

1545
00:59:01,139 --> 00:59:05,699
the return to craft production and I've

1546
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:08,338
always dreamed of Home production for

1547
00:59:05,699 --> 00:59:10,139
everyone I don't as a dispensary owner I

1548
00:59:08,338 --> 00:59:12,298
still advocate for it continuously

1549
00:59:10,139 --> 00:59:13,798
because for all my medical years nobody

1550
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:15,719
could afford it and that's why we did

1551
00:59:13,798 --> 00:59:17,639
all that subsidy shit I mean I gave away

1552
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:20,039
fucking millions and millions of dollars

1553
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:22,558
for years and sometimes as I struggle

1554
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:24,000
now I'm like whoa what did I do and then

1555
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,400
I asked myself would I do it again I go

1556
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,719
yeah because ultimately it was a

1557
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,760
beautiful moment in time where you got

1558
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:33,598
to have a relationship with people that

1559
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:37,740
were really needy and cannabis was that

1560
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:40,079
food is what they had to eat and and for

1561
00:59:37,739 --> 00:59:42,239
me all the years in the hustle

1562
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,039
I realized that I had never understood

1563
00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:46,439
medical cannabis and I didn't have any

1564
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:48,119
clue about medical people

1565
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:50,159
and

1566
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:52,318
it caught me you know it caught me

1567
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:55,199
emotionally and so

1568
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:58,380
to me home growing is medical there but

1569
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:59,879
all use of cannabis is medical spiritual

1570
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:02,400
inspirational how do we want to define

1571
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:03,960
it it's just that the medical has the

1572
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,920
most need and usually the least on a

1573
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:08,280
cash

1574
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:10,980
you know and I think that uh education

1575
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,660
Falls right behind that where you have

1576
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:15,059
pushed you know I personally have pushed

1577
01:00:12,659 --> 01:00:17,519
a lot of Education about terpenes let's

1578
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:20,880
just say and

1579
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:22,619
that doesn't pay you and so to speak to

1580
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,240
your point I want to talk about the the

1581
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:26,519
things that are good and coming up and

1582
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:29,279
everything but the other side of it is

1583
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:31,679
the balance of the books and with the

1584
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,900
money the truth is in the numbers and we

1585
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:35,578
have to make money they're not making it

1586
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:37,619
easy for any of us to do in any country

1587
01:00:35,579 --> 01:00:40,500
I believe no you know we each have our

1588
01:00:37,619 --> 01:00:44,400
own issues with it all so

1589
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:46,739
to drive that it requires like Shannon

1590
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:49,039
said in the past a large team of people

1591
01:00:46,739 --> 01:00:53,759
to really truly Drive the education

1592
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:55,500
Drive the concept of your story because

1593
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:58,260
I think that

1594
01:00:55,500 --> 01:01:01,019
all you know in this world of

1595
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:03,660
consumerism uh we're looking for Unique

1596
01:01:01,019 --> 01:01:06,000
Individuals and unique story lines that

1597
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:08,219
add a

1598
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,559
flavor to your product that you can't

1599
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:13,439
buy and you can't make it's because you

1600
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:16,920
did it you lived it right and so we need

1601
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:20,720
to capture that as a group of small

1602
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:23,519
craft individuals and boutique Growers

1603
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:26,098
and truly represent us as a whole

1604
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:28,259
because that's the only way we can have

1605
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:30,359
the amount of pull we need to

1606
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:33,599
necessarily compete with a larger group

1607
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:36,000
out there without selling pieces of our

1608
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:37,380
soul to get the money to do it

1609
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,639
because we know that that's what it

1610
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:40,380
comes down to if you go out and try to

1611
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:44,058
do it yourself you are going to have to

1612
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:44,059
give up something of yourself to do it

1613
01:01:45,298 --> 01:01:48,838
there's always a price to pay you know I

1614
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:52,618
mean like if you're talking about

1615
01:01:48,838 --> 01:01:54,480
cannabis culture it's free exit and

1616
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:56,940
entry but when it comes down to cannabis

1617
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,619
business under regulated rules it's you

1618
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:00,420
either play it or you don't and if you

1619
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:03,420
don't want to do it don't and if you do

1620
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:05,159
do I mean it's that simple and and so

1621
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:07,619
you have to really really really want to

1622
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:11,279
be here if you want to be here

1623
01:02:07,619 --> 01:02:14,818
and that's that's the difficult part is

1624
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:16,619
just desire doesn't get you far enough

1625
01:02:14,818 --> 01:02:18,838
you know and and when it comes to

1626
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:21,000
education it doesn't pay but I don't

1627
01:02:18,838 --> 01:02:23,880
look at it as payment like I I did an

1628
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,500
ungodly amount of pro bono education

1629
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:27,539
because I wanted to share information

1630
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:29,219
that I was receiving currently and I

1631
01:02:27,539 --> 01:02:31,039
knew I was getting stuff that was flying

1632
01:02:29,219 --> 01:02:33,959
out of the pipe straight and I was just

1633
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:36,058
regurgitating it into the public so that

1634
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:39,119
we would have a more educated consumer

1635
01:02:36,059 --> 01:02:40,798
group and cultivation group and I I I

1636
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,240
didn't want to monopolize the

1637
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:44,818
information so that I was the only one

1638
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:46,858
with it because what I always knew is

1639
01:02:44,818 --> 01:02:48,659
you're not going to survive alone

1640
01:02:46,858 --> 01:02:50,699
you know

1641
01:02:48,659 --> 01:02:53,460
yeah it's the love of it but it's the

1642
01:02:50,699 --> 01:02:55,558
love of the people too like I

1643
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:57,599
I spent my whole life in weed and so

1644
01:02:55,559 --> 01:03:00,059
herb herb took care of me my whole life

1645
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:01,740
right and so what I know is that I don't

1646
01:03:00,059 --> 01:03:03,660
have to know you or benefit from you if

1647
01:03:01,739 --> 01:03:06,000
you benefit from the information because

1648
01:03:03,659 --> 01:03:07,558
what I know is that if if when I was

1649
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,980
needy and I got information that was

1650
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:13,079
valuable it was extremely important and

1651
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:15,358
I said well I'm catching shit that most

1652
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:17,880
people aren't catching I'm in a lot of

1653
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:19,798
rooms that people aren't in and I'm not

1654
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:22,619
signing ndas that say I can't talk about

1655
01:03:19,798 --> 01:03:24,059
it and so I was I mean I've been spewing

1656
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:27,298
for years

1657
01:03:24,059 --> 01:03:30,059
so that people would get some insight

1658
01:03:27,298 --> 01:03:31,619
about what was taking place so that

1659
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:33,240
other peoples could survive

1660
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:35,358
and that way we got more of us in the

1661
01:03:33,239 --> 01:03:35,358
room

1662
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:48,420
he's right there uh yeah yeah before I

1663
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:51,900
get into this I Marcus I didn't know

1664
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:55,460
you're so funny man like awesome that's

1665
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:55,460
great that's awesome

1666
01:03:55,858 --> 01:04:00,480
yeah

1667
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:02,219
um just pulling it back to what Kelly

1668
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,858
was referring to in the different

1669
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:07,500
languages between the Legacy and and the

1670
01:04:04,858 --> 01:04:09,480
commercial market and it it is

1671
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:12,599
interesting I will say right my my

1672
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:14,579
perspective is one from a pure business

1673
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:17,039
um I I've come to the Cannabis industry

1674
01:04:14,579 --> 01:04:19,980
I came out of high tech high tech was a

1675
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:22,139
blast right I was there before I was in

1676
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:24,000
in the world of Google when AdWords

1677
01:04:22,139 --> 01:04:26,818
weren't a thing and I watched AdWords

1678
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,880
come on and it was absolutely

1679
01:04:26,818 --> 01:04:32,818
astronomical I mean we were earning

1680
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:34,740
every dollar we would spend on Google

1681
01:04:32,818 --> 01:04:36,420
AdWords in those days shit we were

1682
01:04:34,739 --> 01:04:38,639
earning 10 bucks in Revenue it was

1683
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:41,818
ridiculous it was like shooting fish in

1684
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:44,699
a barrel and it and that dried up like

1685
01:04:41,818 --> 01:04:47,400
it just it just dried up right and then

1686
01:04:44,699 --> 01:04:49,439
you know as the as technology evolved I

1687
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:51,720
got into product development and really

1688
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:54,420
understood how organizations should

1689
01:04:51,719 --> 01:04:56,818
operate and after 20 years and you know

1690
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:58,740
getting kicked so many damn times and

1691
01:04:56,818 --> 01:05:01,380
learning during the lumps of of what it

1692
01:04:58,739 --> 01:05:03,539
takes to run a corporation right that's

1693
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:06,000
that's our opportunity here

1694
01:05:03,539 --> 01:05:08,400
right in Canada right I hear about the

1695
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,619
US and and and it's different mentality

1696
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,798
from a business perspective there is a

1697
01:05:10,619 --> 01:05:16,619
lot of Regulation here in Canada and and

1698
01:05:13,798 --> 01:05:19,440
I'll tell you every company in the

1699
01:05:16,619 --> 01:05:21,119
Canadian market today is a startup and

1700
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,280
what further compounds that is that

1701
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:25,798
we're in a startup industry

1702
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:29,579
right it's a cluster

1703
01:05:25,798 --> 01:05:33,179
daily it's a cluster large LPS small LPS

1704
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:34,859
micros it's a cluster and yet that's our

1705
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:37,980
opportunity

1706
01:05:34,858 --> 01:05:40,139
right that's our opportunity

1707
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:43,079
to get organized

1708
01:05:40,139 --> 01:05:45,900
to understand the processes and learn

1709
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:48,059
the language Kelly it's beautiful I will

1710
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:50,519
say right I've heard this word called

1711
01:05:48,059 --> 01:05:52,200
this combination a phrase of creative

1712
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:53,639
compliance

1713
01:05:52,199 --> 01:05:55,679
right if you start to read the

1714
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:58,798
regulations you can drive a Mac Truck

1715
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:01,318
somewhere through some of these as long

1716
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:04,199
as and I'll look at Marcus and we'll go

1717
01:06:01,318 --> 01:06:06,058
as long as your QA you know is drinking

1718
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:09,480
the same Kool-Aid that you're drinking

1719
01:06:06,059 --> 01:06:11,940
right so there are ways to do it

1720
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,798
and we talk about the different you know

1721
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:16,500
it's US versus them

1722
01:06:13,798 --> 01:06:18,420
but we we forget about this layer right

1723
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:20,579
in the middle and it's people

1724
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:22,798
right it's not it's not US versus them

1725
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:24,780
like no no sorry no no no no no no no

1726
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:26,400
I'm just saying the language the

1727
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:28,319
language there's individuals in our

1728
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:30,358
industry who are motivated only by

1729
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:32,818
Financial enrichment 100 that's them

1730
01:06:30,358 --> 01:06:34,679
yeah and then there's the others and

1731
01:06:32,818 --> 01:06:37,199
that's us yeah and there is a fucking

1732
01:06:34,679 --> 01:06:39,779
line and it is US versus them it's very

1733
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:41,279
very fucking much is us first so let me

1734
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:43,500
tell you this I'm not I'm not gonna

1735
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:47,339
debate that I'm talking about there's

1736
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:49,980
when we as as as commercial corporate

1737
01:06:47,338 --> 01:06:52,980
corporate LPS we want to sell our

1738
01:06:49,980 --> 01:06:55,740
product into Ontario there's this layer

1739
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:57,179
of of people in there and they just want

1740
01:06:55,739 --> 01:06:59,699
to help us

1741
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:00,899
regardless of shape size form they just

1742
01:06:59,699 --> 01:07:02,578
want to help us

1743
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:05,220
right so having somebody there to help

1744
01:07:02,579 --> 01:07:06,900
interpret that and understand that and

1745
01:07:05,219 --> 01:07:09,118
again I'll go back to the startup within

1746
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:11,119
a startup every province is still trying

1747
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:13,559
to organize themselves BC just

1748
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:17,640
reorganize the way that they buy again

1749
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:20,099
we got to relearn that we got we we have

1750
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:23,400
to have build new relationships with new

1751
01:07:20,099 --> 01:07:24,960
people again so it's it can be done and

1752
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:27,240
the beauty of that is we're small we're

1753
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:30,539
Nimble and we actually have a brand

1754
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:33,479
we've got a storyline you guys are so

1755
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:36,660
damn authentic it's it's so beautifully

1756
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:39,599
Rich right yeah

1757
01:07:36,659 --> 01:07:41,639
yeah that's what I've seen it I've seen

1758
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:43,859
the big you know publicly traded I've

1759
01:07:41,639 --> 01:07:46,318
worked in those sterile walls and now

1760
01:07:43,858 --> 01:07:48,420
down to smaller guys like like Che and

1761
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:50,400
stuff like that's our opportunity they

1762
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:52,680
can't pivot like we can and then that

1763
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,079
middle layer they want to help us right

1764
01:07:52,679 --> 01:07:57,960
a prime example is Ontario right now

1765
01:07:55,079 --> 01:08:00,180
they've created a flow through model

1766
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:02,818
right so whether you've got you know

1767
01:08:00,179 --> 01:08:05,940
three kilos for sale or 10 kilos for

1768
01:08:02,818 --> 01:08:07,679
sale right they want your product right

1769
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:10,559
you want to talk about supporting a

1770
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:12,899
small you know your community again like

1771
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:15,359
there is an ideal opportunity and it's

1772
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:17,100
evolving right I imagine soon enough

1773
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:19,439
this this flow through model will be

1774
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:21,719
across the country right Alberta's

1775
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:23,879
trying to figure it out but that's our

1776
01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:25,859
opportunity is to figure out how we can

1777
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:28,980
become Nimble use creative compliance

1778
01:08:25,859 --> 01:08:30,600
and just be agile right and get smart

1779
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:33,539
with products

1780
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:35,279
data's interesting it really is you're

1781
01:08:33,539 --> 01:08:37,500
right about the you're right about the

1782
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:38,699
agility because when we talk about it

1783
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,920
was we had a question the other day

1784
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:42,119
about like genetics and it was you know

1785
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:43,679
everybody's gonna knock each other out

1786
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:45,420
and you're like no in order to do

1787
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:47,460
stabilized seed lines you got a couple

1788
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:50,219
year development process if you're

1789
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:52,798
looking for a one-off uh hunts then

1790
01:08:50,219 --> 01:08:55,020
that's instantaneous if you're doing TC

1791
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:56,759
work it can be up to 9 to 12 months if

1792
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:57,779
depending on how infected the cultivar

1793
01:08:56,759 --> 01:08:59,819
is and how many times you've got to

1794
01:08:57,779 --> 01:09:01,679
stress it to pull the pathogen out so

1795
01:08:59,819 --> 01:09:04,859
you can expose it and clean it regular

1796
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:06,420
propagation is two weeks so what you

1797
01:09:04,859 --> 01:09:09,239
have is you have

1798
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:11,460
the the scientific push and then you

1799
01:09:09,238 --> 01:09:13,798
have the craft push and they're

1800
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:15,600
different and so if it takes me 12

1801
01:09:13,798 --> 01:09:17,460
months to propagate something and get it

1802
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:19,739
in and I can do it in two weeks

1803
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:21,960
then that means that I I'm faster than

1804
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:23,879
you it doesn't mean that I can compete

1805
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:25,319
with you but it means I have a niche

1806
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:27,719
because I can get a product that's

1807
01:09:25,319 --> 01:09:29,819
trending into Market quicker same thing

1808
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:31,140
with seed work where we we see there's a

1809
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:32,640
trend in tripping change we see

1810
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:34,259
volatiles that people want they go

1811
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,239
They're heavy volatile sulfurs are

1812
01:09:34,259 --> 01:09:37,798
coming back into Vogue well we know that

1813
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:40,259
we can run into those populations

1814
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:42,479
quickly and then hunt out a cultivar

1815
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:43,439
versus try to develop a stabilized seed

1816
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:45,899
line which is going to take us a couple

1817
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:48,479
years so stabilize seed work which comes

1818
01:09:45,899 --> 01:09:50,338
from large businesses is a radically

1819
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:52,139
different view than people that are

1820
01:09:50,338 --> 01:09:54,479
hunting from a smaller level and so

1821
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:56,100
they're not really competing and TC

1822
01:09:54,479 --> 01:09:58,819
nurseries aren't really competing with

1823
01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:01,739
conventional nurseries because

1824
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:03,719
propagation is pretty simple and TC is

1825
01:10:01,738 --> 01:10:06,000
extremely expensive to create the

1826
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:08,399
operation but pathogenically you need

1827
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,899
the scrubbing services but the people

1828
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:11,099
that were doing small nurseries were

1829
01:10:09,899 --> 01:10:12,719
like TC who's going to get them right

1830
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:14,699
away and I'm like no they they can't get

1831
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,039
the market the product to Market quick

1832
01:10:14,698 --> 01:10:19,259
enough and so as long as you stay hyper

1833
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:21,300
Nimble it's just the problem is staying

1834
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:24,300
hyper Nimble requires a commitment to

1835
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:26,279
the craft that's phenomenal and for a

1836
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:27,900
lot of people in cannabis prior the

1837
01:10:26,279 --> 01:10:29,099
reason why they got into cannabis was

1838
01:10:27,899 --> 01:10:30,658
because it allowed you I always tell

1839
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,880
people I said the beauty cannabis was it

1840
01:10:30,658 --> 01:10:35,639
let me work x amount days a month and

1841
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:37,980
make make attorney money like doctor

1842
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:40,380
money and what did I get out of that an

1843
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:42,359
unfucking believable good life I had

1844
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:44,400
time to be with my kids I got to travel

1845
01:10:42,359 --> 01:10:45,960
with my children I got to do a lot of

1846
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:47,879
shit regular people don't get to do

1847
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,960
because I had the money and the time and

1848
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,579
someone said you should have been making

1849
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:53,579
more money every day and I said no I

1850
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:55,500
made enough money now I had time

1851
01:10:53,579 --> 01:10:57,899
and that's the problem is that for most

1852
01:10:55,500 --> 01:11:01,198
of us at a career we kind of understood

1853
01:10:57,899 --> 01:11:03,420
the value of time and so the having to

1854
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:06,000
shift in and so like for me at 56 I I

1855
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:07,739
still I'm willing to go but it's hard to

1856
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:10,399
get a lot of people from the world we

1857
01:11:07,738 --> 01:11:13,019
were in to commit to that level of speed

1858
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:14,819
and so the pace is what's killing them

1859
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:17,219
too and but you're totally right that

1860
01:11:14,819 --> 01:11:19,380
there's there's these blinks you can get

1861
01:11:17,219 --> 01:11:21,420
in but you have to be totally cognizant

1862
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:24,179
of the blink and you need to move today

1863
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:25,859
yeah that and you know the word

1864
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:28,440
consistency always comes to mind in our

1865
01:11:25,859 --> 01:11:30,599
shop right consistency every Harvest

1866
01:11:28,439 --> 01:11:33,119
needs to be consistent right that's

1867
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:35,940
really a big part of it and in that yeah

1868
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:37,738
agility is a big a big move and yet here

1869
01:11:35,939 --> 01:11:39,539
in Canada it's the agility there's a

1870
01:11:37,738 --> 01:11:41,939
structured system and I think it's the

1871
01:11:39,539 --> 01:11:44,039
if we understand that structured system

1872
01:11:41,939 --> 01:11:46,019
who we need to sell to at the different

1873
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:47,399
levels right sure you've got your

1874
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:48,840
internal team you've got to sell two

1875
01:11:47,399 --> 01:11:50,698
then you got to get out and then now you

1876
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,260
got to sell to the provincial buyers

1877
01:11:50,698 --> 01:11:53,339
then you got to sell to The Dispensary

1878
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:54,900
buyer then you're gonna sell to the bud

1879
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:57,119
tender and ultimately you got the last

1880
01:11:54,899 --> 01:12:00,299
mile which is the consumer so we've got

1881
01:11:57,119 --> 01:12:02,340
five levels and that's all buried in

1882
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:05,340
beautiful red tape

1883
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:06,900
right it really is it's it's looking at

1884
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:08,880
that and understanding the way that we

1885
01:12:06,899 --> 01:12:10,500
can navigate through that we'll provide

1886
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,440
I think opportunities for brands that

1887
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:15,658
are craft to truly come to the Forefront

1888
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:17,579
and we're seeing the crumble of the

1889
01:12:15,658 --> 01:12:21,119
mid-tier groups right they just can't do

1890
01:12:17,579 --> 01:12:23,340
it they cannot earn and keep the doors

1891
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:25,619
open for the dollar and the wholesale

1892
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:27,779
market today it's it's an interesting

1893
01:12:25,619 --> 01:12:29,880
Market it really is here in Canada it's

1894
01:12:27,779 --> 01:12:32,099
super competitive extremely competitive

1895
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:34,739
you guys over built like your your

1896
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:35,940
expectations of of moving product

1897
01:12:34,738 --> 01:12:37,678
globally

1898
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:39,658
unfortunately just didn't come to

1899
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:41,880
fruition well with US Dollars though

1900
01:12:39,658 --> 01:12:43,079
yeah yeah right U.S cash yeah yeah

1901
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:45,239
because we couldn't we couldn't use the

1902
01:12:43,079 --> 01:12:47,340
stock market in the US and so but the

1903
01:12:45,238 --> 01:12:49,439
thing is it like you know some of the

1904
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:51,079
California Ops you know that we're going

1905
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:53,639
to see a lot of these major ones fold up

1906
01:12:51,079 --> 01:12:55,319
and nobody's talking about it but I'm

1907
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:57,420
like I know you're not turning to profit

1908
01:12:55,319 --> 01:12:59,279
and your investors at this point aren't

1909
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:00,719
going to give you any more money and so

1910
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:02,279
we're going to see this cleansing we

1911
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:04,980
figured that you should see in the next

1912
01:13:02,279 --> 01:13:06,479
year and a half so next year should be a

1913
01:13:04,979 --> 01:13:09,479
blood bath again and then we'll start to

1914
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:12,658
come out of it and you get into 2024

1915
01:13:09,479 --> 01:13:14,639
in 2025 and you start to have normality

1916
01:13:12,658 --> 01:13:15,599
because we've cleaned out both big and

1917
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,920
small

1918
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,300
and you got to get rid of these bigger

1919
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:21,119
groups because really what they're doing

1920
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:24,360
is they're dumping and in California I'd

1921
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:25,738
say 40 50 of the total products sold in

1922
01:13:24,359 --> 01:13:27,719
stores the other half of the product

1923
01:13:25,738 --> 01:13:31,019
grown is going out the back door

1924
01:13:27,719 --> 01:13:32,760
and so it's it's sustaining groups that

1925
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:34,860
shouldn't be sustained

1926
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:36,900
because ultimately what you're doing is

1927
01:13:34,859 --> 01:13:38,698
you're using your tools to to be able to

1928
01:13:36,899 --> 01:13:40,799
work your infrastructure allows you

1929
01:13:38,698 --> 01:13:42,359
enough product to sell at a low price to

1930
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,920
make enough to continue but for small

1931
01:13:42,359 --> 01:13:46,979
farms that's not true

1932
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:49,079
and so it's this it's this odd situation

1933
01:13:46,979 --> 01:13:50,459
where you understand how to manipulate

1934
01:13:49,079 --> 01:13:52,738
the rules

1935
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:54,480
and you're big enough to be able to

1936
01:13:52,738 --> 01:13:56,519
sustain movement and if you can even

1937
01:13:54,479 --> 01:13:58,559
register a nickel on the profit the

1938
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:01,380
investors will continue to feed but

1939
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,300
anybody below that level is dying but

1940
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:06,000
it's it's going to suddenly flop in a

1941
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:07,739
minute it's I can't sustain forever and

1942
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,198
so we're about to see the collapse come

1943
01:14:07,738 --> 01:14:12,059
and we need it we you need to get rid of

1944
01:14:10,198 --> 01:14:13,559
all these large operations that are not

1945
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:15,539
meant to be there I call them aphid

1946
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:16,620
factories because I tore them right

1947
01:14:15,539 --> 01:14:17,519
they're aphid factories that's what

1948
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,479
they're growing is they're aphid

1949
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,860
factories

1950
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:23,158
and I've never seen anything like in my

1951
01:14:19,859 --> 01:14:25,439
life if you stop moving the plants are

1952
01:14:23,158 --> 01:14:27,839
moving so they literally moving on the

1953
01:14:25,439 --> 01:14:29,759
table so then like you know there's only

1954
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:32,880
six companies that make dishwashers

1955
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:34,860
there's only one or two companies that

1956
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:38,039
make eyeglass frames

1957
01:14:34,859 --> 01:14:40,799
are we heading to that sort of Cold War

1958
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:43,979
era in California that is leading the

1959
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:46,980
evolution of the Cannabis sort of yes

1960
01:14:43,979 --> 01:14:49,619
without a question there is no question

1961
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:51,599
that that's what's coming and you know

1962
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:53,519
I'm looking at two million three million

1963
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,719
square foot Greenhouse operations you

1964
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,280
just got one that come online that's

1965
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:57,658
going to be running seven they're

1966
01:14:56,279 --> 01:14:59,219
looking I think their their goal is a

1967
01:14:57,658 --> 01:15:03,299
risk right now about a million million

1968
01:14:59,219 --> 01:15:06,420
pounds per year the goal is to get a 80

1969
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:09,360
ounce into the store and of of decent

1970
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:11,100
weed right decent and the problem is

1971
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:13,380
though is that their marketing and his

1972
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:15,239
craft and so what it does is it confuses

1973
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:17,460
the customer right and so we had we had

1974
01:15:15,238 --> 01:15:20,099
this we had this debate about this

1975
01:15:17,460 --> 01:15:22,020
concept called crafted scale right and

1976
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,100
so the largest operation has this and I

1977
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:25,380
said to them I said isn't that a fucking

1978
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:26,520
oxymoron can they it's like saying

1979
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:29,880
you're tall and short at the same time

1980
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:32,219
they they don't go together and and I'm

1981
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:34,319
laughing but they weren't but

1982
01:15:32,219 --> 01:15:36,480
it's the part is that my thing is take

1983
01:15:34,319 --> 01:15:38,519
the lane you belong in and so what you

1984
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:40,678
need is you need inexpensive cannabis

1985
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:42,659
for the majority because ultimately it's

1986
01:15:40,679 --> 01:15:45,480
an agricultural crop and so if we could

1987
01:15:42,658 --> 01:15:47,879
grow inexpensive cannabis cleanly in a

1988
01:15:45,479 --> 01:15:49,738
sustainable fashion then please let that

1989
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:51,779
happen because people really need to buy

1990
01:15:49,738 --> 01:15:55,019
45 ounces because I don't have the money

1991
01:15:51,779 --> 01:15:57,779
for a 95 eighth and my store is selling

1992
01:15:55,020 --> 01:16:00,179
85 dollar AIDS so like I'm touching the

1993
01:15:57,779 --> 01:16:02,579
highest end of the the periphery of

1994
01:16:00,179 --> 01:16:04,260
cannabis and I'm a craft operator at the

1995
01:16:02,579 --> 01:16:07,019
same time so I'm kind of anomaly because

1996
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:09,300
I'm a craft farmer but I'm I'm playing

1997
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:11,400
with monstrous companies

1998
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:13,440
and so it kind of lets you see the the

1999
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:16,259
picture in totality

2000
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:18,419
but you have to have economies scale to

2001
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:20,579
create these agricultural products and

2002
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:23,579
once we have that now we have a clear

2003
01:16:20,579 --> 01:16:24,960
division on what is craft and and what

2004
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:27,000
we do like like what we've been working

2005
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,140
on is we we've developed the gone GA

2006
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,279
program

2007
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:31,320
and

2008
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:33,179
we we fought hard to get it into

2009
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:35,039
Humboldt County so that what I was able

2010
01:16:33,179 --> 01:16:38,340
to do was get all these people that were

2011
01:16:35,039 --> 01:16:40,560
buyers for these 140 store operations to

2012
01:16:38,340 --> 01:16:42,840
come in and get an education but what I

2013
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,820
do is I bring them in with craft Farmers

2014
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,560
so I have Farmers meet them in the

2015
01:16:44,819 --> 01:16:48,658
parking lot just to smoke weed with them

2016
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,340
and to throw a bag to them and I have

2017
01:16:48,658 --> 01:16:52,079
Farmers come to the class to talk about

2018
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:53,219
it we bring in herb that's two years old

2019
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:54,779
to let them know this is what

2020
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:57,119
two-year-old herb looks like done right

2021
01:16:54,779 --> 01:16:59,639
and what it does it's recalibrating

2022
01:16:57,119 --> 01:17:01,319
everybody so it's allowing us to start

2023
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:03,079
getting bigger companies to start

2024
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:05,279
creating

2025
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:07,380
relationships with Craft Farms because

2026
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:08,819
the lead buyer of someone who's moving

2027
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:11,279
two billion dollars worth of weed

2028
01:17:08,819 --> 01:17:13,019
realizes that's better pot

2029
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:15,359
and so we're working on this education

2030
01:17:13,020 --> 01:17:16,920
but educating the customer it's

2031
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:18,359
effective but you better educate the

2032
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:20,039
people who are buying the grass for the

2033
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:21,899
distro and who's who's buying the weed

2034
01:17:20,039 --> 01:17:24,600
for the store because they're the ones

2035
01:17:21,899 --> 01:17:26,879
that put the product in the window and

2036
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:29,640
then the data is based off of that

2037
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:31,800
so the the gatekeeper is the one who's

2038
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:33,420
really controlling the data and people

2039
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:35,100
are trying to educate the customer

2040
01:17:33,420 --> 01:17:37,020
constantly and all I'm trying to educate

2041
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:39,179
the customer on is how do you buy weed

2042
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:40,860
in the new system it's the people who

2043
01:17:39,179 --> 01:17:42,899
are going to sell the weed that you need

2044
01:17:40,859 --> 01:17:44,639
to educate on how do you Market it how

2045
01:17:42,899 --> 01:17:48,179
do you showcase it how do you gradient

2046
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:50,940
on price and how do we determine quality

2047
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:53,399
that's not branding because right now

2048
01:17:50,939 --> 01:17:56,460
branding controls price quality is

2049
01:17:53,399 --> 01:17:58,439
quality branding is branding and we want

2050
01:17:56,460 --> 01:18:00,060
to clearly start to Define it so we

2051
01:17:58,439 --> 01:18:02,579
spend all this time developing the

2052
01:18:00,060 --> 01:18:04,500
system so that what we could do and my

2053
01:18:02,579 --> 01:18:06,179
goal wasn't to educate the consumer it

2054
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:08,520
was to educate the people who are

2055
01:18:06,179 --> 01:18:10,679
gatekeeping our money so that they have

2056
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:13,080
an ability to understand wow craft

2057
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:15,179
product is better if there's an Echelon

2058
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:16,019
and there's an upper echelon then that's

2059
01:18:15,179 --> 01:18:17,880
craft

2060
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:19,739
and that way we are able to get lifted

2061
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:22,020
up because craft has to be more valuable

2062
01:18:19,738 --> 01:18:24,059
than commercial or we can't do it and

2063
01:18:22,020 --> 01:18:26,820
and and it's not about

2064
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:28,380
because we we're there because I know a

2065
01:18:26,819 --> 01:18:29,939
lot of Craft Farms that grow shitty pot

2066
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:31,020
like I'm just going to say what it is

2067
01:18:29,939 --> 01:18:32,579
they've been growing wheat for a long

2068
01:18:31,020 --> 01:18:34,679
time and they were able to get sub-grade

2069
01:18:32,579 --> 01:18:37,500
herb into the system because the system

2070
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:39,840
had a fucking need well there's no more

2071
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:41,039
need and now it better be good and what

2072
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,199
you're seeing is pretty good isn't good

2073
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:45,600
enough and most people were pretty good

2074
01:18:43,198 --> 01:18:47,759
and you have to really be clear about

2075
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,920
like what's good and what's not and and

2076
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:52,380
developing these grading standards and

2077
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:55,020
getting the ability to be able to say I

2078
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:57,300
got you this is better blending your

2079
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:59,040
hash shouldn't have to be the case

2080
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:00,179
because the bottom line the irony when

2081
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:01,560
you say in that I'm the guy that

2082
01:19:00,179 --> 01:19:04,440
invented that was fell out of my fucking

2083
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:07,440
chair because it's so true you're like

2084
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:09,599
I'm the wrong person to blend I'm the

2085
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:10,919
guy that separated it you can't make me

2086
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,719
go back

2087
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:14,158
and they have to because otherwise you

2088
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:16,380
can't exist

2089
01:19:14,158 --> 01:19:20,219
and and it's it's in that it's in that

2090
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:22,199
reality and it's it's the communication

2091
01:19:20,219 --> 01:19:24,000
to the people who are selling and buying

2092
01:19:22,198 --> 01:19:26,039
and getting them to actually sit down

2093
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,140
and experience the different products

2094
01:19:26,039 --> 01:19:29,460
and be able to say look I'm not trying

2095
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:31,440
to convince you with words I'm going to

2096
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:32,698
let you chill the product and and you'll

2097
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:35,219
experience it

2098
01:19:32,698 --> 01:19:36,419
that's what's what's not taken place

2099
01:19:35,219 --> 01:19:38,579
because we don't have that open

2100
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:40,260
environment with cannabis anymore the

2101
01:19:38,579 --> 01:19:43,140
way that the shops used to work was it

2102
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:44,880
was radically more freely moving and so

2103
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:46,500
you could bring product in talk to the

2104
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:48,239
buyer show the product consume the

2105
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:50,039
product give them some product let them

2106
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:53,158
think about the product then they would

2107
01:19:50,039 --> 01:19:55,380
take your product now it's through a

2108
01:19:53,158 --> 01:19:58,259
buyer that is disconnected from anything

2109
01:19:55,380 --> 01:20:00,659
else and and they're and I'm saying

2110
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:02,579
Canada they are radically undereducated

2111
01:20:00,658 --> 01:20:04,439
holy Christ like you guys have a problem

2112
01:20:02,579 --> 01:20:07,619
you have a problem you have government

2113
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:09,299
officials buying you weed holy shit when

2114
01:20:07,619 --> 01:20:10,559
I realized like when I got to look at

2115
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:11,820
this yeah because he said I looked at it

2116
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,140
like a customer because that's the only

2117
01:20:11,819 --> 01:20:14,519
person I really care about in the

2118
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:17,159
business because everyone's bought a

2119
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:18,960
weed right so I said what's it like to

2120
01:20:17,158 --> 01:20:20,460
go to a store take me to a store and so

2121
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,198
Dennis and Mark took me to a store and I

2122
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:24,539
was like looking around and I'm like 140

2123
01:20:22,198 --> 01:20:27,000
pre-rolls in a container and then it was

2124
01:20:24,539 --> 01:20:28,560
140 and 60 and 20. I'm like people

2125
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,859
buying that shit

2126
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:35,760
wow like that's a purchase

2127
01:20:31,859 --> 01:20:38,158
and it was and I realized wow Canada

2128
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:40,500
whoa your your legacy Market must be

2129
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:42,238
doing the majority of the good work

2130
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:44,158
because there's nothing in the store

2131
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:46,678
that was good well the people who bought

2132
01:20:44,158 --> 01:20:48,839
cannabis in the past in Canada were not

2133
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:50,699
in those channels to get those jobs the

2134
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:53,100
people who got those jobs were in liquor

2135
01:20:50,698 --> 01:20:54,899
distribution and tobacco distribution

2136
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:56,760
and they just moved right into those

2137
01:20:54,899 --> 01:20:58,439
jobs I thought the same thing and I

2138
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:00,600
think the same thing but I will say

2139
01:20:58,439 --> 01:21:02,819
there is a silver lining there's

2140
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:04,679
cannabis people now buyers that have

2141
01:21:02,819 --> 01:21:07,500
been buyers over the years that are now

2142
01:21:04,679 --> 01:21:10,260
going into those jobs and I met a guy in

2143
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:11,698
Manitoba this guy Dan he called me up

2144
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:13,800
he's like oh I'm one of the buyers for

2145
01:21:11,698 --> 01:21:15,658
Manitoba and I'm like oh my God what's

2146
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:18,000
this gonna be like I brought my pot

2147
01:21:15,658 --> 01:21:20,039
smoking Uncle over to his house we go to

2148
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,779
this guy's house and I'm telling you I

2149
01:21:20,039 --> 01:21:25,380
was like I teared up a little bit I was

2150
01:21:21,779 --> 01:21:27,779
like every single room in his house was

2151
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:29,699
overflowing with like he had rosin

2152
01:21:27,779 --> 01:21:31,979
presses and he had grow tents and he was

2153
01:21:29,698 --> 01:21:34,379
he was 3D printing tags for all of

2154
01:21:31,979 --> 01:21:36,839
plants in one room like everything in

2155
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:39,420
the house was for weed and I just

2156
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:41,640
thought fuck if we get more guys like

2157
01:21:39,420 --> 01:21:44,119
this being the buyers for the provinces

2158
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:46,560
I mean that's legitimately what you need

2159
01:21:44,119 --> 01:21:48,719
you really need that we don't have it

2160
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,880
yet no you have to have the regulatory

2161
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:52,619
support and and the thing is that

2162
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:55,800
cannabis has become a cannabis is always

2163
01:21:52,619 --> 01:21:57,658
cool but it's become it's become allowed

2164
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:59,699
so that people who previously had to

2165
01:21:57,658 --> 01:22:02,339
hide their their stuff can open it up

2166
01:21:59,698 --> 01:22:04,799
and I was with all the state regulators

2167
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:06,600
and I have this this uh uh what do you

2168
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,640
call it an auditor and he comes walking

2169
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,140
up to me and he whispers in my ear I

2170
01:22:08,640 --> 01:22:12,360
Know Who You Are

2171
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:14,219
and that the fucking hair my back stood

2172
01:22:12,359 --> 01:22:15,599
up because when you have the when you

2173
01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:17,039
have the government Auditors saying I

2174
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,600
know who you are and he's like bro I

2175
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:20,039
follow all your shit I got a tent in my

2176
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,780
house right now man I'm gonna send you a

2177
01:22:20,039 --> 01:22:23,340
photo can you give me your number and I

2178
01:22:21,779 --> 01:22:24,359
was like holy shit I think it's gonna be

2179
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:26,640
all right

2180
01:22:24,359 --> 01:22:28,799
because it's the truth you're having a a

2181
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:31,380
change it's just the problem is

2182
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,900
it doesn't happen quick enough when your

2183
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:35,579
capital is bleeding and so the issue

2184
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:37,979
here is a bleed rate

2185
01:22:35,579 --> 01:22:39,719
can you control the bleed rate

2186
01:22:37,979 --> 01:22:41,158
and for a lot of the farmers I talked to

2187
01:22:39,719 --> 01:22:43,260
I said listen just follow your farm and

2188
01:22:41,158 --> 01:22:44,939
go get a job for a year I mean I I

2189
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:46,140
Lawrence Ringo's son I bumped in him the

2190
01:22:44,939 --> 01:22:47,819
other day Lawrence Ringo is one of the

2191
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:50,579
pioneers of CBD right so like we're

2192
01:22:47,819 --> 01:22:53,039
talking Pioneer and and he was a

2193
01:22:50,579 --> 01:22:54,300
sweetheart too man I love Lawrence and I

2194
01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:56,039
bump into his son and I've known his

2195
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:57,480
kids for years too and he's like man I

2196
01:22:56,039 --> 01:22:59,100
followed by farm and he goes and I went

2197
01:22:57,479 --> 01:23:01,439
and got an AG permit he goes it cost me

2198
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:02,820
35 and I said how much can I grow they

2199
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:04,198
said as much as you want anywhere you

2200
01:23:02,819 --> 01:23:05,579
want he goes I put up a farm buildings

2201
01:23:04,198 --> 01:23:07,759
for everybody whatever you want and he's

2202
01:23:05,579 --> 01:23:07,760
like

2203
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:13,440
he's like bro farming is easy

2204
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:14,760
and when is the last time you had

2205
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:17,960
someone say Farm is easy well yeah

2206
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,960
compared to cannabis farming it is

2207
01:23:19,198 --> 01:23:23,639
um I had a question and maybe Kevin you

2208
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:24,960
can answer this but Marcus you made me

2209
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:27,659
think of it when you said like

2210
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,880
pharmaceutical reps come over and

2211
01:23:27,658 --> 01:23:31,500
it's awesome to educate the buyers but

2212
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:34,079
what happens when there's these large

2213
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:35,939
companies that are investor-backed that

2214
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:38,100
have retailers that have to hit certain

2215
01:23:35,939 --> 01:23:39,779
numbers so what they do is what

2216
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:41,820
pharmaceutical companies did where they

2217
01:23:39,779 --> 01:23:44,039
go in and they send sales rep with a

2218
01:23:41,819 --> 01:23:46,139
bunch of perks for the bud tenders who

2219
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:48,060
are then expected to sell a certain

2220
01:23:46,140 --> 01:23:50,699
amount of that product and so it's

2221
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:52,920
basically you know you you have these

2222
01:23:50,698 --> 01:23:56,039
companies that are coming from more

2223
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:58,380
traditional sales backgrounds rather

2224
01:23:56,039 --> 01:24:00,238
than this is the best we have ever seen

2225
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:02,940
you have to put this on the shelf and

2226
01:24:00,238 --> 01:24:04,619
more like okay the bud tenders know this

2227
01:24:02,939 --> 01:24:06,779
they all have the t-shirts they're gonna

2228
01:24:04,619 --> 01:24:09,179
do a demo you know and how does that

2229
01:24:06,779 --> 01:24:12,119
impact that in your that's a good

2230
01:24:09,179 --> 01:24:14,880
question and the problem the problem

2231
01:24:12,119 --> 01:24:16,859
with that mentality and sales is that

2232
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,539
people get really pissed off if they

2233
01:24:16,859 --> 01:24:19,259
even push them Herb that doesn't do the

2234
01:24:18,539 --> 01:24:21,960
job

2235
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:23,579
and so as the person at the counter when

2236
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:25,020
someone buys weed from you and comes

2237
01:24:23,579 --> 01:24:26,340
back the next day and throws it at you

2238
01:24:25,020 --> 01:24:28,440
and says the shit sucked and you told me

2239
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:30,420
it was good all of a sudden you don't

2240
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:33,238
want to push that product anymore

2241
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:36,359
and that's a problem with all stores so

2242
01:24:33,238 --> 01:24:38,879
anytime the the the employees lose favor

2243
01:24:36,359 --> 01:24:40,380
of a thing you got to sit down and say

2244
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:42,300
are you just tired of selling it because

2245
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:44,640
we sell a lot of it or are you having

2246
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:46,440
bad feedback that's causing problems and

2247
01:24:44,640 --> 01:24:49,440
we maybe we shouldn't sell it

2248
01:24:46,439 --> 01:24:51,960
and they're two different things so so

2249
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:54,059
selling flour that you need to sell but

2250
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:56,039
trying to sell sub pot flour and push it

2251
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:58,080
to the customer that bites you in the

2252
01:24:56,039 --> 01:25:00,179
ass and it comes back because ultimately

2253
01:24:58,079 --> 01:25:03,059
what you do is you lose the customer and

2254
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:04,980
so the more they try to force the desire

2255
01:25:03,060 --> 01:25:06,539
upon the individual what they don't

2256
01:25:04,979 --> 01:25:07,559
catch fundamentally to me is that it's

2257
01:25:06,539 --> 01:25:09,420
like they don't have to smoke weed in

2258
01:25:07,560 --> 01:25:12,300
their life wheat is the drug that when

2259
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:14,279
you consume it it lets you see bullshit

2260
01:25:12,300 --> 01:25:16,920
it's the drug when you consume it that

2261
01:25:14,279 --> 01:25:19,079
you do not conspire to fuck others over

2262
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:21,779
so you're selling a drug that pond

2263
01:25:19,079 --> 01:25:24,479
consumption gives a lens of clarity

2264
01:25:21,779 --> 01:25:26,420
about what just occurred and so you

2265
01:25:24,479 --> 01:25:29,519
consume and go I just got fucked by you

2266
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:31,980
and you don't go back and so I think

2267
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:33,360
that's the issue it's just what's taken

2268
01:25:31,979 --> 01:25:35,698
places you got

2269
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:37,319
not enough storefronts and so you have

2270
01:25:35,698 --> 01:25:39,178
Limited store for instance so the stores

2271
01:25:37,319 --> 01:25:41,279
control the flow of the product too well

2272
01:25:39,179 --> 01:25:42,840
and then the people that can then make

2273
01:25:41,279 --> 01:25:44,039
the relationships with the store as a

2274
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:46,140
control in it but the thing is they're

2275
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:47,460
having such dissatisfaction that you're

2276
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:49,800
driving customers right out of the

2277
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:52,079
stores so it's backfiring on them as

2278
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:54,539
well because they're losing customers

2279
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:56,399
from that strategy

2280
01:25:54,539 --> 01:25:58,019
you can give them all the t-shirts and

2281
01:25:56,399 --> 01:25:59,759
hats and all the shit you want you get

2282
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:02,280
four customers come in and swear at them

2283
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:04,020
which they do I like I've even been

2284
01:26:02,279 --> 01:26:05,479
behind the counter oh it's an

2285
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:07,380
interesting experience

2286
01:26:05,479 --> 01:26:10,859
especially one that's moving a lot of

2287
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:14,219
people and a lot of money you see rage

2288
01:26:10,859 --> 01:26:16,679
and that shit doesn't work so for me the

2289
01:26:14,219 --> 01:26:19,679
more you try to drive subpop product by

2290
01:26:16,679 --> 01:26:22,319
those methodologies because cannabis as

2291
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:25,260
a consumption when you consume it it's

2292
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:27,000
not fucking ice cream it has a radically

2293
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:28,079
different effect on you and I I talk to

2294
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,238
people all the time and I'm like does

2295
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:32,100
anybody that building even smoke like

2296
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:33,419
you don't have to be a smoker to do the

2297
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:35,579
business but you better have somebody

2298
01:26:33,420 --> 01:26:38,100
who's a consumer in your fucking Circle

2299
01:26:35,579 --> 01:26:40,139
who's clearly telling you this shit is

2300
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:41,219
garbage and if you don't have that and

2301
01:26:40,139 --> 01:26:42,659
you're making the Assumption even the

2302
01:26:41,219 --> 01:26:45,539
scientists I work with in labs they go

2303
01:26:42,658 --> 01:26:46,859
we're doing all analysis by by COA and

2304
01:26:45,539 --> 01:26:47,819
I'm laughing and I'm like I got any

2305
01:26:46,859 --> 01:26:49,799
fucking mind

2306
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:52,079
it's not a lab that's going to consume

2307
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:54,600
it it's a human being so you have to get

2308
01:26:52,079 --> 01:26:57,000
a human in the room to sample it because

2309
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:58,860
this paper does not give you any

2310
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,139
information about that

2311
01:26:58,859 --> 01:27:03,779
and that's just what it is and so

2312
01:27:01,139 --> 01:27:05,699
I get to fuck with some Giants and when

2313
01:27:03,779 --> 01:27:07,439
I see them stumbling around the dock it

2314
01:27:05,698 --> 01:27:10,259
makes me feel a little more confident

2315
01:27:07,439 --> 01:27:13,138
well I think the the keeping us all

2316
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:15,360
isolated not allowing vapor lounges you

2317
01:27:13,139 --> 01:27:18,179
know having vapor lounges would allow so

2318
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:20,219
many people to learn so much if we had a

2319
01:27:18,179 --> 01:27:22,260
place to consume together and you know

2320
01:27:20,219 --> 01:27:24,840
because right now there's really the

2321
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:27,060
market we talk about right now in Canada

2322
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:28,500
is not actually the market you think

2323
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:30,719
you're talking about because that market

2324
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:32,399
the the Legacy Market

2325
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:33,840
most of those people still grow their

2326
01:27:32,399 --> 01:27:35,219
own weed make their own hash trade

2327
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:37,020
amongst their friends buy with their

2328
01:27:35,219 --> 01:27:39,239
friends they're not really a part of the

2329
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:40,500
Canadian Market the Canadian Market is

2330
01:27:39,238 --> 01:27:42,059
all these people that are like oh they

2331
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,859
legalize marijuana like I'm gonna give

2332
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:45,900
it a shot I got a gummy and I got like a

2333
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:47,519
little a drink it tastes like beer and I

2334
01:27:45,899 --> 01:27:49,679
got this other thing this little vape

2335
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:52,620
pen thing and so it's this whole other

2336
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:54,658
group of people that are currently like

2337
01:27:52,619 --> 01:27:57,059
if you want to pay your burn every month

2338
01:27:54,658 --> 01:27:59,279
like they're they're how you're gonna do

2339
01:27:57,060 --> 01:28:01,080
it it's not through all of these but at

2340
01:27:59,279 --> 01:28:03,119
the same time I'm with you I want to

2341
01:28:01,079 --> 01:28:05,340
recapture those people I want to sell

2342
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:07,439
six star and full Mount dry sift and I

2343
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:10,260
want to like have Podium products that

2344
01:28:07,439 --> 01:28:12,839
are like small batch and incredible and

2345
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:15,900
you know powered by regenerative Farms

2346
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:17,819
like Rosebud and done and all these

2347
01:28:15,899 --> 01:28:20,039
different groups in Canada that's what I

2348
01:28:17,819 --> 01:28:22,198
want to see but it's like until we can

2349
01:28:20,039 --> 01:28:23,519
actually sit around and consume cannabis

2350
01:28:22,198 --> 01:28:25,259
in public

2351
01:28:23,520 --> 01:28:27,300
We're Not Gonna you know the world

2352
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:29,039
changed when people just started

2353
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:31,340
drinking beers and pubs the

2354
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:34,019
conversations that occurred from those

2355
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:36,000
experiences with that drug created the

2356
01:28:34,020 --> 01:28:37,860
future world and then they did then they

2357
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,479
started doing tea houses and those

2358
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:40,738
conversations were different from the

2359
01:28:39,479 --> 01:28:42,178
ones that were being done by the

2360
01:28:40,738 --> 01:28:43,799
laborers who were drinking the beer

2361
01:28:42,179 --> 01:28:45,840
these were different people who were

2362
01:28:43,800 --> 01:28:47,400
Scholars and they were drinking tea and

2363
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:49,380
that created conversations that created

2364
01:28:47,399 --> 01:28:50,879
a new future and then people started

2365
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:52,980
drinking coffee and coffee was super

2366
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:55,440
productive and that created a whole

2367
01:28:52,979 --> 01:28:57,839
different reality this is going to as

2368
01:28:55,439 --> 01:29:00,359
well but we need to be able to hang out

2369
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:02,159
in public just like you can go to a

2370
01:29:00,359 --> 01:29:03,899
store right into a vapor lounge and have

2371
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:05,519
these conversations and bump into one

2372
01:29:03,899 --> 01:29:07,738
another and that's why we all loved

2373
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:10,080
Amsterdam in the 80s and the 90s because

2374
01:29:07,738 --> 01:29:12,059
it was that it was the only place in the

2375
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:13,439
world you could go to and just bump into

2376
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:15,060
people from other places yeah I like

2377
01:29:13,439 --> 01:29:16,619
weed too I'm from Denmark oh I'm from

2378
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:18,060
Canada let's talk

2379
01:29:16,619 --> 01:29:19,800
I think that's what's important about

2380
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:22,139
what we're doing right here right now

2381
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:24,960
this is it this is one of the few places

2382
01:29:22,139 --> 01:29:27,900
I've seen in Canada events that allows

2383
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:30,300
us to do that and all get together

2384
01:29:27,899 --> 01:29:31,920
and hang out and Converse with each

2385
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:34,619
other because the community really is

2386
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:36,600
small in the end and uh to be able to

2387
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:39,359
sit with each other and break bread

2388
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,440
let's say is a huge

2389
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:43,319
um

2390
01:29:40,439 --> 01:29:44,698
that impact on how we all walk away and

2391
01:29:43,319 --> 01:29:46,559
think about it and who we talk to and

2392
01:29:44,698 --> 01:29:48,419
how we go out and socially describe what

2393
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,980
we do now and how we think of it is all

2394
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:52,500
influenced by each other's conversations

2395
01:29:49,979 --> 01:29:55,698
here we need more events that are

2396
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:55,698
properly done to be able to do so

2397
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:01,800
and more than events we need normalized

2398
01:29:59,399 --> 01:30:03,359
lounges that are in every city that you

2399
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:05,159
can just be skateboarding and be like Oh

2400
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:06,779
weird like I see pod stores all the time

2401
01:30:05,158 --> 01:30:08,099
I have zero interest in going in I'm

2402
01:30:06,779 --> 01:30:09,539
like oh I should go into this generic

2403
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:12,120
shop that looks like an Apple store that

2404
01:30:09,539 --> 01:30:13,920
has like all the products look exactly

2405
01:30:12,119 --> 01:30:15,658
the same and I and I'm like a cannabis

2406
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:17,880
consumer of 30 plus years and I can't

2407
01:30:15,658 --> 01:30:19,619
fucking recognize any of them is that a

2408
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:21,840
payroll joint oh it's a vape cartridge

2409
01:30:19,619 --> 01:30:24,420
okay that's weird I just can't recognize

2410
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:26,100
any of it but if I went by and saw a

2411
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:27,179
vapor lounge that I could just go into

2412
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:30,120
and here's the other thing about

2413
01:30:27,179 --> 01:30:32,039
cannabis you'd be welcome at every table

2414
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:34,260
in that vapor lounge if there was only

2415
01:30:32,039 --> 01:30:36,300
one chair at a 12 person table and you

2416
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:38,280
walked in of course come and sit down

2417
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:40,440
man we'll smoke with you like let's find

2418
01:30:38,279 --> 01:30:43,439
out who this person is and let's those

2419
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:46,198
conversations that are yet to happen are

2420
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:48,599
going to create our future world I go we

2421
01:30:46,198 --> 01:30:50,698
have we have a a consumption license at

2422
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:52,500
our spot but kovid made it a pain in the

2423
01:30:50,698 --> 01:30:54,178
ass was an outside one and because we

2424
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:56,579
have acreage there we just let the

2425
01:30:54,179 --> 01:30:57,899
acreage be the lounge but I love lounges

2426
01:30:56,579 --> 01:30:59,579
and I go to the ones in the city when

2427
01:30:57,899 --> 01:31:01,019
I'm in town check them out well my

2428
01:30:59,579 --> 01:31:03,000
favorite one was this uh the Northwest

2429
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:05,760
Social Club in Oregon

2430
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,859
and it was so eclectic and diverse and

2431
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:10,860
who was there and how they ran it and

2432
01:31:07,859 --> 01:31:12,479
the cost that it made it really cool and

2433
01:31:10,859 --> 01:31:14,579
and what I tripped out on was that the

2434
01:31:12,479 --> 01:31:17,638
clusters of people who were in their 70s

2435
01:31:14,579 --> 01:31:21,059
and 80s that were bringing in ounces of

2436
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:23,579
oil to blaze I was like whoa you're the

2437
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:25,380
concentrate consumers of bulk and

2438
01:31:23,579 --> 01:31:28,380
quality though you know like but I

2439
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:30,359
couldn't all tie-dyed out and I mean my

2440
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:31,800
grandmother's age and I was just like oh

2441
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:34,500
this is awesome

2442
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:35,699
and it let me see that diversity and

2443
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:37,319
then there was groups of women so I

2444
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:38,819
always look for groups of women because

2445
01:31:37,319 --> 01:31:40,500
what I know is that if you see women

2446
01:31:38,819 --> 01:31:42,420
coming into places or you see women

2447
01:31:40,500 --> 01:31:45,060
walking in areas and you see them

2448
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:47,399
without men they feel safe so they must

2449
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:49,020
be low crime rate and there's no

2450
01:31:47,399 --> 01:31:51,299
pressure to go into the club and so what

2451
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:54,840
I saw is very

2452
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:56,699
different demographics than bars and

2453
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:58,920
radically friendlier with if you could

2454
01:31:56,698 --> 01:32:00,539
sit down there was always a space and we

2455
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:02,279
would go me and Pedro would go and hang

2456
01:32:00,539 --> 01:32:04,738
out in the Northwest and I'd be in there

2457
01:32:02,279 --> 01:32:06,179
for like nine hours and everybody that

2458
01:32:04,738 --> 01:32:07,379
we were supposed to meet on business I'd

2459
01:32:06,179 --> 01:32:08,940
have them come to the club and meet so

2460
01:32:07,380 --> 01:32:11,340
we could just hang out and get high

2461
01:32:08,939 --> 01:32:13,319
and and they had such an incredible

2462
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:15,000
setup where they had underneath on the

2463
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:17,219
the basement they had all the pool

2464
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:19,439
tables and old school games and ping

2465
01:32:17,219 --> 01:32:23,460
pong and shuffleboard and on the on the

2466
01:32:19,439 --> 01:32:25,019
top floor they had all these uh TVs but

2467
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:27,658
it only had four different kinds of

2468
01:32:25,020 --> 01:32:30,420
movie cannabis movies comedies Kung Fu

2469
01:32:27,658 --> 01:32:32,579
and like old school 80s action right so

2470
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:34,800
you had interesting stuff and they had

2471
01:32:32,579 --> 01:32:37,019
music in an outside area and when you

2472
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:38,460
went in the food was really cheap so you

2473
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:40,260
could you know you could get a drink for

2474
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:42,119
a dollar fifty so what it did is it

2475
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:43,860
allowed you not to be victimized while

2476
01:32:42,119 --> 01:32:45,300
you were in and so you bought a yearly

2477
01:32:43,859 --> 01:32:47,219
membership and then you'd show up and

2478
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:48,900
drop a couple bucks to get in

2479
01:32:47,219 --> 01:32:49,980
but it was like my single favorite place

2480
01:32:48,899 --> 01:32:52,259
in the world

2481
01:32:49,979 --> 01:32:53,879
because when I was hanging out there's

2482
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:55,320
always somebody sitting next to you and

2483
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:58,380
everybody starts to have a conversation

2484
01:32:55,319 --> 01:32:59,579
and you don't have that in in bars the

2485
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:01,679
same way because once people get

2486
01:32:59,579 --> 01:33:03,119
liquored up they're a different person

2487
01:33:01,679 --> 01:33:05,460
and

2488
01:33:03,119 --> 01:33:08,219
not everybody transforms but most

2489
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:10,619
transform but with cannabis the

2490
01:33:08,219 --> 01:33:12,359
transformation is usually man this is so

2491
01:33:10,619 --> 01:33:14,760
hot you want to smoke some

2492
01:33:12,359 --> 01:33:16,559
and and it's it's to me it's the way the

2493
01:33:14,760 --> 01:33:17,880
community has to be built so I fully in

2494
01:33:16,560 --> 01:33:19,380
agreement that the fact that we're

2495
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:21,659
allowed to buy the product but we can't

2496
01:33:19,380 --> 01:33:22,679
consume it anywhere except in in our we

2497
01:33:21,658 --> 01:33:23,579
want you to take it directly home and

2498
01:33:22,679 --> 01:33:26,520
consume it in your house when the

2499
01:33:23,579 --> 01:33:29,158
windows closed I can't smoke anywhere in

2500
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:30,780
public I mean it was like that Vancouver

2501
01:33:29,158 --> 01:33:32,698
originally and that was what was really

2502
01:33:30,779 --> 01:33:34,259
cool about Vancouver was going to

2503
01:33:32,698 --> 01:33:36,599
Vancouver wow you can do that here in

2504
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:38,460
North America and buy seeds in the

2505
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:40,679
basement whatever it was you know that

2506
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:42,000
was the blunt Brothers Cafe exactly Ice

2507
01:33:40,679 --> 01:33:44,819
come up and blazing the blunt brothers

2508
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:47,698
because I was like yeah

2509
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:50,039
and um you know and also just that that

2510
01:33:47,698 --> 01:33:51,719
kind of was the patient care side of

2511
01:33:50,039 --> 01:33:53,460
things too it's when you talk about make

2512
01:33:51,719 --> 01:33:54,300
groups of women sometimes that's like

2513
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:55,980
their

2514
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:58,880
Therapy Group where they're going

2515
01:33:55,979 --> 01:34:01,738
through cancer together or something and

2516
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:04,319
and I think for us always cannabis was

2517
01:34:01,738 --> 01:34:06,419
like becoming more intelligent Rising

2518
01:34:04,319 --> 01:34:09,420
above like what was left what was given

2519
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:10,920
to you like medically uh or whether it's

2520
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:12,658
athletes you know there's so many

2521
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:14,158
athletes in the world that are you know

2522
01:34:12,658 --> 01:34:16,319
they're getting broken or they're

2523
01:34:14,158 --> 01:34:19,259
getting compromised and there's no real

2524
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:21,779
guidance in the medical industry for

2525
01:34:19,260 --> 01:34:23,460
True health and well-being so I like the

2526
01:34:21,779 --> 01:34:26,639
idea of lounges as well when they're

2527
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:30,359
mixed with like elixir bars and you know

2528
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:32,100
herbal uh you know exploration hydrosols

2529
01:34:30,359 --> 01:34:33,479
aromatherapy and stuff so you're like

2530
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:35,820
getting high and then all of a sudden

2531
01:34:33,479 --> 01:34:38,339
you're like whoa like experiencing

2532
01:34:35,819 --> 01:34:40,439
plants in a whole different way a better

2533
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:44,340
food a better way of existing at home

2534
01:34:40,439 --> 01:34:45,899
and um that's uh part of the magic of

2535
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:48,239
the ganja and bringing the community

2536
01:34:45,899 --> 01:34:50,819
together and I do think that's missing

2537
01:34:48,238 --> 01:34:53,339
and I think that the medical industry

2538
01:34:50,819 --> 01:34:55,019
and getting the people that are left out

2539
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:57,179
you know when the medical industry can't

2540
01:34:55,020 --> 01:35:00,060
do anything that's her men I have you

2541
01:34:57,179 --> 01:35:03,480
know cannabis really shines and in the

2542
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:05,880
you know the the regulated system I just

2543
01:35:03,479 --> 01:35:07,919
don't feel that medicine is really for

2544
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:12,119
those people so it's almost more just

2545
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:14,039
blast out like consumer medicine where I

2546
01:35:12,119 --> 01:35:17,099
just really resonate with the craft

2547
01:35:14,039 --> 01:35:18,719
aspect of it and creating Avenues and

2548
01:35:17,100 --> 01:35:21,420
lounges and places where we can get

2549
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:23,158
together so we can communicate what's

2550
01:35:21,420 --> 01:35:25,739
working about the medicine and it's not

2551
01:35:23,158 --> 01:35:29,698
just a product that's going out and it

2552
01:35:25,738 --> 01:35:32,039
fits a data set and a you know a a graph

2553
01:35:29,698 --> 01:35:33,779
you know you're actually learning how

2554
01:35:32,039 --> 01:35:36,179
your medicine is reacting with people

2555
01:35:33,779 --> 01:35:37,920
and then people needing it and I just I

2556
01:35:36,179 --> 01:35:40,319
I just will I think all of us would

2557
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:43,079
always stand you know for that that

2558
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:44,759
light and moving forward I hope that we

2559
01:35:43,079 --> 01:35:46,559
can still do that with things that are

2560
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:48,539
happening you know locally local

2561
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:51,840
processors being able to support local

2562
01:35:48,539 --> 01:35:55,380
micro producers and these events uh

2563
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:58,139
moving forward I wanted to actually you

2564
01:35:55,380 --> 01:36:01,920
were almost describing my Vapor Bar in

2565
01:35:58,139 --> 01:36:04,619
in like 2001 my my the melting point so

2566
01:36:01,920 --> 01:36:06,840
I had my first my first Lounge I opened

2567
01:36:04,619 --> 01:36:08,819
up the melting point 2001 on Commercial

2568
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:10,380
Drive I was in Jamaica on the beach and

2569
01:36:08,819 --> 01:36:14,039
my buddy called me and said I found your

2570
01:36:10,380 --> 01:36:16,260
your place 11 I and I and I and I 11 11

2571
01:36:14,039 --> 01:36:17,399
Commercial Drive I was like I rented it

2572
01:36:16,260 --> 01:36:20,340
didn't even know what I was doing

2573
01:36:17,399 --> 01:36:22,019
started a gallery did the whole glass

2574
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:24,000
show with Slinger and all the glass

2575
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:26,360
blowers back in the day like we did the

2576
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:29,340
regenerate and the degenerate art shows

2577
01:36:26,359 --> 01:36:32,698
I opened a raw food living Source Cafe

2578
01:36:29,340 --> 01:36:34,679
that was a hundred percent organic vegan

2579
01:36:32,698 --> 01:36:38,279
and macrobiotic everything was grown

2580
01:36:34,679 --> 01:36:40,800
within 100 miles of the cafe and it was

2581
01:36:38,279 --> 01:36:43,439
just the most magical place I had the

2582
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:46,320
inhalation station of vaporization with

2583
01:36:43,439 --> 01:36:48,419
12 different vaporizers on my table and

2584
01:36:46,319 --> 01:36:50,819
I was vaporizing people with like all

2585
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:53,158
sorts of like different herbs all

2586
01:36:50,819 --> 01:36:54,899
different sorts of terpene profiles and

2587
01:36:53,158 --> 01:36:56,759
then if you were the reason I opened it

2588
01:36:54,899 --> 01:36:58,859
I wasn't selling any weed but at that

2589
01:36:56,760 --> 01:37:00,960
point Canada had a medical you know

2590
01:36:58,859 --> 01:37:03,179
cannabis you could get a license

2591
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:04,260
medically to to have cannabis and I

2592
01:37:03,179 --> 01:37:06,000
thought well

2593
01:37:04,260 --> 01:37:08,100
you can't ask people about their health

2594
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,420
that's illegal like it's not my job so

2595
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:12,239
people wanted to come in and use the

2596
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:13,560
vaporizers and put their Herb in and I

2597
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:16,500
just I'd also want to give a shout out

2598
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:18,659
to Hillary black who prior to that in 97

2599
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:21,119
opened up you know through inspiration

2600
01:37:18,658 --> 01:37:22,738
of California the Corrals Todd McCormick

2601
01:37:21,119 --> 01:37:25,380
all these people that she had spent time

2602
01:37:22,738 --> 01:37:27,718
with down there she came up uh she came

2603
01:37:25,380 --> 01:37:30,119
back to Vancouver in 97 and she opened

2604
01:37:27,719 --> 01:37:32,520
the BC Compassion Club and it's wild to

2605
01:37:30,119 --> 01:37:35,880
think that that was really the one of

2606
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:38,219
the major catalysts that led us to our

2607
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:39,199
conversations tonight which are just so

2608
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:42,719
like

2609
01:37:39,198 --> 01:37:44,219
so different from the birth of what was

2610
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:46,079
created and it was you know it wasn't

2611
01:37:44,219 --> 01:37:48,719
just Hillary it was like just like in

2612
01:37:46,079 --> 01:37:51,300
California it was the gay community who

2613
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:54,179
brought this forward you know they they

2614
01:37:51,300 --> 01:37:56,219
backed cannabis in a way that no other

2615
01:37:54,179 --> 01:38:00,119
person who lived in the sort of Joe

2616
01:37:56,219 --> 01:38:02,399
stratey mainstream world would do and so

2617
01:38:00,119 --> 01:38:04,319
these two dudes kind of hooked up with

2618
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:07,439
Hillary she started the BC Compassion

2619
01:38:04,319 --> 01:38:11,399
Club and who she was helping were the

2620
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:13,379
most vulnerable the most ill terminally

2621
01:38:11,399 --> 01:38:15,238
ill mentally ill like every type of

2622
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:17,819
illness you can have homeless living on

2623
01:38:15,238 --> 01:38:20,698
the street really the most vulnerable

2624
01:38:17,819 --> 01:38:23,039
people that was that was who cannabis

2625
01:38:20,698 --> 01:38:24,719
chose to help first

2626
01:38:23,039 --> 01:38:26,519
because really there was so much

2627
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:29,698
propaganda against it it was still very

2628
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:31,199
much like ooh like this is drugs so it

2629
01:38:29,698 --> 01:38:32,879
was like well let's just help the you

2630
01:38:31,198 --> 01:38:36,059
know the people who literally had the

2631
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:37,560
least and who had the most to lose in a

2632
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:40,020
sense because they just already had

2633
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:42,060
nothing and to watch how the be how

2634
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:43,860
cannabis for me it was very profound

2635
01:38:42,060 --> 01:38:45,659
because I was a broker in the city at

2636
01:38:43,859 --> 01:38:47,219
the time selling a ton of cannabis you

2637
01:38:45,658 --> 01:38:49,979
know in a penthouse apartment just

2638
01:38:47,219 --> 01:38:52,739
flipping mad pounds to everyone and with

2639
01:38:49,979 --> 01:38:55,198
the Compassion Club I was like ooh I

2640
01:38:52,738 --> 01:38:58,019
can't make any profit off of this I have

2641
01:38:55,198 --> 01:39:00,299
to actually lose money and just give the

2642
01:38:58,020 --> 01:39:02,520
Cannabis Compassion Club cannabis and

2643
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:04,500
just be like here's some pounds like I

2644
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:06,300
don't want to make money off this and it

2645
01:39:04,500 --> 01:39:08,819
was the first time in my life I was ever

2646
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:10,980
exposed to like making friends with

2647
01:39:08,819 --> 01:39:12,960
people who would then die like weeks

2648
01:39:10,979 --> 01:39:14,698
later or a month later or a day later

2649
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,960
like there was if you were around in

2650
01:39:14,698 --> 01:39:17,698
those days and I'm sure it was no

2651
01:39:15,960 --> 01:39:21,119
different in California

2652
01:39:17,698 --> 01:39:22,619
they were dying every day so this Core

2653
01:39:21,119 --> 01:39:24,899
group of people that were helping people

2654
01:39:22,619 --> 01:39:27,899
were also dealing with this super heavy

2655
01:39:24,899 --> 01:39:30,000
emotion of of death and that was the

2656
01:39:27,899 --> 01:39:32,279
birth of what has led us now to talk

2657
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:35,279
about data points and marketing and

2658
01:39:32,279 --> 01:39:37,800
compliance and qas and making me mix my

2659
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:40,319
bubble hash and it is just so

2660
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:42,840
so trippy you know I'm not necessarily

2661
01:39:40,319 --> 01:39:46,500
against it but it is a very strange

2662
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:49,579
pathway that that would lead us to to

2663
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:52,500
here you know the irony of how it began

2664
01:39:49,579 --> 01:39:54,658
like I I I knew the story of San

2665
01:39:52,500 --> 01:39:57,420
Francisco cannabis but before Dennis

2666
01:39:54,658 --> 01:39:59,939
perone died and I I met Dennis and knew

2667
01:39:57,420 --> 01:40:02,340
him but before he died

2668
01:39:59,939 --> 01:40:04,079
he has his get-together as a house and

2669
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:06,360
you had to have 30 years in the hustle

2670
01:40:04,079 --> 01:40:08,460
right so only 30-year Hustlers could go

2671
01:40:06,359 --> 01:40:09,899
to the event and so me and a couple of

2672
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:13,198
my partners go down and hang with Dennis

2673
01:40:09,899 --> 01:40:14,638
before he dies and and my buddies got to

2674
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:16,259
hang out with the other architects of

2675
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:18,600
prop 215.

2676
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:21,420
and it was really about

2677
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:23,699
this honesty of we noticed that our

2678
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:26,760
friends who were dying of AIDS could eat

2679
01:40:23,698 --> 01:40:28,379
if they smoked and so we started the

2680
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:31,280
first Compassion Club

2681
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:34,380
and it turned into a five-story monster

2682
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:35,279
and if you poor and needy you got free

2683
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:37,440
weed

2684
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:40,139
and so when I got into medical cannabis

2685
01:40:37,439 --> 01:40:41,460
and and Dennis was a giant Dope Dealer

2686
01:40:40,139 --> 01:40:43,380
like people I don't people have any idea

2687
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:46,020
that fucking Dennis Barone was a giant

2688
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:47,400
Dope Dealer he was out of control for

2689
01:40:46,020 --> 01:40:49,679
years I mean they shot him and tried to

2690
01:40:47,399 --> 01:40:52,319
kill him they really really didn't like

2691
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:54,060
Dennis perone but but inside that little

2692
01:40:52,319 --> 01:40:57,259
motherfucker was the heart of a tiger

2693
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:59,940
and he just would not break and he was

2694
01:40:57,260 --> 01:41:03,000
surrounded by brilliant people as well

2695
01:40:59,939 --> 01:41:04,198
and as a group they drove it forward and

2696
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,399
so when I really got into medical

2697
01:41:04,198 --> 01:41:08,039
cannabis

2698
01:41:05,399 --> 01:41:09,779
it was it was the inspiration for those

2699
01:41:08,039 --> 01:41:11,579
people that I was like wow man if Dennis

2700
01:41:09,779 --> 01:41:12,238
perone can do this that means it can be

2701
01:41:11,579 --> 01:41:14,639
done

2702
01:41:12,238 --> 01:41:16,738
like he proved it that you can be cool

2703
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:18,960
you can you can take care of people who

2704
01:41:16,738 --> 01:41:20,959
are ill and you just have to make sure

2705
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:24,420
that you are making enough money

2706
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:26,760
successfully to sustain it and you have

2707
01:41:24,420 --> 01:41:28,199
you have the ability to do this and

2708
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:30,960
that's what we did and so you know we we

2709
01:41:28,198 --> 01:41:32,819
did we did an ungodly amount of if it

2710
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:34,859
was a CBD product for years you didn't

2711
01:41:32,819 --> 01:41:36,599
pay for it so anything to do with with

2712
01:41:34,859 --> 01:41:38,099
with we were the ones that were

2713
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:39,119
releasing all the CBD genes into the

2714
01:41:38,100 --> 01:41:41,219
system but anything to do with medical

2715
01:41:39,118 --> 01:41:42,839
cannabis if you came to me and you had

2716
01:41:41,219 --> 01:41:45,658
your wife was dying you would die and

2717
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:47,699
you were sick we subsidized you

2718
01:41:45,658 --> 01:41:50,099
and we tried to like hold your hand till

2719
01:41:47,698 --> 01:41:52,500
you died and it was so emotionally

2720
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:54,600
intense because we realized the met I

2721
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:56,039
had never been ill so I hadn't been

2722
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:57,060
through the hospital yet I didn't know

2723
01:41:56,039 --> 01:41:58,319
what it was like to be in the medical

2724
01:41:57,060 --> 01:42:01,020
system

2725
01:41:58,319 --> 01:42:04,079
I didn't understand that for us to reach

2726
01:42:01,020 --> 01:42:06,480
out and be friendly and and kind and

2727
01:42:04,079 --> 01:42:08,039
supportive was that emotionally heavy

2728
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:09,718
and you're watching people break down

2729
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:11,100
and you don't realize they're breaking

2730
01:42:09,719 --> 01:42:12,060
down because they haven't been treated

2731
01:42:11,100 --> 01:42:14,940
nicely

2732
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:17,039
and it was and and it was Heavy because

2733
01:42:14,939 --> 01:42:18,658
I didn't come from a compassionate

2734
01:42:17,039 --> 01:42:20,760
background and I come right out of the

2735
01:42:18,658 --> 01:42:22,618
street and so for me to run the program

2736
01:42:20,760 --> 01:42:24,960
was insane because I wasn't trying to

2737
01:42:22,618 --> 01:42:26,399
make money I I was already I already had

2738
01:42:24,960 --> 01:42:28,260
made money I didn't get into medical

2739
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:30,359
cannabis to make cash I got in because I

2740
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:32,280
wanted a different direction and so for

2741
01:42:30,359 --> 01:42:34,198
me it was odd to see everybody trying to

2742
01:42:32,279 --> 01:42:37,399
like beat the captive audience to death

2743
01:42:34,198 --> 01:42:40,079
and I was just like holy shit

2744
01:42:37,399 --> 01:42:41,279
wow I said I'm the most moral person in

2745
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:44,158
the room and I'm by far the most

2746
01:42:41,279 --> 01:42:46,800
Criminal and it tripped me out it was

2747
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:49,500
something I just it was so eye-opening

2748
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:52,380
that we were more moral

2749
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:54,539
in that regard and I was just like whoa

2750
01:42:52,380 --> 01:42:57,719
I've broken every rule but this one I'm

2751
01:42:54,539 --> 01:43:01,439
not and so I'm about you on that when

2752
01:42:57,719 --> 01:43:03,600
the the gay community AIDS created a

2753
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:06,899
problem that was not dealt with

2754
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:08,579
correctly and internally they discovered

2755
01:43:06,899 --> 01:43:10,319
a product that would help

2756
01:43:08,579 --> 01:43:11,698
and how many times has that occurred

2757
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:12,479
through history but we just lost the

2758
01:43:11,698 --> 01:43:14,759
history

2759
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:16,138
so what other Myriad of problems have

2760
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:18,380
been solved by this that we just don't

2761
01:43:16,139 --> 01:43:18,380
know

2762
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,738
yeah Josh was just mentioning that yeah

2763
01:43:23,399 --> 01:43:27,118
Wham the Legends Legends Legends of

2764
01:43:25,738 --> 01:43:28,500
compassion

2765
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:29,698
I think that we're really hitting the

2766
01:43:28,500 --> 01:43:31,800
nail on the head it's starting to get

2767
01:43:29,698 --> 01:43:34,439
laid too but I'm really hitting the nail

2768
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:37,380
on the head that I think what has

2769
01:43:34,439 --> 01:43:39,899
happened is that we've taken the

2770
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:42,739
compassion out of the Legacy Market by

2771
01:43:39,899 --> 01:43:46,079
forcing the Legacy Market into a

2772
01:43:42,738 --> 01:43:50,759
non-compassionate industry which I like

2773
01:43:46,079 --> 01:43:53,039
to call an outdistry so we are we we're

2774
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:55,199
in it because of compassion

2775
01:43:53,039 --> 01:43:57,118
and now if it's not going to be

2776
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:58,678
compassionate then I'm not in I'm not

2777
01:43:57,118 --> 01:44:00,420
interested like it's not interesting

2778
01:43:58,679 --> 01:44:02,639
anymore me anymore I'm moving to

2779
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:04,560
psychedelics because at least I can find

2780
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:06,420
a place of compassion there because I've

2781
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:08,460
always grown my plants I've always grown

2782
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:11,100
my community I've helped out in my

2783
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:13,800
community I've brought medicine we were

2784
01:44:11,100 --> 01:44:15,719
the medicine makers before you know

2785
01:44:13,800 --> 01:44:18,179
anybody understood it and they're still

2786
01:44:15,719 --> 01:44:19,139
catching up to us in the pharmaceutical

2787
01:44:18,179 --> 01:44:20,279
Market

2788
01:44:19,139 --> 01:44:23,520
so

2789
01:44:20,279 --> 01:44:26,039
we did it because and we still do it

2790
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:27,960
because of the compassion but if they're

2791
01:44:26,039 --> 01:44:29,880
going to force us and take the

2792
01:44:27,960 --> 01:44:31,739
compassion out of it it's just not as

2793
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:33,420
interesting anymore so yeah if we bring

2794
01:44:31,738 --> 01:44:35,698
it back to the compassion I mean that's

2795
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:38,219
really what we're all talking about here

2796
01:44:35,698 --> 01:44:41,339
and I loved it that it's basically like

2797
01:44:38,219 --> 01:44:43,618
where we came back to is like oh it's

2798
01:44:41,340 --> 01:44:46,380
just compassion versus the industry it's

2799
01:44:43,618 --> 01:44:48,479
the outestry versus the freaking Legacy

2800
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:51,480
Market but what it is is the heart and

2801
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:54,539
soul versus the money man

2802
01:44:51,479 --> 01:44:56,939
and there's just simply gonna always be

2803
01:44:54,539 --> 01:44:58,800
people that are more interested in the

2804
01:44:56,939 --> 01:45:00,960
heart and soul of the beginning of any

2805
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:03,659
industry and that's the reason why it

2806
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,980
becomes an industry is because it

2807
01:45:03,658 --> 01:45:07,439
started with heart and soul and that's

2808
01:45:04,979 --> 01:45:10,678
the reason why it was successful

2809
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:13,859
so you know hey cannabis is one of the

2810
01:45:10,679 --> 01:45:16,618
most adaptogen plants adaptogenic plants

2811
01:45:13,859 --> 01:45:19,698
in the world that we know of on this

2812
01:45:16,618 --> 01:45:23,579
planet and us as cultivators of it

2813
01:45:19,698 --> 01:45:25,138
know that if we are to survive and if we

2814
01:45:23,579 --> 01:45:27,779
are to continue to bring plant medicine

2815
01:45:25,139 --> 01:45:32,118
forward then we need to follow her

2816
01:45:27,779 --> 01:45:32,118
guidance of be adaptable

2817
01:45:34,579 --> 01:45:39,960
very well put Kelly

2818
01:45:37,979 --> 01:45:41,879
the only thing I think about in all that

2819
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:43,319
is like yes like I was there for a lot

2820
01:45:41,880 --> 01:45:45,600
of that in the 90s and it was so

2821
01:45:43,319 --> 01:45:47,939
powerful and it was like you know how

2822
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:49,440
could you make How Could You profit off

2823
01:45:47,939 --> 01:45:51,359
of those people like how could you

2824
01:45:49,439 --> 01:45:53,698
profit off patients that are so hurting

2825
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:56,039
it's just but yet how can you sustain it

2826
01:45:53,698 --> 01:45:58,379
well I sustained it through flipping mad

2827
01:45:56,039 --> 01:46:00,118
pounds and then donating the excess like

2828
01:45:58,380 --> 01:46:02,279
I go by 100 pounds and every pound would

2829
01:46:00,118 --> 01:46:04,920
be like 500 grams and I'd be like take

2830
01:46:02,279 --> 01:46:06,420
out make those 454s add it all up and

2831
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:09,000
then go give that to The Compassion Club

2832
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:11,460
but it was like I needed both systems to

2833
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:12,840
to philanthropize to the other side and

2834
01:46:11,460 --> 01:46:14,880
then the other thing I think about is

2835
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:17,639
yes like some people are going to stay

2836
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:20,340
there my what's driving me isn't like

2837
01:46:17,639 --> 01:46:22,020
profit margins and all of this I know

2838
01:46:20,340 --> 01:46:24,539
how important it is to make these

2839
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:27,900
products available to everyone because

2840
01:46:24,539 --> 01:46:29,279
otherwise they're drinking alcohol and

2841
01:46:27,899 --> 01:46:31,319
they're they're they're literally

2842
01:46:29,279 --> 01:46:33,238
consuming things that are bringing down

2843
01:46:31,319 --> 01:46:35,639
their vibrations which is it's really

2844
01:46:33,238 --> 01:46:37,919
making the world a worse place and if we

2845
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:39,719
can just slowly make like psychedelics

2846
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:40,920
available to people and can't like with

2847
01:46:39,719 --> 01:46:42,658
cannabis

2848
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:44,279
he's leading the way you know

2849
01:46:42,658 --> 01:46:46,920
psychedelics are going to be in stores

2850
01:46:44,279 --> 01:46:49,500
soon enough you know Dana Larson what

2851
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:51,899
he's got a the Peyote store or the the

2852
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:53,880
coca leaf store in Vancouver he's

2853
01:46:51,899 --> 01:46:55,379
selling psilocybin capsules he's just

2854
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:56,940
like yeah I did whatever like I'm doing

2855
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:58,679
it again I did it with weed I'll do it

2856
01:46:56,939 --> 01:47:00,539
with this and once they you know allow

2857
01:46:58,679 --> 01:47:01,980
this there's people that always need to

2858
01:47:00,539 --> 01:47:04,738
push that envelope because Civil

2859
01:47:01,979 --> 01:47:06,779
Disobedience no matter what you think is

2860
01:47:04,738 --> 01:47:08,698
what led us here I always remind the

2861
01:47:06,779 --> 01:47:10,979
corporate kind of people like listen

2862
01:47:08,698 --> 01:47:13,079
like it's if we stop pushing the

2863
01:47:10,979 --> 01:47:15,779
envelope now we'll be complacent and

2864
01:47:13,079 --> 01:47:18,118
we'll deteriorate we'll collapse we have

2865
01:47:15,779 --> 01:47:19,738
to always push the envelope and the

2866
01:47:18,118 --> 01:47:21,420
envelope is pushing the rules they're

2867
01:47:19,738 --> 01:47:24,178
putting the boundaries that they're

2868
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:25,440
setting for us we need to keep pushing

2869
01:47:24,179 --> 01:47:27,300
them right where we are right now

2870
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:29,099
because we have moved forward the bottom

2871
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:31,079
line is

2872
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:34,199
you know my buddy Ron who I just visited

2873
01:47:31,079 --> 01:47:35,880
my mentor my dear friend Ron you know

2874
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:37,678
took me under his wing when I was 17

2875
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:39,239
taught me how to grow weed showed me

2876
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:41,819
more weed than I'd ever seen in my life

2877
01:47:39,238 --> 01:47:43,919
he served 11 years in the Stony Mountain

2878
01:47:41,819 --> 01:47:47,698
Penitentiary for being a habitual

2879
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:49,319
florist 11 years with child murders and

2880
01:47:47,698 --> 01:47:51,419
rapists and like the most dangerous

2881
01:47:49,319 --> 01:47:54,238
people that you could imagine and that's

2882
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:56,399
really at least here in Canada for now

2883
01:47:54,238 --> 01:47:58,019
not happening anymore you know we don't

2884
01:47:56,399 --> 01:48:00,118
get guns put in our faces anymore

2885
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:03,239
because we have a backyard full of

2886
01:48:00,118 --> 01:48:05,579
plants like so that to me it's it's it's

2887
01:48:03,238 --> 01:48:07,259
getting better and I want to see how

2888
01:48:05,579 --> 01:48:09,179
much better we can make it by pushing

2889
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:10,679
the boundaries within this within the

2890
01:48:09,179 --> 01:48:12,539
system I don't care if we collapse it

2891
01:48:10,679 --> 01:48:13,679
and push the boundaries to the point we

2892
01:48:12,539 --> 01:48:15,658
need to get back to some Civil

2893
01:48:13,679 --> 01:48:18,300
Disobedience though

2894
01:48:15,658 --> 01:48:20,460
word and continuing with the uh being

2895
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:22,760
able to make products like it's fun to

2896
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:25,139
make products and it's it's compounding

2897
01:48:22,760 --> 01:48:27,119
products that that really is what we

2898
01:48:25,139 --> 01:48:29,760
need right now so like being able to to

2899
01:48:27,118 --> 01:48:33,299
compound products I think is a beautiful

2900
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:36,119
future coming that way I got a shout out

2901
01:48:33,300 --> 01:48:39,199
to my mom uh we're at a pot conference

2902
01:48:36,118 --> 01:48:41,779
and they're they're down on alcohol

2903
01:48:39,198 --> 01:48:44,638
how's that Mom

2904
01:48:41,779 --> 01:48:47,158
I I my mom threw me out of the house

2905
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:49,260
when I was 16. I was next door doing a

2906
01:48:47,158 --> 01:48:50,939
bong hit with my next door neighbor and

2907
01:48:49,260 --> 01:48:53,219
I looked out the window it was dusk

2908
01:48:50,939 --> 01:48:56,299
about you know night and I saw my mom's

2909
01:48:53,219 --> 01:48:59,460
face in the window I'll never forget it

2910
01:48:56,300 --> 01:49:00,960
and after that I I said quick I got to

2911
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:03,840
go home when I went home my stuff was

2912
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:06,139
right on the porch man I was out well at

2913
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:09,600
that time how old are you

2914
01:49:06,139 --> 01:49:11,760
so you so you were I'm 56 but you were

2915
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:15,600
you're from that you're from the

2916
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:19,380
absolute peak of this shit's heroin when

2917
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:21,179
my my family was organized crime right

2918
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:23,520
I was considered the worst criminal in

2919
01:49:21,179 --> 01:49:26,399
the house and I got relatives doing 200

2920
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:30,300
years in prison and I was the criminal

2921
01:49:26,399 --> 01:49:33,179
because it because oh my God drugs weed

2922
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:34,860
because weed was worse than heroin and

2923
01:49:33,179 --> 01:49:37,440
and I trip out that uh because the

2924
01:49:34,859 --> 01:49:40,859
propaganda was so unbelievable

2925
01:49:37,439 --> 01:49:42,299
and now here we are now and so I agree

2926
01:49:40,859 --> 01:49:44,099
with you Marcus that I we we're making

2927
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:45,779
these changes and we still you know in

2928
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:47,639
the U.S they're still stuck in people in

2929
01:49:45,779 --> 01:49:49,019
The Joint left and right so we're not

2930
01:49:47,639 --> 01:49:51,239
we're not doing the job we're supposed

2931
01:49:49,020 --> 01:49:53,639
to it's a lot of rhetoric but what

2932
01:49:51,238 --> 01:49:55,678
you're seeing is people becoming

2933
01:49:53,639 --> 01:49:58,859
cannabis

2934
01:49:55,679 --> 01:50:00,600
aficionados cannabis um just not just

2935
01:49:58,859 --> 01:50:03,719
consumers but also

2936
01:50:00,600 --> 01:50:06,300
culturally aware and the more the the

2937
01:50:03,719 --> 01:50:07,980
the public becomes sensitized the harder

2938
01:50:06,300 --> 01:50:10,020
it is to screw people

2939
01:50:07,979 --> 01:50:12,839
because they're your jury

2940
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:16,080
and so you have to be able to allow this

2941
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:17,880
to take place but you know I mean

2942
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:19,019
I've just been waiting my whole life and

2943
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:20,520
so I just figure well I'm not gonna

2944
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:22,139
someone said like they go what are you

2945
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:23,880
gonna do next and I said there is no

2946
01:50:22,139 --> 01:50:26,039
next this is what I do

2947
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:27,779
and I'm gonna do this till I'm dead and

2948
01:50:26,039 --> 01:50:30,000
so because of that I know that the

2949
01:50:27,779 --> 01:50:31,559
timeline is forever and so I just need

2950
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:34,439
to make sure that I make good good

2951
01:50:31,560 --> 01:50:36,539
movement and that I see long term and

2952
01:50:34,439 --> 01:50:38,579
then I try to build value and I try to

2953
01:50:36,539 --> 01:50:40,679
drag as many people forward with me as I

2954
01:50:38,579 --> 01:50:42,979
can because it's hard to party alone and

2955
01:50:40,679 --> 01:50:46,020
have a good time

2956
01:50:42,979 --> 01:50:47,879
uh in Canada the laws are like still

2957
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:50,219
transforming you know like everywhere

2958
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:52,260
and um it's important for us to continue

2959
01:50:50,219 --> 01:50:54,060
to learn it's cool to hear about New

2960
01:50:52,260 --> 01:50:55,560
York and all the vaping lounges it's

2961
01:50:54,060 --> 01:50:58,679
like you can smoke anywhere in New York

2962
01:50:55,560 --> 01:51:00,179

2963
01:50:58,679 --> 01:51:02,940

uh available in Maine and a lot of our

2967
01:51:07,859 --> 01:51:11,939
Farmers that we work with in Maine have

2968
01:51:10,198 --> 01:51:14,519
a really amazing system

2969
01:51:11,939 --> 01:51:17,399
a lot of good stuff in Michigan you know

whole scene they're going down next yeah

2977
01:51:33,118 --> 01:51:37,439

2978
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:39,719
Oklahoma's hitting the ground next right

2979
01:51:37,439 --> 01:51:40,979
yeah yeah my buddy my buddy's telling me

2980
01:51:39,719 --> 01:51:42,359
we're in the next humble then he hits me

2981
01:51:40,979 --> 01:51:43,559
up the next day and he goes man Hale

2982
01:51:42,359 --> 01:51:46,099
took my whole crop and I said you're not

2983
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:46,100
the next humble

2984
01:51:46,579 --> 01:51:50,420
it's going to be all right

2985
01:51:53,579 --> 01:51:57,960
how did Oklahoma go from giving Will

2986
01:51:55,618 --> 01:51:59,639
Foster 96 years in prison for growing

2987
01:51:57,960 --> 01:52:03,118
some plants in his basement to just

2988
01:51:59,639 --> 01:52:05,940
literally letting everyone grow weed

2989
01:52:03,118 --> 01:52:09,599
cash grab 2500 2500 for the license it's

2990
01:52:05,939 --> 01:52:12,118
a cash grab and it's mind-bending

2991
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:15,119
well you got people in prison watching

2992
01:52:12,118 --> 01:52:17,819
this occur and you you're and I'm I'm

2993
01:52:15,118 --> 01:52:19,559
I'm expunged but I'm a multi-time felon

2994
01:52:17,819 --> 01:52:21,539
I collected a whole slew of the fucking

2995
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:22,860
charges over the years right and so they

2996
01:52:21,539 --> 01:52:25,319
only come up when the federal database

2997
01:52:22,859 --> 01:52:26,819
pulls me and so I so I have to I had to

2998
01:52:25,319 --> 01:52:28,618
write this letter of Contrition for my

2999
01:52:26,819 --> 01:52:31,259
license and I had to say

3000
01:52:28,618 --> 01:52:32,698
I apologize for the crime I committed so

3001
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:34,440
that I can commit the crime legally

3002
01:52:32,698 --> 01:52:36,359
today and that's what I wrote as my

3003
01:52:34,439 --> 01:52:39,299
statement I said this work and they were

3004
01:52:36,359 --> 01:52:41,698
like well I guess it's contrite but I

3005
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:43,800
was just like this is great

3006
01:52:41,698 --> 01:52:45,599
yes and so you know I have all the

3007
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:48,659
expungement so I come up as a clean

3008
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:51,719
individual but the bottom line is

3009
01:52:48,658 --> 01:52:53,579
what allowed that to happen was was the

3010
01:52:51,719 --> 01:52:55,079
money I made in the hustle because most

3011
01:52:53,579 --> 01:52:57,059
most the people didn't have that lawyer

3012
01:52:55,079 --> 01:52:58,800
power where I had a lawyer Entertainer

3013
01:52:57,060 --> 01:53:00,239
for like 25 years

3014
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,920
so like when you're hanging out with

3015
01:53:00,238 --> 01:53:02,939
your tourney all the time you have a

3016
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:05,039
different life

3017
01:53:02,939 --> 01:53:07,618
and most people don't have that ability

3018
01:53:05,039 --> 01:53:10,139
and so for me I'm like I I

3019
01:53:07,618 --> 01:53:12,539
I feel fortunate not smart

3020
01:53:10,139 --> 01:53:14,699
and the number of my friends at the time

3021
01:53:12,539 --> 01:53:16,979
in the joint and then like my family did

3022
01:53:14,698 --> 01:53:19,138
time all of a weed I'm like we're still

3023
01:53:16,979 --> 01:53:20,879
not done but we're moving forward but

3024
01:53:19,139 --> 01:53:23,219
this shit that shit I can handle you

3025
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:24,480
slowing my business down I can't handle

3026
01:53:23,219 --> 01:53:26,340
you fucking people and put them in the

3027
01:53:24,479 --> 01:53:28,259
joint like if there was a choice between

3028
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:29,880
the two you can you can you can make my

3029
01:53:28,260 --> 01:53:31,320
business life harder versus put someone

3030
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:33,420
in prison because once you in prison

3031
01:53:31,319 --> 01:53:35,698
you're in a different fucking world

3032
01:53:33,420 --> 01:53:38,779
and the average individual growing weed

3033
01:53:35,698 --> 01:53:41,460
does not belong in prison

3034
01:53:38,779 --> 01:53:43,319
time you if you're not a certain type of

3035
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:46,560
dude you have a bad time well I was

3036
01:53:43,319 --> 01:53:48,479
facing 25 years and I remember the judge

3037
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:51,179
asking my lawyer how would be November

3038
01:53:48,479 --> 01:53:53,158
22nd be for the next uh date and John

3039
01:53:51,179 --> 01:53:55,500
conradly he's like oh no your honor that

3040
01:53:53,158 --> 01:53:57,599
that date won't work for me leans over

3041
01:53:55,500 --> 01:54:00,238
to my ear and he goes cause I'll be at

3042
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:03,119
the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam with my

3043
01:54:00,238 --> 01:54:04,859
clients like in court he says this and

3044
01:54:03,118 --> 01:54:07,259
I'm like holy fuck I'm just like this is

3045
01:54:04,859 --> 01:54:09,359
my first time getting busted I'm kind of

3046
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:12,000
like okay like yeah that's true we are

3047
01:54:09,359 --> 01:54:14,880
going to the Cannabis Cup together

3048
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:16,979
fuck so it's it is important to be good

3049
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:18,719
friends with you Laura and have the

3050
01:54:16,979 --> 01:54:20,879
right lawyer and have the right lawyer

3051
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:22,198
and yeah well you do have to have a

3052
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:24,359
couple but you have to have one key

3053
01:54:22,198 --> 01:54:26,519
lawyer and and then what happens is he

3054
01:54:24,359 --> 01:54:28,979
becomes kind of like you consularity and

3055
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:31,139
through him he finds your other lawyers

3056
01:54:28,979 --> 01:54:32,759
you don't look for lawyers your lawyer

3057
01:54:31,139 --> 01:54:34,679
looks for lawyers and you say look I got

3058
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:35,880
a problem let's put a team together your

3059
01:54:34,679 --> 01:54:37,199
lawyer puts the team together because

3060
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:38,940
the one thing you know is that attorney

3061
01:54:37,198 --> 01:54:41,158
you've chosen who's worked with you is

3062
01:54:38,939 --> 01:54:43,379
about you and you know that when they

3063
01:54:41,158 --> 01:54:46,079
get in court they're fucking ferocious

3068
01:54:51,479 --> 01:54:54,419

3086
01:55:26,340 --> 01:55:30,779
the prosecutor in the hallway asks he

3087
01:55:29,520 --> 01:55:32,580
says hey did you hear about our good

3088
01:55:30,779 --> 01:55:34,559

3089
01:55:32,579 --> 01:55:36,899

3090
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:38,940
prostate cancer he's in uh he's in the

3091
01:55:36,899 --> 01:55:40,859
hospital do you think your client could

3092
01:55:38,939 --> 01:55:44,039
get him a bag of weed so now my

3093
01:55:40,859 --> 01:55:46,139
prosecutor is trafficking in cannabis in

3094
01:55:44,039 --> 01:55:47,219
the hallway while Prosecuting me for

3095
01:55:46,139 --> 01:55:51,980
cannabis

3096
01:55:47,219 --> 01:55:51,980
I was just like holy shit

3097
01:55:52,618 --> 01:55:56,118
I did get him a bag of weed

3098
01:56:02,899 --> 01:56:06,118
oh yeah we're holding them but hold on

3099
01:56:04,859 --> 01:56:08,158
awake but no that's it's a funny shit

3100
01:56:06,118 --> 01:56:10,618
but it's true it's the and but the issue

3101
01:56:08,158 --> 01:56:11,939
is you know that the the legal system I

3102
01:56:10,618 --> 01:56:14,219
don't care what country you're in is

3103
01:56:11,939 --> 01:56:15,899
expensive and the average individual

3104
01:56:14,219 --> 01:56:17,158
can't really fight a case they have to

3105
01:56:15,899 --> 01:56:18,299
they have to take a public defender and

3106
01:56:17,158 --> 01:56:19,979
cop a plea

3107
01:56:18,300 --> 01:56:21,719
and they don't people don't understand

3108
01:56:19,979 --> 01:56:23,519
that you know your provided attorney the

3109
01:56:21,719 --> 01:56:26,279
attorney's job isn't to defend you it's

3110
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:28,020
to come and play and so you end up

3111
01:56:26,279 --> 01:56:29,460
having to settle these pieces and so

3112
01:56:28,020 --> 01:56:32,400
most people just don't have the legal

3113
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:33,420
power and I mean I just seen it when I

3114
01:56:32,399 --> 01:56:35,638
was like that's why I left Rhode Island

3115
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:37,319
really was that I was visiting my cousin

3116
01:56:35,639 --> 01:56:39,118
in the joint he's doing 200 years in

3117
01:56:37,319 --> 01:56:41,279
prison all my friends about to about

3118
01:56:39,118 --> 01:56:42,359
spend their lives in prison and I'm

3119
01:56:41,279 --> 01:56:43,979
sitting there going man there's no

3120
01:56:42,359 --> 01:56:45,299
future we're all going to we're going to

3121
01:56:43,979 --> 01:56:46,799
the Joint you're carrying a bag of grass

3122
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:48,300
in your pocket you go into prison at the

3123
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:50,039
time right and we're all we're all in

3124
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:52,139
crime pot so like we're definitely going

3125
01:56:50,039 --> 01:56:54,600
down for time and I was like

3126
01:56:52,139 --> 01:56:57,118
this is this isn't this isn't there's

3127
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:59,520
nothing here and it had become it was 83

3128
01:56:57,118 --> 01:57:01,139
so the drug law was in full effect and

3129
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,520
they were just sweeping people up so me

3130
01:57:01,139 --> 01:57:03,659
and Dale garringer from normal were

3131
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:06,659
hanging out and we were talking about

3132
01:57:03,658 --> 01:57:08,638
timelines he said Woo 83 was aggressive

3133
01:57:06,658 --> 01:57:10,019
and I said everywhere and he goes oh

3134
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:12,239
yeah that was the year where they went

3135
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:13,440
off and that's where I got smashed

3136
01:57:12,238 --> 01:57:15,178
but

3137
01:57:13,439 --> 01:57:18,419
you you

3138
01:57:15,179 --> 01:57:20,579
can't live a life where every moment the

3139
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:23,760
penalty is is death

3140
01:57:20,579 --> 01:57:25,260
it's too it's just too much and and so I

3141
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:27,719
said look I'm gonna get out of here for

3142
01:57:25,260 --> 01:57:30,119
a minute and then as when I was gone I

3143
01:57:27,719 --> 01:57:32,219
spent I spent an afternoon with a global

3144
01:57:30,118 --> 01:57:34,380
level drug trafficker and he he helped

3145
01:57:32,219 --> 01:57:37,618
me understand that cannabis was my life

3146
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:39,359
and was my future and I said wow that's

3147
01:57:37,618 --> 01:57:40,738
that's heavy and I got when I got out of

3148
01:57:39,359 --> 01:57:42,000
the military I went right back into the

3149
01:57:40,738 --> 01:57:44,039
game and never left

3150
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,139
because he helped me understand that

3151
01:57:44,039 --> 01:57:48,599
that was a time period and that the

3152
01:57:46,139 --> 01:57:49,920
evolution of cannabis was about to begin

3153
01:57:48,599 --> 01:57:52,319
he said that we're about to go through

3154
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:54,060
his radical Global change and I was like

3155
01:57:52,319 --> 01:57:56,039
wow I'm gonna I'm gonna ride that change

3156
01:57:54,060 --> 01:57:59,400
because being a nurb is where I had my

3157
01:57:56,039 --> 01:58:01,859
my best time it was where I felt uh most

3158
01:57:59,399 --> 01:58:03,539
comfortable you know consuming cannabis

3159
01:58:01,859 --> 01:58:06,000
being around cannabis people cannabis

3160
01:58:03,539 --> 01:58:08,340
cultivation like that was me and when I

3161
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:11,760
put it down you put down a piece of

3162
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:13,199
yourself but I just I everyone around me

3163
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:14,699
was going to prison and I already been

3164
01:58:13,198 --> 01:58:16,979
incarcerated so I was just like this

3165
01:58:14,698 --> 01:58:19,379
isn't fucking life no but what it did

3166
01:58:16,979 --> 01:58:20,819
here in Canada was it made cannabis very

3167
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:22,020
valuable because we would get caught

3168
01:58:20,819 --> 01:58:24,299
with it and really you'd have to have

3169
01:58:22,020 --> 01:58:26,940
hundreds of pounds to go to prison so it

3170
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:28,800
was suddenly like pounds were like so

3171
01:58:26,939 --> 01:58:31,198
and I don't know about 83 what pounds

3172
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:34,260
we're selling for but like by 93 it's

3173
01:58:31,198 --> 01:58:36,299
like 5500 to 7 000 US dollars in

3174
01:58:34,260 --> 01:58:38,520
Manhattan for a pound of good weed and

3175
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:41,099
you could buy it you could buy it in in

3176
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:44,040
in well but like by the 100 pack you

3177
01:58:41,099 --> 01:58:47,340
could buy it by uh um in Vancouver for

3178
01:58:44,039 --> 01:58:50,238
like 2400 Canadian to like on a high-end

3179
01:58:47,340 --> 01:58:54,239
3200 Canadian which at the time was like

3180
01:58:50,238 --> 01:58:55,738
1.48 exchange so it was like you're

3181
01:58:54,238 --> 01:58:57,000
paying like with your American dollars

3182
01:58:55,738 --> 01:58:59,579
you're like I think I just paid like

3183
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,500
1300 US dollars for this pound and now

3184
01:58:59,579 --> 01:59:03,899
this pound is worth like six or seven

3185
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:06,118
thousand US Dollars and I'm moving 200

3186
01:59:03,899 --> 01:59:10,079
at a time or a thousand at a time like

3187
01:59:06,118 --> 01:59:11,880
it just became such a crazy place where

3188
01:59:10,079 --> 01:59:13,500
it was like the wild wild west but you

3189
01:59:11,880 --> 01:59:15,359
also had all these amazing people coming

3190
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:17,340
up who you'd become friends with but

3191
01:59:15,359 --> 01:59:18,899
then you'd never see them again because

3192
01:59:17,340 --> 01:59:20,639
they got pulled over in Spokane or they

3193
01:59:18,899 --> 01:59:23,158
went down to Alabama or they like went

3194
01:59:20,639 --> 01:59:24,840
somewhere where it was like 10 20 30

3195
01:59:23,158 --> 01:59:26,698
years like

3196
01:59:24,840 --> 01:59:28,020
was just a crazy thing that you're

3197
01:59:26,698 --> 01:59:29,939
killing us you guys were killing us in

3198
01:59:28,020 --> 01:59:31,380
California oh I'm sure all the guys that

3199
01:59:29,939 --> 01:59:33,960
were flying in all the guys that were

3200
01:59:31,380 --> 01:59:36,900
flying in to grab herb from us we had we

3201
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:39,300
had become entitled and and and the the

3202
01:59:36,899 --> 01:59:41,638
BC group was putting out better products

3203
01:59:39,300 --> 01:59:42,840
and for cheaper prices so I think at the

3204
01:59:41,639 --> 01:59:45,420
time you know you could get a unit for

3205
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:48,360
like 2600 and in Humble you know it was

3206
01:59:45,420 --> 01:59:50,219
like 4 400. yeah so because I can't

3207
01:59:48,359 --> 01:59:51,779
whenever somebody came to Canada as soon

3208
01:59:50,219 --> 01:59:53,158
as I spoke they knew I wasn't Canadian

3209
01:59:51,779 --> 01:59:54,539
and the first words out of the cab

3210
01:59:53,158 --> 01:59:57,179
driver's mouth were you looking for

3211
01:59:54,539 --> 01:59:58,439
units like a Pax and I was like wow I

3212
01:59:57,179 --> 02:00:00,000
said I'm California they got fuck you

3213
01:59:58,439 --> 02:00:03,419
got weed and then and then we would just

3214
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:06,179
hang out oh yeah but the

3215
02:00:03,420 --> 02:00:07,560
that that that quality that was moving

3216
02:00:06,179 --> 02:00:09,239
out of Canada was pretty good and the

3217
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:12,300
price point was phenomenal and if it

3218
02:00:09,238 --> 02:00:14,098
wasn't for 9 11 and perp California

3219
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:15,599
would have got buried that it saved Our

3220
02:00:14,099 --> 02:00:17,520
Lives you were killing us and you were

3221
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:18,960
actually nicer and more friendly to deal

3222
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:20,280
with so all the guys I knew that did big

3223
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:21,239
big plane work but they had their own

3224
02:00:20,279 --> 02:00:22,859
planes

3225
02:00:21,238 --> 02:00:24,178
they were just like and we all got along

3226
02:00:22,859 --> 02:00:25,559
but they were like God dealing with you

3227
02:00:24,179 --> 02:00:27,179
fuckers out there sucks he goes the

3228
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:29,880
Canadians are so nice

3229
02:00:27,179 --> 02:00:33,658
and and the herb is cheaper

3230
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:35,900
waging yeah you're rivers of it

3231
02:00:33,658 --> 02:00:38,339
I can see the mountains here

3232
02:00:35,899 --> 02:00:40,859
I'm looking here and I'm like wow you

3233
02:00:38,340 --> 02:00:44,279
you could have went off plenty of water

3234
02:00:40,859 --> 02:00:45,420
no enforcement holy shit yeah you don't

3235
02:00:44,279 --> 02:00:47,219
have the helicopter see we had the

3236
02:00:45,420 --> 02:00:49,260
helicopters but the same thing I didn't

3237
02:00:47,219 --> 02:00:51,840
mind them because even when I got busted

3238
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:52,980
and they they took me for 900 pounds one

3239
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:53,639
year

3240
02:00:52,979 --> 02:00:55,678
um

3241
02:00:53,639 --> 02:00:57,840
that 900 pounds I lost means someone

3242
02:00:55,679 --> 02:00:59,099
else made 900 pounds more money and the

3243
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:01,440
years that you got fucked I got paid

3244
02:00:59,099 --> 02:01:04,079
it's it's a game so I never tripped on

3245
02:01:01,439 --> 02:01:05,759
the helicopters you need you need the

3246
02:01:04,079 --> 02:01:07,979
difficulty to make the mission correct

3247
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:10,020
if there's no difficulty Everybody Plays

3248
02:01:07,979 --> 02:01:13,738
well and and the people who play in the

3249
02:01:10,020 --> 02:01:15,360
game so like that world required a

3250
02:01:13,738 --> 02:01:17,399
certain type of person

3251
02:01:15,359 --> 02:01:19,559
and at that time that's what I was into

3252
02:01:17,399 --> 02:01:21,118
well I'll tell you the beasters because

3253
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:23,280
you mentioned it I'll say you know that

3254
02:01:21,118 --> 02:01:25,439
was uh that was not created by a

3255
02:01:23,279 --> 02:01:27,300
Canadian the original beasters were

3256
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:29,879
American buyers that would come up buy

3257
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:32,219
massive amounts of weed and then sifted

3258
02:01:29,880 --> 02:01:33,840
they'd sift all the sift off the weed

3259
02:01:32,219 --> 02:01:35,639
and then they'd send the weed to these

3260
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:37,020
different North Carolina like down in

3261
02:01:35,639 --> 02:01:39,060
Kentucky like all these different places

3262
02:01:37,020 --> 02:01:41,099
and you know it wasn't the only part

3263
02:01:39,060 --> 02:01:43,920
there was also really breeder Steve

3264
02:01:41,099 --> 02:01:46,079
turning on the Vietnamese to growing

3265
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:48,300
cannabis giving them grapefruit cultivar

3266
02:01:46,079 --> 02:01:49,618
that was on and don't get me wrong when

3267
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:50,940
they first start I'll never forget it

3268
02:01:49,618 --> 02:01:53,158
because I met these guys they were like

3269
02:01:50,939 --> 02:01:54,598
hardcore gangster dudes and they they

3270
02:01:53,158 --> 02:01:55,979
were just like man this is so good we

3271
02:01:54,599 --> 02:01:58,079
don't need to have guns I don't need to

3272
02:01:55,979 --> 02:02:00,718
have bodyguards this is amazing business

3273
02:01:58,079 --> 02:02:02,819
you know but what happened was

3274
02:02:00,719 --> 02:02:04,800
they pumped out amazing products for

3275
02:02:02,819 --> 02:02:06,359
about two years and then it was like

3276
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:07,860
yeah we don't need to go eight weeks or

3277
02:02:06,359 --> 02:02:10,139
nine weeks uh we don't need to really

3278
02:02:07,859 --> 02:02:12,598
dry it properly yeah and it just went

3279
02:02:10,139 --> 02:02:14,219
downhill because people were coming up

3280
02:02:12,599 --> 02:02:16,560
to buy it you didn't have to do that

3281
02:02:14,219 --> 02:02:18,000
anymore and they just they were more

3282
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:19,739
like in the business of just like

3283
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,479
pumping Out product but the first

3284
02:02:19,738 --> 02:02:24,718
product those guys pumped out I was

3285
02:02:21,479 --> 02:02:26,698
beyond impressed I was like wow like

3286
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:28,560
how could you it was a cultural thing

3287
02:02:26,698 --> 02:02:30,539
because it was like Caucasian people

3288
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:32,520
were just fucking each other over and

3289
02:02:30,539 --> 02:02:35,039
fucking it up and the way he put it to

3290
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:36,900
me my buddy was like Vietnam's small bro

3291
02:02:35,039 --> 02:02:38,579
like if I have to go back there and I

3292
02:02:36,899 --> 02:02:41,519
fuck someone here in Canada like I am

3293
02:02:38,579 --> 02:02:43,198
bumping into them you know so they were

3294
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:44,820
able to work together in a way that like

3295
02:02:43,198 --> 02:02:46,439
put out really once they got the

3296
02:02:44,819 --> 02:02:47,880
cultivars and Steve definitely hooked

3297
02:02:46,439 --> 02:02:50,219
them up with the cultivars they were

3298
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:51,599
able to put out really nice cannabis and

3299
02:02:50,219 --> 02:02:53,340
it just it must have seemed like a

3300
02:02:51,599 --> 02:02:55,440
miracle to them from coming from like a

3301
02:02:53,340 --> 02:02:57,480
really gangsterism selling heroin

3302
02:02:55,439 --> 02:02:59,098
selling cocaine to just leaving that

3303
02:02:57,479 --> 02:03:01,439
behind and getting into this herb game

3304
02:02:59,099 --> 02:03:03,119
because there was that much money in the

3305
02:03:01,439 --> 02:03:04,678
Arab game you guys are still violent

3306
02:03:03,118 --> 02:03:06,059
though I had a buddy that got killed by

3307
02:03:04,679 --> 02:03:08,279
the Canadians oh yeah like you guys

3308
02:03:06,060 --> 02:03:10,440
still had you had the the it was biker

3309
02:03:08,279 --> 02:03:12,479
gang shit doing the trafficking and they

3310
02:03:10,439 --> 02:03:14,460
owed my pot in the money and instead of

3311
02:03:12,479 --> 02:03:16,738
paying my buddy they just they came down

3312
02:03:14,460 --> 02:03:18,899
to Santa Rosa and they fucking murdered

3313
02:03:16,738 --> 02:03:20,638
them at his house over the debt right

3314
02:03:18,899 --> 02:03:22,519
and and I was like college in Upstate

3315
02:03:20,639 --> 02:03:25,199
New York during that time yeah

3316
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:26,400
a lot of weed it was really cheap when

3317
02:03:25,198 --> 02:03:28,799
it was four thousand dollars for

3318
02:03:26,399 --> 02:03:31,618
anything anything you give anything and

3319
02:03:28,800 --> 02:03:34,380
you could get it for 1300 us that drove

3320
02:03:31,618 --> 02:03:36,299
a pretty big market for a long time that

3321
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:37,859
was coming over uh Native lands it was

3322
02:03:36,300 --> 02:03:39,840
all over the borders yeah they're just

3323
02:03:37,859 --> 02:03:41,460
uh thousands of pounds a day that whole

3324
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:43,380
Mohawk thing that happened if you

3325
02:03:41,460 --> 02:03:46,319
remember the Mohawk thing that was like

3326
02:03:43,380 --> 02:03:47,819
uh hey look over here right they had the

3327
02:03:46,319 --> 02:03:49,859
guns and the masks and they were

3328
02:03:47,819 --> 02:03:51,658
supposedly protecting a field that field

3329
02:03:49,859 --> 02:03:54,179
was nothing it was all like it was like

3330
02:03:51,658 --> 02:03:56,339
giving a crop up to move ten thousand

3331
02:03:54,179 --> 02:03:58,500
crops over the Border you know every

3332
02:03:56,340 --> 02:04:00,360
single day they were moving thousands of

3333
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:02,219
pounds and you could never feed enough

3334
02:04:00,359 --> 02:04:04,920
into America

3335
02:04:02,219 --> 02:04:08,039
there was just really even just New York

3336
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:10,260
just New York and so what happens now

3337
02:04:08,039 --> 02:04:12,179
when New York the Northeast the largest

3338
02:04:10,260 --> 02:04:14,099
market in the world let's say actually

3339
02:04:12,179 --> 02:04:16,859
gets out of its Cowboy stage and

3340
02:04:14,099 --> 02:04:19,260
produces enough cannabis legally

3341
02:04:16,859 --> 02:04:21,779
that they'll never have to have imported

3342
02:04:19,260 --> 02:04:23,280
cannabis ever again oh well I I will say

3343
02:04:21,779 --> 02:04:26,219
one thing about that and I think he will

3344
02:04:23,279 --> 02:04:28,439
as well terroir

3345
02:04:26,219 --> 02:04:30,359
right that's it terroir that's a cracked

3346
02:04:28,439 --> 02:04:33,379
thing you can't get Jamaican you can't

3347
02:04:30,359 --> 02:04:33,380
know but you can't

3348
02:04:34,639 --> 02:04:40,618
there were grapes when when the Vikings

3349
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:44,940
landed in the new world and I don't hear

3350
02:04:40,618 --> 02:04:46,319
I I've never had a wine from Pei but I

3351
02:04:44,939 --> 02:04:48,598
could tell you there are some fantastic

3352
02:04:46,319 --> 02:04:51,118
wine regions in BC there's some

3353
02:04:48,599 --> 02:04:52,500
fantastic wine regions in France so I

3354
02:04:51,118 --> 02:04:55,339
think you're going to end up seeing is

3355
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:58,139
cultivars being developed for

3356
02:04:55,340 --> 02:04:59,940
locally adapted for this environment

3357
02:04:58,139 --> 02:05:02,819
that can fit within that climactic

3358
02:04:59,939 --> 02:05:04,559
standards and you know here here in the

3359
02:05:02,819 --> 02:05:06,299
Kootenays that's probably going to be

3360
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:08,880
shorter season plants but there's going

3361
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:11,159
to be some you know the high variety of

3362
02:05:08,880 --> 02:05:12,840
pine terpenoids within within the

3363
02:05:11,158 --> 02:05:14,339
environment and likely within the

3364
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:18,619
compost is probably going to contribute

3365
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:21,020
to uh Pine and other similar terpenoids

3366
02:05:18,618 --> 02:05:23,579
being slightly higher within the

3367
02:05:21,020 --> 02:05:26,159
cultivars and so we can compare it to

3368
02:05:23,579 --> 02:05:29,420
micro breweries let's say 100 there's a

3369
02:05:26,158 --> 02:05:29,420
lot of people that drink Budweiser

3370
02:05:30,618 --> 02:05:34,380
same thing with cannabis there's going

3371
02:05:32,819 --> 02:05:36,658
there's going to be those people don't

3372
02:05:34,380 --> 02:05:39,000
drink microbrews also yeah and I think

3373
02:05:36,658 --> 02:05:40,198
but you're gonna have to have both 100 I

3374
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,939
don't think you can rest in business on

3375
02:05:40,198 --> 02:05:44,399
just one or the other quite yet having

3376
02:05:41,939 --> 02:05:46,439
both of them I mean my goal was always

3377
02:05:44,399 --> 02:05:48,179
to put out the best all the time and say

3378
02:05:46,439 --> 02:05:49,859
at the highest level possible but I

3379
02:05:48,179 --> 02:05:51,480
realized at one point that it wasn't

3380
02:05:49,859 --> 02:05:53,399
just the highest level of The

3381
02:05:51,479 --> 02:05:55,559
Connoisseur it was the highest level of

3382
02:05:53,399 --> 02:05:56,638
every grade that you can go after so if

3383
02:05:55,560 --> 02:05:58,320
you have to put out a lower grade

3384
02:05:56,639 --> 02:06:00,118
because it is what it is

3385
02:05:58,319 --> 02:06:02,158
match the price point and put out the

3386
02:06:00,118 --> 02:06:03,719
highest possible grade you can faster

3387
02:06:02,158 --> 02:06:05,098
that price point I just know I've

3388
02:06:03,719 --> 02:06:07,198
traveled all over the world and made

3389
02:06:05,099 --> 02:06:10,679
hash all over the world and probably 26

3390
02:06:07,198 --> 02:06:12,178
27 countries and I have my favorites and

3391
02:06:10,679 --> 02:06:13,560
there are different profiles that are

3392
02:06:12,179 --> 02:06:15,960
created in those different countries

3393
02:06:13,560 --> 02:06:17,880
that I've never tasted or experienced

3394
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:19,920
and I can't even put it into language

3395
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:22,319
really that just the overall feeling

3396
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:24,658
that you can get from Cannabis that's

3397
02:06:22,319 --> 02:06:27,779
been expressed from a different terroir

3398
02:06:24,658 --> 02:06:30,179
you know and so that like to me where I

3399
02:06:27,779 --> 02:06:31,679
really want to see this go is like I'd

3400
02:06:30,179 --> 02:06:32,940
love to be able to see all of these

3401
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:35,039
different Terror I mean of course the

3402
02:06:32,939 --> 02:06:36,059
old you know Afghanistan and Lebanon and

3403
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:37,859
all these different house producing

3404
02:06:36,060 --> 02:06:39,239
countries but for all we know there's

3405
02:06:37,859 --> 02:06:40,679
house producing countries that we've

3406
02:06:39,238 --> 02:06:42,479
never heard of that will you know like

3407
02:06:40,679 --> 02:06:44,099
in Jamaica a perfect example is oh in

3408
02:06:42,479 --> 02:06:45,539
the Westmoreland they grow the best weed

3409
02:06:44,099 --> 02:06:47,099
it's like no they don't that's just

3410
02:06:45,539 --> 02:06:48,539
where it was the furthest away from the

3411
02:06:47,099 --> 02:06:50,639
fucking Army in the police force of

3412
02:06:48,539 --> 02:06:52,979
Kingston it's the furthest point of the

3413
02:06:50,639 --> 02:06:55,618
island that's that's why they went there

3414
02:06:52,979 --> 02:06:57,419
not for the soil or for whatever else so

3415
02:06:55,618 --> 02:07:00,059
but what happens when we really start

3416
02:06:57,420 --> 02:07:01,618
going to places for the terroir to find

3417
02:07:00,060 --> 02:07:04,619
these different Expressions that aren't

3418
02:07:01,618 --> 02:07:06,658
necessarily based on uh how much can I

3419
02:07:04,618 --> 02:07:08,639
get and how fast can I get it so when I

3420
02:07:06,658 --> 02:07:09,839
went to Barcelona when we did you know

3421
02:07:08,639 --> 02:07:12,300
if you've ever been to span Abyss that's

3422
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:13,319
kind of like the New Amsterdam and we

3423
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:14,880
were getting

3424
02:07:13,319 --> 02:07:17,039
um

3425
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:18,000
hash from Morocco you know and they were

3426
02:07:17,039 --> 02:07:19,979
saying oh this is how they get it here

3427
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:22,020
they like ski do it over and we're

3428
02:07:19,979 --> 02:07:24,539
smoking hashimaka it's called Blue Dream

3429
02:07:22,020 --> 02:07:26,159
and it's called OG Kush and it's called

3430
02:07:24,539 --> 02:07:29,939
and I'm like wait a second so we can't

3431
02:07:26,158 --> 02:07:31,198
get the original uh genetics or the land

3432
02:07:29,939 --> 02:07:33,118
race you guys have been growing for

3433
02:07:31,198 --> 02:07:35,579
centuries anymore because all of the

3434
02:07:33,118 --> 02:07:37,079
people the children have gotten hip to

3435
02:07:35,579 --> 02:07:40,019
the game and they've come and gotten

3436
02:07:37,079 --> 02:07:41,579
genetics from Amsterdam or Barcelona

3437
02:07:40,020 --> 02:07:44,340
America and are growing them there and

3438
02:07:41,579 --> 02:07:47,039
we're losing that traditional hash that

3439
02:07:44,340 --> 02:07:48,599
truly is Afghanistan

3440
02:07:47,039 --> 02:07:50,158
and maybe there'll be a difference in

3441
02:07:48,599 --> 02:07:51,239
how you know we can see it grown

3442
02:07:50,158 --> 02:07:52,920
differently and the different

3443
02:07:51,238 --> 02:07:54,479
expressions from this cultivars that

3444
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:56,039
we're using today but I think it's a

3445
02:07:54,479 --> 02:07:58,259
tragedy that we're going to lose in

3446
02:07:56,039 --> 02:08:00,300
Jamaica they didn't have Lamb's problem

3447
02:07:58,260 --> 02:08:02,579
right there none of the Ross's had last

3448
02:08:00,300 --> 02:08:04,320
breath they had Sour Diesel and because

3449
02:08:02,579 --> 02:08:06,539
it's such a small island or they don't

3450
02:08:04,319 --> 02:08:09,299
pull their males

3451
02:08:06,539 --> 02:08:10,800
that was the the end up talk was that we

3452
02:08:09,300 --> 02:08:12,840
don't have that anymore we don't have it

3453
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:15,119
in a pure form it doesn't exist because

3454
02:08:12,840 --> 02:08:17,279
we ruined that because of our geography

3455
02:08:15,118 --> 02:08:21,000
and we tried to take what we saw in the

3456
02:08:17,279 --> 02:08:23,519
world and bring it to our world and now

3457
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:26,340
you know the chase is uh land races but

3458
02:08:23,520 --> 02:08:27,540
we're losing we are losing stuff but

3459
02:08:26,340 --> 02:08:29,159
like I just got brought into this

3460
02:08:27,539 --> 02:08:32,880
project in Morocco

3461
02:08:29,158 --> 02:08:34,799
and it's it's to develop appellations of

3462
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:36,900
origin for the farm so they can start to

3463
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:38,760
identify you know the impacts of the

3464
02:08:36,899 --> 02:08:40,319
region and it's also to sequence the

3465
02:08:38,760 --> 02:08:42,300
genetics and get the fucking Dutch and

3466
02:08:40,319 --> 02:08:44,639
American genes out of the pool because

3467
02:08:42,300 --> 02:08:47,219
it's killing the farmers because none of

3468
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:49,079
that shit is developed for drought and

3469
02:08:47,219 --> 02:08:50,219
so when the agronomists come over from

3470
02:08:49,079 --> 02:08:51,300
these countries they're telling them you

3471
02:08:50,219 --> 02:08:52,560
need more water to use it they'll be

3472
02:08:51,300 --> 02:08:54,179
great and they're trying to tell them we

3473
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:55,920
don't have any more water we only have

3474
02:08:54,179 --> 02:08:58,440
this much water and it's like nobody's

3475
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:59,460
kind of cognizant of this limitation and

3476
02:08:58,439 --> 02:09:00,598
they're trying to say well then you're

3477
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:01,679
not going to be able to produce cannabis

3478
02:09:00,599 --> 02:09:03,900
and they said we've been producing it

3479
02:09:01,679 --> 02:09:05,699
for 3 000 fucking years so I don't think

3480
02:09:03,899 --> 02:09:07,559
we need the advice and what they

3481
02:09:05,698 --> 02:09:09,779
realized is that what they need is

3482
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:11,340
people to come in and so the Moroccan

3483
02:09:09,779 --> 02:09:13,920
government got a hold of an Israeli

3484
02:09:11,340 --> 02:09:15,719
group that's connected the DD Mary so

3485
02:09:13,920 --> 02:09:17,639
they have someone who's a brilliant

3486
02:09:15,719 --> 02:09:21,420
cannabinoid scientist to be able to

3487
02:09:17,639 --> 02:09:22,980
really do deep dives into profiles and

3488
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:24,658
then we have the sequence in groups and

3489
02:09:22,979 --> 02:09:26,279
I got brought in to help them kind of

3490
02:09:24,658 --> 02:09:28,439
work with the farmers and start to

3491
02:09:26,279 --> 02:09:30,960
develop these this project

3492
02:09:28,439 --> 02:09:32,819
but the it's the irony of it is is that

3493
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:34,800
they got infiltrated with American and

3494
02:09:32,819 --> 02:09:37,139
Dutch genes and then they're failing

3495
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:40,079
because plants that were produced in

3496
02:09:37,139 --> 02:09:41,819
rockwool don't really give you water

3497
02:09:40,079 --> 02:09:43,079
conservation

3498
02:09:41,819 --> 02:09:45,658
you know what I mean like you're you're

3499
02:09:43,079 --> 02:09:47,880
not starving the plant off and so you're

3500
02:09:45,658 --> 02:09:49,618
giving it optimal conditions and you're

3501
02:09:47,880 --> 02:09:52,139
dialing in your dry vacs and all your

3502
02:09:49,618 --> 02:09:55,139
fucking Squirts and the problem is it

3503
02:09:52,139 --> 02:09:58,380
got optimal moisture the entire time and

3504
02:09:55,139 --> 02:10:00,840
it is not possible and what we see too

3505
02:09:58,380 --> 02:10:02,219
is that the European market is far more

3506
02:10:00,840 --> 02:10:03,900
driven towards what we would call

3507
02:10:02,219 --> 02:10:06,420
traditional Moroccan hash to go along

3508
02:10:03,899 --> 02:10:08,939
with tobacco and that the desire for the

3509
02:10:06,420 --> 02:10:11,279
American Products isn't there the

3510
02:10:08,939 --> 02:10:13,019
Europeans aren't Desiring our products

3511
02:10:11,279 --> 02:10:15,179
as much as they want the traditional

3512
02:10:13,020 --> 02:10:17,460
products but they want them standardized

3513
02:10:15,179 --> 02:10:19,440
stabilized and delivered freely like you

3514
02:10:17,460 --> 02:10:21,420
know frequently able to be accessed

3515
02:10:19,439 --> 02:10:22,559
easily like it's been for centuries in

3516
02:10:21,420 --> 02:10:24,440
Europe

3517
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:27,480
and so you're kind of seeing the change

3518
02:10:24,439 --> 02:10:29,519
and it's it's like when I was in I was

3519
02:10:27,479 --> 02:10:31,919
in Columbia same thing I went there to

3520
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:33,360
work on a project and they people knew I

3521
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:35,699
was coming into Colombia and so all

3522
02:10:33,359 --> 02:10:37,559
these Old Farmers out of Cali had come

3523
02:10:35,698 --> 02:10:40,019
down and picked me up and we went and

3524
02:10:37,560 --> 02:10:41,760
hung out in Bogota and they were the

3525
02:10:40,020 --> 02:10:43,139
preservationists of the old Colombian

3526
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:44,579
lines and they said our families have

3527
02:10:43,139 --> 02:10:46,139
held this for hundreds of years so we

3528
02:10:44,579 --> 02:10:49,500
have like 50 different varieties that

3529
02:10:46,139 --> 02:10:51,000
we've held in form for a long time and

3530
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:53,039
what we're trying to do is bring these

3531
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:55,079
forward in breeding projects and and

3532
02:10:53,039 --> 02:10:57,300
further them into the normal world

3533
02:10:55,079 --> 02:10:59,519
because they understand that the the

3534
02:10:57,300 --> 02:11:02,219
historical value so it's the same thing

3535
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:03,480
you you go to you go to a I was telling

3536
02:11:02,219 --> 02:11:05,039
somebody I said you go to you go to

3537
02:11:03,479 --> 02:11:08,218
Thailand and I said you get a bag of

3538
02:11:05,039 --> 02:11:10,139
fucking runs you're going to be upset

3539
02:11:08,219 --> 02:11:12,539
and and they're like no no I said trust

3540
02:11:10,139 --> 02:11:15,539
me on this one a tourist doesn't want

3541
02:11:12,539 --> 02:11:17,760
runts in Thailand they want runts in

3542
02:11:15,539 --> 02:11:19,738
fucking Florida because that's an indoor

3543
02:11:17,760 --> 02:11:22,619
flower you know you make it anyway

3544
02:11:19,738 --> 02:11:25,198
but with with what we're talking about

3545
02:11:22,618 --> 02:11:27,299
is very specific stuff and so

3546
02:11:25,198 --> 02:11:29,698
New York blowing up everyone's going to

3547
02:11:27,300 --> 02:11:32,340
have their own internal Market but you

3548
02:11:29,698 --> 02:11:34,198
would still want to import some killer

3549
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:35,699
seasonal from Humboldt County you would

3550
02:11:34,198 --> 02:11:37,439
still want to import some killer

3551
02:11:35,698 --> 02:11:39,719
seasonal from you'd still want to import

3552
02:11:37,439 --> 02:11:41,219
some phenomenal herb from Colombia you'd

3553
02:11:39,719 --> 02:11:42,539
still want to touch Jamaica you still

3554
02:11:41,219 --> 02:11:44,219
want to touch all these countries that

3555
02:11:42,539 --> 02:11:47,340
produce phenomenal herb

3556
02:11:44,219 --> 02:11:50,279
and maybe not replace your crop it's not

3557
02:11:47,340 --> 02:11:52,260
a competitor but there's no way New York

3558
02:11:50,279 --> 02:11:53,340
can produce those products and there's

3559
02:11:52,260 --> 02:11:55,260
no fucking way they're going to do it

3560
02:11:53,340 --> 02:11:57,719
indoor you're not going to do equatorial

3561
02:11:55,260 --> 02:12:00,119
shooting how long is that how long does

3562
02:11:57,719 --> 02:12:02,039
that take for us to get to that point

3563
02:12:00,118 --> 02:12:03,779
what's happening right now do you think

3564
02:12:02,039 --> 02:12:06,779
it's oh my guarant fucking see it we're

3565
02:12:03,779 --> 02:12:08,279
trying to negot like in in

3566
02:12:06,779 --> 02:12:10,618
I just know that all these countries

3567
02:12:08,279 --> 02:12:12,960
that are opening up I'm brought into the

3568
02:12:10,618 --> 02:12:14,759
conversations about sourcing product and

3569
02:12:12,960 --> 02:12:17,279
so legal countries to Legal countries

3570
02:12:14,760 --> 02:12:18,659
it's happening so for the U.S we're

3571
02:12:17,279 --> 02:12:19,979
fucked for a minute because we're not

3572
02:12:18,658 --> 02:12:22,319
doing we're not opening the borders at

3573
02:12:19,979 --> 02:12:24,539
all and the problem with the U.S so I

3574
02:12:22,319 --> 02:12:26,519
said two years ago I figured five years

3575
02:12:24,539 --> 02:12:28,500
so I figured five years because I

3576
02:12:26,520 --> 02:12:29,820
figured that the administration that I

3577
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:31,500
was in in America didn't give a fuck

3578
02:12:29,819 --> 02:12:32,698
about us and I figured the Dems probably

3579
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:34,738
don't give a fuck about us either but

3580
02:12:32,698 --> 02:12:37,198
maybe at the next election they'd be so

3581
02:12:34,738 --> 02:12:39,359
desperate that they'll have to legalize

3582
02:12:37,198 --> 02:12:41,698
and so legalization is just a tool it's

3583
02:12:39,359 --> 02:12:43,920
it's not about fairness or parody it's

3584
02:12:41,698 --> 02:12:45,118
straight up a political tool to use to

3585
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:47,460
get votes

3586
02:12:45,118 --> 02:12:50,460
and so until they have the need there's

3587
02:12:47,460 --> 02:12:52,020
no need to do so and so for us in the

3588
02:12:50,460 --> 02:12:54,300
U.S we're just hoping that we can go

3589
02:12:52,020 --> 02:12:56,219
state to state which is difficult

3590
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:58,440
because if you if you if it's contiguous

3591
02:12:56,219 --> 02:13:00,599
we can do a compact but if we have to

3592
02:12:58,439 --> 02:13:02,219
fly through the air over a state that is

3593
02:13:00,599 --> 02:13:04,560
not part of the compact that goes on the

3594
02:13:02,219 --> 02:13:06,840
federal so it creates this situation

3595
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:08,340
that's that's tough but globally we're

3596
02:13:06,840 --> 02:13:09,659
not the only producers so I don't I

3597
02:13:08,340 --> 02:13:11,760
don't see cannabis from a U.S

3598
02:13:09,658 --> 02:13:13,859
perspective only because I'm touching

3599
02:13:11,760 --> 02:13:15,840
cannabis in other countries and so what

3600
02:13:13,859 --> 02:13:16,979
I know is any country that's legal can

3601
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:18,900
import so when we couldn't get enough

3602
02:13:16,979 --> 02:13:20,759
Urban Israel from the production we've

3603
02:13:18,899 --> 02:13:23,578
got it imported from Portugal

3604
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:24,780
so people in Portugal are selling herb I

3605
02:13:23,578 --> 02:13:26,819
just think I think this is a really

3606
02:13:24,779 --> 02:13:28,979
interesting conversation too and while

3607
02:13:26,819 --> 02:13:30,359
it's like my favorite part of it I'm

3608
02:13:28,979 --> 02:13:32,279
gonna cut it short because we've been

3609
02:13:30,359 --> 02:13:34,078
here for a while and feeling a little

3610
02:13:32,279 --> 02:13:34,920
bit hungry I've been going going for a

3611
02:13:34,078 --> 02:13:37,078
while

3612
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:39,779
um but what I but what I did want to say

3613
02:13:37,078 --> 02:13:41,279
is that what we do is we continue to

3614
02:13:39,779 --> 02:13:43,679
talk about culture we're talking about

3615
02:13:41,279 --> 02:13:46,439
the Cannabis culture and now we're

3616
02:13:43,679 --> 02:13:49,260
expanding the word culture to different

3617
02:13:46,439 --> 02:13:51,419
areas which we call terroir and when we

3618
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:53,699
talk about secondary metabolites and we

3619
02:13:51,420 --> 02:13:55,618
talk about terpene profiles we talk

3620
02:13:53,698 --> 02:13:57,539
about different cannabinoid profiles

3621
02:13:55,618 --> 02:13:59,880
we're talking about the culture of the

3622
02:13:57,539 --> 02:14:01,738
plant and that culture of the plant can

3623
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:04,859
only come from different areas in

3624
02:14:01,738 --> 02:14:06,718
different zones and I just think it's

3625
02:14:04,859 --> 02:14:10,078
really interesting that that term

3626
02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:14,099
culture continues to come back we are

3627
02:14:10,078 --> 02:14:16,979
always honoring the culture of us in the

3628
02:14:14,099 --> 02:14:20,300
industry and Us in different cultures

3629
02:14:16,979 --> 02:14:22,979
but how awesome for us to be able to

3630
02:14:20,300 --> 02:14:24,900
honor all of the different cultures that

3631
02:14:22,979 --> 02:14:27,598
cannabis comes from as well because

3632
02:14:24,899 --> 02:14:29,299
that's the true you know culture and

3633
02:14:27,599 --> 02:14:31,319
when we talk about cannabis culture

3634
02:14:29,300 --> 02:14:33,659
that's really what we're talking about

3635
02:14:31,319 --> 02:14:34,799
not just our association as human beings

3636
02:14:33,658 --> 02:14:36,598
with it

3637
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:38,039
