3
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,580
my name is yes Joshua Shelton I'm a

4
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,589
co-founder of pre-treat agency based out

5
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,479
of Los Angeles and before we get into

6
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:32,549
the panel I just want to say the topic

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,100
we're talking about his brand and for me

8
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,530
it's I'm like honored and inspired to be

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,629
talking about this topic because you

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,820
know as a young attorney I was working

11
00:00:39,628 --> 00:00:43,890
with brand well I say brands but guys

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,600
whose I only knew their first name in my

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,489
phone because they didn't have a brand

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,829
they didn't have logos they didn't have

15
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:51,808
websites or social media and they didn't

16
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,460
want anybody to know that they were even

17
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:55,439
associated with the product being sold

18
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,170
in the stores because it was a gray

19
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,420
market and brands didn't exist and the

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,480
hyper growth and maturity that I've seen

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,859
over the last five to seven years is

22
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,509
unbelievable it's inspiring to see the

23
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:08,429
success the companies have built and the

24
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:10,530
brands and the culture and really what a

25
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:12,030
brand is is trust it's the consumer

26
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,379
being able to connect with your brand

27
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,960
and trust that your product is something

28
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:17,069
that they can consume and value and that

29
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:18,868
that's something I'm seeing more and

30
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:21,269
more every day so it's exciting to be a

31
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:23,519
part of that and I'm gonna welcome our

32

this is all our first time meeting so

45
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,829
it's great to meet everybody and I hate

46
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,509
that I'm standing up here like I'd

47
00:01:58,828 --> 00:02:02,279
rather just be with you guys but here we

48
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,750
go anyway so we're gonna just something

49
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,118
a few topics we're gonna do a little bit

50
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,560
of conversation with the panel over a

51
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:09,090
few topics I'd love everybody I think

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,618
will provide some value to us as an

53
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,299
industry some information and some

54
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:14,099
education and then we're gonna open it

55
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:16,439
up because really I think what everybody

56
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,000
is here to do is if you're not a leader

57
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:20,129
already is to become a leader in this

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,229
industry understand what that takes and

59
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:24,000
I assume that your brains are full of a

60
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:25,979
ton of questions that we are hopefully

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,500
here to be able to answer so let's start

62
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:30,899
off with our first topic which you know

63
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,180
I think in our industry I've worked with

64
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,250
a lot of people that because they've

65
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,240
only worked in the cannabis industry

66
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,560
they feel like they are inventing or

67
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,390
creating certain aspects of their

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,270
business whether it have been extraction

69
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:46,679
or distillation or a certain type of

70
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:49,110
processes within their company the

71
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,460
cannabis industry is a you know doesn't

72
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,990
have a lot of perspective from outside

73
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:54,689
because it's self-made millionaires

74
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,250
within the industry so one of the things

75
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:58,109
I think our panel can help us with today

76
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,050
is applying some of the history and

77
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,850
trends of other industry parallel

78
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,410
industries and what types of things have

79
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:09,870
made brands successful in industries

80
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:10,919
like fashion music sports apparel so

81
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,209
let's talk about that a little bit I

82
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,579
want to open it up to the panel maybe

83
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:17,370
start with on this end and work this way

84
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,989
as as we see fit I feel like I have the

85
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:22,140
privilege every day of working with wine

86
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:25,650
coffee tea and consume consumer products

87
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:28,109
and cannabis is an amazing amazing

88
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:29,580
opportunity for us to take what we can

89
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,200
learn from other industries but also

90
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,840
remind ourselves that we have the

91
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,609
respect of a lot of farmers and we have

92
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,739
to make sure that farmers are still at

93
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,720
the forefront of what we do and so every

94
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:41,430
day that's my job it's agriculture where

95
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:43,409
we're talking about an agricultural

96
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,969
product and I think that's a it's an

97
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:47,129
honor to be able to work in that so

98
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:49,199
that's been what I've been doing brands

99
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:51,780
are one of those moments where you break

100
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,699
bread and we have the honor of being

101
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,259
panelists on this but when you are

102
00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:57,899
selling something that you can enjoy as

103
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:59,489
a community and a communal event where

104
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,519
you do break bread it becomes a

105
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:04,110
different experience it is not just a

106
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:05,849
product it is something that unites

107
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,130
people and it's something that unites a

108
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:09,569
lot of people and so that sort of

109
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:11,699
branding is really hard and really

110
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:14,099
interesting because it's not just a

111
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:16,798
widget it's not just a cog it's actually

112
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,449
a very memorable experience and I think

113
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,279
that's something that's even harder in

114
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,829
branding because we're taking something

115
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:24,659
that's that's very very passionate for a

116
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:26,009
lot of people and it's it's something we

117
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,790
consume it somebody put in our bodies

118
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:30,899
and I think that's pretty awesome

119
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,629
definitely Green the cultural elements

120
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:35,849
so one of the co-founders Ryan Smith

121
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:38,550
that leaf link and we work with over 700

122
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:40,950
brands more than 2,300 retailers now in

123
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,150
12 states and one of the primary bets we

124
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:43,560
made when we started the company was

125
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:45,779
that this industry would be similar to

126
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,790
as it matures a lot of other industries

127
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:49,279
right consumers

128
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,480
looking for consistency same pricing

129
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,099
things that feel comfortable to them

130
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,750
especially if they're new to the market

131
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,070
and over the last two and a half three

132
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,379
years since we started the company we

133
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:59,240
went from meeting with our first clients

134
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:01,610
that were running these you know middle

135
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,100
eight-figure businesses on whiteboards

136
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,540
text messages Google sheets to saying

137
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,160
well you know asking basic questions

138
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,500
what was your most sold product

139
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,000
yesterday oh we think it was this kind

140
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,769
of these subjective answers it was the

141
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,589
drink and then we're starting to see now

142
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:17,359
more of this professionalism maturity

143
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:19,609
around these businesses as they grow we

144
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,689
build tools for that I think that's what

145
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,129
clients at the end of the day want to

146
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:24,529
see the the results of so there's

147
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:32,719
definitely quickly growing which is

148
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:35,349
exciting to be a part of good morning

149
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,570
thanks again Susan for having us here

150
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:40,700
today to talk about brandy

151
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:41,629
so I can actually I'm going to talk

152
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,349
about branding from a different

153
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:45,319
perspective

154
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:47,720
I can I can talk about products we have

155
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:51,170
we manufacture a product that's infused

156
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,290
it's infused popcorn but I'm also I'm

157
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:56,600
also the co-founder of supernova women

158
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:59,510
which is an organization that works to

159
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,129
empower people of color to become

160
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:04,189
self-sufficient shareholders within the

161
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:07,490
cannabis industry and I bring I bring up

162
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:09,319
that brand because the that brand was

163
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:12,560
something that we were able to create

164
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:16,550
and create a movement behind it and it's

165
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,610
been a very powerful experience just

166
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:22,370
kind of speaking to two needs within the

167
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:26,150
community and getting people to rally

168
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:28,069
behind us so you know of course you can

169
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:29,449
also you build consumer brands and

170
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:33,079
things like that but when you build a

171
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:36,560
movement behind whether it's a product

172
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:41,419
or a need within the industry or an

173
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:45,759
industry need you can see a really

174
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:49,049
exponential growth behind that so yeah

175
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:52,748
movements behind brands

176
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:55,598
hey everybody my name's Dean rays I'm an

177
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:57,879
autist manager at c3 management I come

178
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:00,548
from the music side I've been working in

179
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:03,999
cannabis for a couple of years now

180
00:07:00,548 --> 00:07:08,798
advising cannabis companies on branding

181
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:11,709
strategy marketing design packaging at

182
00:07:08,798 --> 00:07:15,188
c3 we produce music festivals and manage

183
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:18,699
artists we produce Lollapalooza in eight

184
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:22,299
countries Bonnaroo Austin City Limits

185
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:23,978
and we manage about 65 bands The Strokes

186
00:07:22,298 --> 00:07:27,698
they had in the heart Sylvan Esso

187
00:07:23,978 --> 00:07:29,829
justice Phoenix Grammatik and several

188
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:31,329
others and so I've been kind of coming

189
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:33,848
into the cannabis based the last couple

190
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:35,439
years starting with the revolution as a

191
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:38,199
band a reggae band I've managed for 10

192
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:41,139
years we partnered with Flav Rx a couple

193
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,819
years ago to release some cartridges and

194
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:45,098
disposable pens so that was kind of my

195
00:07:42,819 --> 00:07:46,509
entry into the cannabis space and kind

196
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:48,308
of looked around and saw that a lot of

197
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:50,259
the branding and and a lot of the

198
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:52,419
products kind of all looked very similar

199
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:55,269
and something that I've been trying to

200
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:57,668
do is is normalization in branding and

201
00:07:55,269 --> 00:07:59,918
making sure that that you know when a

202
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:01,478
cannabis for that that my family and

203
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:03,399
other people that I'm not your

204
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:05,558
traditional and maybe newcomers to

205
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,209
cannabis can feel comfortable with their

206
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:09,549
consumption and that they don't have to

207
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:10,809
hide it and that the the branding is you

208
00:08:09,548 --> 00:08:12,878
know it looks very similar to other

209
00:08:10,809 --> 00:08:14,379
products such as you know a can of beer

210
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,179
or a bottle of whiskey and that it's

211
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:17,588
just making sure that it's fine that it

212
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:19,118
sits on the coffee table and that if

213
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:22,899
somebody wants to consume cannabis as

214
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:24,429
opposed to drinking alcohol and so that

215
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:26,978
was kind of what kind of what I'm going

216
00:08:24,428 --> 00:08:28,388
for in that space is making people feel

217
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:30,248
comfortable about the consumption

218
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:31,749
there's absolutely nothing wrong with it

219
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:33,610
it's you know it's healthier than some

220
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:34,829
other products so I just felt like a lot

221
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:37,269
of the branding was kind of

222
00:08:34,828 --> 00:08:40,120
counterintuitive to that process so I've

223
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:43,318
been focusing a lot on that and having

224
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,318
some fun and happy to be here

225
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:47,528

230
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,050

we're gonna get my plug and before that

235
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:11,980
I worked for the state assembly for

236
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:14,980
probably about almost eight years so my

237
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:17,620
focus right now with with marketing and

238
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:19,600
with Pat with brands has been on the

239
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,000
compliance angle which as we probably

240
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,730
all know that's been really tough we've

241
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,090
had some major deadlines the July first

242
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:30,820
the grace period we have another

243
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:33,190
deadline coming for for branding and

244
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:37,060
labeling and packaging with the proposed

245
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:38,590
regs that will go into effect I mean to

246
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:41,019
be honest with you guys there are brands

247
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:43,300
that are not on the shelves of retailers

248
00:09:41,019 --> 00:09:45,610
right now because of labeling and

249
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:47,620
packaging and this is a huge issue this

250
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:50,320
is something we fight every day a river

251
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,960
we try and work with our brands and help

252
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,000
them and give them the the blueprint and

253
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,560
what they need to do to get there their

254
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,509
package to get their products on the

255
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,279
shelves because we want to do that we

256
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:02,169
want to sell that it has been a constant

257
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:05,259
battle and we're gonna continue to fight

258
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:06,759
it so that's where I'm coming from I'm

259
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:08,679
sure we'll talk about this more during

260
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:09,909
the panel our next topic I want to talk

261
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:11,679
about here rather than just the

262
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:14,709
parallels on the mainstream is you know

263
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,879
have a plan you know most of the early

264
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,860
companies we've worked with we're kind

265
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,230
of shooting from the hip and creating a

266
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,210
plan as they went and I'd love to just

267
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,980
pose it to the panel what are some of

268
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:25,840
the essential elements you guys think

269
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,490
are necessary for a company when putting

270
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,860
together a go-to market or a yearly

271
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:32,740
marketing strategy plan once again guys

272
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:34,870
I'm gonna go on my compliance angle when

273
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,659
you're a brand you need to figure out

274
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:40,389
exactly what needs to be on that

275
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:44,289
packaging so you can sell it that's step

276
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:46,269
one work with your legal counsel work

277
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:47,949
with your distributor if you have a good

278
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:49,449
distributor that I'm sorry of kind of

279
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,460
bragging but they're gonna help you out

280
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,320
with your with your labeling and make

281
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,030
sure that making sure that's compliant

282
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,920
and they'll work with you I spend a good

283
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:59,169
portion of my day working with brands

284
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:02,679
and just advising the engl advising them

285
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:06,729
on what's compliant labeling so start

286
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:08,169
out there and that's my two cents on

287
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:12,680
this and I'll let all these pros here

288
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:16,879
jump in I would say you know figure

289
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:18,559
to call what your story is you know who

290
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,710
are you what are you about where do you

291
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:25,039
come from what you know what is going to

292
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:27,290
be that emotional connection between you

293
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:30,139
and your audience and your brand and

294
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:33,259
your marketing and your design and your

295
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:35,208
social media and and your photos and you

296
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,720
know your articles and what is your

297
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,939
story

298
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,830
don't just be you know figure out the

299
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,779
core like who are you why are you doing

300
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:43,670
this where do you want to go and and

301
00:11:41,778 --> 00:11:46,338
build a connection and try to find an

302
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:48,500
audience that agrees with that and give

303
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:51,170
consumers something that they can

304
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,389
connect to that they feel a loyalty

305
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:55,809
towards your product whether it be you

306
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:58,789
know a cause who are you giving back to

307
00:11:55,809 --> 00:12:00,799
what organizations are you supporting or

308
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:03,829
you know what's your sustainability

309
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:06,559
angle what good are you doing as well as

310
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:09,830
you know where is your product coming

311
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:11,778
from tell tell the consumers everything

312
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:14,089
about you because they're going to find

313
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:17,149
out and you want them to know so don't

314
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:20,209
just you know go deeper go deeper try to

315
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:21,740
find it something emotional or something

316
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:24,319
meaningful in there without just

317
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,539
throwing you know a product into the

318
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,190
marketplace and expecting people to want

319
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:30,019
to buy it you know there has there's so

320
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,610
many products and people's attention

321
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,720
spans are so quick that if they don't

322
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,070
like yours they're gonna click to

323
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,259
something else and go somewhere else

324
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:37,730
try to draw people in with something

325
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:39,230
meaningful yeah I couldn't agree more

326
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,149
Dean I think that's it's one of the most

327
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,830
important things and a company we all

328
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:44,809
know and probably have a device in our

329
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,940
pocket from which is Apple their early

330
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:48,679
mission statement was about the Y right

331
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,330
it's not to make great cell phones and

332
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:52,278
sell a lot of product it was to make

333
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:55,040
devices that make communication easier

334
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:56,899
for human beings and I something along

335
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,120
that lines I'm paraphrasing but then it

336
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:01,309
was okay in order to accomplish that why

337
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,230
we're gonna make tablets and cell phones

338
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:04,578
and reinvent all of these devices order

339
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,230
to do that and that was really the story

340
00:13:04,578 --> 00:13:08,239
and the reason behind it and why people

341
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,190
got behind every product that Apple

342
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,049
brings is because they connect with the

343
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:15,170
why of the company and I think it's

344
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:17,588
tremendously important yeah I just want

345
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:21,139
to build on what Dean mentioned as well

346
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:25,089
telling your story is is essential and

347
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:26,779
connecting with your audience is key so

348
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:29,240
making sure that

349
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:31,639
the visuals on your packaging the

350
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,169
imagery that you choose and marketing

351
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,049
your product whether it be on social

352
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:38,209
media or on a billboard that it connects

353
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:42,139
with your audience and who you're trying

354
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:44,780
to target and and all of that and also

355
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:47,629
be genuine be very genuine and be

356
00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:49,579
transparent people want to know where

357
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:50,629
their cannabis is coming from they want

358
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:52,629
to know what they're putting into their

359
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:54,379
bodies people really want transparency

360
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:57,409
nowadays and that's why the

361
00:13:54,379 --> 00:13:59,360
farm-to-table movement it's a so huge

362
00:13:57,409 --> 00:14:02,569
and had such success and people are

363
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,879
smart smart consumers we have the

364
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,700
internet we have information within the

365
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:10,700
palm of our hands that we can access

366
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:14,000
right away so you know and and and and

367
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,830
all of that also plays into building the

368
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,360
movement behind your product well if you

369
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:20,780
can do this successfully you can get a

370
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,210
lot of people on your side and and once

371
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:25,159
you have a customer for life that person

372
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:28,240
is going to tell everybody about your

373
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:32,329
product so yeah just be genuine be real

374
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,430
connect with with your audience and yeah

375
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,440
I just want to add something real quick

376
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:38,959
sorry to what I was saying doesn't only

377
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,200
pertain to like physical products if

378
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,330
you're a grower your brand is who you

379
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,040
are and how you're growing tell people

380
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,480
the nutrients that you're doing tell

381
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:48,860
people what you're doing tell people

382
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:50,779
where you're selling to if you're a

383
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,310
distributor you have a brand this is

384
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:54,649
what we do this is how we take care of

385
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:57,109
people it's not I don't mean brands just

386
00:14:54,649 --> 00:14:59,840
in terms of luck a you know a jar of

387
00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:02,300
flour on a shelf I mean like everything

388
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,580
about your company if if you are you

389
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:07,039
know anything within the industry you

390
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,770
have a brand you have a story you have

391
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:12,589
an audience whether your audience is b2b

392
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:14,659
or b2c or you know if it's consumers or

393
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:16,820
if it's other professionals everybody's

394
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:18,889
paying attention so don't you know don't

395
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:21,250
take for granted that people just know

396
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:23,539
stuff about you try to make sure that

397
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,610
that you're telling who you are and why

398
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:27,049
you're doing what you're doing I think

399
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,820
it's a great point like when a lot of

400
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:31,309
the companies on our platform so you

401
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:33,200
work with you know some leading brands

402
00:15:31,309 --> 00:15:35,659
like Kia and California Juana and

403
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,150
Colorado's suits up in Washington but

404
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:39,549
there really isn't yet

405
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:42,669
a national leader there's no Coke no

406
00:15:39,549 --> 00:15:44,049
Pepsi people like market caps might say

407
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:46,599
otherwise but that's just you know

408
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:48,309
that's just today what we are seeing is

409
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,629
a lot of companies are pretty small and

410
00:15:48,309 --> 00:15:51,159
they're looking to scale and getting to

411
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:53,559
other markets and I think some of the

412
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:55,419
mistakes that we're seeing happen is we

413
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:56,769
have companies that launch in Michigan

414
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:58,809
or will launch in Colorado because they

415
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:00,370
work with us in Oregon and a lot of

416
00:15:58,809 --> 00:16:02,439
these are startups right everyone is a

417
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:05,049
start-up to a varying degree and the

418
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,090
eyes get really big we want to be craft

419
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:08,979
so we have to be everywhere and if you

420
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:11,139
in the more internal operational side

421
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:12,850
haven't really set what your mission

422
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:14,649
what your goal is how you should be

423
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:16,090
known as I mean it's a business right it

424
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:18,129
has to be operating at a certain level

425
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:20,070
efficiency with accountability and

426
00:16:18,129 --> 00:16:23,049
transparency to actually be successful

427
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:24,900
and so we're seeing mistakes like people

428
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:28,149
jumping into these shotgun marriage

429
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:30,159
jayvees in other states to meet

430
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:32,500
residency requirements and just to get

431
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:35,350
live and what's happening is if you only

432
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,450
have a team of 10 to 30 people in state

433
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,430
1 and you want to be in state 2 and 3 in

434
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:41,590
the next six months things just start

435
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:43,029
getting so sloppy and so forget about

436
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,950
the beauty of the packaging or the

437
00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:47,230
mission at the end consumer sees if you

438
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:49,480
can't keep it straight internally and

439
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,909
have a consistency of who you are as a

440
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,460
team in a company forget about I mean

441
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:57,100
being yeah it's it's it's really through

442
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,660
and through from what we've seen coming

443
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,580
from the creative side I think we get a

444
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:02,769
phone call every single week and it's I

445
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,019
need a logo and I say you got to

446
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:06,459
rephrase your question because it's not

447
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:08,109
about a brand of so much more than a

448
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:10,570
logo a brand is so much more than a

449
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:13,000
package a brand has like many many

450
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:14,799
multifaceted prongs and it's really

451
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,230
important that that brand strategy that

452
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,299
written word is completed first before

453
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:21,099
you ever put ink to paper don't get me

454
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:22,599
wrong I love putting ink to paper it's

455
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:24,189
what I get up in the morning and do I

456
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:26,109
want to create I want to make design I

457
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,700
want to create a package that's gonna be

458
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:29,740
unforgettable that you want to bring and

459
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,720
share at you know with your friends I

460
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:33,759
want it to be resin the biggest thing

461
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,100
also is it needs to resonate I just came

462
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,869
back from Denver cat Joe we were all in

463
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:40,179
Denver for the past couple days and you

464
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:42,849
know six years have passed and I still

465
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:44,950
think that the net was cast really wide

466
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:47,769
and it was kept it was cast by a

467
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:49,019
category called cannabis it wasn't cast

468
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:53,639
by a

469
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:55,650
nating audience driven why I think that

470
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:59,009
that's a moment here in California where

471
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:01,080
we can we can expedite what that process

472
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:04,410
looks like by thinking of brand strategy

473
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:06,089
first so instead of looking at you know

474
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,740
a big net that's being cast and we're

475
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:09,240
all going out into cannabis we're

476
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,430
actually you know we're actually

477
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,319
targeting a person on the other end who

478
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:15,390
wants to resonate with the product that

479
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:17,339
believes in something that is bigger and

480
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,650
beyond and I think that that's really

481
00:18:17,339 --> 00:18:21,809
important so think beyond a logo think

482
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,060
beyond package think about the strategy

483
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,740
first and really make yourself stand out

484
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:27,720
and be different and be authentic

485
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,519
because if that happens you will pull

486
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,289
out from the crowd I'll tell you going

487
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,299
to Denver there was only a few people

488
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:35,339
that really stood out to me and it was

489
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:37,919
just all very similar and homogenized

490
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:40,079
and I think that if you saw real brand

491
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,240
strategy you knew immediately and it

492
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:44,189
popped off the shelf and it maybe even

493
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,930
sometimes wasn't there package maybe it

494
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:47,400
was the way it was merchandised maybe it

495
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,200
was the fourth for that patient who

496
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,330
needed to open that child-resistant

497
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,440
package

498
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:54,389
innovation we have in California right

499
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,279
now and we have a really big chance to

500
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:58,110
do it right

501
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:01,500
totally great and so we keep hitting on

502
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:05,159
packaging right and it's become and I

503
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:07,529
remember back in a day when the retailer

504
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,720
that I worked with was I'll do retailer

505
00:19:07,529 --> 00:19:12,990
didn't even have packaging you'd have to

506
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:15,059
bring your own baggies too now we have

507
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,589
the most sophisticated packaging I think

508
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:19,289
in almost any industry with some of the

509
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:21,000
child proofing that exists how important

510
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:22,409
is it what do we need to consider how

511
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,150
expensive is it how much should a

512
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:27,060
company be contributing into its

513
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:28,830
packaging design and utility let's throw

514
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:31,829
that go ahead yeah you seem excited I

515
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:35,399
can talk about this because what I I

516
00:19:31,829 --> 00:19:37,259
have a lot of I feel your pain because

517
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,240
we can't design against it right now

518
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:41,460
because we don't know exactly where it's

519
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,170
gonna go so I do feel the pain of the

520
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,600
industry because we cannot create the

521
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:46,590
package yet based on where the rigs are

522
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,500
we don't we don't know where that

523
00:19:46,589 --> 00:19:51,779
child-resistant mark is gonna land with

524
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,069
that said I think that's also a mistake

525
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:54,899
that's happening right now with brands

526
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:56,970
is they're thinking like they're pulling

527
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,590
back and waiting because they're just

528
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,940
like I'm not gonna invest in my brand

529
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:01,799
yet because I can't I don't know where

530
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,450
child-resistant it's gonna go that's

531
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:04,430
good

532
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,710
lose you have to come out and strong

533
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,870
with your brand and still feel like oh

534
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,730
oh I'll be able to pivot when I know

535
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:12,769
what the rig's are gonna look like so

536
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:15,170
that's just something I want to say as I

537
00:20:12,769 --> 00:20:16,190
see too much of this pullback of people

538
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,750
being like you know I don't know what my

539
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,400
brand looks like yeah and it's like your

540
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,710
brand isn't your package I don't don't

541
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:24,110
stress but I feel your pain because we

542
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:26,539
don't know what where that's going sorry

543
00:20:24,109 --> 00:20:28,909
I don't mean upset the order no but

544
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:31,700
please please whatever you do if you're

545
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:34,960
a brand do not wait for the regulations

546
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:38,029
to drop just can just act like you're

547
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,620
under the regs you are now and it has to

548
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:42,740
be in child resistant packaging because

549
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:45,019
if you're not and they do take out that

550
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,210
requirement guess what can't sell your

551
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:49,490
product you're going to be waiting to

552
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:49,970
find packaging and and that could take

553
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,490
months

554
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:54,470
well I have brands right now River

555
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,359
represents 30 brands I have brands right

556
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,430
now who can't haven't been able to

557
00:20:56,359 --> 00:21:00,349
secure packaging and that's the only

558
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,880
reason why they are not sitting on

559
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:03,679
shelves of retailers right now are being

560
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:07,100
sold are you guys seeing more packaging

561
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,779
locally or from abroad is that mainly

562
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,490
from abroad I mean you know I mean to be

563
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:13,009
honest a lot of it's just Chinese

564
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:15,740
packaging though and I don't know how

565
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:17,930
the tariffs are going to affect that so

566
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,819
there's a whole host of issues but just

567
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:22,070
be proactive

568
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:24,500
I think the child resistance standards

569
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:26,569
are the child resistant packaging will

570
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,279
be placed on the retailer's ultimately

571
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:32,240
just kind of following what's going on

572
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:34,399
in Sacramento but you know be prepared

573
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,039
be prepared if it's not because if

574
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:44,290
you're not you're we can't sell your

575
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:47,240
product have a little bit of wiggle room

576
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:49,490
with not knowing what was going to

577
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,980
happen with the regulations I went out

578
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:54,079
and bought a 10 thousand dollar Epson

579
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,329
printer label printer so we would have

580
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:59,299
the flexibility to be able to print

581
00:21:56,329 --> 00:22:02,809
in-house no matter what regulations

582
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:05,539
changed tomorrow okay we go to print so

583
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:07,569
yeah just be smart about it and invest

584
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:10,309
you know don't invest 10 grand and

585
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:12,919
pre-printed packaging and the rags

586
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:14,849
change in six weeks you know I have make

587
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,190
sure you have some flexibility

588
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:18,750
and sorry to jump in again don't think

589
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:20,570
you're gonna fool a retailer because

590
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:23,099
they're pretty smart right now they

591
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:25,168
refuse products even product that's

592
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:27,359
compliant because they are seriously

593
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:29,149
nervous about taking product that the

594
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,788
BCC is just gonna pull off the shelf

595
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:34,379
during an inspection so everyone's

596
00:22:32,788 --> 00:22:36,329
paying attention distributors are paying

597
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:39,389
attention I pay attention I have to send

598
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:41,099
back product every day because someone

599
00:22:39,388 --> 00:22:43,048
tried to get queued and placed it in you

600
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:45,119
know a bag that's technically not child

601
00:22:43,048 --> 00:22:47,369
resistant or they didn't put the proper

602
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,109
labels on they didn't put the universal

603
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:50,939
symbol in the front of the product if

604
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:54,178
it's a manufactured product there's all

605
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,798
sorts of little nuances that we simply

606
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:57,899
just can't distribute your product this

607
00:22:55,798 --> 00:23:00,509
is it these are big I have retailers who

608
00:22:57,898 --> 00:23:02,878
who will turn down products like flowers

609
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:05,399
a perfect example technically flower

610
00:23:02,878 --> 00:23:06,839
doesn't is not a manufactured cannabis

611
00:23:05,398 --> 00:23:09,268
good and it really doesn't need the

612
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:10,699
universal symbol because CD pH regs

613
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:13,558
don't govern flower

614
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:15,960
however retailers are freaking out about

615
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:17,308
it when there is a universal symbol on

616
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:20,788
the back but it's in a different color

617
00:23:17,308 --> 00:23:22,259
and they're simply trying to refuse this

618
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:23,908
product so I have to get on the phone

619
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:25,649
with the retailer and we have to go back

620
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:28,230
and forth and then I have to dig up

621
00:23:25,648 --> 00:23:30,148
emails from CD pH saying that's not

622
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:33,360
required for flower and it's this long

623
00:23:30,148 --> 00:23:35,428
process so I guess what I'm saying is

624
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:36,449
just make sure you're dialed in you're

625
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:38,519
not gonna fool anybody

626
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,379
you're not gonna fool anybody but you

627
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,000
know and this is get cute I'll just

628
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:43,918
place it over here but you have to

629
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,109
really follow this those guidelines that

630
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,028
the states giving you it's I think it's

631
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:49,888
a cool opportunity at the same time

632
00:23:48,028 --> 00:23:51,839
right because we have there's one brand

633
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:53,250
of thinking of in California that we

634
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,138
went to visit their facility a few

635
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,700
months back and they had half of it was

636
00:23:55,138 --> 00:23:58,079
just packaging that they way over

637
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,808
purchase and they knew it was gonna be

638
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:02,428
beyond even you know if we weren't gonna

639
00:24:00,808 --> 00:24:04,079
be operating by a grace period or hoping

640
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:06,450
for another one this is what was gonna

641
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,579
be compliant in the very least and we

642
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,048
released new badges now on leaf link

643
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:12,388
that you can be a compliant product

644
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:14,069
people are asking and looking for it but

645
00:24:12,388 --> 00:24:15,508
there was a whole like methodology to

646
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:17,548
releasing this compliant packaging which

647
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:19,288
kind of keys into some retailers are

648
00:24:17,548 --> 00:24:20,788
smart but there's still like a lot of

649
00:24:19,288 --> 00:24:22,740
lack of communication in the supply

650
00:24:20,788 --> 00:24:24,569
chain and especially between buyers and

651
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,519
sellers and regulators so they not only

652
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:26,668
pre bought all their packaging more than

653
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:27,808
they

654
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:29,369
we're gonna need for the next you know

655
00:24:27,808 --> 00:24:31,499
six twelve months but they also had a

656
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:32,959
whole like educational one-sheets that

657
00:24:31,499 --> 00:24:35,308
went in with all the deliveries and

658
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,009
educated their sales reps to explain

659
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:39,839
this is you know what you can and cannot

660
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:41,278
buy and here's why because there's a lot

661
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:42,658
of ideas and there's granularity to

662
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,548
those ideas and what's okay and what

663
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:46,859
isn't okay so it's almost like launching

664
00:24:44,548 --> 00:24:48,378
a product in a new product that people

665
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:50,819
aren't quite yet familiar with and

666
00:24:48,378 --> 00:24:51,868
companies that did that seem to be we

667
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:54,058
could see their transaction on the

668
00:24:51,868 --> 00:24:55,408
platform far and away where others are

669
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:57,028
really almost at a standstill they're

670
00:24:55,409 --> 00:24:58,080
sitting on millions of dollars of

671
00:24:57,028 --> 00:25:00,419
product kind of like what we were

672
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:02,999
learning to earlier yeah so one of our

673
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,499
recurring themes of the panel is the

674
00:25:02,999 --> 00:25:06,509
regulation surrounding all of the

675
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:08,399
marketing and branding right so and it's

676
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:09,868
the first time in our industry at least

677
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:11,308
here in California that we've ever had

678
00:25:09,868 --> 00:25:13,079
to deal with these types of threat of

679
00:25:11,308 --> 00:25:15,298
losing your license so I want to segue

680
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:17,608
here into the don't lose your license

681
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:19,440
conversation and what are a few things

682
00:25:17,608 --> 00:25:20,970
in addition to obviously compliant

683
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,249
packaging and everything being compliant

684
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:25,710
what are some pitfalls in just the the

685
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:26,850
overall compliance area that brands

686
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,710
should be aware of whether it's

687
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:30,480
marketing to minors or children or

688
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,069
caricatures or packaging let's talk

689
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,839
about a few of those areas one of the

690
00:25:32,069 --> 00:25:35,519
issues that I dealt with when I first

691
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,519
came to River was marketing to children

692
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:41,038
I looked through all of our SKUs you

693
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:42,899
know looking for names had to

694
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,808
unfortunately tell a lot of brand brands

695
00:25:42,898 --> 00:25:47,788
you can't use the word candy and what is

696
00:25:45,808 --> 00:25:49,470
that started cutting tin but to you guys

697
00:25:47,788 --> 00:25:51,720
what is your interpretation because it's

698
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:53,100
not 100% where you can and can't market

699
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,429
its marketing to children is kind of

700
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:57,599
what does that mean to River what does

701
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:00,149
that mean tahrir I mean we're just

702
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,798
overly cautious where you don't want you

703
00:26:00,148 --> 00:26:03,689
know we look at these brands we looked

704
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:05,940
at the packaging this is really isn't a

705
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,080
too big of an issue right now but you

706
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,149
know when I first came there where we

707
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:11,668
were really with a fine-tooth comb going

708
00:26:09,148 --> 00:26:13,648
through these brands and and looking at

709
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:16,409
them and looking for keywords looking

710
00:26:13,648 --> 00:26:18,238
for cartoon figures and stuff like that

711
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:20,850
it was kind of silly but it's actually

712
00:26:18,239 --> 00:26:22,259
something that we had to do because once

713
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:24,449
again you know we want to sell these

714
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:26,368
brands but we can't sell them you know

715
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:28,288
when they have a certain certain names

716
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:30,118
in there that a lot of candies you know

717
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:32,099
like and it's very explicit in the regs

718
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:35,220
you can't use the word candy on your

719
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:37,558
packaging you can't and then as far as

720
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:40,140
what's like appealing to children

721
00:26:37,558 --> 00:26:42,299
I'd really don't know

722
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,490
we had kind of had to take kind of a

723
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:46,200
conservative approach because no offense

724
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,930
to the state but there's really no

725
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,190
guidelines on they just say it and

726
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:53,009
there's this kind of like oh you

727
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:57,509
interpret it and there's this nothing

728
00:26:53,009 --> 00:27:01,319
there so that's been an issue right

729
00:26:57,509 --> 00:27:03,000
infringement is a real thing so don't

730
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:06,839
make a candy bar that looks like a

731
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,670
Hershey bar and call it stoner bar yet

732
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:10,709
real companies are coming in you know

733
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,120
and that's something that as Tim kind of

734
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,920
mentioned I've seen a lot of cleaning up

735
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:15,869
in the last year or two of you know

736
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,600
variations of Disney properties or

737
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:21,000
Marvel properties or Star Wars and that

738
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:22,649
was I think something that early on a

739
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,029
lot of brands would attract you and have

740
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,740
these limited runs and I think that's a

741
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:27,089
pitfall at least at this point because a

742
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,410
lot of the big boys are starting to step

743
00:27:27,089 --> 00:27:30,509
up and their IP departments are

744
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:32,700
labouring litigation all across the

745
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:34,769
industry and from an advertising

746
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,330
standpoint you know as we all know we

747
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:38,339
cannot take out you know anything that's

748
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:40,829
federally you know FCC there's no

749
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:44,339
there's no advertising for television

750
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:45,720
radio so what actually is kind of unique

751
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:47,639
about this is you get to drive a

752
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,250
language in an organic fashion and I

753
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,650
think what we need to look at is making

754
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,660
sure that brands are very connected with

755
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,940
the end consumer through training and

756
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,800
through connecting with their retailers

757
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,690
and to make sure that they're educating

758
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,970
and changing and driving the message

759
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:04,680
about their brand for to the bud tenders

760
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,450
even and I think that that's really

761
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,160
important when we when we when I think

762
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,480
about alcohol and coffee there's a lot

763
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,830
of trainings that are coming from the

764
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,329
brands there's the distributors are

765
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:13,289
going in they're meeting and they're

766
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:14,669
saying this is this is how you

767
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:16,200
administer the product this is what the

768
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:18,180
product is this is the farmer that grew

769
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,430
it and that's an opportunity to kind of

770
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:22,500
do the advertising in a very internal

771
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:24,029
way while we still have a lot of you

772
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,539
know sort of requirements where we can't

773
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:28,859
advertise our brand social media you

774
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,720
can't you know we're no we're gonna get

775
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:32,639
into that but that's another amazing

776
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,170
place for you to drive your why you get

777
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,090
to drive the message you can account you

778
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,529
can connect and talk to the right people

779
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:39,990
that you want to have resonate with your

780
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:42,210
brand in your product it is an amazing

781
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:45,150
tool right now they can be used to grow

782
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,470
a very loyal following and I think it's

783
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,330
really important that that's that it

784
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:49,799
that's addressed and looked at yeah I

785
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:51,539
think let's jump into sorry Tim but

786
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:53,028
let's just jump into social media now

787
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:55,038
because you know

788
00:28:53,028 --> 00:28:56,239
I've watched the industry grow and I

789
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:57,798
think it's been more of a community

790
00:28:56,239 --> 00:29:00,409
rather than an industry up until this

791
00:28:57,798 --> 00:29:03,108
point social media has been a platform

792
00:29:00,409 --> 00:29:04,999
that was readily used by everyone and

793
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:07,128
I'd say like the cannabis industry runs

794
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:09,199
on Instagram essentially right despite

795
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:10,759
the fact that we can't advertise people

796
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:12,528
are touchy accounts are shut down every

797
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:14,479
other day it's the same as like the bank

798
00:29:12,528 --> 00:29:16,669
accounts have always been so despite

799
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:18,859
that that does the cannabis industry run

800
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:20,509
on Instagram and social media how does

801
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:22,338
our panel feel that branch should be

802
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,899
activating and where should they use in

803
00:29:22,338 --> 00:29:25,519
and what are good strategies for using

804
00:29:23,898 --> 00:29:28,458
social media and other mainstream media

805
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,899
channels I think email is a great way to

806
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:31,429
connect with an audience as long as

807
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:32,658
you're not over emailing and pissing

808
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:36,499
people off because a lot of people do

809
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:38,119
that or texting but you know a lot of I

810
00:29:36,499 --> 00:29:39,588
think everybody should be worried about

811
00:29:38,118 --> 00:29:42,078
what platform that you're building your

812
00:29:39,588 --> 00:29:42,858
audience because whose audience is still

813
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:45,098
on MySpace

814
00:29:42,858 --> 00:29:47,328
nobody's you know those social media

815
00:29:45,098 --> 00:29:49,308
companies could go away or they could

816
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:51,259
you know things could change so don't

817
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:54,499
just you know build your audience on

818
00:29:51,259 --> 00:29:55,939
Facebook or Instagram you know use them

819
00:29:54,499 --> 00:29:58,368
to reach an audience but really try to

820
00:29:55,939 --> 00:30:01,219
collect emails and really try to you

821
00:29:58,368 --> 00:30:03,978
know build in-person experiences with

822
00:30:01,219 --> 00:30:07,578
people and connections because you know

823
00:30:03,979 --> 00:30:09,859
those platforms could go away and what

824
00:30:07,578 --> 00:30:11,658
types of mainstream platforms are you

825
00:30:09,858 --> 00:30:14,989
guys utilizing or that you see it all

826
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:18,169
whether it be radio or television or ads

827
00:30:14,989 --> 00:30:19,519
in print in magazines like what have you

828
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:26,739
guys seen be effective for the brands

829
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:30,679
that you guys work with oh I was a

830
00:30:26,739 --> 00:30:33,469
former CEO of Magnolia wellness which is

831
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:37,249
a dispensary in West Oakland and I think

832
00:30:33,469 --> 00:30:38,869
we were probably the first dispensary to

833
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:42,889
have a billboard

834
00:30:38,868 --> 00:30:45,708
on 580 which coming from San Francisco

835
00:30:42,888 --> 00:30:49,368
going into Oakland and we had that

836
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:50,839
billboard up for four years and we saw a

837
00:30:49,368 --> 00:30:53,019
lot of success from that billboard

838
00:30:50,838 --> 00:30:56,328
mainly because we were the only

839
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:58,909
dispensary in the state that had a

840
00:30:56,328 --> 00:31:01,459
billboard and it was it's kind of

841
00:30:58,909 --> 00:31:03,169
expensive but it paid off you know we

842
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,590
were able to kind of retract out from

843
00:31:03,169 --> 00:31:07,200
track are we

844
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:09,149
turn on investment by seeing who was

845
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,470
coming in signing up and how they found

846
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:13,470
out about us did you find out about us

847
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:16,110
do weed maps billboard what was it

848
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:18,929
and so the Billboard was cool we also

849
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:20,399
did a TV commercial which was really

850
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:22,580
expensive I think we're one of the only

851
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:27,419
dispensaries that have TV commercial too

852
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:29,240
and I don't think that's very good there

853
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:34,440
but it was cool they would show our

854
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:36,778
commercial during SVU at night and but

855
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,480
print print print seems to be good but

856
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:41,220
you know I do agree with Dean here about

857
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,298
collecting emails because that's

858
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,640
something that you will always have

859
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:46,408
whereas all the other platforms could go

860
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,630
away you will always have a way to

861
00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:52,140
connect with the audience through email

862
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:53,820
I think a lot of the main outlets or the

863
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:55,230
ones that are industry leaders are

864
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:56,668
pretty underwhelming at least on the

865
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,440
metrics that they give back on

866
00:31:56,669 --> 00:32:00,360
advertisements click-through rates and

867
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:02,610
impressions are usually pretty pathetic

868
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:04,589
and then at times there are these very

869
00:32:02,609 --> 00:32:06,259
like what we call like v1 tech companies

870
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:11,189
in the space doing pretty predatory

871
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:13,019
advertising regimes so there's that side

872
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,028
and there's limitations around where

873
00:32:13,019 --> 00:32:17,759
like even getting access to billboards

874
00:32:15,028 --> 00:32:19,679
or like public TV is is challenging the

875
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,000
nice part is the industry so small and

876
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,399
the community is pretty tightly knit

877
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,308
that are people ask how do we get to

878
00:32:23,398 --> 00:32:28,109
2,300 retailers how do we have over 350

879
00:32:26,308 --> 00:32:29,579
in California because we're we're

880
00:32:28,109 --> 00:32:31,528
knocking on everyone's doors I mean you

881
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:33,028
could spend a few weeks and pretty much

882
00:32:31,528 --> 00:32:35,159
meet everyone you need to meet in this

883
00:32:33,028 --> 00:32:37,230
space and people talk and it's very

884
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:40,110
communal so you may not have all these

885
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:41,490
quick sexy methods of getting everyone's

886
00:32:40,109 --> 00:32:43,500
eyeballs but you could pretty much get

887
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:45,120
everyone's bodies in a room pretty

888
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,429
quickly and then meet them in the

889
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:49,558
old-school old-fashioned way so that's a

890
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:51,059
good thing that we've done and I just

891
00:32:49,558 --> 00:32:52,829
want to say everyone in this room is

892
00:32:51,058 --> 00:32:54,509
here because we're probably an authority

893
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:57,658
on something or we have a voice in

894
00:32:54,509 --> 00:33:01,288
cannabis and we need all of our voices

895
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:05,130
to be the advertisers and so I always

896
00:33:01,288 --> 00:33:07,349
tell people please like be right go and

897
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:08,970
say you'll do an op-ed talk to media

898
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:12,119
connect with influencers who are

899
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:14,279
probably not in cannabis to change to

900
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:16,409
sort of change the tone and to get more

901
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:17,819
people that are not even thinking of

902
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:20,279
cannabis is something that they should

903
00:33:17,819 --> 00:33:22,980
have as a as a budget line item and a

904
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:25,500
purchase and their you know in their in

905
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,819
their household to think of it as

906
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,710
something that they can bring into their

907
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:30,089
household and that's sort of the thing

908
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:32,579
that I want to say is that we need to

909
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:34,559
get more communal connectivity and media

910
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:36,509
to be talking about it and writing great

911
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:37,049
articles about brands that are doing it

912
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:39,029
well

913
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:41,639
cultivation that's doing it well and

914
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:44,700
that's our job to really raise voices

915
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:48,240
together yeah you know from rivers

916
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:50,250
perspective we have a team of 23 sales

917
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,200
managers who go out around the state and

918
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:54,990
sell the product but the brands that

919
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,910
work with our sales folks are the ones

920
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:58,980
who succeed the brands who do the ride

921
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:01,140
alongs with us who go out and promote

922
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:02,579
their own product with our team the

923
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:06,210
brands that show up to our sales

924
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:08,549
meetings and and educate our sales

925
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,590
associates about about the brands and

926
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:12,570
the benefits and the message they they

927
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:14,789
all want to convey and the story about

928
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:17,640
the brand those are that is so important

929
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:19,889
just just getting out there yes social

930
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:22,139
media and print and all that's great

931
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:24,029
but just getting out there and and

932
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:26,039
preaching your message and advertising

933
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:29,550
your brand those are the brands that

934
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:31,409
River really we really do well with it's

935
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,690
when they play an active part with us

936
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,519
yes we have the team we have the the

937
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:37,289
foot soldiers sort of speak to go out

938
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:39,360
there and sell the product but it's the

939
00:34:37,289 --> 00:34:41,610
brands who actually step and get away

940
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,460
and advertise their products themselves

941
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:46,320
in conjunction with us they do well the

942
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,150
hard work wins right yeah it's gonna

943
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,539
take time you know it's gonna take a

944
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:53,190
long time you know you're not set up to

945
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:54,480
be able to get you know mass media

946
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,760
coverage and there are a lot of

947
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,199
limitations on the marketing if you want

948
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,480
to have a brand of any sort you're gonna

949
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:01,859
have to go down go out there on the road

950
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,420
foot soldier

951
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:09,269
go and make you know connections 1 bar 1

952
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,710
bar 1 bar 1 there is no launcher product

953
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:12,509
and immediately you've got a following

954
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,949
and you're selling 10,000 units and

955
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,240
you're it's gonna take a long time so

956
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:17,309
make sure you're managing your

957
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:18,479
expectations and the expectations of the

958
00:35:17,309 --> 00:35:20,219
people that you're working with and

959
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:22,380
really put in the effort and put in the

960
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:24,329
time and be really passionate about it

961
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:28,030
because people can see that and they can

962
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:31,849
read it - one more thing

963
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:34,310
so when I moved to California four and a

964
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:35,960
half years ago I worked for an edibles

965
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:38,150
company with actually beer brothers

966
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:40,280
those two guys in the back and they were

967
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:44,030
my sales team here in LA and I was

968
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:46,609
working up north and we took that that

969
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:48,830
brand that edibles company from four

970
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:51,500
dispensaries to fifty dispensaries in

971
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:53,719
six months and we did that because we

972
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,760
were on the ground going from dispensary

973
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:58,099
to dispensary talking to folks we didn't

974
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,010
depend on you know it's great to have

975
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:03,199
River as a distributor or a distribution

976
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:04,940
company but you've really as the brand

977
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:07,368
got to go out and do your own work and

978
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,630
build those relationships yeah I think

979
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:10,100
the point here is that the industry is

980
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:11,480
still young enough and still small

981
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:13,489
enough that you could start a company

982
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,380
tomorrow work hard and still play among

983
00:36:13,489 --> 00:36:18,679
the biggest in the game here and that's

984
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:21,079
available and work Yeah right come on

985
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:22,309
I think this industry is the epitome of

986
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,750
the American dream I've seen more

987
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:25,369
self-made millionaires than any other

988
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:28,010
industry I've ever worked in so that

989
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:29,980
that's why I say that but we're hitting

990
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:32,240
here a lot on the issues of the

991
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:34,608
limitations of advertising and marketing

992
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:36,139
right advertising is a part of having a

993
00:36:34,608 --> 00:36:37,489
brand where do we advertise and pay for

994
00:36:36,139 --> 00:36:39,829
ads and get get the word out there

995
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:41,959
because social media is limited

996
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:43,009
Instagram Google Facebook that's where

997
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,750
everybody else in the world and

998
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:46,640
advertisers and spends millions of

999
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,769
dollars we can't do it I think we've

1000
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:51,230
seen a turn in cannabis to a lot of

1001
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:53,659
influencer or celebrity branded

1002
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:55,190
marketing right so there's been some

1003
00:36:53,659 --> 00:36:57,469
good ones there's been some bad ones

1004
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:58,700
there's been how do we use celebrity

1005
00:36:57,469 --> 00:37:00,919
influencers how do we use just

1006
00:36:58,699 --> 00:37:02,960
influencers on on the ground the guys

1007
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,430
who have 20 40 50 thousand followers as

1008
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,230
well I just want to throw that on the

1009
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:08,480
table and let's get a little topic going

1010
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:11,420
there yeah I can speak a little bit to

1011
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,980
the celebrity branded products I've

1012
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,590
launched a couple of I've been paying a

1013
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:19,849
lot of attention Tom will tell if it

1014
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:22,670
works if people care it's difficult

1015
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:24,639
enough to have a product on a shelf

1016
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:27,980
especially in the state of California

1017
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:29,719
period then to now slap a celebrity logo

1018
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:31,579
on it charge a little bit more and

1019
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:33,799
actually have that work yes it's going

1020
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:36,380
to help because that celebrity has a

1021
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,750
pre-existing following and an audience

1022
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,340
already but who's to say that if you

1023
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:41,489
know we won't use any names but we'll

1024
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:44,140
say celebrity

1025
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:47,499
has a huge following and they go and

1026
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:48,788
they partner with you know a farm or a

1027
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,409
manufacturer or something and they'll

1028
00:37:48,789 --> 00:37:52,420
end up getting a product on the shelf

1029
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:54,429
you know if they're fans of their

1030
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:57,249
audience walk into that dispensary and

1031
00:37:54,429 --> 00:37:59,828
they see that the product is at a you

1032
00:37:57,248 --> 00:38:02,318
know a higher price point because there

1033
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:04,930
are more you know the pie has to be cut

1034
00:38:02,318 --> 00:38:07,088
more ways but the product isn't that

1035
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:08,739
good and it's not as good as a much

1036
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:10,808
better product that's next to it on the

1037
00:38:08,739 --> 00:38:12,789
shelf that's cheaper I don't care if

1038
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:14,140
you're the biggest fan of celebrity X in

1039
00:38:12,789 --> 00:38:16,239
the world you're not buying that product

1040
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:17,920
more than once and it becomes a novelty

1041
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:20,380
item and the problem is that it'll ends

1042
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,048
up being brand depreciating because the

1043
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:25,690
the fan and the loyal follower of that

1044
00:38:23,048 --> 00:38:27,278
celebrity will go into the store and

1045
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:28,900
look at it and get pissed off and go

1046
00:38:27,278 --> 00:38:30,278
what what are you doing you're trying to

1047
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,979
sell me a product that's not as good

1048
00:38:30,278 --> 00:38:34,088
that's more expensive and you now you're

1049
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,618
just trying to cash grab and you

1050
00:38:34,088 --> 00:38:37,478
obviously haven't paid attention to the

1051
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:39,459
product you're not really a huge fan of

1052
00:38:37,478 --> 00:38:41,858
it and then that deadlines are being

1053
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:44,198
depreciating to the celebrity or the

1054
00:38:41,858 --> 00:38:45,788
musician or the band or whatever so you

1055
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:47,259
know I think I think everybody needs to

1056
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:48,519
be a little bit careful about what kind

1057
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:50,708
of products that they're putting out

1058
00:38:48,518 --> 00:38:53,409
there and people you know really need to

1059
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:54,879
make sure that it's legitimate because

1060
00:38:53,409 --> 00:38:58,690
you could let it could land a backfiring

1061
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:01,028
on you so I want to piggyback on that

1062
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:02,559
that's a great point River we distribute

1063
00:39:01,028 --> 00:39:06,458
Cheech and Chong I like to joke around

1064
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:08,559
so we got both of them and you're

1065
00:39:06,458 --> 00:39:10,899
exactly right it's about the quality of

1066
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,759
the product yeah sure it's a novelty

1067
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:15,130
like Cheech and Chong it's great product

1068
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:16,539
we sell it all the time only because

1069
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:19,059
it's great product and that's why we

1070
00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:20,619
have a team that goes out there and make

1071
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:23,559
sure it's actually a good product

1072
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:25,449
actually good flour because we know that

1073
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:27,369
it's just simply not gonna sell yeah it

1074
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:29,739
might sell right away and you know it's

1075
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:31,660
gonna be a short time thing but that's

1076
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:33,759
definitely one to piggyback on that on

1077
00:39:31,659 --> 00:39:37,298
that point as a distributor actually

1078
00:39:33,759 --> 00:39:39,219
carries two brands for celebrities

1079
00:39:37,298 --> 00:39:41,048
yeah I think what they bring to the

1080
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:43,088
table is attention all right you get a

1081
00:39:41,048 --> 00:39:44,380
flash of look this way at your company

1082
00:39:43,088 --> 00:39:45,998
and they're you know encouraging an

1083
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,219
experience and if that experience is not

1084
00:39:45,998 --> 00:39:49,149
through the roof people are for sure not

1085
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,289
going to be paying your premium you know

1086
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:52,809
I think that's a mistake that brands

1087
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:53,979
make is charging the extra 20% over

1088
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:55,079
their standard thing to cover the

1089
00:39:53,978 --> 00:39:57,118
licensing deal that they

1090
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:59,068
just struck consumers won't pay it they

1091
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,660
know they can get the cheaper name of

1092
00:39:59,068 --> 00:40:02,670
your brand version and not the shiny

1093
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:05,248
package with the gold trim and it's the

1094
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:06,809
same product inside so I completely

1095
00:40:05,248 --> 00:40:08,488
agree on that I think it works -

1096
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:10,499
apparently it depreciates the brand it

1097
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:11,519
depreciates the the celebrity or the

1098
00:40:10,498 --> 00:40:13,528
influencer involved

1099
00:40:11,518 --> 00:40:15,169
I think the net result is that they've

1100
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:17,608
lost money all the way around that the

1101
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:19,440
the envelope because it's expensive to

1102
00:40:17,608 --> 00:40:21,088
bring brands it's expensive to do new

1103
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,338
packaging it's expensive to do photo

1104
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:24,690
shoots and coordinate social media

1105
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:26,489
content and do all these things that

1106
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:28,588
most of the brands in this industry are

1107
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:30,298
just brand new at getting so they strike

1108
00:40:28,588 --> 00:40:31,889
up one of these expensive deals pay a

1109
00:40:30,298 --> 00:40:34,108
large guarantee upfront and it's more

1110
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:36,929
high-fives and pictures I've at least

1111
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:38,728
I've noticed then actual value in ROI in

1112
00:40:36,929 --> 00:40:40,348
the relationships yeah it's not as cut

1113
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:41,248
and dry as just creating a product and

1114
00:40:40,349 --> 00:40:42,509
putting it on the shelf I think

1115
00:40:41,248 --> 00:40:44,879
everybody in here knows how difficult

1116
00:40:42,509 --> 00:40:47,248
that is and how to bring a product to

1117
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,099
market and I think you know if the

1118
00:40:47,248 --> 00:40:51,949
celebrity isn't like fully endorsing and

1119
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:53,789
marketing the hell out of that product

1120
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,649
dispensaries are gonna go why am i

1121
00:40:53,789 --> 00:40:57,239
carrying this product you're you're the

1122
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:58,858
celebrity isn't even marketing it and

1123
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:00,420
endorsing it and then you know you've

1124
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:02,130
got issues with distribution and sales

1125
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:04,739
teams and and people that are just

1126
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:06,269
trying to cash in and put products on

1127
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:09,150
the Shelf that they don't actually use

1128
00:41:06,268 --> 00:41:11,159
that aren't authentic to the brand and

1129
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:12,509
you know and you know dispensary start

1130
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:14,670
asking questions and they'll say like

1131
00:41:12,509 --> 00:41:16,170
well you know you just played a show in

1132
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,369
the city why didn't you guys come in and

1133
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:20,278
do meet and greets you know with

1134
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:23,309
revolution we've placed a big focus on

1135
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:24,958
actually going into the stores and doing

1136
00:41:23,309 --> 00:41:26,339
signings and doing giveaways and

1137
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:29,098
marketing the products and posting

1138
00:41:26,338 --> 00:41:31,768
videos and talking about it because the

1139
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:34,019
band actually really does use and love

1140
00:41:31,768 --> 00:41:35,399
the product and that comes across and I

1141
00:41:34,018 --> 00:41:38,068
think that people can see that there's

1142
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,269
an actual connection where they're not

1143
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:41,248
just trying to slap their name on

1144
00:41:39,268 --> 00:41:43,708
something and call it a day and hope

1145
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:45,899
that dispensaries order the product and

1146
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:48,419
that sales teams sell the product so I

1147
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,608
think you know I think that's been an

1148
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,949
issue too but it's also we we have seen

1149
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:56,009
it work for us because you know

1150
00:41:52,949 --> 00:41:57,298
dispensaries are very open to something

1151
00:41:56,009 --> 00:41:59,039
like that and it's something special if

1152
00:41:57,298 --> 00:42:01,440
you know revolution just played two

1153
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,539
nights at Red Rocks in Colorado and we

1154
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,278
went into the clinic and we you know

1155
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:06,630
they sat down and they did a table and

1156
00:42:05,278 --> 00:42:08,500
they did a signing and everybody who

1157
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,510
comes in got a raffle ticket

1158
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,429
tickets to a sold-out show and I think I

1159
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:14,020
think dispensaries appreciate that I

1160
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:15,789
think the fans can see that the band

1161
00:42:14,019 --> 00:42:18,280
actually loves and supports the product

1162
00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:20,769
and they're more inclined to support it

1163
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,360
- yeah I think that's a big thing to hit

1164
00:42:20,769 --> 00:42:23,650
on is that the band or the celebrity the

1165
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,510
influence or wherever it is needs to

1166
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,980
love and support the product and I think

1167
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:29,440
it's less about slapping that name on

1168
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,820
the product and their followers knowing

1169
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,440
that they love and support something

1170
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:34,000
because that they want to participate

1171
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:35,740
and they want to enjoy the things that

1172
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,510
those the people that they idolize and

1173
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:39,129
that they think are the the culture

1174
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,480
tastemakers they want to participate in

1175
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:42,820
the things that those people love and

1176
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,869
and and and participate in not something

1177
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:45,130
that has their face on it

1178
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:45,909
right I mean in that and that's

1179
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:48,070
something that's been traditionally

1180
00:42:45,909 --> 00:42:50,379
improving and I think other mainstream

1181
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:51,760
music fashion apparel industries and now

1182
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,650
that it's coming over to cannabis I

1183
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,540
think we had a flush of put your face on

1184
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:56,500
it kind of brands and really generic

1185
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,420
products and we're seeing that that's

1186
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:59,710
not not something that's been effective

1187
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,079
and I think we're gonna start seeing

1188
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:04,059
more of a generalized brand that is

1189
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,829
supported by a collective of these

1190
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:07,809
influencers that will be more effective

1191
00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:10,150
long-term you don't need to think about

1192
00:43:07,809 --> 00:43:12,190
your brand like this and I think that we

1193
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:13,930
can look at other industries you can

1194
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:17,079
have multiple products within your

1195
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:19,299
portfolio that are going to be beyond

1196
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:21,099
they're gonna be tiered there's gonna be

1197
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,870
some or like limited edition you've

1198
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:24,579
poured your heart and soul into it maybe

1199
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:27,219
it does have somebody that's being it's

1200
00:43:24,579 --> 00:43:29,440
endorsed by then think of it look at

1201
00:43:27,219 --> 00:43:31,809
your portfolio and say well I want that

1202
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,030
shelf space up at the top and I want to

1203
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:35,230
have that beautiful high-end product

1204
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:37,870
that I maybe spend a lot more time

1205
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:40,090
curating or it has a little bit more you

1206
00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:41,799
know sort of you know something unique

1207
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:43,510
to it and then have your space in the

1208
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,400
middle where it's hey you might be

1209
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:47,260
targeting multiple consumers but do it

1210
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:49,090
in a way that's that resonates and has a

1211
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:50,350
story behind it there should be a reason

1212
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:52,329
why it's on that top shelf and there

1213
00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:53,769
should be a reason why you know that you

1214
00:43:52,329 --> 00:43:55,869
have another piece of portfolio that's

1215
00:43:53,769 --> 00:43:57,340
taking that bottom I mean not to do it

1216
00:43:55,869 --> 00:43:59,380
back to the alcohol industry but you go

1217
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,030
into Safeway and there's there's three

1218
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:02,559
people in that game and they've figured

1219
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:04,120
out a ways to create brands that are

1220
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:05,829
there sitting on multiple shelf spots

1221
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:07,989
and I think that's one thing that I want

1222
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:10,090
to say is look at retail look at what

1223
00:44:07,989 --> 00:44:11,229
retail is doing what retail wants the

1224
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:12,490
biggest thing that's gonna happen is if

1225
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:14,110
you don't have shelf space now you're

1226
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:15,699
not gonna get it in a year because that

1227
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,930
shelf space will be filled and if

1228
00:44:15,699 --> 00:44:18,189
they're doing it right there's no one

1229
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:19,989
else that's gonna they're not gonna take

1230
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:22,000
that brand off and put another brand on

1231
00:44:19,989 --> 00:44:23,709
so fill that shelf space and

1232
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,320
do it in ways that are creating creating

1233
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:27,579
a lot of value at each place yeah you

1234
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,320
know and that's something we see with

1235
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:31,029
brands you know everyone wants a

1236
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,970
high-end brand that's all they want to

1237
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:36,610
do that's great that's really great but

1238
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:38,559
you know using the supermarket analogy

1239
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:40,329
you're gonna want your Budweiser you're

1240
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,250
gonna want your Sierra Nevada you're

1241
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:44,679
gonna want some of those you know low to

1242
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:46,480
mid to high high great products and you

1243
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:49,029
want to diversify diversify your

1244
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,320
portfolio as a brand otherwise you're

1245
00:44:49,030 --> 00:44:52,090
not going to command that shelf space

1246
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,460
and the shelf space issue I could go on

1247
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:56,980
for days seeing that as a distributor

1248
00:44:54,460 --> 00:45:00,070
that's been that's been an interesting

1249
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:01,809
challenge for distributors and brands

1250
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:04,840
because you have some places in the

1251
00:45:01,809 --> 00:45:07,239
state who some retailers are saying do

1252
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:09,640
you have to pay me X amount of dollars

1253
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:11,409
to buy this shelf space and this goes on

1254
00:45:09,639 --> 00:45:12,670
in the liquor industry as well actually

1255
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:16,929
it's been outlawed in the liquor

1256
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:19,090
industry but paid you pay me X amount of

1257
00:45:16,929 --> 00:45:21,129
dollars to put this on my shelf and I

1258
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:22,780
can sell it and note with no guarantees

1259
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:24,280
like you know they're gonna push your

1260
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,670
brand or anything like that so that's

1261
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,780
something as brands and its distributors

1262
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:30,730
we need to have an honest discussion

1263
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:32,830
about maybe sorry retailers I may be

1264
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:35,889
making you mad right now but that's one

1265
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:37,659
of the issues we've kind of been dealing

1266
00:45:35,889 --> 00:45:39,819
with yeah I think it's a great point is

1267
00:45:37,659 --> 00:45:41,139
look to the retailers in almost every

1268
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,670
other industry in the world the

1269
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:45,279
retailers are the one that determined

1270
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:47,170
size of package type of product how many

1271
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,910
are sold together they report back to

1272
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:51,099
the distributor the distributor tells

1273
00:45:48,909 --> 00:45:52,809
the manufacturers guys this is what

1274
00:45:51,099 --> 00:45:54,549
works at a retail level and this is how

1275
00:45:52,809 --> 00:45:56,019
it's selling this is the product you

1276
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:57,519
need to make and a lot of other

1277
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:59,440
industries the retailer simply won't

1278
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:00,909
take product which means the distributor

1279
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,920
won't buy it from the manufacturer

1280
00:46:00,909 --> 00:46:05,259
unless it meets their certain criteria

1281
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,760
to encourage the most efficient sales on

1282
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:08,500
the store so the retailers are

1283
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,330
eventually and it's underrated now but

1284
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,800
you're starting to see retailers sell

1285
00:46:10,329 --> 00:46:13,869
the shelf space and understand their

1286
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:15,730
equity in the game it's going to be the

1287
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:17,529
determining factor on what product is

1288
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:19,030
endorsed by a budtender or somebody in

1289
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:21,820
the store level and what actually gets

1290
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:23,140
sold so with that guys let's give a big

1291
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:26,269
round of applause for our panel that was

1292
00:46:23,139 --> 00:46:29,009
fantastic include our question area

1293
00:46:26,269 --> 00:46:30,630
and I wanted to just open up here we got

1294
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:31,890
our 15-20 minutes of question and

1295
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:33,840
answers whatever you guys would like to

1296
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:40,199

1297
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:41,670
for a point and I'll yep perfect you

1298
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:43,679
know the target segmentation and

1299
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:45,840
everything that is really important I

1300
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,789
come from the media marketing

1301
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,740
advertising background and I just wanted

1302
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:52,139
to kind of expand a little bit that yes

1303
00:46:49,739 --> 00:46:55,289
that is definitely what brands and

1304
00:46:52,139 --> 00:46:57,539
products need to do is to really look at

1305
00:46:55,289 --> 00:47:00,630
you know a strategic target segmentation

1306
00:46:57,539 --> 00:47:02,730
what I also think that in addition to

1307
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:05,070
that the market research is also very

1308
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:07,108
important understanding the market

1309
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:13,980
trends and the category that you're in

1310
00:47:07,108 --> 00:47:15,840
what percentage that they're kind of but

1311
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:19,108
I was just saying as well as competitive

1312
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:20,970
you know analysis and so forth that it

1313
00:47:19,108 --> 00:47:22,889
is really important to understand and

1314
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:24,839
you guys were talking about in terms of

1315
00:47:22,889 --> 00:47:27,089
you know the the aisle and so for the

1316
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:29,369
competitive analysis and information is

1317
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:30,930
just very important for brands to make

1318
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:31,680
sure how they can also play in the same

1319
00:47:30,929 --> 00:47:34,259
sandbox

1320
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:36,089
I completely agree and that's and I you

1321
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:38,910
know when we when we look at brands in

1322
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:41,730
other industries coffee wine commodity

1323
00:47:38,909 --> 00:47:44,639
products that we work in we have data we

1324
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:46,469
know that that person who is 35 years

1325
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:49,230
old in San Francisco loves herself a

1326
00:47:46,469 --> 00:47:50,849
Pinot Noir we don't have that yet we're

1327
00:47:49,230 --> 00:47:52,230
gonna get there but you know the fact

1328
00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:54,539
that we're not data collecting and we're

1329
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:56,579
in it there is a lot of security and and

1330
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:58,259
things at the dispensary level it's

1331
00:47:56,579 --> 00:48:00,509
going to be a challenge so back to what

1332
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:02,850
Dean said you have to control the end

1333
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,720
consumer get their email talk to them

1334
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:05,909
because you're not gonna get it from

1335
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:08,279
anywhere else there's no way that you're

1336
00:48:05,909 --> 00:48:10,170
gonna get that information right now at

1337
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,580
least so really try to get as much and

1338
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:13,740
gather as much information about who's

1339
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:14,849
buying your product because that's the

1340
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:17,159
only way we're gonna do it but thank you

1341
00:48:14,849 --> 00:48:19,049
that was such a very good point I just

1342
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:20,759
wanna elaborate on the collecting emails

1343
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:22,700
I'm sure everybody knows but just in

1344
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:26,450
case an easy way to do that is to just

1345
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:29,069
put a email signup form on your website

1346
00:48:26,449 --> 00:48:30,839
you know right as the website pops up

1347
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:31,320
chances are it's gonna say are you 21

1348
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,260
and over

1349
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:36,099
yes have the email website up there when

1350
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:39,459
you're going in and you're doing

1351
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:40,959
in you know in dispensary demos have an

1352
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:42,759
email signup sheet and just say hey

1353
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:44,768
someone comes up like I love this

1354
00:48:42,759 --> 00:48:46,208
product to really help my back cool sign

1355
00:48:44,768 --> 00:48:47,828
up give us your email address then the

1356
00:48:46,208 --> 00:48:49,328
next time we launch a new product you'll

1357
00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:52,539
get it first or the next time we're

1358
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:55,028
coming back to you know Santa Ana at the

1359
00:48:52,539 --> 00:48:57,039

1361
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:00,549

1363
00:49:00,548 --> 00:49:05,199

1366
00:49:06,998 --> 00:49:11,318
know 15% off your next order of whatever

1367
00:49:09,219 --> 00:49:13,298
the product is be creative give people

1368
00:49:11,318 --> 00:49:15,099
incentives but you know technically

1369
00:49:13,298 --> 00:49:17,588
that's the way you can go to companies

1370
00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:19,749
like MailChimp and they have software

1371
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:20,858
that allows you to import all of the

1372
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:23,768
email addresses that you've collected

1373
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:25,778
and then easily export and send out an

1374
00:49:23,768 --> 00:49:27,548
email with whatever you want to design

1375
00:49:25,778 --> 00:49:30,159
or put on there I wondered if you could

1376
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:32,588
comment on maybe some less direct

1377
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:34,748
marketing things that companies can be

1378
00:49:32,588 --> 00:49:36,818
doing something I really appreciate is

1379
00:49:34,748 --> 00:49:38,919
having like a longer-term vision with it

1380
00:49:36,818 --> 00:49:40,599
and education programs and sponsorship

1381
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,659
where it's not necessarily directly

1382
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:45,130
trying to sell a brand or product but

1383
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:47,108
educating the consumer on how to use it

1384
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:48,489
and how it might be beneficial and some

1385
00:49:47,108 --> 00:49:51,248
of the companies that are maybe using

1386
00:49:48,489 --> 00:49:52,838
that approach as their way of getting in

1387
00:49:51,248 --> 00:49:55,708
front of the consumer yeah I think

1388
00:49:52,838 --> 00:49:57,728
collaboration is key and those things so

1389
00:49:55,708 --> 00:50:00,098
for instance I'll just use my own

1390
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:02,368
organization supernova we do a lot of

1391
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:05,109
outreach to black and brown communities

1392
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:06,369
we don't necessarily do expungement

1393
00:50:05,108 --> 00:50:08,380
clinics because that's very

1394
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:12,699
labor-intensive so we've partnered with

1395
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:15,759
SSDP and they do expungement clinics and

1396
00:50:12,699 --> 00:50:20,739
we just sponsor them so you know yeah

1397
00:50:15,759 --> 00:50:22,509
sponsoring with other maybe nonprofit

1398
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:25,150
organizations or any organizations that

1399
00:50:22,509 --> 00:50:27,190
are doing educational outreach and just

1400
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:29,920
your logo being on there its brand

1401
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:31,298
recognition you know takes five five to

1402
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,219
seven times for someone to see your logo

1403
00:50:31,298 --> 00:50:35,588
and weirder for it to really kind of

1404
00:50:33,219 --> 00:50:37,659
click and resonate with them so yeah

1405
00:50:35,588 --> 00:50:39,759
yeah it makes a lot of sense and and

1406
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:41,798
with that it's really just a lot about

1407
00:50:39,759 --> 00:50:43,119
collaborating with other folks you know

1408
00:50:41,798 --> 00:50:44,559
you don't have the bandwidth to do

1409
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,329
certain things you collaborate with

1410
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,519
someone that can and all of our top

1411
00:50:46,329 --> 00:50:49,869
brands have River do that I mean they're

1412
00:50:48,518 --> 00:50:52,118
doing that they're going out and

1413
00:50:49,869 --> 00:50:54,640
promoting the benefits of their products

1414
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:59,499
with the retailers alongside ourselves

1415
00:50:54,639 --> 00:51:01,538
team so yeah yeah something that I've

1416
00:50:59,498 --> 00:51:03,338
seen be very effective in that regard is

1417
00:51:01,539 --> 00:51:05,140
you know supporting the community

1418
00:51:03,338 --> 00:51:06,940
holding it up being a part of it and

1419
00:51:05,139 --> 00:51:08,618
participating right the the the most

1420
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,420
successful brands that I've seen to date

1421
00:51:08,619 --> 00:51:12,940
are the ones who have invested the most

1422
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:14,920
in supporting and hidden ways right

1423
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,329
helping other people carry boxes helping

1424
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,380
companies use their license when they

1425
00:51:16,329 --> 00:51:19,359
were going out of business

1426
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:20,858
housing people during the fires this is

1427
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:23,078
not things that hit the news headlights

1428
00:51:20,858 --> 00:51:24,429
but our brand equity and building within

1429
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:26,469
the community like building up your

1430
00:51:24,429 --> 00:51:27,998
social equity is a very real thing here

1431
00:51:26,469 --> 00:51:31,028
and the industry is still cottage enough

1432
00:51:27,998 --> 00:51:33,189
where that has a ton of value and I just

1433
00:51:31,028 --> 00:51:35,409
just adds that get on nonprofit boards

1434
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:37,329
in your community we're not seeing

1435
00:51:35,409 --> 00:51:40,058
enough people in the cannabis industry

1436
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:41,920
having a voice in powerful boards I

1437
00:51:40,059 --> 00:51:44,079
believe there's a lot of nonprofits that

1438
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,940
could use educate more education and

1439
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:48,249
there's no there's not even the thought

1440
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,729
of a cannabis industry having a seat at

1441
00:51:48,248 --> 00:51:51,669
the table

1442
00:51:48,728 --> 00:51:54,278
we have banking we have you know a lot

1443
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:56,139

1444
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:58,690

1445
00:51:56,139 --> 00:52:00,940
industries sit on boards be a voice I

1446
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:02,588
work a lot in food and agriculture we

1447
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:05,229
were just doing this huge event called

1448
00:52:02,588 --> 00:52:07,358
women and AG and I was so disappointed

1449
00:52:05,228 --> 00:52:09,818
that there was no one represented in

1450
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:11,920
cannabis how is that even possible that

1451
00:52:09,818 --> 00:52:13,509
we're having a you know a legal

1452
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,180
environment here where people are

1453
00:52:13,509 --> 00:52:18,278
growing something and that there was not

1454
00:52:16,179 --> 00:52:20,198
one woman in cannabis so please sit at

1455
00:52:18,278 --> 00:52:22,358
the table please make sure that you're

1456
00:52:20,199 --> 00:52:24,489
on nonprofit boards even outside your

1457
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:25,869
industry you know it's awesome it's a

1458
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:27,278
great way for you to show that there's

1459
00:52:25,869 --> 00:52:28,390
there's brand equity and that you're

1460
00:52:27,278 --> 00:52:30,489
also making a difference

1461
00:52:28,389 --> 00:52:32,440
get on your chamber or local Chamber of

1462
00:52:30,489 --> 00:52:34,690
Commerce I mean you guys we're an

1463

00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:40,028
revenue to the door for these cities and

1465
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:42,009
for the state will bring more eventually

1466
00:52:40,028 --> 00:52:44,978
to the state that's been a another issue

1467
00:52:42,009 --> 00:52:47,469
but we are really an economic powerhouse

1468
00:52:44,978 --> 00:52:49,718
and this you know cities are looking to

1469
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:51,519
us for a lot of for revenue they're

1470
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:52,900
struggling see all these cities are

1471
00:52:51,518 --> 00:52:54,669
struggling they have pension debt they

1472
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:56,229
have all sorts of debt they're looking

1473
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:57,980
at the cannabis industry to kind of help

1474
00:52:56,228 --> 00:53:00,379
solve those problems so

1475
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:02,269
we do have we do have some power when we

1476
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:05,510
come to those staples yeah absolutely

1477
00:53:02,269 --> 00:53:07,309
I also do consulting around branding and

1478
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:10,310
packaging work so I wanted to ask each

1479
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:13,369
panelist just real quick can you name or

1480
00:53:10,309 --> 00:53:15,230
think of one brand besides your own that

1481
00:53:13,369 --> 00:53:16,730
you love the design you think the

1482
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:18,320
branding is on point something that's

1483
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:20,480
really sharp and that stands out to you

1484
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:23,840
in today's market I think broccoli

1485
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:26,360
magazine is doing an amazing job I I

1486
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:28,460
think it's beautifully designed it talks

1487
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,559
to me I love lifestyle brands I left

1488
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:32,510
kinfolk I love great design and I think

1489
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,829
broccoli magazines doing a great job the

1490
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:35,600
people that are advertising and broccoli

1491
00:53:33,829 --> 00:53:38,389
magazine are doing a great job

1492
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,949
from a product standpoint I think you

1493
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:41,799
know Bebo is doing a great job bloom

1494
00:53:39,949 --> 00:53:44,419
farms bloom farms does a great job for

1495
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,400
multiple reasons great packaging great

1496
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:48,349
design but even better transparency in

1497
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,940
their storytelling I feel like I know

1498
00:53:48,349 --> 00:53:51,440
the cultivators I feel like I know the

1499
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:54,380
farmers and they're doing a great job

1500
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:56,179
through social media I think I'd say

1501
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:58,250
dosis there's done a really good job of

1502
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:59,509
spanning people that are not in the

1503
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:01,489
industry again and to understand the

1504
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:03,170
value of the brand and then also there's

1505
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:04,489
a lot of brands and make a lot of noise

1506
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:07,970
but don't have the sales that really

1507
00:54:04,489 --> 00:54:09,319
follow on being existing they do and so

1508
00:54:07,969 --> 00:54:13,159
I think that would be one that I'd call

1509
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:16,880
that I have to be a fangirl to you and

1510
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:20,239
say big Pete's treats Vic peach treats

1511
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:23,240
website just blew me away it's amazing

1512
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:24,769
so awesome and really the story and what

1513
00:54:23,239 --> 00:54:26,809
big peach trees has been doing over the

1514
00:54:24,769 --> 00:54:28,780
years you know they participate very

1515
00:54:26,809 --> 00:54:32,179
heavily with in Santa Cruz community

1516
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:34,880
they do a lot of beach cleanups they

1517
00:54:32,179 --> 00:54:37,399
work with with the veterans in the area

1518
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,349
and Santa Cruz veterans Alliance so I

1519
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,610
mean I have so much respect for big

1520
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:41,119
peach treats I think they're doing an

1521
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:46,220
amazing job

1522
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:48,349
I think Flo Connor is doing a great job

1523
00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:49,909
I think their storytelling is great I

1524
00:54:48,349 --> 00:54:53,480
think the message is great I think the

1525
00:54:49,909 --> 00:54:56,929
designs are great I agree with with

1526
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:57,500
dosis I'm a simple man I like the clean

1527
00:54:56,929 --> 00:55:00,409
lines

1528
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:01,909
I like minimalism I think they're doing

1529
00:55:00,409 --> 00:55:05,029
great in terms of their packaging and

1530
00:55:01,909 --> 00:55:07,399
their design I don't necessarily like to

1531
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:08,930
be told how much I should be consuming

1532
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:10,309
for like the DOS part of it with the

1533
00:55:08,929 --> 00:55:11,539
vibration

1534
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:13,789
that's just my personal opinion

1535
00:55:11,539 --> 00:55:16,099
sometimes I like to take a smaller or

1536
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:17,630
bigger and I don't like to be told you

1537
00:55:16,099 --> 00:55:19,279
know you need to be doing this much

1538
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:20,780
because each person is different but

1539
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,830
their packaging is outstanding and I

1540
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:23,600
really like what they're doing with

1541
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:25,610
trying to push sustainability and and

1542
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:27,049
recycling how they have the drop

1543
00:55:25,610 --> 00:55:30,710
stations and the dispensaries I think

1544
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:32,810
that's really cool too I'm going to use

1545
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:34,970
two brands of river carries lulz and

1546
00:55:32,809 --> 00:55:38,269
utopia I think they're all doing a great

1547
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:40,129
brand especially utopia on you know the

1548
00:55:38,269 --> 00:55:41,690
community benefits once again based out

1549
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:44,030
of Santa Cruz they're just a really

1550
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:46,039
great company really great people so is

1551
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:48,200
lulz I think they're killing it there's

1552
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:50,179
other brands out there like and acid and

1553
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:53,409
stuff that I feel are doing really well

1554
00:55:50,179 --> 00:55:56,419
so kudos to them we need more of those

1555
00:55:53,409 --> 00:55:58,849
yeah and I think for me it would have to

1556
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:00,320
be Apothic Anna from a lotion SOT I

1557
00:55:58,849 --> 00:56:02,509
think their aesthetic and their their

1558
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,250
company angle ambition is one that

1559
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:08,390
really resonates with us and a lot of

1560
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:10,159
people in our in our kind of world and

1561
00:56:08,389 --> 00:56:12,109
on the other end from like a flower

1562
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:14,960
product I think Henry's and their story

1563
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:16,940
and their packaging and the way their

1564
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,980
employees and the way they talk about

1565
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:22,210
their brand or their language is

1566
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:22,210
something that they've really

1567
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:41,090
