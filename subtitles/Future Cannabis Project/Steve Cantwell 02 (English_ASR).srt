1
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:22,140
you're up here in the and the triangle

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,059
Emerald triangle I mean that that's you

3
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,949
build your brand around that what makes

4
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:28,079
you different you grow organic you're in

5
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,449
the mo triangle you have a set of

6
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:33,179
strains grown the best you can market

7
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,920
I'm really good and just keep keep going

8
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:38,429
keep going keep going don't get

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,158
intimidated when you see these huge

10
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:43,829
corporate grows open up Danvers area and

11
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:46,469
all these crazy freakin huge corporate

12
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,969
monsters don't even worry about it man

13
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,338
I've really at the end of the day just

14
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,780
let your enemies kill themselves either

15
00:00:50,338 --> 00:00:53,609
they're already doing it they're there

16
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,439
they're shooting themselves in the foot

17
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:57,058
- stand back do your own thing stay in

18
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,920
your own lane there's plenty of

19
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,298
blessings out there for everybody so you

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,009
know I've got I get jealous you don't

21
00:01:00,298 --> 00:01:04,828
gotta see your neighbor cropping out

22
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:06,390
bigger than you and man he didn't lock

23
00:01:04,828 --> 00:01:07,859
his trashcan I'm gonna call it no you

24
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,659
don't got I think things like that and I

25
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,659
just need to be happy be to be thankful

26
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,040
for what you have and try to create more

27
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:15,478
of that community effect you know I get

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,570
about it where I'm from it's extremely

29
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:21,978
competitive it's it's it's crooked

30
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:25,079
it's the corruption is unreal and

31
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:28,109
there's not a real community vibe there

32
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,340
and now that the dust is kind of settled

33
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:31,620
a little bit we're starting kind of

34
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,870
starting to get it but California you

35
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,820
guys have a good community and don't

36
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,159
lose that you know definitely stay true

37
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:39,478
to that don't don't get don't get

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,130
hostile toward your neighbors because

39
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,019
you know they're able to pay for their

40
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:44,429
license or they're able to crop out

41
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,868
there able to make a sale they're able

42
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,299
to do this because that's the most toxic

43
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:52,469
thing you can do is spend your energy on

44
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,580
that but anyways back to the Brandon so

45
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:55,170
yeah so we start off in Nevada

46
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,510
competitive market we did things

47
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,040
completely different I tried to focus I

48
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:00,750
didn't do these things to because they

49
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,729
were trendy back when I did them four or

50
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,709
five years ago nobody was hashtagging

51
00:02:02,728 --> 00:02:06,359
freaking living soil or no-till or any

52
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:09,030
of that stuff I'm none of the cool kids

53
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:10,679
were doing it again for me it was more

54
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,120
about this is how this is the pot that I

55
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,620
want to smoke this is the pot that I

56
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,870
want to bring to market so for me it was

57
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,569
just it was what is the purest way to

58
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,700
grow

59
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:24,609
no as an indoor farmer that's one of my

60
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:25,839
biggest like annoying things that I have

61
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,480
to have a roof over my head every single

62
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,819
day and I walk outside in the desert and

63
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,619
we have some of the most the most Sun

64
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:36,250
you could ever freaking ask for almost

65
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,408
too much Sun it that that kind of suck

66
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,908
would again work with what you have make

67
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,908
the best of it build a brand around it

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,930
and just just make sure that you're not

69
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,068
you're not chasing trends for that I see

70
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,209
a lot of that going on these days I'd

71
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,979
rather I rather see a group of

72
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:53,319
individuals setting trends and chasing

73
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:56,078
trends because there's too many of this

74
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:57,158
this cool kid stuff going on where

75
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:59,319
everybody's kind of going in the same

76
00:02:57,158 --> 00:03:02,259
direction and it's the total wrong

77
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:04,628
direction it's it's it's almost like a

78
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:07,658
sheep getting led to the slaughter kind

79
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:09,039
of thing in one of the main things that

80
00:03:07,658 --> 00:03:10,780
you can protect yourself is just is

81
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,370
having a voice having a story making

82
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,848
sure that you have a brand that people

83
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:17,319
support that people can stand behind so

84
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:19,149
I for us again it was a whole word

85
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:20,738
gendered movement we do things that

86
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,170
support their gendered movement again as

87
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:25,329
a farmer I can't save the world

88
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:27,219
single-handedly but I can try to plant a

89
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:28,930
seed in each individual's head that just

90
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:31,299
turns on that hay it makes them think

91
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,459
more generally so some of the things

92
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:34,659
that we do to kind of highlight what I

93
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,419
just said it like we have a radar

94
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:40,060
recycling program so years ago when we

95
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:42,160
open up our facility my investors are

96
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:43,870
like if Ames you guys are have investors

97
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,759
are probably have done like hey you want

98
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,590
to go cheap cheap cheap on packaging we

99
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:51,068
want to put good weed and I fucking the

100
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,750
cheapest bag possible no-go obviously so

101
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:53,828
I fought really hard on this gentleman

102
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,900
right here actually helped me

103
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:58,030
we found jars that were the best jars

104
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,989
they're not the best looking jars they

105
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,359
actually looked like something to get

106
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,500
like tomato pasta sauce and or something

107
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:04,659
like they're not they're not the best

108
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:08,408
looking jar I'll be honest but it is the

109
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:10,289
best jar my opinion to store reading we

110
00:04:08,408 --> 00:04:12,239
did all kind of trial and error and it

111
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:13,769
the best sealing lid he just opened it

112
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,530
easiest to close a whole night and so we

113
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:19,228
ran with that I got a whole jar packing

114
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:20,219
program basically to protect the quality

115
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:22,139
of the product in sight

116
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,759
you'd only be selling you want to grow

117
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,740
the best herb in the world put it in a

118
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,879
ten cent bag and then by the time it

119
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,769
gets in consumer it turns to dust so

120
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:33,930
basically to make sure that you're able

121
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:36,029
to make those proper decisions we're in

122
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,978
that spot because you see a lot of that

123
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:39,269
ruin a good grow it doesn't matter how

124
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:41,399
good you grow but if you don't put it in

125
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:45,779
something a quality packaging you're

126
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:53,279
you're screwed anyways I was doing that

127
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:55,348
jar my dad but does so what that was

128
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:58,559
with our door again is that we do a

129
00:04:55,348 --> 00:05:00,120
recycling program so what we do is we

130
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,060
actually ask people hey if you're a GLP

131
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,399
if you have ten GOP gr7 I think it

132
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,189
starts at seven GOP jars you get a hat

133
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,929
ten twenty GOP jars you get a pre-roll

134
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:11,579
so on and so forth so what that does is

135
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,259
we get this huge thing if people are

136
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:16,978
hash tagging us and how they reuse their

137
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:18,960
jars with candles coined this ashtrays

138
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:20,250
that then we got people bringing you

139
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,388
know hundreds of jars coming and

140
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,560
sometimes I don't even want the pre-roll

141
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:24,000
they're just like the idea that they're

142
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,550
do you feel like they're recycling and

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,709
pitching into something and we have a

144
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,180
whole program to where we then peel the

145
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:32,219
sticker the secret that we use I use the

146
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,720
peel for that reason run through a

147
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,669
dishwasher cleaning them putting back

148
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,780
into rotation that's just one more way

149
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:39,658
that we're kind of spreading that

150
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:43,918
regenitive that thinking process not

151
00:05:39,658 --> 00:05:45,269
just the open rev reviews throw away but

152
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:49,348
as far as the agenda of movement the

153
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:50,908
whole idea is basically to look further

154
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,800
down the line you know I mean you can't

155
00:05:50,908 --> 00:05:55,709
just sit there to build this huge trash

156
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,980
piles of heaping piles of garbage and

157
00:05:55,709 --> 00:06:00,560
you try to get rich so

158
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,720
we use what they and try to make your

159
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,129
soil better more agenda by reusing all

160
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,070
the things that you produce and try to

161
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:08,870
basically not have to open your front

162
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:11,689
gate become a consumer I try to be a

163
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,269
producer and not a consumer and I try to

164
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:16,459
produce without without having to intake

165
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:17,990
intake intake without without be able to

166
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,329
produce on my own property so even with

167
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:23,150
the coil company our flour company right

168
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:25,159
now we take very little from the outside

169
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:26,899
I mean I might get a little bit of

170
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,480
coconut powder here and here and now and

171
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:30,889
then that's one of my plants some

172
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:34,700
mycorrhizal haven't figured how to make

173
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:37,699
that yet for most the seeds like we

174
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:39,860
capture on seeds everything we have

175
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,959
drying racks for we have drawing-rooms

176
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,360
for cannabis we have drying racks for

177
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:45,769
plant material because anything I grow

178
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,870
I'm gonna want to put back in the soil I

179
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:49,039
want to just take take take we have

180
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:51,800
different things for different purposes

181
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,150
like half my room gets put into a dry

182
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,740
room half my room we just put into dry

183
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:57,199
racks and put back into the room or into

184
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,660
a composting process and then that

185
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,599
compost now gets you know used into the

186
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,310
into the system so everything we use

187
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,689
everything cut down ends up getting back

188
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,839
into the soil the only thing doesn't go

189
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:11,050
back and so the bug that we sell so it's

190
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:13,669
people we do things like water catchment

191
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,740
so indoors we have the ability to

192
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,530
control our environment the sealed

193
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,180
environment so any water that we we put

194
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:23,629
into that room we have to remember

195
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,120
room with the humidification or HVAC

196
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:28,949
HVAC well we catch that water we reuse

197
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,800
that water yeah we have the filter and

198
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:34,350
purify it make sure that our coils are

199
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,410
copper not aluminum there's there's

200
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:38,310
there's things like that to make sure

201
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,630
you look into you don't want to be

202
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,879
dumping a bunch of heavy metals you guys

203
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:43,079
in California had that problem you only

204
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,300
be watering your plants a bunch of heavy

205
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:46,199
metal so there's definitely make sure

206
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,120
you have the right equipment to do that

207
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,770
but water captain's a big one you know

208
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,538
we're in the desert so one of the most

209
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:54,689
valuable resources in the desert is

210
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:56,279
water we have plenty of some and plenty

211
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:58,168
of that we don't have a lot of water so

212
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:00,269
that's one of the things I try to focus

213
00:07:58,168 --> 00:08:02,909
on the most I'd say right now we're

214
00:08:00,269 --> 00:08:05,370
probably capturing about reusing about

215
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,590
70% of water only taking about 30% from

216
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,090
the city when they did our water Kouts

217
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:11,728
we used about as much as the average

218
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:15,689
household to run 10,000 square-foot grow

219
00:08:11,728 --> 00:08:17,189
facility or residential household so

220
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:18,810
that was pretty cool and making that

221
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:20,098
they I think they thought something was

222
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,149
broken is why they actually sent the

223
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:22,379
people out there like this can't be

224
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:24,239
right you guys are stealing water kind

225
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,889
of thing I kind of had to explain to him

226
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,199
this whole mechanism how you can you

227
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:29,220
know you have water from air and it's

228
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:34,168
like yeah you never heard of rain like

229
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:35,580
it's this whole thing but uh but there's

230
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:37,559
often two ways like in like that I was

231
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,330
forced to go indoors I have a lot of

232
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,708
experience indoors but I looked at it I

233
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,240
didn't look at the negative side of that

234
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:44,069
look at the positive side I took those

235
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,690
challenges and I use them to make me

236
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,500
better not to limit my potential but to

237
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,600
make make me better

238
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,809
so indoors was just one of them the

239
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,110
microbial testing was one of them micro

240
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:56,609
boat testing is a huge challenge you

241
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,810
guys will pass that and grow a quality

242
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:00,180
product that's why so many people

243
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:02,519
struggle with pesticides and fungicides

244
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:04,859
because they don't have the ability to

245
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:07,559
grow in an environment that won't have

246
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:09,240
you know those pests those pathogens see

247
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:10,588
one you gotta be good at what you do to

248
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,629
get there but then you gotta understand

249
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:13,829
what it is that you're up against your

250
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:15,740
epic when you're when you're facing

251
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:17,509
biologicals

252
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,980
anaerobic microbes so make sure that

253
00:09:17,509 --> 00:09:21,200
you're not that's why I'm not a big fan

254
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,060
personally of KNF except I don't

255
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,379
thinking of works about thinking of

256
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:26,449
grows great but I've smoked great

257
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:28,370
breaking her bills KF is I don't think

258
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:30,980
Kaena who work in a commercial setting

259
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:32,720
or they have mold and yeast testing so

260
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,830
things like that just know what you're

261
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:39,019
up against as far as that goes but as

262
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:41,900
far as the regenitive stuff goes yeah

263
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:44,240
just it's just going green focusing on

264
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:46,309
using less again we use LEDs so our

265
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,370
power consumption indoors is you know

266
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:52,219
cut by 50% and things like that just

267
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:55,759
kind of just chasing that that goal that

268
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,350
that my goal as even an indoor farmer is

269
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:01,789
I want to be able to shut my front gate

270
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:03,379
and it's only to only just only be a

271
00:10:01,789 --> 00:10:04,969
pretty or sorry a producer and sell

272
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:06,860
stuff and I have to intake anything I

273
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,330
want to cash my own water I want to make

274
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,370
my own nutrients I want to grow my own

275
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,840
if I use our Falco cool on a girl

276
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:14,330
they'll feel the velvet right next to my

277
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,009
mind or grow if I need predatory bugs

278
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,110
cool I want to know how to make pirate

279
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:21,289
bugs I want to know how to make score

280
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,310
see my soror bring them populate them so

281
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:23,419
that that's the direction that we're

282
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:24,859
going is I want to be able to close my

283
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:26,089
front gate and not need anything from

284
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,550
anybody and just be able to apply

285
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:30,830
everybody with everything it's kind of

286
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:34,759
the goal and from my regenitive mindset

287
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:36,050
as a returning the farmer oh yeah it

288
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,939
goes further than that to obviously a

289
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:38,899
virgin in mine sake that also goes into

290
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,220
the community you wanna make sure that

291
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,899
you have a healthy community because

292
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:43,580
without a healthy community supporting

293
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:45,529
you you can't support your business so I

294
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,410
mean there's a whole there's definitely

295
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:49,909
layers to that question but for us

296
00:10:48,409 --> 00:10:52,459
that's the approach I took we have a

297
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:53,870
voice to have a stage I mean can't I'm

298
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,090
in the cannabis industry in Nevada

299
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,889
that's a huge stage for the world so I

300
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,600
thought hey if we could use cannabis if

301
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:03,649
cannabis is known as a gateway drug to

302
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,540
to fail yours and to heroin and rape and

303
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:08,029
all these things why can't be a gateway

304
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:11,259
drug to something positive to

305
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:13,759
permaculture to rajendran farming to

306
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:16,200
plant medicines and things like that so

307
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:20,309
try to flip the script and that's

308
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:26,370
and use it you know as a tool of picking

309
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:28,349
things up and up and down but yeah

310
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,528
so so we did that we chased that and

311
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:34,379
indoors in the desert we have our

312
00:11:31,528 --> 00:11:38,610
challenges in Nevada right now there's

313
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:41,220
there's probably 15 to centuries really

314
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:43,080
15 I mean there might be 20 brands but

315
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,959
there's really or 30 brands but there's

316
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,509
really like 15 ownership groups and

317
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,979
there's like 200 brands so again how do

318
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:52,470
you really separate your and they're

319
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,778
good like they're not all garbage I

320
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,649
assure you there's like there's 200

321
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:59,039
brands yes

322
00:11:55,649 --> 00:12:00,509
50% of them are probably a fish nowadays

323
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,250
but there's there's really some really

324
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:03,838
good guys out there they're grown it's

325
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,129
like how do you compete with that you

326
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,560
got people that got every strain in the

327
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:09,059
world now is out there for grabs so it's

328
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:10,979
not like oh I got the best oh gee you

329
00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:12,869
don't have it or I got the girls tell

330
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,120
the real girl stop cooking you don't or

331
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:16,830
the you know whatever it is wherever the

332
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,750
Mac one whatever that whatever it is

333
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:22,800
that you know you got they don't you

334
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,419
know everybody's got everything now

335
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,099
so how do you separate yourself you know

336
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:28,649
you again you gotta build a brand behind

337
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,649
something behind that people you don't

338
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:32,820
know never met will stand behind - so in

339
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:35,339
the regenerative movement is something

340
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:38,399
that if you don't stand behind it you

341
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:40,170
need to wake up and real quick and for

342
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,289
all of our sake because it's it's real I

343
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:44,939
mean we really need to start focusing on

344
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:46,439
I'm being more gentle more sustainable

345
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,120
and that's the thing too but we're

346
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,410
generally God first in order to be or

347
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,570
agenda you first have to be sustainable

348
00:12:49,409 --> 00:12:52,558
you can't just go straight to being

349
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,389
regenerative

350
00:12:52,558 --> 00:12:57,118
you have to first create a sustainable

351
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:58,818
business model is the first part to

352
00:12:57,119 --> 00:13:00,418
being a sustainable farm or a

353
00:12:58,818 --> 00:13:02,578
regenerative farm

354
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:03,629
so first the single business model make

355
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:05,158
sure that you can make money pay the

356
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:07,558
bills keep the lights on keep the pump

357
00:13:05,158 --> 00:13:09,389
pumping whatever the case may be and

358
00:13:07,558 --> 00:13:13,139
then you can start to work on that next

359
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:14,448
phase being or genitive I know people

360
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:17,188
kind of the word that used

361
00:13:14,448 --> 00:13:18,628
interchangeably a lot of times but I in

362
00:13:17,188 --> 00:13:20,548
my own mind I kind of separate them a

363
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:22,259
little bit sustainable or magenta have

364
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:25,198
two completely different things that

365
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:27,658
coexist with one another you can't have

366
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:29,818
one without the other in my mind but

367
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:31,048
anyways so yeah so that's kind of what

368
00:13:29,818 --> 00:13:32,878
we did in Nevada in a highly competitive

369
00:13:31,048 --> 00:13:35,458
market if we focus on our strengths we

370
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,649
focus on on on a quality plant where I

371
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:41,578
felt was right and we built our brand

372
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:44,308
around that I have a really good team we

373
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:46,558
have really good reputation for what we

374
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:48,808
do you can go to any dispensary and it's

375
00:13:46,558 --> 00:13:50,759
not just that hey they grow the best

376
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:52,348
weed it's like no those guys they they

377
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,269
grow the best weed their sales team

378
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:56,699
sells the best weed the delivery team is

379
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:59,158
always on point from from the front door

380
00:13:56,698 --> 00:14:00,928
to the back door we get compliments and

381
00:13:59,158 --> 00:14:02,578
that's really really important because

382
00:14:00,928 --> 00:14:04,198
at the end of the day one of the biggest

383
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:07,948
hang-ups you're than a half as a brand

384
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:10,408
as a as a as a business it is again is

385
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:12,298
is getting that sale so once you got to

386
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:13,259
get in the door of the dispensary and

387
00:14:12,298 --> 00:14:14,489
then you got to get out of the

388
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:17,308
dispensary someone's got to buy your

389
00:14:14,489 --> 00:14:18,509
weed so you can't just focus on the

390
00:14:17,308 --> 00:14:20,488
person buying you meat you got to focus

391
00:14:18,509 --> 00:14:22,019
on that person you know who's got a buy

392
00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:23,908
it from you that the the purchasing

393
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:26,249
manager so if you make your wheat hard

394
00:14:23,908 --> 00:14:27,778
to buy for the person who buys they're

395
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:28,918
not gonna buy weed from you you don't

396
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:30,298
seem like you think about it if you had

397
00:14:28,918 --> 00:14:31,978
a weed dealer and every time you call

398
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:33,448
them hey I'll be there in 20 minutes he

399
00:14:31,979 --> 00:14:35,309
shows up fucking three days later with

400
00:14:33,448 --> 00:14:36,598
with fucking the wrong thing and they're

401
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:39,088
looking for a different weed guy you

402
00:14:36,599 --> 00:14:40,649
know I guess it's just how it is so if

403
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:42,059
you're if your business isn't on point

404
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:44,249
it's in structured tour you're just

405
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:46,288
hitting those every every single thing

406
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:49,189
you just hit an on point you're not

407
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:49,188
going to be competitive

408
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,588
you
