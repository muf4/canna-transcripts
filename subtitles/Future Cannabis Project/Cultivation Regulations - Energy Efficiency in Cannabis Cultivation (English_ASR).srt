1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,109
[Music]

2
00:00:04,219 --> 00:00:10,620
if you can explain kind of conceptually

3
00:00:06,778 --> 00:00:13,919
that state by state regulations are put

4
00:00:10,619 --> 00:00:18,239
in place that address I guess energy

5
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:20,609
consumption which affects cultivators I

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:24,089
mean less outdoor but indoor in

7
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,820
greenhouse and then kind of what's going

8
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:29,309
on in different markets that you've seen

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,829
that's interesting that's making you

10
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:36,350
pull your hair out and then talk about

11
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:40,710
California specifically yeah so

12
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:44,820
Massachusetts just released its rules

13
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:48,329
related to how they will regulate energy

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,270
and carbon impacts of cannabis and

15
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,670
essentially Massachusetts has set the

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,670
model for how states are going to look

17
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,320
at these issues Massachusetts is the

18
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,989
number one state on energy efficiency

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,048
ranked 8 years in a row by an

20
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:07,140
organization called AC Triple E which

21
00:01:03,048 --> 00:01:08,969
looks at how states are adjusting their

22
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,569
responses to climate change and and

23
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:15,658
whatnot so Massachusetts is out in the

24
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:18,649
lead on this issue they have essentially

25
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,618
set lighting standards that are

26
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:25,140
equivalent to an energy code and

27
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:28,519
essentially clearly preferring LED

28
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,799
lighting technology they're also

29
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:34,978
collecting survey data from growers

30
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:40,400
about how they're using energy and water

31
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:43,349
and how much waste they're creating and

32
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,490
with that data that the thinking is that

33
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:50,419
they will inform targets that they may

34
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:55,769
set for increased efficiency over time

35
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:58,649
and so there the good news is that the

36
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:00,949
state isn't not just providing a heavy

37
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:05,040
hand of regulation it's also providing

38
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:08,098
some investments in resource innovation

39
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,050
Institute to help us reach out to

40
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,579
growers so they know how to report on

41
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,990
their inner

42
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:18,590
water and waste and so they can tap into

43
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:21,050
resources like best practices on how to

44
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:25,039
cultivate under LED lighting how to

45
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:28,450
operate HVAC more efficiently in both

46
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:32,120
indoor and greenhouse environments I

47
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:35,479
would say that for the most part outdoor

48
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,879
cultivation is as far as we've seen is

49
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:41,509
getting somewhat of a pass on these

50
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:44,870
regulations Illinois essentially just

51
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:50,060
copied what Massachusetts did added a

52
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:52,640
little more nuance to it and so we're

53
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:56,090
seeing replication happen now Illinois

54
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:59,689
also banned outdoor cultivation so

55
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:02,569
that's a different wrinkle on energy and

56
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:05,120
carbon impact and of course we've seen

57
00:03:02,569 --> 00:03:08,629
various local jurisdictions in many

58
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:13,459
states banned outdoor cultivation which

59
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:16,159
is not a smart decision for a number of

60
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:19,569
reasons economic development energy and

61
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,189
carbon impacts impact on the rest of the

62
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:24,169
utility ratepayers in the area who may

63
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:26,329
may have rates increased because of all

64
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:30,289
the new infrastructure that needs to be

65
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:33,260
built in to support these energy

66
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:35,120
intensive indoor facilities so we see a

67
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:37,810
wide range of things that governments

68
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,640
are doing I think what's important for

69
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:43,449
the cultivation community to understand

70
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,979
is that California is now in the game

71
00:03:43,449 --> 00:03:48,560
the California Energy Commission is

72
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:53,560
currently reviewing proposals through

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:57,170
its title 24 code proposal process

74
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:00,219
they're looking at establishing lighting

75
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:02,359
standards they're looking at

76
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:05,979
establishing efficient dehumidification

77
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:12,080
standards requirements on reuse of water

78
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:18,319
and environmental and requiring in

79
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:21,590
and irrigation controls and so there

80
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:24,550
there's a number of elements of

81
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:29,449
cultivation that will be impacted by

82
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:32,720
California's codes and they may apply to

83
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:37,459
every form of cultivation so even a

84
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,050
sun-grown grower that has generally very

85
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:43,129
little energy and carbon impact at least

86
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:47,240
in the flowering stage may be impacted

87
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:49,310
by these regulations and so it's

88
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,040
important that growers pay attention

89
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:56,000
it's important especially for the

90
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:58,580
cultivation community in California that

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,009
they engage in a stakeholder process and

92
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:04,849
that's what we at resource innovation

93
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:07,219
Institute are facilitating is ways for

94
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:10,700
the cultivation community to interact

95
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:14,180
with governments as governments set out

96
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:15,769
to regulate energy use and again what we

97
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,350
want we want what we want to do is

98
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:21,349
encourage governments to not just have a

99
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:24,770
heavy hand but to support cultivators

100
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:28,220
with good unbiased information that's

101
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:30,490
from experts who can help them learn how

102
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,320
to be more efficient with energy use

103
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,490
connect cultivators who are succeeding -

104
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:37,819
with cultivators who are having

105
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:40,519
challenges and just really expand the

106
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:44,180
knowledge base and the transfer of

107
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:45,859
knowledge throughout the industry so we

108
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,870
can raise the bar on best practices and

109
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,750
help everybody be more profitable and

110
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,910
then obviously make compliance with all

111
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,220
of these regulations a lot easier right

112
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:58,220
so just quickly does the California

113
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:01,430
Energy Commission currently is there

114
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:03,860
currently any regulation on the books or

115
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,930
is this like they have a blank slate and

116
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:08,360
they're about to institute something for

117
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:13,569
the first time and they're in the kind

118
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:16,160
of like like data gathering reaching out

119
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:20,209
to those who are going to be affected by

120
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,490
a process yeah California's energy Code

121
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:24,539
processes is generally a long process

122
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:26,790
it's generally a three year process

123
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,680
and we're still at the relatively early

124
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:33,240
stage of that so it's the perfect time

125
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,490
for people to get in and contribute

126
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,470
their ideas about what makes sense and

127
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,170
what's functional for motivation hi Lee

128
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:43,440
yeah this is the stakeholder engagement

129
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:46,009
process right now this is happening

130
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:50,250
right now over the next several months

131
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:53,539
this is when the state of California the

132
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:57,420
California Energy Commission is

133
00:06:53,540 --> 00:07:00,510
encouraging the industry to provide

134
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:03,600
input to code proposal writers who

135
00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:06,689
literally are wanting to go out and talk

136
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:10,830
to people and so we're helping the code

137
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:12,360
proposal writers for title 24 connect

138
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:14,009
with experts in the industry with

139
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,340
cultivators who have figured out how to

140
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:19,860
do things efficiently with LED lighting

141
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:23,389
manufacturers HVAC manufacturers HVAC

142
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:26,790
engineers lighting engineers utilities

143
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:29,279
everybody that can have can contribute

144
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:32,120
some understanding to what the

145
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:36,209
challenges are what the roadblocks are

146
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:40,370
where the easiest sort of low hanging

147
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:42,959
fruit is where the real savings are

148
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:46,370
where the real impacts on a business

149
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:48,180
model might be and so again it's it's

150
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,840
critically important that people get

151
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:55,379
involved now and in the the important

152
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,429
thing about California is not just that

153
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:58,159
it affects one of the largest

154
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,170
cultivation markets in the world

155
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,140
basically as California energy codes go

156
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:06,569
so go the rest of the world and so we

157
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:08,789
already have Massachusetts the number

158
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:12,180
one ranked state on energy efficiency

159
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:14,100
and we have California the number two

160
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,379
state usually on those rankings and

161
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:21,000
generally the most forward state on

162
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:23,279
carbon commitments and when we're

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,939
talking about just for clarification

164
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,259
it's not cannabis specific it's just

165
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:32,610
Massachusetts is an energy efficient

166
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:35,340
state across all industries or ya-ya-ya

167
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,629
Massachusetts yep correct I did not know

168
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,370
that

169
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:40,259
I always thought califor

170
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:43,019
he was leading the way but Massachusetts

171
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:46,080
is number one so so this process is

172
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:47,879
typically I mean is it like tip I mean

173
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,528
obviously it can be it can vary but is

174
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:51,299
it like a six month process like if

175
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:53,820
we're in February right now and they're

176
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:56,729
just starting the process there's the

177
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:59,490
listening period then they go draft some

178
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:02,580
proposals based on all the information

179
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,470
they've gathered then I assume they get

180
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:06,660
some public feedback and that's another

181
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:09,480
opportunity for cultivators to be like

182
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:12,329
oh my god like that's ridiculous I have

183
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:18,570
something to say about that yeah

184
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:20,910
there are draft proposals that are

185
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,140
already put forward on those subjects

186
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:24,899
that I talked about earlier the the

187
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:32,639
lighting standards and dehumidification

188
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:37,199
efficiency standards water reuse etc and

189
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:38,939
if if folks go to our blog page they can

190
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,620
get a link to everything they need to

191
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:45,600
know about the California codes and how

192
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,419
they can be involved in the process but

193
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,459
essentially the proposals are already

194
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:54,838
out there they're getting feedback right

195
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:57,449
now they do several iterations of larger

196
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:01,290
stakeholder engagement sessions that are

197
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:04,850
funded by the utilities in the state one

198
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:07,139
of those is coming up in April and then

199
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,850
they're they're gonna continue to refine

200
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:11,689
the proposals and then ultimately they

201
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:14,310
they get through a Energy Commission

202
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:16,470
review process and then approval and

203
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:19,889
then a rollout process to the market and

204
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:24,600
like I said it's it's still early enough

205
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:28,049
in the process that input is valued and

206
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,240
can impact what the outcome is if we

207
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:33,778
wait if the industry waits though too

208
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,730
too long to provide input the proposals

209
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:37,289
rolling a lot of people are giving input

210
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:40,019
and we just need to make sure the

211
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:42,750
cultivators are checking into this and I

212
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:44,778
know that the market is really

213
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,799
challenging in California in particular

214
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:49,610
everybody's really busy it's a

215
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:49,609
legislative session

216
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:56,359
challenges with taxes and a number of

217
00:10:52,549 --> 00:11:00,049
other things this is this is a critical

218
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,449
long-term business model consideration

219
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:05,469
and I am I'm just we want to make this

220
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:07,998
as easy as possible for cultivators to

221
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,309
engage in and that's why we're here

222
00:11:07,999 --> 00:11:12,170
we're a non-profit this is this is we

223
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:14,088
are trying to help the industry become

224
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:17,058
more efficient in the best ways that

225
00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:18,740
work for the industry right so so within

226
00:11:17,058 --> 00:11:21,198
those different buckets that you

227
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:24,730
mentioned lighting dehumidification

228
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:27,289
water reuse in the current draft

229
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,420
proposals is there anything in any of

230
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:33,620
those buckets that jumps out at you as

231
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:35,778
very concerning or very positive like

232
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,179
either they got something right from

233
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:40,039
your perspective or oh my god this is

234
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:42,828
gonna be devastating to a lot of people

235
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:47,240
I don't view California is doing

236
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:49,370
anything extreme I definitely see that

237
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,980
they are looking to Massachusetts in

238
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:55,068
Illinois and learning from some

239
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:58,159
challenges who have come up in those

240
00:11:55,068 --> 00:12:04,490
markets with the initial regulatory

241
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:06,708
rollout they are clearly very open to

242
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:08,120
getting stakeholder input and they're

243
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,659
creating a lot of opportunities for that

244
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,539
to happen

245
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:14,799
and so I've been impressed with the

246
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:18,438
process it's definitely the most

247
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:24,708
rigorous engagement process I've seen

248
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:27,318
from government on these issues and so I

249
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:33,979
think it's gonna come out as a pretty

250
00:12:27,318 --> 00:12:36,049
reasonable set of expectations but it's

251
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:41,028
important for cultivators to assess that

252
00:12:36,049 --> 00:12:42,919
and to assess it soon right I think when

253
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:45,558
we spoke before you had talked about

254
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:48,519
like I think lighting versus just kind

255
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:52,549
of overall energy footprint and how some

256
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:57,198
sometimes things are our regulations are

257
00:12:52,549 --> 00:13:00,500
drafted in a way that that that don't

258
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:02,628
lead to like if it's focused on one

259
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,169
thing let's say just lighting it doesn't

260
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:05,570
take into

261
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:13,278
account overall energy orbits focused on

262
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:15,290
a nut like examples of how certain

263
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,078
states or even countries around the

264
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:21,349
world are drafting things related to

265
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:23,569
lighting or energy that is maybe the

266
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,639
wrong way to approach it which will

267
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,410
which will lead to adverse outcomes in

268
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:32,419
terms of people not in here adhering to

269
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:35,740
the spirit of what the hope is but they

270
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:42,939
are adhering to the letter of it I guess

271
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:48,980
initial thinking that went into early

272
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:52,250
regulatory concepts essentially tried to

273
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:54,079
look at the way governments regulate

274
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:57,169
buildings that have humans in them and

275
00:13:54,078 --> 00:14:00,379
apply those standards to buildings that

276
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:03,139
have plants in them and for a variety of

277
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:07,578
reasons that doesn't work and it's it's

278
00:14:03,139 --> 00:14:09,919
it's not apples and apples and so that's

279
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:14,028
an example of can you give a concrete

280
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:18,769
example of something specific like they

281
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:20,448
had X in the regulations which if it

282
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:24,110
were humans would make sense but it's

283
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:29,359
plant so it doesn't make sense yeah so

284
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:30,709
one example is lighting standards in an

285
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,930
in an office building you would think

286
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:37,939
about watts per square foot and set a

287
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:40,129
limit on that in a grow environment it

288
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:42,100
isn't watts per square foot that's

289
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:46,159
necessarily going to drive efficiency

290
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:48,409
watts is a capacity of how much energy

291
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:51,649
can be delivered what you want to

292
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:54,588
measure is actually how efficiently is a

293
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:57,318
light fixture delivering the electricity

294
00:14:54,589 --> 00:15:00,380
that's required to stimulate effective

295
00:14:57,318 --> 00:15:02,419
plant growth and that's a whole new

296
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:06,350
measurement system that literally is not

297
00:15:02,419 --> 00:15:11,049
relevant to humans but it's critically

298
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:15,700
important to understanding how you can

299
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:18,549
think about producing a product with

300
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,670
less of an energy impact on a unit basis

301
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:23,799
so you know we are recommending

302
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:26,529
cultivators think about not just you

303
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:29,409
know grams for a lot as an example but

304
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:32,919
grams produced per kilowatt hour

305
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:35,110
consumed or kbtu which is really a

306
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:37,599
standardized way of looking at all

307
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:40,600
energy sources and that's the way we

308
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,950
need to be thinking about this that's

309
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,930
the way the tools that we're

310
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:46,770
establishing like our cannabis power

311
00:15:43,929 --> 00:15:49,029
score energy benchmarking tool are

312
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:50,860
measuring things that's what all of our

313
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:53,470
advisors are telling us the industry

314
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:56,320
needs to move toward those types of

315
00:15:53,470 --> 00:16:00,129
metrics and so we need to make sure that

316
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:04,480
governments are aligning the way that

317
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:07,059
they will evaluate energy performance to

318
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,960
what will work for a business model in

319
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:13,179
this industry and again if industry is

320
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:16,060
not involved governments will go down a

321
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:18,669
path that they think makes sense in the

322
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:21,639
absence of input and it will become law

323
00:16:18,669 --> 00:16:26,709
and and so we have a unique opportunity

324
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:30,519
right now as an industry to affect what

325
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:32,680
will be the likely consistent replicable

326
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:36,909
rollout of regulations throughout the

327
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:40,059
world so so taking the example you just

328
00:16:36,909 --> 00:16:41,949
gave of like watts per square foot is is

329
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:42,699
kind of like if humans were in the

330
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:46,960
building

331
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:51,040
if lighting regulations were drafted

332
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:53,680
that way what kind of actions would

333
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:56,589
cultivators take that would adhere to

334
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,419
the letter of the law but like not

335
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:01,960
really the spirit of the law or the

336
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:05,250
regulations like what's kind of the

337
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:10,769
adverse outcome of drafting regulations

338
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:14,559
measuring energy efficiency in that way

339
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:19,389
well okay so just as an example 36 watts

340
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:21,250
per square foot is is a number that's

341
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,709
out there that's being referred to by a

342
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:26,439
number of

343
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:30,620
government's somewhat arbitrary

344
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:33,980
definitely is looking at HPS lights and

345
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:36,589
how to graduate them out of the market

346
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:40,130
over time or at least the inefficient

347
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:43,038
ones and so you can think about you know

348
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:45,049
on a four by four fixture pattern you

349
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:47,720
know how many lights are over at square

350
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:50,569
feet of a canopy you would be in the

351
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:55,700
sixty plus watts per square foot range

352
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:57,710
at we using an HBS light you could you

353
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,620
could spread that one light fixture out

354
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:03,350
over a larger period or a larger space

355
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:06,678
like a five by six or a six by six

356
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:09,109
pattern you may not get as much of the

357
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:11,269
light that you want coming from those

358
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:13,069
HBS lights to stimulate growth if

359
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:16,970
they're spread out over more of the

360
00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:19,908
canopy and so you might be meeting the

361
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:23,058
law but you might be impacting your

362
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:26,299
production and so we it's really

363
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:30,288
important how government's right the

364
00:18:26,298 --> 00:18:34,418
little nuance of what metric they're

365
00:18:30,288 --> 00:18:40,009
using to evaluate performance right and

366
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:44,600
so photon efficacy the ability of the

367
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:46,519
light fixture to deliver that the light

368
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:49,819
that the plant needs for growth is just

369
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:53,019
a much more functional way to evaluate

370
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:56,000
performance and and it accounts for

371
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:58,700
generally all forms of lighting

372
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,710
it's definitely pushing toward the

373
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:05,450
fixtures like LED and others that are

374
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:09,710
performing at a higher micro mole per

375
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:11,450
Joule performance level and looking at

376
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,120
organizations like the design lights

377
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,130
consortium which is third-party

378
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:20,298
verifying manufacturer claims on

379
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:24,350
performance and and supporting the

380
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:29,359
market in those directions that that was

381
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:31,699
a great concrete example do you have one

382
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:35,629
in either dehumidification or water

383
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:38,840
reuse like an example of regulations RIT

384
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:41,420
in a way that's not really a right fit

385
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:44,889
like a you know square peg round hole

386
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:48,620
fit rather than a square peg square hole

387
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:50,630
in a grow environment there there is

388
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:53,179
there are so many there are so many

389
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:55,280
systems that are kind of fighting each

390
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:58,820
other the the heat from the lights is

391
00:19:55,279 --> 00:20:00,889
fighting the cooling systems and there's

392
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:05,079
just a lot of energy thrown at the

393
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:08,840
production process that is inefficient

394
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:11,000
but also basically the entire supply

395
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:14,539
chain and nearly every cultivator I

396
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,690
talked to nobody knows exactly how to

397
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:20,149
optimize these systems so that you're

398
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:23,720
driving the most plant growth for the

399
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:25,340
least energy input and that's because we

400
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:28,460
need more data we need this is all

401
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:30,379
relatively new I mean obviously cannabis

402
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:34,100
cultivation and indoor facilities is not

403
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:36,080
new but governments and utilities and

404
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:42,759
others being Everman involvement in that

405
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:45,409
process is new yeah well at least energy

406
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:47,960
energy departments of governments being

407
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:51,310
involved in in cannabis cultivation is

408
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:54,200
is new and so everybody's got to learn

409
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:55,960
and and what we need is more data I mean

410
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,000
literally everybody needs more data

411
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:59,720
cultivators need more data investors

412
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,869
need more data

413
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,920
utilities governments and so what's

414
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:09,549
important is that again the utility gets

415
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:14,000
involved in these conversations so that

416
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:17,509
governments don't set arbitrary numbers

417
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,089
on desired performance that cultivators

418
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:22,190
must meet in the absence of actually

419
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:25,189
knowing if those targets are

420
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:29,330
appropriative right or achievable or at

421
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:32,920
what cost and so we need to we need to

422
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:35,509
join together as an entire supply chain

423
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:38,410
lighting manufacturers HVAC engineers

424
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:42,740
etc architects contractors

425
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:44,300
cultivators and inform the process or at

426
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,920
least you know and that's again that's

427
00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:46,970
what we've been working on is a way to

428
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,250
standardize

429
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:52,308
is the data collection so we're actually

430
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:54,440
have all the data points that can when

431
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:57,740
disaggregated we can actually understand

432
00:21:54,440 --> 00:22:00,650
how much does a watering rate or the

433
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:04,308
soil and media that's being used affect

434
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:08,900
the dehumidification energy that is

435
00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:11,389
needed in this building or this grow

436
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,940
environment in this climate zone right

437
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:16,059
those are those are examples of the data

438
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,830
points that are needed to really unpack

439
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:22,908
how to optimize efficiency in

440
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:24,740
cultivation environments and you know

441
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:26,780
it's a little cart before the horse to

442
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:30,048
be setting extreme targets in a

443
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:33,288
regulatory construct when we don't know

444
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:36,500
how to optimize efficiency in

445
00:22:33,288 --> 00:22:38,808
cultivation yet right so so we just need

446
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,298
to be very thoughtful and ensure that

447
00:22:38,808 --> 00:22:44,808
everybody involved is thoughtful right

448
00:22:41,298 --> 00:22:47,179
now so as somebody who I kind of view as

449
00:22:44,808 --> 00:22:51,319
like a hummingbird going around from

450
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:55,940
grower to grower wearing the hat of you

451
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:59,329
know energy efficiency I know when we

452
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:01,220
spoke a year ago Jesse Peters was kind

453
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:03,619
of held up as an example of somebody

454
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,808
who's brought kind of is is the

455
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:08,319
measurement cost per pound of indoor

456
00:23:05,808 --> 00:23:11,710
cultivation was that kind of what he was

457
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:15,079
crushing or doing a really good job of

458
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:17,090
yeah cost per pound of cultivation yeah

459
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:22,220
and what did he get the cost per pound

460
00:23:17,089 --> 00:23:28,548
down to Jesse Peter is that at one point

461
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:31,970
was audited to be producing at $189 a

462
00:23:28,548 --> 00:23:35,240
pound was the number he was quoting in

463
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:41,150
an in a vertical stacked highly

464
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:46,548
automated LED lit indoor facility in in

465
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:48,650
the Willamette Valley of Oregon and that

466
00:23:46,548 --> 00:23:49,849
that's definitely the lowest cost of

467
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,950
production I've seen in an indoor

468
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:53,619
environment and he believes it could be

469
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:58,210
cut in half

470
00:23:53,619 --> 00:24:00,308
as far as I can tell basically every

471
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:04,150
cultivation environment out there can

472
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:07,750
probably save 50% on energy indoor

473
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:10,870
greenhouse outdoor you know again

474
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:13,778
sun-grown obviously in the flowering

475
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:15,819
stage is not using energy but you know

476
00:24:13,778 --> 00:24:20,048
that they're still using lighting still

477
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:23,079
using HVAC and drying and curing and as

478
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:25,929
far as I can tell most people can save a

479
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:30,069
lot on energy because we just need to

480
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:32,048
learn how to adopt best practices at a

481
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:35,230
higher rate throughout the industry and

482
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:38,019
and that's the type of community we're

483
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,970
building and RI is people to to share

484
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:41,579
that information and and again raise the

485
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:44,500
bar in the industry so that we can all

486
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:46,480
figure out how to be more profitable and

487
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:50,619
have a lower carbon footprint and be a

488
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,808
good responsible market actor right so

489
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:58,629
so just with some some concrete examples

490
00:24:52,808 --> 00:25:01,960
again so two questions one what are some

491
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:04,480
low-hanging fruit in terms of just

492
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,179
things that you've seen that people can

493
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:10,440
do that don't take much time and effort

494
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:13,570
that lead to a marginally dramatic

495
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:18,058
reduction in energy usage and then part

496
00:25:13,569 --> 00:25:20,769
two is who are the innovators and and/or

497
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:23,230
have you seen anything in the past

498
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:26,950
couple months that's kind of blown your

499
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:28,870
mind of oh my god that's genius in terms

500
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:32,558
of energy efficiency that somebody's

501
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:34,599
done I think I think the basic place

502
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:36,339
where everybody should start is just get

503
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:39,699
a handle and how much energy they are

504
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:42,609
using and how does that compare to their

505
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:45,028
class of cultivation in their climate

506
00:25:42,609 --> 00:25:47,379
zone in their preferred method

507
00:25:45,028 --> 00:25:49,898
indoor/outdoor greenhouse even within

508
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:53,890
greenhouse you know as what kind of

509
00:25:49,898 --> 00:25:55,509
greenhouse is it and you know it's the

510
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:59,259
old adage right what gets measured gets

511
00:25:55,509 --> 00:26:01,148
done right so really understanding where

512
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:04,148
your baseline is of current performance

513
00:26:01,148 --> 00:26:06,409
is critical and once you get a handle on

514
00:26:04,148 --> 00:26:09,649
that then you can figure out for

515
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:12,050
where to where to chip away that's why

516
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:15,410
we created the cannabis power score as a

517
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:17,419
standardized way to measure energy as a

518
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:22,970
function of how much cultivation output

519
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:24,560
you're providing from there you know at

520
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:28,700
the end of the day this is this is

521
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:31,279
largely lighting and HVAC and it's

522
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:34,069
really about how what type of lighting

523
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,930
you're using and then how you're

524
00:26:34,069 --> 00:26:37,789
adjusting the set points on your

525
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,500
environmental controls through your HVAC

526
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:44,389
systems and whatnot how you're

527
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:46,970
automating and you know it's I would say

528
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:49,790
there's not really a silver bullet it's

529
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:53,809
really like you have to pick what we say

530
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:56,779
is you know tweak and peak right make

531
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:59,599
some adjustments understand what it how

532
00:26:56,779 --> 00:27:05,119
it impacted you and and then continue to

533
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:07,129
refine from there yeah and you know

534
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,769
again we just released two best

535
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:14,690
practices guide it's one one on LED

536
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:17,299
lighting and one on HVAC and these are

537
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:22,820
chock-full of good peer reviewed

538
00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:24,980
information and what every again

539
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:27,289
cultivator architect manufacturer

540
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,630
engineer the folks who are involved in

541
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:33,019
this from throughout the industry

542
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:34,420
basically all we're saying let's make

543
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:37,250
sure we're talking the same language

544
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:40,370
let's make sure we understand the terms

545
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:42,529
as they should be defined let's make

546
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:46,250
sure we understand how to measure ppfd

547
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:48,920
correctly with a with a meter let's make

548
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,960
sure that we think about having

549
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:54,289
independent commissioning done of

550
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,079
buildings after all the equipment is

551
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:58,730
installed so that you know you don't

552
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:00,109
just hear from your engineer who

553
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,710
designed the space that everything's

554
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:02,539
good

555
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:05,299
you actually have somebody independent

556
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:07,069
come in and and value you validate that

557
00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:10,369
everything is going to operate the way

558
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:14,960
that you are being told so it you know

559
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:16,909
it really starts with deciding to who's

560
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,650
on your team who's on your construction

561
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:20,680
or your red

562
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:23,950
team and making sure you have a good set

563
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:27,250
of people surrounding you and and

564
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:30,519
challenging each other and then and then

565
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:32,529
moving forward from there right so so

566
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:34,690
just that last question something you've

567
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:37,029
seen in the past couple months that or

568
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:40,210
even the past year or whatever that is

569
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:43,210
just kind of an innovation that that

570
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:48,819
blew your mind I think what we're seeing

571
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:51,039
in the market is some evolution of

572
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:53,019
technologies that are beginning to talk

573
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,579
to each other and work with each other I

574
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:57,549
think we're gonna see a lot around the

575
00:28:54,579 --> 00:29:02,139
automation space like smart controllers

576
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:04,480
kind of yeah and and where lighting

577
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,970
systems are talking to HVAC systems and

578
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,769
and they're actually functioning well

579
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:11,110
together

580
00:29:07,769 --> 00:29:14,529
things like that I think we're gonna see

581
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:20,409
in the marketplace soon and and that

582
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:22,839
actually begin to appear as well as you

583
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:27,130
know connections to renewable resources

584
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:30,399
of energy and just using energy more

585
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:33,970
creatively right more more more

586
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,860
dynamically throughout the system I will

587
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:38,980
I want to throw out something else and

588
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:41,199
that is and this is important work we're

589
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:46,809
hearing at least in some markets in some

590
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:50,680
climate zones that greenhouses appear to

591
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:55,960
be using when when you standardize to a

592
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:57,490
BTU level and you know a common unit of

593
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,680
energy across all sources of energy

594
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:04,420
propane natural gas electricity whatnot

595
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:08,080
greenhouses appear to be in some cases

596
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:10,509
using as much energy as a warehouse and

597
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:13,389
so there's a lot to learn there there's

598
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:16,660
a lot to understand how to make

599
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:18,280
greenhouses more efficiently and I just

600
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,740
really want to make sure everybody

601
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:24,250
understands these codes and regulations

602
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:26,940
that are continuing to come out and in

603
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,869
particular in California they are

604
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:32,410
addressing

605
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:34,659
warehouses and greenhouses and like I

606
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:36,970
said some stages of cultivation that

607
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:40,960
will be relevant to even sun-grown

608
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:44,140
producers so it's it's it's an entire

609
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,850
industry issue we all need to get

610
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:49,030
involved and we all can do so much

611
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:50,589
better and thrive together but we got to

612
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:53,170
work together on these issues and we got

613
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:55,329
to do it now and that's that's why we're

614
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:57,519
here that's what we're here to do and

615
00:30:55,329 --> 00:30:58,929
that's actually a surprising finding I

616
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,549
think most people would be taken by it

617
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:04,450
or that would take them by surprise

618
00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:08,039
is there anybody doing some interest in

619
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:11,230
kind of distributed power like local

620
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:16,509
generation whether solar panels wind

621
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:18,930
algae biofuel something else that is is

622
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:22,390
crushing their energy consumption or

623
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:25,029
their need for the grid basically yeah

624
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:27,580
well I'm seeing I think the state of

625
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:31,509
Colorado just announced the partnership

626
00:31:27,579 --> 00:31:33,519
between some cultivators and some

627
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:36,940
brewery operations where they're

628
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:39,250
actually exchanging co2 so the brewery

629
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:43,150
has co2 too that they don't want and

630
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:45,849
they're essentially sharing it with the

631
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:48,970
cultivation community in a way that's

632
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:50,859
bringing everybody's costs down and

633
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,779
obviously lowering the carbon footprint

634
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:54,849
that's awesome I mean the cannabis

635
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:58,539
industry can do so much to partner with

636
00:31:54,849 --> 00:32:01,000
other industries and also can learn from

637
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:03,220
the broader world of agriculture which

638
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,920
we are part of not everybody wants to

639
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:08,350
believe that but or accept that but it

640
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:11,759
is true and you know there's so much

641
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:15,730
that cannabis cultivators can teach on

642
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:18,579
regenerative AG and there's also other

643
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:21,400
things we can learn from like big

644
00:32:18,579 --> 00:32:24,339
vertical warehouses in you know dense

645
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,410
urban environments that are doing co2

646
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:27,759
recapture from a nearby facility and

647
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:30,490
just literally piping it from that

648
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:34,500
facility right into the facility growing

649
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:37,079
lettuce or basil so we just need to I

650
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,190
think open our minds collaborate and

651
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:41,619
work on these issues together

652
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:44,019
and I think we'll see a lot of positive

653
00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:44,949
returns great all right well Derek I

654
00:32:44,019 --> 00:32:49,089
appreciate it

655
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:51,250
I appreciate you Peter and I'll see you

656
00:32:49,089 --> 00:32:54,209
in a couple weeks down in San Diego

657
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:54,210
right on
