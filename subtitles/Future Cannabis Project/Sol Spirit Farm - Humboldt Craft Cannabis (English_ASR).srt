and so

36
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,040
i sat down read the growers guide from

37
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,280
cover to cover and went to the hardware

38
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,400
store and bought some lights and classic

39
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,879

40
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,880
hardware store at that point yeah

41
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:24,239
not in baton rouge louisiana yeah uh not

42
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:26,239

00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,519
into a single housing and yeah yeah

46
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,920
definitely

47
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,239

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,000
in a jar like it was

49
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,879
just luckily i would save some seeds at

50
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,759
one point and that experience of taking

51
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,000
that

52
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,599

i we have a permaculture background uh

89
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,158
took some courses

90
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,878
previous to even buying land and that

91
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:07,840
helped with the search of like okay we

92
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:09,359
need some good sunlight we need you know

93
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,039
be efficient you know with things right

94
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,480
we have two wheel drive access to our

95
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:16,158
farm we have uh gravity water we have

96
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,878
you know yeah all these little things

97
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,560
that make it a pretty good little spot

98
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,560
and um

99
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,799
so we've been like i said practicing

100
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,280
no-till for 20 years in this in this one

101
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,840
area where we're farming the cannabis

102
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,479
there and just working on

103
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,519
reducing our inputs the whole time never

104
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,719
have

105
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,239
never have brought in the heavy

106
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:40,639
equipment and and you know flattened or

107
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,878
or graded or anything so we're in the

108
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,878
true native soil yeah it's a true

109
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,479
permaculture-like experience i've been

110
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,878
following you guys for a while now and

111
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:51,679
you guys really are a shining example

112
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,518
for this model of permaculture type

113
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,920
systems you guys are dragonfly earth

114
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,438
medicine certified is that right yes

115
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,878
and sun and earth certified yeah i mean

116
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,560
because you guys are the one farm that i

117
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,840
know of that actually uses animal

118
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,239
husbandry is sort of connected with

119
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,239
the cult the the farming practices that

120
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,799
i in willow creek

121
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,080
is one of the few that do that so i i

122
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,239
agree

123
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,560
it's definitely not not the uh everyday

124
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,720
farm yeah we do we do try and you know

125
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,120
like i said everything we can to reduce

126
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,520
those inputs and all the ways we uh

127
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,519
gather some leaves out of our forest and

128
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,039
you know right now we have these uh this

129
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,680
problem with um

130
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,160
too much small brush and trees in our

131
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,879
forest uh from previous logging and and

132
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,479
bad management and so using that

133
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,040
material to

134
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,240
build our soil and so then we don't have

135
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
to go out

136
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,478
to

137
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,239
you know somewhere else to you guys in

138
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,159
mulch yeah yeah

139
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,040
heavy heavy mulch heavy multi yeah yeah

140
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,960
yeah heavy mulching is is one of my

141
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,960
main you guys have like a chipper i've

142
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,439
always struggled with like large-scale

143
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:58,159
mulching right now and and uh you know

144
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:01,038
so previous to having good access to a

145
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,039
chipper we used a lot of the forest leaf

146
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,680
and stuff like that and uh you know we

147
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,120
would buy some organic rice straw or

148
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,120
something like that or whatever to

149
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,600
supplement just you know trying to buy

150
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,399
things from local locally produced but

151
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,960
um

152
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,439
we now uh are working with the the

153
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,198
willow creek fire safe council oh and

154
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,000
chip in yeah so i have access to their

155
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,680
chip

156
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,680
oh my god so yeah i'm using that to uh

157
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,600
to help out with the forest area around

158
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,879
us and at the meantime we get to win

159
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,560
when we put some of those chips on our

160
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:35,038
own i think you know

161
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,319
actually we both ended up in humble

162
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,959
originally

163
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,319
as environmental activists like when we

164
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,959
first

165
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,079
came through it was right during redwood

166
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,478
summer and there was a lot of uh

167
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:52,319
activism direct action going on trying

168
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:54,800
to save the old growth redwoods and so

169
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,800
once we kind of decided that we wanted a

170
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,360
homestead of our own i mean that's the

171
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,319
perspective that we came to this all

172
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,160
from

173
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,000
that's our background and what's

174
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,560
important to us is is living sustainably

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,319
working in concert with the land and

176
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,319
that is also how we go about

177
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,240
farming cannabis because it is

178
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:19,280
ultimately the most important thing

179
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,160
that's an expression of our activism is

180
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:24,559
is this farm this homestead and all that

181
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,240
and to be able to share that with people

182
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,478
is super important to us because i'm

183
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,360
slowing the flowers it's not it's not

184
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:33,918
about hiding anything it's it's about

185
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,000
like let's let's be regenerative yeah

186
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,639
let's um let's build this let's

187
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,639
sequester carbon as much as we can and

188
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,680
you know make it different so you talked

189
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,038
about using mulch and and leaf

190
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,240
from the forest you guys have any other

191
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,879
interesting

192
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,199
methodologies that you uh work with you

193
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,879
know i mean i don't know we're dabbling

194
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,720
in a little this and a little that for

195
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,639
sure and trying trying to find you know

196
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,479
what is what is the most regenerative

197
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,478
we're working with you know so those

198
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,318
those mulch piles uh

199
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,719
naturally give us those indigenous

200
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,319
microorganisms right we can put that

201
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,479
pile of uh wood chips in the forest and

202
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,479
and use it like a rice box oh sure it's

203
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,318
like imo right right right right now

204
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:16,800
it's your own version of it right so

205
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,879
instead of doing that rice all that well

206
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,319
i have a couple of yards of

207
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,000
over here and a couple of yards over

208
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,560
here and a couple years over there just

209
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,079
scaled up right and so then i can just

210
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,720
mix those chips in and then we can

211
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:31,279
spread those out and now we would use an

212
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,759
imo on our thing and

213
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,679
do you have any um opinion do you know

214
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,759
if any types of wood work better do you

215
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,639
have like hardwoods that work better so

216
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,800
i mean for me it's what's local is super

217
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,360
important right and

218
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,038
you do want you know i don't think it

219
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,520
wouldn't be good to be all

220
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:51,918
um like doug fur yeah right that would

221
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,359
be a little bit much probably but as a

222
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:54,639
little bit for a little bit of pine in

223
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,240
there but you know as long as you can

224
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,240
let it sit for a while

225
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,079
and and let it start decomposing let

226
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,038
that mycelium start running through that

227
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:02,800
pile

228
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,120
it's really not too much of a problem

229
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,439
and if you can chip in the leaves with

230
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,000
it then that helps with that you know

231
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,560
and not be such a because it's carbon so

232
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,199
it's it's acts like a carbon filter and

233
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,360
it grabs onto things right and so at

234
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,720
first it can lock up some nutrients if

235
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,360
it is just

236
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,039
wood chips but this is whole tree chips

237
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,400
and brush and all that right already

238
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:28,079
pre-decomposing well and then so then

239
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,359
yeah we run it through with all those

240
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:31,758
material and then yeah then let it

241
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,519
pre-decompose some and then that really

242
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,519
you know yeah that gets it all going

243
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,639
yeah and and it really makes it so that

244
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,959
their

245
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,240
any of those problems should should you

246
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,679
know yeah let your nose know that that's

247
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,240
you know that's that's going to smell

248
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,199
that pile and make sure it it's got that

249
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,519
you know earthy yummy smell right

250
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,680
yeah if it smells super pungent like a

251
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,159
crazy walnut whatever sort of or you

252
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,639
know i'd be a little wary of that you

253
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:59,519
know but and then if you mix it too you

254
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:02,159
know so our we have you know when we're

255
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,039
mulching those trees it's madrone it's

256
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:07,360
doug fur it's tan oak it's all that

257
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,958
and you know yeah and it all it all

258
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,639
becomes good love in a while that's

259
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,278
amazing that's really interesting thanks

260
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:15,838
for that info that's amazing um

261
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,360
so as far as you know they always say

262
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,279
that growing is half the battle and

263
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,959
harvesting and drying is

264
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,958
another half of the battle for

265
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,958
preservation do you guys have any

266
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,639
you know have you have you dialed that

267
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,399
in do you have any you know techniques

268
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,399
you like to for your flowers that make

269
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,958
your flowers well so we do a couple of

270
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,320
things i think that help for sure is one

271
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,879
thing is we're

272
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,000
we're all right there on site close by

273
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,879
so the

274
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,399
there's no hauling totes of weed halfway

275
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,879
across the country or whatever in the

276
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,440
back of a truck um

277
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:50,720
it's just hand carried to the drying

278
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,800
room and so that reduces impacts and all

279
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,560
that i like to not feel overfill my you

280
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,879
know just be careful and appreciative of

281
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,799
it i always cringe when i see the

282
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,639
people on top of a ladder throwing their

283
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,879
nuggets down into a bin i'm like no no

284
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,958
no there's trichomes on there you know

285
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,519
let's let's keep those right because to

286
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,359
me it's it's all sacred medicine and i

287
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,120
don't have like

288
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,560
the special jar here and here that's

289
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,200
what i'm gonna save for myself and or

290
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,879
what no it's all special it's all you

291
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,640
know and so i want to treat it all that

292
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:22,639
way so yeah like we do that we

293
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,720
we do light depth and so that gives us

294
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,519
the ability to stagger our harvest

295
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,920
and so that gives us the ability to dry

296
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,839
for a little longer dry cure you know

297
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,519
take that and slow that process down

298
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,760
yeah that's that's what we do nice too

299
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,720
often just a nice low temp and all that

300
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:41,360
i think is is super key to not

301
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,040
losing your terpenes and that's i mean

302
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,759
that's one of the

303
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:49,120
major differences too as far as like if

304
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:51,439
you're talking craft cannabis versus

305
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,240
mass produced is someone who's trying to

306
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:57,200
squeeze every little bit of profit out

307
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,039
of it is gonna speed those processes up

308
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,759
and ultimately

309
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:04,480
things are lost when you do that so to

310
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,200
really create craft cannabis you take

311
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,720
your time you wait it's like well does

312
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,278
this cultivar take you know 10 days in

313
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,839
the drying room to be at its fullest

314
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:18,000
expression or you know is it

315
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,000
you know maybe it's 12 maybe one year

316
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,600
even the same thing is 10 days but the

317
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,240
next year something's different and now

318
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,639
it's but you have you can't you have to

319
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,759
do what you're doing based on what the

320
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,720
plant

321
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:33,278
is doing you can't have it sunset

322
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,519
regimen in your head or on paper and be

323
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:38,720
like forcing your will upon the whole

324
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,560
system it's about listening and smelling

325
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,720
and using your senses to figure out when

326
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,518
something's ready and go in with that

327
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,360
right and letting those plants finish

328
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,839
yes all good things to those who might

329
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,839
be in a hurry to you know harvest that

330
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,680
because you know oh

331
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,440
you know you gotta kind of wait that's

332
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,799
right well speaking of waiting we've

333
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,959
been waiting i've been waiting to check

334
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,639
out some of these flowers here

335
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,559
can we see what the three samples are

336
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,919
you brought yeah we brought this soul

337
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,599
shine which

338
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,919
i think it's a

339
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,839
it's a pretty special uh

340
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,759
really

341
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,639
refreshing um pretty loud yeah yeah it's

342
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:17,360
a terpenoline dominant which is a one of

343
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,200
the rare uh terpenes to have dominant in

344
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,278
your in your flower and a little bit

345
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,120
like a train wreck

346
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:24,879
right yeah which is true

347
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,440
yeah yeah train wreck

348
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,039
yeah jack it's got that sort of yeah

349
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,160
some of those characteristics to it

350
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,919
which

351
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,639
a lot of people think of as pining but

352
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,919
it's it's another terpene that is in a

353
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,240
pine tree

354
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,159
so it does have that that piney right

355
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,240
love all the pine turtles yeah so it

356
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,319
doesn't have much pinene but it had had

357
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,839
a really good amount of terpenoline and

358
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,600
and uh well-rounded um

359
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,920
i know it's like not the proper term to

360
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,639
use anymore but indica or sativa right

361
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:57,599
right right it's sativa it's activating

362
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,600
yes yes yes it's a good good breakfast

363
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,680
focus like you got to go to that meeting

364
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,759
and and maintain your focus but it's

365
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,559
also still potent it uh

366
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,000
it tests well amazing yeah

367
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,319
amazing product

368
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,360
all right let's see round two round two

369
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,278
well

370
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,159
this one here came out just

371
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,799
just glorious uh looked amazing as the

372
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,679
white rice the white runts yeah

373
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:24,319
nice nose on it uh just really special

374
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,519
all together i was really impressed with

375
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,600
with that

376
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,919
plant all together now yeah i've been

377
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,360
hearing some really good things about it

378
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,078
yeah i've been breeding with it a little

379
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,399
bit

380
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,879
yeah it's a good set of genetics yeah no

381
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,759
it worked it worked but we ran the other

382
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,600
the

383
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,759
ones without the white in front of it

384
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,879
just right right just right i think it's

385
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,958
all the same parent just different

386
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,399
phenos of the same uh correct yeah

387
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,638
that's what i

388
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,240
know it is i like this pinot better yeah

389
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,799
it worked better for our yeah you can

390
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,240
tell it's a beautiful flower oh yeah

391
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,078
like you've got some permanent and it

392
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,240
checks all the boxes this is a good one

393
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:00,719
for converting people who think they

394
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,120
only like indoor right right i mean this

395
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,879
looks like yeah no and that's always one

396
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,839
one of my favorite things to do is to go

397
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:10,320
down to a place like la and pop jars out

398
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,160
and be able to you know show people once

399
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,680
they come out oh man really fire indoor

400
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,039
i'm like no no

401
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:16,879
you might have been buying it as indoor

402
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,078
for the last 20 years but it's not check

403
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,679
the technique

404
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,919
i love that about kind of the like

405
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,359
regenerative cannabis and permaculture

406
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,919
community they just

407
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,360
they produce quality of flowers that are

408
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,360
really comparable to some really

409
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,720
high-grade cannabis and it's just all

410
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,959
about the

411
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,199
the biology i believe

412
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:38,159
the highest grade i mean there's nowhere

413
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:40,559
you're going to get you know um

414
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:43,198
three three per less percent terpenes

415
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,799
and all that without the sun and the

416
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,879
earth now that's one i haven't smelled

417
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,399
in a while headband yeah yeah i think i

418
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,399
grew it like 10 years ago and i just

419
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,759
haven't seen it around very right now i

420
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,000
haven't been around it that's one of the

421
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,600
things too is we liked you know for me

422
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,480
more important than

423
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,920
that thc number is well how is it how's

424
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,360
the effect

425
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,439
yeah right because i found that that

426
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,039
doesn't correlate very well with the thc

427
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,240
number that's one that doesn't tend to

428
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:10,240
test over 20 even so it's hardly

429
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,799
marketable right but yeah you tell

430
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,560
people headband and like yeah that's the

431
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:17,198
that's the jar that gets hit the hardest

432
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,799
at the at the emerald cup vents or

433
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,278
something like that right because oh my

434
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,039
gosh you know and and it does it's you

435
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:24,720
know it smells amazing

436
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:26,319
you know what terpenes these are this is

437
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,720
dominant in i believe that's

438
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,000
caryophyllene dominant yeah it's the

439
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,879
it's that

440
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,159
yeah to me it it really kind of reminds

441
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,000
me of uh

442
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,679
an oil refinery

443
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,240
we lived in louisiana right for a little

444
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,559
bit yeah yeah he's got that let's go oh

445
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,159
my gosh talk about gasps

446
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:45,439
yeah i know it's a classic i love the

447
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,679
headband and

448
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,519
the og well and it's important for

449
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:54,159
people to keep the classics growing yeah

450
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,360
right because if we don't if we lose all

451
00:15:54,159 --> 00:16:00,078
the stuff that tests you know around

452
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,720
20 or even lower

453
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,479
it will be gone you know and we may

454
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,639
discover like oh wow there was

455
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,800
properties in that that

456
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,079
healed crohn's disease or something who

457
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,639
knows yes

458
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,439
we'll lose it right if we get so focused

459
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,120
on

460
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,279
these high thc producing cultivars that

461
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,959
that there is a risk you know and and

462
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,399
it's so tempting to go down that road

463
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,359
like well if they all finished in eight

464
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,159
weeks

465
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,919
right yeah well but then you're limited

466
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,639
to

467
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:33,679
right and that doesn't yeah that doesn't

468
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,919
that doesn't please me

469
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,479
right i'm you know i'm not pleased i'm

470
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,879
that daytime activating sativa you know

471
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,199
i'm farming i'm working i i want to be

472
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,720
awake and focused uh i don't find i need

473
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:46,879
that knockout

474
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,959
variety except to knock myself out at

475
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,519
the end of the day maybe right yeah and

476
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,758
so i do mostly smoke you know like a

477
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,839
sour diesel is another we grew and i

478
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,600
just love it and you know i came out you

479
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,639
know close to four percent terps and

480
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,680
just

481
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,000
you know

482
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:04,159
super fire and you know like that's

483
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,160
that's but it takes a long time to

484
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,600
flower and so it's not on very many

485
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,120
menus now i didn't bring that you guys

486
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,838
want to talk about where you can find

487
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,958
your products or is that yeah

488
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:16,558
not right right well you know it's uh

489
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,558
that's a challenge we're trying to get

490
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,798
out into more more stores for sure

491
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:22,720
that's always uh as a heart hard thing

492
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:25,039
is without a page marketing but

493
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,759
sebastian poole yeah um they have

494
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:30,000
[Music]

495
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,440
maybe not all of these in particular but

496
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,440
they have several of our different

497
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,720
cultivars and they're a really huge

498
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,240
supporter of small regions

499
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,558
so they're amazing amazing yeah so

500
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,079
support that those types of businesses

501
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,399
is what we need to spend our money with

502
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:47,439
yeah yeah because the retailers who are

503
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,200
going out of their way to support small

504
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,320
regenerative farms

505
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,960
if people go and support them then maybe

506
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,678
others will think oh you know that is

507
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,558
actually like a it's worthwhile for me

508
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,280
to

509
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:03,839
create space on my shelves for these

510
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:06,879
types absolutely flowers you know yeah a

511
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:09,038
great place uh down in the la area we

512
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,120
have a sesame that's really just yeah

513
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:14,079
the sesame creek collection collective

514
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:16,798
in ojai they're probably on sun grown

515
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,839
regenerative flower and and uh have

516
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,960
created

517
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:24,159
because that's what we found is if if uh

518
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,120
if we can get that retailer

519
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,960
to put in a little bit of that education

520
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:32,239
and when that person comes in and says

521
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,960
well what do you have that's 500 thc

522
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,120
you know you're like hey well can we can

523
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,360
we talk about that a little bit like

524
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,558
because in our experience you know

525
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,798
that's not

526
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,960
the number that matters we've had some

527
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,639
really good flour that doesn't test high

528
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,960
for sure yeah i'm trying and i would

529
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,840
prefer it usually over you know

530
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,038
something that's test really high but is

531
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,199
is uh

532
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,038
less of a broad spectrum right because

533
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,558
when we're focusing on any one thing

534
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,240
we're going to lose some of the some of

535
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,000
the rest of that yeah there's this like

536
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,400
you know for lack of a better term

537
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,119
entourage effect exactly loosely coined

538
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,640
but has a lot of interplay dynamics with

539
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,199
all of the combination of all the

540
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,280
secondary metabolites right so if you

541
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,080
get a story a little that'll help uh

542
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,798
help

543
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:19,199
you know with that narration then

544
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,960
you know we do great that sounds like a

545
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,558
great push for the industry yeah

546
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,558
terpenes over thc is the new

547
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,038
you know and also

548
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,919
you know

549
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,720
for

550
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,679
the customer who is looking for

551
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,919
earth conscious flower you know people

552
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,038
who go out of their way to buy organic

553
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,038
food or spend a little bit more money on

554
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:45,919
something that's fair trade

555
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,640
those are the people that are looking

556
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,120
for

557
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,038
flour like ours right and and really for

558
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,839
flour like everybody in the willow creek

559
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:56,400
cannabis alliance because that is

560
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:59,599
the difference definitely ultimately

561
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,519
between what we're offering and what you

562
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:04,719
might get from

563
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:06,319
a 100 acre farm somewhere in

564
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,120
a place that has a lot of other

565
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:11,359
industrial agriculture with risks of

566
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,158
you know all sorts of pesticide drift

567
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:13,199
and

568
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,280
you know

569
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,960
all sorts of stuff like that and so you

570
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,960
know we just think it's really important

571
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,200
that

572
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,798
farms like ours

573
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,120
are able to remain in the market

574
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,440
because there are people that want it

575
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:32,079
it's just unfortunately sometimes they

576
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,919
don't know that it's even an option

577
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:37,279
and so it's great that i need that

578
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,559
education able to you know provide

579
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:42,480
content like this you know that

580
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,079
helps people find out

581
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,480
that it's an option that it's a choice

582
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,678
that they have that's a great look and

583
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,200
you know there's probably you guys just

584
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,360
said like a dozen different things that

585
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,279
we could spin off but

586
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,959
i guess the final question would be if

587
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,440
there's one thing in the industry you

588
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,240
could see changed either regarding you

589
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,519
know like education or regulations what

590
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,038
do you think like the most important

591
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,359
thing would be that you'd like to see

592
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:07,519
changed if you had to pick one

593
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,599
to pick one it would because it's a big

594
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,480
one it would be the tax

595
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:15,038
because that is

596
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,919
creating just a chain

597
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:20,480
reaction of problems

598
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,480
if because we don't have those economies

599
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,240
of scale that those giant farms have all

600
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,360
of our little costs are a little bit

601
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,919
higher

602
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:30,479
and then that all gets taxed and then

603
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,240
taxed again and then taxed again and up

604
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,038
to seven or something different times

605
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,440
that that's getting taxed or more even

606
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,720
and to where and then that gets to the

607
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,200
retailer

608
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,640
who then you know has to make their

609
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,720
margin too

610
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,038
and so

611
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,679
our little difference in price keeps

612
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,558
getting amplified and amplified and so

613
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,080
what

614
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:54,798
what we're looking at in the current

615
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:56,399
market situation that the tax is

616
00:21:54,798 --> 00:22:00,639
completely out of control

617
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,640
and it is crippling the entire industry

618
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,799
i hate to call it industry but whatever

619
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,759
it's it's crippling us as the farmer is

620
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:10,480
crippling the wholesaler or the

621
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,798
transportation it's the whole

622
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,200
there's no margins because the

623
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:18,319
government is taking such a huge cut

624
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,640
they're taking so many slices that it

625
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:23,119
adds up so they had that event yesterday

626
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,720
at in sacramento i didn't i didn't

627
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:26,959
follow it too closely but it was you

628
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,079
know to repeal the taxes to repeal the

629
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,519
cultivation tax and then also to give

630
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:36,079
the equity farmer uh sorry equity

631
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,679
retailers equity retailers a break on

632
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,480
the uh

633
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:43,600
the 15 state excise taxes do you think

634
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,679
newsom's gonna follow through with uh

635
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:46,719
uh you know he's a politician and and

636
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,960
following through isn't there

637
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,640
necessarily their specialty but he's

638
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,519
definitely made some

639
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,919
some

640
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,158
noises in that proper direction and we

641
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,759
can just we have to keep up the pressure

642
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,600
yes and

643
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:04,879
let let them know because it really like

644
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,839
so much tax on anything is going to

645
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,760
direct people to going

646
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,199
elsewhere and elsewhere is the

647
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:14,158
traditional black market whatever you

648
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,519
want to call it the old market

649
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,679
and

650
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,759
and that's you know crippling the legal

651
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,960
market and then and then you know to

652
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:25,279
have our prices be just so high

653
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,240
really really prevents people from being

654
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:30,000
able to get access good medicine

655
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,319
if i had one thing i would change i

656
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,880
would be i know it's a pipe dream but

657
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:38,480
direct to consumers and i agree with you

658
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,960
because so we operate a little bud and

659
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,759
breakfast at our farm in the summers

660
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,640
and right now i cannot

661
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:48,640
sell

662
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,840
our own cannabis to our guests

663
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,799
and

664
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:54,798
if you think about the vineyard model

665
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:57,119
and like the wine tasting model which is

666
00:23:54,798 --> 00:24:00,720
a huge tourism

667
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:02,319
boon for napa and other counties and

668
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,960
you know

669
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,599
it is odd to me that the government is

670
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,840
fine with people drinking alcohol

671
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:12,879
basically driving turning around

672
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:15,918
right and it's okay for those vendors to

673
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,799
directly sell bottles of wine

674
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,240
to the people that come for those things

675
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:23,038
and yet i

676
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,519
cannot do that when somebody comes to

677
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:28,558
stay at our farm for sure i would have

678
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:30,158
to actually have my flower you know it

679
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:31,918
leaves the farm and it goes to the

680
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,559
distributor which currently our

681
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,880
distributor is in southern california

682
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:37,839
they would then package it down in long

683
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,159
beach

684
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,918
and then if i want it

685
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,159
to be able to

686
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,000
have it access for my guests i would

687
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,960
actually have to then get it shipped

688
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,159
back to a retail location

689
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,038
nearby

690
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:56,320
and i would have to have my guest

691
00:24:53,038 --> 00:25:01,158
go to that retail location to get it

692
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:01,158
what it's just a supply chain fiat

693
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,278
and so yes i totally agree with you the

694
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,679
direct to consumer sales and i think

695
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:10,798
that they should allow some amount of

696
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,000
on-farm sales sure as well that would be

697
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:13,599
amazing

698
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,640
this is great and people want that

699
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:16,240
experience

700
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,000
yeah they do they're looking for it i

701
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,240
know there's all sorts of things popping

702
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,599
up with that um farm you know farm

703
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,880
visits and

704
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,199
it's really cool you guys are doing that

705
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,000
so the people that have stayed have had

706
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,159
this

707
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,440
amazing time it's really been it's been

708
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,120
yeah we don't even really talk about

709
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,880
that i mean might as well just plug that

710
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,918
really quick you guys do

711
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,320
offer this service right this glance

712
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,120
well i mean one of our whole original

713
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:43,678
reasons for settling on this particular

714
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:46,079
piece of property was that we wanted to

715
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:49,440
be able to introduce people to

716
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:51,519
permaculture and natural building and

717
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,400
you know just sustainable living in

718
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:56,720
general and so it's fun now that they

719
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,038
can come and we have the cannabis

720
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:01,759
growing on site as well and so it opens

721
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,919
it up to a whole other

722
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:05,519
group of people who maybe they actually

723
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,960
think that they're just coming because

724
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,960
they like weed

725
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,558
and then they find out like oh wow

726
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,720
actually look at all this other cool

727
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,359
stuff going on and i do think that

728
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,200
sometimes it like sparks a little

729
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:20,079
a little change little spider little and

730
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,360
then you know shift and yeah which is

731
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:22,798
sort of what we're doing that's what

732
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:24,959
