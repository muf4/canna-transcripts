1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,928
so it sounds like you use cover crops

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,819
yeah oh yeah oh you have other life

3
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:07,679
growing it's not just a lone soldier

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:08,429
standing out there by themselves oh yeah

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:10,138
I have

6
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:14,480
okay I'm gonna lay it on you my system

7
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:19,140
you're gonna love this it's it's a a

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:22,050
scaleable high production no-till micro

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:26,789
remediated subterranean full-spectrum

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:31,670
light depth bio retention pit technique

11
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,670
yes that's what we've been missing

12
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:36,210
that's like that's beautiful I know what

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,700
that mean you know what that means you

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,439
know you know that knew the layers upon

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,270
layers of life took a while to realize

16
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:46,859
even realize that's what I was doing

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,870
because I've always been doing that

18
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,539
technique honestly since the beginning

19
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:54,149
when I learned some science after living

20
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,710
it for 15 years I'm like oh my god

21
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,109
that's what that's called I didn't even

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,250
know I was doing no-till for 12 years

23
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,250
but I'm doing it
