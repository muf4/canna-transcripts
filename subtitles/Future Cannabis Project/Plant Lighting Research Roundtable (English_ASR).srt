2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,910
an associate professor at McGill

3
00:00:09,689 --> 00:00:13,739
University I specialized in controlled

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,419
environment agriculture I have a bunch

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,368
of pretty pictures on the side there so

6
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:18,809
basically anything to do with controlled

7
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:20,670
environment from a greenhouse all the

8
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:22,799
way to NASA based stuff I've done work

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,080
on I like showing my farm that I grew up

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,219
on because I come from a flat land area

11
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,320
right there

12
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:30,689
so it's rural agriculture in Western

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,099
Canada if anybody's into ice hockey then

14
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,558
that's what we play there predominantly

15
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,779
and it it drives everything background

16
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:39,119
for solar energy most people have

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,520
probably seen this predominantly we have

18
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,289
the solar output of the Sun which is the

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,059
big tall red line that we see on top

20
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:47,369
here and then we have a little bit of UV

21
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:49,078
light that's being produced if we go to

22
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:50,640
the other side we have our far red and

23
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,549
our infrared that's all being kicked out

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,320
on this side the atmosphere has a habit

25
00:00:53,549 --> 00:00:56,669
of breaking up or absorbing some of

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,469
these wavelengths and so you can see the

27
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:00,359
actual spectrum that are being absorbed

28
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:01,829
along this the part that I always find

29
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,870
interesting when I look at this slide is

30
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,540
that the human eye and plants both

31
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:08,099
evolved to absorb and utilize the

32
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,420
primary wavelengths of light that are

33
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:10,618
coming out of the Sun so it's the vast

34
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:12,750
majority of the light that's actually

35
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:14,430
coming to us and it's where majority of

36
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,200
that light energy is being produced from

37
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:17,759
that and it's within the same spectrum

38
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,368
so human eye and plants are fairly

39
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,009
similar and they evolved independently

40
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:24,540
as far as we know and so from this

41
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,509
perspective we have to be aware that

42
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,040
there is differences from this this way

43
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:30,569
but it is also something there is

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,049
similarities so we can tie through those

45
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:35,548
things over the history of humanity we

46
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,530
found different ways to actually produce

47
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,180
light solar beam the background that

48
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,939
everybody's aware of and then we also

49
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,899
have come up with different systems

50
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:44,279
ultimately as you look at this you can

51
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,409
see that none of these actual mirror

52
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,790
that solar light spectrum that's up top

53
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:49,439
but we also have our cool like

54
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,030
fluorescents which are a lot more peaky

55
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,129
so a little individual Peaks here and

56
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,689
they're more in the blue wavelengths a

57
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:56,158
little bit through the green area and

58
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,798
then our high-pressure sodium which is

59
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,439
the industry standard for most people

60
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,579
predominantly in the I call it amber but

61
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,218
between the orange and the yellow

62
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:06,779
spectrum of light incandescent which is

63
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:08,859
one of our first lighting fixtures that

64
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,409
we have metal halides and then our

65
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:12,910
LEDs I'm one of these guys that actually

66
00:02:11,409 --> 00:02:14,650
thinks low pressure sodium should

67
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:16,180
actually come back at some point I see

68
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,189
some fun stuff on this and we are doing

69
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,050
some research on this people ignored it

70
00:02:18,189 --> 00:02:21,789
NASA did one research project and said

71
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,380
it could be useful and then everybody's

72
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:25,389
ignored it ever since but I actually

73
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:27,159
think it has applications and at some

74
00:02:25,389 --> 00:02:31,659
point I'll start ranting in great length

75
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:32,919
about why I believe that but the coolest

76
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:35,109
thing that's happened in the last while

77
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:37,059
is LEDs have come on to the field and

78
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,040
the part that's fun is that they're very

79
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,979
nectar narrow-spectrum they produce a

80
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,299
lot of a lot of light and they're one of

81
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:44,649
the more efficient systems that are out

82
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,630
there and you can see that the fairly

83
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,730
narrow spectrum out of this up until

84
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:50,799
this point most of them were 50 to 100

85
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:52,000
nanometer type width and in these cases

86
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,770
they're sitting down in that twenty nine

87
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,539
a meter width so fairly narrow light

88
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,340
spectrum and so we can actually start

89
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:59,620
tailoring different colors specifically

90
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,729
for growing plants one of the challenges

91
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,469
that we're playing with and I'll talk

92
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:04,780
about later on is that this is at 20

93
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:06,129
nanometers can we narrow it down farther

94
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:07,870
and what's the impact that we can do

95
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:10,180
could we ever make a one nanometer base

96
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,950
light and actually see what the impact

97
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,750
of that that's why I talked about low

98
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:17,079
pressure sodium it is a narrower light

99
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:19,810
source then the LED systems that we have

100
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,150
there so these are the most of the LEDs

101
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:23,799
that we have on the market you can see

102
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,989
that we go all the way from the UV range

103
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,060
on this side all the way over to the far

104
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:29,890
red infrared in some cases on this side

105
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,780
and then we have this area in between

106
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:33,458
one of the parts that I find interesting

107
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,469
is this area where everybody talks about

108
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:37,390
the green gap personally I think we kind

109
00:03:35,469 --> 00:03:39,370
of ignore it's not as serious of the

110
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:41,109
effect for plant growth as people think

111
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,789
it is it's purely because we cheat and

112
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,470
we do the PC amber so the phosphorus

113
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,669
coated amber like production and we

114
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:47,319
still get light across the whole

115
00:03:45,669 --> 00:03:48,819
spectrum the place that I have my

116
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,310
biggest issue is actually right here in

117
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:53,079
that 680 - 700 I can't seem to find la

118
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:56,110
le d-- lights that produce efficiently

119
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,760
or actually at all in that space and I

120
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,650
need them to finish off some of my

121
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,689
research so if anybody knows lights in

122
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:03,340
the 680 to the 700 range I'm more than

123
00:04:01,689 --> 00:04:06,789
willing to chat with you because I need

124
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,890
them the basis of light and

125
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:11,259
photosynthesis basically is driven by

126
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:12,879
the principles of pigment absorption so

127
00:04:11,259 --> 00:04:14,560
we have chlorophyll a chlorophyll B and

128
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,930
our carotenoids and so we've actually

129
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,519
tailored around these things these

130
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,560
pigments to actually determine our

131
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,988
photosynthetic efficiency and how do we

132
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,598
can

133
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:25,370
we set this up but McCree back in the

134
00:04:23,598 --> 00:04:26,659
day so there's plenty of people before

135
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,970
McCree that actually worried about

136
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,380
photosynthesis mercury is the one that's

137
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:32,270
become the standard if we actually

138
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:33,649
overlay what happened with the pigments

139
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:35,029
with this we can see that the

140
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:37,250
chlorophyll a and B kind of line up

141
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:39,469
reasonably well between 400 and 500 and

142
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:40,970
between 600 and 700 is also our

143
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:42,949
chlorophyll but there's this big gap

144
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:45,139
between 500 and 600 where there is no

145
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:47,060
pigment absorption that we believe is

146
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:48,560
driving photosynthesis but yet we

147
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,959
actually get a fairly good activity I

148
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,089
like playing in that five nine five the

149
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:55,068
amber light and I will rant about that

150
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:58,698
quite a bit next yeah in two days from

151
00:04:55,069 --> 00:05:00,889
now it's kind of a final thing since you

152
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:02,509
are all here human eyes did evolve to

153
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:04,280
actually measure light our problem is

154
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:05,960
that we're actually we were really good

155
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,788
at measuring green light so the primary

156
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:09,620
responses of a green light and we're

157
00:05:07,788 --> 00:05:11,180
poor in the red in the blue spectrum and

158
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,709
so people come to me and say I have

159
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,449
plenty of light within my greenhouse or

160
00:05:12,709 --> 00:05:15,829
in my controlled environment space and

161
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:17,329
like did you measure it with a sensor

162
00:05:15,829 --> 00:05:18,469
and they're like no I can see it and I'm

163
00:05:17,329 --> 00:05:20,269
like no you didn't you just looked at

164
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,650
green light and you have no real ability

165
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:22,969
to understand the blue or the far red

166
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:24,560
and that's where plants do a lot of

167
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,990
photosynthetic activity out of this one

168
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,759
and then ultimately we have our high

169
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,069
pressure sodium space on this space

170
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,169
which is actually has become the

171
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:34,610
industry standard and so if you overlay

172
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:36,319
that with that green line which is the

173
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,000
Makri curve that I showed you before as

174
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,038
I'm showing there the high pressure

175
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,709
sodium seems to be hanging out in that

176
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:44,180
amber wavelength space and it seems to

177
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:45,769
be the industry standard well it is the

178
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,658
industry standard and it's the place

179
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:49,490
that I find the most interesting because

180
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:51,288
ultimately plant pigments don't have a

181
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,900
good absorption capacity within that

182
00:05:51,288 --> 00:05:56,329
space but yet plants grow really really

183
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:57,769
really well with it and so we have a lot

184
00:05:56,329 --> 00:06:00,408
of questions that we're going to have

185
00:05:57,769 --> 00:06:01,519
understood on this one so more in-depth

186
00:06:00,408 --> 00:06:03,560
understanding of our different

187
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,209
wavelengths photosystem one photosystem

188
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,069
two and our different pigments and the

189
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:09,408
mercury and how all these things

190
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:10,819
actually drive this so that's a really

191
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:12,288
quick overview of the basics of

192
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:14,210
photosynthesis at least from a light

193
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:15,800
perspective and wavelengths that we play

194
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:17,568
with we have to be aware that high

195
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,430
pressure sodium is the industry standard

196
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:21,348
and so as such everything has to be

197
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,090
compared to that and so I hope that

198
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:25,399
these guys will all check with it from

199
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:27,739
that perspective so the first speaker is

200
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:30,588
actually going to be Dave Holley he's

201
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,538
works for fluence his exact title is the

202
00:06:30,588 --> 00:06:33,759
senior scientist I believe you just got

203
00:06:32,538 --> 00:06:35,829
that a little while

204
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,899
it's been from the beginning okay

205
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:42,310
because it was added on to your LinkedIn

206
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:44,079
account I saw so yes I wondered if he

207
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,959
was ever a junior scientist before that

208
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,550
point so and then we have two others

209
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:52,269
that will be coming up after him which

210
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:54,850
is Neil dirge it died Gertz was working

211
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:58,659
on out and so he's at solo too he's

212
00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:00,639
based here in San Diego and so he'll be

213
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,660
talking about some of the systems and as

214
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,490
you walk down the hallway you can

215
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:07,960
actually see that and then the one that

216
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:13,509
I worked on is Cindy Rajan hmm let's see

217
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:15,969
moot moot yeah okay okay and so he's

218
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:17,889
gonna be talking about the biomimicry of

219
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:19,240
light and I'm actually really interested

220
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:20,620
in that I understand the other two

221
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,079
slightly but this is the one that I

222
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,699
looking forward to alright so I'm a

223
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:27,339
little bit jealous for this talk that my

224
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:30,490
name isn't Sun because nothing is more

225
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:32,619
appropriate than that I think so once

226
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,610
again my name is Dave Holly and I am the

227
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,788
senior scientist at fluence

228
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,050
bioengineering and yeah it's been senior

229
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:40,269
scientists the whole time but then again

230
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:43,389
haven't we all been junior scientists at

231
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:46,060
one point in life mark in some ways I

232
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:47,650
definitely still feel that way so the

233
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,519
intent for me today if you're not first

234
00:07:47,649 --> 00:07:50,769
of all if you're not familiar with

235
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:53,019
fluence we are a horticultural lighting

236
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:55,509
company of course and we sell primarily

237
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:57,399
broad-spectrum light in an LED form

238
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:59,620
factor we're very present in the

239
00:07:57,399 --> 00:08:01,000
cannabis market worldwide and

240
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,829
increasingly so in commercial

241
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,870
agriculture so if you imagine like fine

242
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:07,209
crop leafy greens berries things like

243
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,439
that that's where we're putting a lot of

244
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:12,638
our efforts now especially on the

245
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:15,969
research side now mark gave a really

246
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,280
efficient talk on light spectrum and

247
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:19,539
absorption and pigments and things it's

248
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:21,279
almost as though you've done it once or

249
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:24,159
twice before mark but I'm going to

250
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:25,538
expand a little bit more and go just a

251
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,939
little bit slower because I know this is

252
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:30,639
this is not a myth kind of a wide array

253
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:32,500
of backgrounds and so it could be

254
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,769
helpful to kind of set the stage for the

255
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:39,158
rest of the conference so when we're

256
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:41,110
talking about optimizing light quality

257
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:43,479
for plant development from an LED stamp

258
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,980
standpoint we're really talking about

259
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,540
three pillars of plant development so

260
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,070
this can be yield and that

261
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:50,349
drives most of the market whether it's

262
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,120
cannabis or leafy greens or vine crop or

263
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,860
anything else mostly people care about

264
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,110
yield then we're talking about

265
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,940
morphology people want certain canopy

266
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,528
architectures for various reasons and

267
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,380
finally we're talking about plant

268
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:04,448
quality and in the case of cannabis that

269
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:06,458
means plant secondary metabolism so

270
00:09:04,448 --> 00:09:07,838
cannabinoids terpenes things like that

271
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:09,219
and it can mean different things and

272
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,769
different crops like in berries it might

273
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:14,259
mean sugar content and tomato it might

274
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:15,669
mean oh I don't know it could mean sugar

275
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:17,490
content again it could also mean things

276
00:09:15,669 --> 00:09:20,469
like lycopene for a coloration in flavor

277
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:23,318
so if we dive into these three pillars

278
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:25,060
right yield morphology and secondary

279
00:09:23,318 --> 00:09:26,338
metabolism we can look at how light

280
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:29,789
affects each one of these things

281
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:32,290
starting with yield yield really means

282
00:09:29,789 --> 00:09:34,149
photosynthesis it just means taking co2

283
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:36,818
from the air and turning it into plant

284
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:39,970
stuff right and sometimes you get the

285
00:09:36,818 --> 00:09:41,649
good plant stuff that can be leaves if

286
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,730
your lettuce it can be cannabis but if

287
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:45,039
you're in that industry it can mean

288
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:48,100
tomato fruit but it just means turning

289
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:49,689
co2 into plant stuff so how does this

290
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:52,028
work well there are these three steps

291
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,860
and once again I'll try to do this in

292
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:55,269
kind of a depth that's appropriate for

293
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,889
this group but we've got the light

294
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:58,328
reactions and then there's some

295
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:00,068
chemistry and then there's the dark

296
00:09:58,328 --> 00:10:03,399
reactions that actually captures the co2

297
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:04,448
so if we dive into these steps first

298
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,730
we're gonna be looking at light

299
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:09,578
absorption and this is really where we

300
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:12,339
are playing most of the time ultimately

301
00:10:09,578 --> 00:10:14,409
what you see here is a light harvesting

302
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:15,790
complex and we have these green dots

303
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:17,139
that represent chlorophyll we have the

304
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:18,698
yellow and the red and the orange dots

305
00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:21,190
that represent these secondary pigments

306
00:10:18,698 --> 00:10:23,169
so like Mark said chlorophyll really

307
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:25,360
good at absorbing light between the sort

308
00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:27,578
of 4 to 500 nanometer region and the 6

309
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,289
to 700 nanometer region or in other

310
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:32,289
words red and blue light that's how we

311
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:34,599
all understand it and then there's this

312
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:36,129
big gap kind of between five and six

313
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,480
hundred and we're all kind of guessing

314
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:39,519
with our best understanding of how all

315
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,350
of this works but as we understand it

316
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,659
right now we do have these secondary

317
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:46,509
pigments like alpha carotene beta

318
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:48,039
carotene lycopene these all fall in this

319
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:49,209
category of carotenoids and there are

320
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:51,490
some other related ones called

321
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:53,078
xanthophylls but we think that these

322
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,339
compounds fill in that gap a little bit

323
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:56,500
and essentially they're going to absorb

324
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:58,720
light in that region pass it over to

325
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:00,129
chlorophyll a bunch of things happen

326
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,710
water gets split

327
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:04,960
hydrogen gets liberated and it powers a

328
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:08,800
bunch of full chemical kind of machinery

329
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:11,800
and plants grow mm-hmm and of course if

330
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,879
you look at this last graph here this is

331
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:14,589
actually what light absorption looks

332
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,269
like in a whole leaf right so the first

333
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:18,040
two graphs are showing light absorption

334
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:19,779
if you just isolate these compounds in

335
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:21,279
solution and then shine some light on it

336
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,809
and see what happens if you actually

337
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,829
look at a whole leaf though you get

338
00:11:22,809 --> 00:11:27,039
something that looks a little bit like

339
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:28,509
this last graph and rather than kind of

340
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,149
doing a deep dive through each one of

341
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:33,159
these little points out is that the

342
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:35,259
yellow line which is kind of the one

343
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:37,179
that dips down the most it's

344
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:39,370
representing your isolated sort of

345
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:42,009
photosynthetic pigments your green line

346
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,019
is showing what a whole leaf whole

347
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:47,139
intact leave is actually absorbing what

348
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:49,149
you see is that again like Mark said the

349
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,740
plant does absorb light more or less

350
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:52,090
across the spectrum it does dip down a

351
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,490
little bit and that's why it looks green

352
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:57,129
but the plant is capturing full-spectrum

353
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,570
light this is the part where I say a

354
00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:00,129
little bit of chemistry happens all of

355
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,970
that stuff that we just looked at in the

356
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:05,769
previous cartoon is that first ps2

357
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:10,180
molecule does this have a laser pointer

358
00:12:05,769 --> 00:12:12,699
on it very good so right here this guy

359
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:14,349
were talking about ps2 and again there's

360
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,150
a lot of other stuff happening here but

361
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,790
essentially all of those compounds we

362
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:20,889
just talked about exist in here it

363
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:22,449
captures that light it splits water it

364
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:25,750
liberates this hydrogen molecule and

365
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:28,960
this hydrogen proton powers this protein

366
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,340
that makes ATP right so really what

367
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,139
we're doing here is we're tuning light

368
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,149
energy into biochemical energy and

369
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:36,399
ultimately what we end up with is NADPH

370
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:38,439
and ATP and these are very energetic

371
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,409
biochemical molecules it goes on to do

372
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,000
other stuff so this is where we get into

373
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:44,769
the dark reactions of photosynthesis

374
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,600
once again probably review for a lot of

375
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:48,429
you but this is where we take that co2

376
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,460
from the air and turn it into the plant

377
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:53,349
stuff so we have co2 from the air and

378
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:55,180
then we have these energetic molecules

379
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:59,110
that I just talked about and ultimately

380
00:12:55,179 --> 00:13:01,659
they reduce co2 to make glucose or sugar

381
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,519
and this sugar goes on to do a whole

382
00:13:01,659 --> 00:13:04,990
bunch of other biochemical processes but

383
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,549
this is really your primary metabolism

384
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,960
and actually from this point forward a

385
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:09,919
lot of what happens is really similar to

386
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,019
what happens in animal cells

387
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,899
you have mitochondria you have cellular

388
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:18,379
respiration and so on so that is

389
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:21,230
ultimately the first pillar of how we

390
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:23,389
optimize light for plant production

391
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,800
right focusing on yields turning co2

392
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:26,629
into plant stuff

393
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,219
the next pillar I'll move through these

394
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:29,299
very quickly because I'm sure again

395
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,329
we're going to talk about it a lot these

396
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:33,620
two today but essentially when we talk

397
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:34,519
about plant morphology we were really

398
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,009
talking about utilizing different

399
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,328
wavelengths of light to get a canopy

400
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:39,379
architecture that might be appealing for

401
00:13:38,328 --> 00:13:42,349
a whole bunch of different reasons and

402
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:45,470
in very broad strokes short wavelengths

403
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:46,730
generally means short plants the shorter

404
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,670
the wavelength you get kind of a more

405
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,899
compact plant usually thicker leaves

406
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:52,099
often a little bit more robust and as

407
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:53,720
you move across the spectrum towards

408
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,250
longer wavelengths you get a longer

409
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,100
plant you get a cell expansion and you

410
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:01,250
get intranet expansion and so on so UVA

411
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,560
and blue you get really similar things

412
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,089
you get increased pigmentation it's kind

413
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:07,069
of like the plant getting a suntan just

414
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:09,050
like if we go outside and we hang out in

415
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,250
a bunch UV light we get a 10 the plants

416
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:13,338
doing the same thing its defending

417
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,990
itself from high-energy photons green a

418
00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:16,399
little bit less morphologically

419
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:17,720
impactful but a lot of people are saying

420
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,549
now that you can induce a lot of the

421
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,199
same sort of physiological responses

422
00:14:19,549 --> 00:14:23,208
with green light as you would get a far

423
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,948
red light so again it's sort of telling

424
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,539
the plant that it's in the shade and it

425
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:30,139
should stretch out and try to get into

426
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:32,208
more intense light red really good at

427
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:34,250
driving photosynthesis but again cell

428
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:37,009
expansion generally increased leaf area

429
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,179
but maybe a less robust plant overall

430
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:40,338
than if you had a higher kind of blue

431
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:41,539
content not saying Reds bad by any means

432
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:43,459
I'm just saying it's a little bit

433
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:45,169
different and far-red is kind of the

434
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:47,268
really extreme example of that one when

435
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:48,500
a plant is in pharr red light it thinks

436
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:49,970
it's in the shade and it wants to

437
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,559
stretch out and get out of that shade

438
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,660
and get into some brighter sunlight just

439
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:57,078
so it has more photons available to

440
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:59,328
drive yield last but not least we're

441
00:14:57,078 --> 00:15:01,039
talking about plant quality and I'm

442
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:02,149
going to use this biochemical pathway is

443
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,409
a really good example of this because

444
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:06,259
it's very relevant to the cannabis space

445
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:07,399
and indoor agriculture in general right

446
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:08,958
so when we're talking about plant

447
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,089
quality we are talking about secondary

448
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:13,099
metabolism and I just want to point out

449
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:15,550
a couple of things right now so this

450
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,209
pathway that you're looking at or is

451
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:18,559
representing a few things it's

452
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:20,299
representing the biosynthesis of

453
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,399
carotenoids and that's what you see in

454
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:23,539
the the pinkish color towards the bottom

455
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,669
right

456
00:15:23,539 --> 00:15:27,349
alpha carotene and beta-carotene and you

457
00:15:25,669 --> 00:15:29,179
remember I mentioned these a little bit

458
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,800
earlier as the compounds that kind of

459
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:33,258
fill in some of that gap in the middle

460
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,149
for yield production what we have

461
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:37,639
represented near the top here are

462
00:15:35,149 --> 00:15:39,440
cannabinoids and a lot of this audience

463
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,810
probably knows what those are they are

464
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,690
exclusive to cannabis they do

465
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:46,369
interesting things to your brain what we

466
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,019
have along here are all of the terpenes

467
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,750
that people think are probably relevant

468
00:15:48,019 --> 00:15:52,490
to the cannabis space and also interact

469
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:55,159
with cannabinoids to induce different

470
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:57,350
sort of recreational attributes and also

471
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:59,299
medicinal attributes and what we can

472
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,339
find is that all of these things share

473
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:03,799
common precursors isopentenyl

474
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:07,100
pyrophosphate or IPP and dimethylallyl

475
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:08,750
pyrophosphate or addi map now what you

476
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:10,579
can take about takeaway from this is

477
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,799
that given they have all common

478
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:15,318
precursors maybe if you create a light

479
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,629
environment rich in some mid-range light

480
00:16:15,318 --> 00:16:19,399
and the plant has to be able to absorb

481
00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:22,338
it so it produces more electrifying more

482
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:23,870
alpha carotene more beta-carotene maybe

483
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:25,850
the way it handles that is by up

484
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,139
regulating these precursors and maybe if

485
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,149
you have more of these you can produce

486
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:30,680
more carotenoids I'm sorry maybe you can

487
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:33,259
produce more cannabinoids and maybe you

488
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:35,088
can produce more terpenes so this is

489
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:37,490
just one example where we take what we

490
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:39,319
understand about light and we manipulate

491
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,448
that light environment to achieve and a

492
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:45,049
sort of targeted results in our

493
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:46,278
production all right so with two minutes

494
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:48,139
remaining

495
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:49,159
I just have one more slide on here and

496
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:52,009
it's just a picture of a few of the

497
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:53,360
products as I say I understand probably

498
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:54,769
a lot of people here are of some

499
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,970
familiarity with fluence but if you

500
00:16:54,769 --> 00:17:00,318
don't it is an LED company we have lots

501
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,209
of different form factors to satisfy a

502
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:03,948
few different markets but very briefly

503
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:06,109
what you see here kind of front and

504
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:08,149
center is something we call spider 2p

505
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:11,000
and this is most often what gets SPECT

506
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:12,919
into indoor cannabis facilities it's

507
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,709
designed to have very good uniformity

508
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:17,059
placed really close to the canopy it's

509
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:18,890
great because again you can play this

510
00:17:17,058 --> 00:17:21,548
over tables it also works really well in

511
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:24,189
like a tiered sort of multi-level system

512
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:28,158
not exclusive to cannabis but that is

513
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:29,750
where we see it most a similar product

514
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:31,730
but a little bit different is in the top

515
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,829
left here we call this raiser and this

516
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,058
is intended for leafy greens kind of

517
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:36,740
vertical farms and you can mount this

518
00:17:35,058 --> 00:17:37,039
again on kind of a racking system we

519
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,259
have a

520
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,240
version of this that mounts on the end

521
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:43,190
on a rack it's sort of canceled leader

522
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,870
of cantilever it off a wall and you can

523
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,110
have trolleys of plants kind of move in

524
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:51,109
and out of them and a few other things

525
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:52,729
this here we call Viper and in the sort

526
00:17:51,109 --> 00:17:54,439
of commercial agriculture space we spec

527
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:55,940
this into greenhouses it's kind of like

528
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,630
our HP s replacement where it's just

529
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:02,350
this super bright thing that just blasts

530
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:05,180
out a whole lot of photons but again for

531
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:06,799
certain indoor applications depending on

532
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,620
how your facility's laid out that gets

533
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,299
SPECT in some times and this is just

534
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:13,189
called ray it's a single bar of LEDs

535
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,180
honestly this is mostly used for

536
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,470
research but there are some niche

537
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,060
applications where you can use this as

538
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,100
well you can have quite a few different

539
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:21,230
spectra of Ray's so you use it either as

540
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,490
a sole source solution or if you had a

541
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,110
broad spectrum and you want to

542
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,940
supplement some additional far-red or

543
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:29,559
some UV or something like that

544
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:31,789
Ray's usually what you would use so

545
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:36,619
without being too long-winded I think

546
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:40,039
I'll just pass it on and do you do the

547
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:47,509
next introduction no can speak for

548
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:49,789
himself all right thank you dr. Holliday

549
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:52,190
that was amazing thank you I've learned

550
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:53,869
a lot all right so good morning

551
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:56,559
everybody I'm Neel Tygart I'm vice

552
00:18:53,869 --> 00:19:00,349
president of solty of international and

553
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:03,859
there we go hmm why especially is

554
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:06,619
actually light and the circadian

555
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:08,919
response to the ever-changing spectrum

556
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:11,689
of light especially is human vision

557
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:14,630
neuro chemistry and psychology of

558
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:17,660
perception but obviously plants follow

559
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:21,110
or use the same spectrum as dr. Lessard

560
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:23,630
already pointed out we use a or our our

561
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:26,359
daytime vision is uniquely tuned to the

562
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:29,120
the green portion of the the visible

563
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:30,979
spectrum but what he didn't state is

564
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,799
that we actually have some intrinsically

565
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:36,170
photo responsive ganglion cells that

566
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:38,450
actually drive our circadian rhythm that

567
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:41,120
actually almost directly match the blue

568
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,860
spectrum that drives photosynthesis and

569
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,649
that's what keeps us entrained in the

570
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:47,689
24-hour clock so we'll talk about that a

571
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:49,070
little bit I am here to talk about

572
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,580
daylight

573
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:55,039
so obviously daylight is the reference

574
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:57,619
light source that we use to compare all

575
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,720
electric lighting today and what we're

576
00:19:57,619 --> 00:20:02,329
gonna see is that when we properly

577
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:06,769
capture daylight it up obviously

578
00:20:02,329 --> 00:20:11,539
directly matches the Makri response

579
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:14,240
curve or desired action spectra that we

580
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:16,490
want for photosynthesis so traditionally

581
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,480
when we think about lighting there we're

582
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,339
gonna have three different ways of

583
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,069
emitting light to a building perimeter

584
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:24,319
glass so printer glass is great allows

585
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:26,169
us to have used the outside but

586
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:29,329
typically it's associated with heat

587
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:31,789
shifting patterns of light and just a

588
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:33,559
very dynamic environment not necessarily

589
00:20:31,789 --> 00:20:36,740
something that we want for today's

590
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:38,690
growth environments we can have top

591
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,509
lighting as we would associate with a

592
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:44,240
skylight or the rooftop glazing of a

593
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:46,640
greenhouse again really good if we're

594
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,859
fully glazing a building but we do have

595
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,140
shifting patterns of light we have heat

596
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:53,329
we have leakage we have all sorts of

597
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,840
issues that could become problematic in

598
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:58,519
the growth arena what we're talking

599
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:01,220
about today or what I'm introducing you

600
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:03,470
to is a notion of optics so optical day

601
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,930
lighting so for the first time now we

602
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:08,750
have a product that is uniquely designed

603
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:12,049
to only admit the wavelengths that we

604
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:14,930
need for vision and photosynthesis it

605
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:16,430
actually extracts heat and UV that we

606
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:18,769
don't want in the buildings that would

607
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:21,259
be problematic we can also use very

608
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:24,319
small apertures to selectively harvest

609
00:21:21,259 --> 00:21:27,259
light by angle so we can actually tune

610
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,789
it to admit light or to broaden the

611
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:31,240
number of hours per day that we have

612
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:33,619
useful illumination we can also capture

613
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,079
incredible amounts of daylight in a very

614
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:38,779
small aperture and drive it down into a

615
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:42,139
building and focus it optically where we

616
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:46,129
want it such as the plant canopy we can

617
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:49,670
do this without any heat so again really

618
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:51,890
beneficial in a growth environment so

619
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:54,470
just very quickly when we talk about

620
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:56,360
an advanced optical system we have the

621
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,730
capture zone which allows us to

622
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:00,099
selectively harvest the light and the

623
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,059
wavelengths of energy that we want

624
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:02,869
extracting the end of the wavelengths

625
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:05,509
that we do not

626
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:07,909
what in the system we have the optical

627
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:10,430
light guide that allows us to now duct

628
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:12,110
the light so whether it is a very short

629
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:14,450
distance or a very long convoluted

630
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:16,399
pathway we have wonderful new

631
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:18,740
technologies that literally allow us to

632
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,370
transport the light with virtually no

633
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:24,170
light loss and then ultimately we can

634
00:22:22,369 --> 00:22:25,579
diffuse the light just like we would

635
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:28,940
with lighting equipment so we can

636
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:31,399
provide focused lighting to highlight an

637
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:34,400
object in a room that we that we want to

638
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,890
call visual attention to or in the case

639
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:41,059
of indoor agriculture we can now focus

640
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:44,059
it on the plant canopy itself we also

641
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:47,289
can provide full range dimming so we can

642
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:49,339
fully modulate daylight as well so

643
00:22:47,289 --> 00:22:51,859
obviously for those of you familiar with

644
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:54,500
sola tube you know of us as a product

645
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:57,049
for lighting interior spaces that's what

646
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,000
we do we have done it for a very long

647
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:00,980
time and we've invented a lot of

648
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,150
technologies allow us to do this all

649
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:06,829
these spaces you see are 100% Dale it

650
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:09,170
even this this is actually one of the

651
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:12,049
very first Dale it Olympic venues this

652
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:14,509
is the martial arts venue in the Beijing

653
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:16,339
Olympics ever since then every every

654
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:18,140
Olympic building has had sold tube

655
00:23:16,339 --> 00:23:20,599
products or optical day lighting systems

656
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:26,080
in the venue's here we're focusing the

657
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:26,079
light 60 feet to the competition floor

658
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,929
so production facilities again nothing

659
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,929
new to new for us

660
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:43,670
and then also we have been working in

661
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,820
the indoor agricultural field for quite

662
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:49,519
some time this project is about 10-12

663
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:53,240
years old this is actually an algae

664
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:56,420
growth facility and so these bioreactors

665
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,009
are daylit so the optical day lighting

666
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:01,100
system as you can see is pumping into

667
00:23:58,009 --> 00:24:06,980
the top of the bio reactors to allow the

668
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:08,869
the algae to propagate okay so today I

669
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,759
won't really want to talk about some

670
00:24:08,869 --> 00:24:13,699
pivotal research that has been ongoing

671
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:16,700
for the last few years so I want to

672
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:19,460
reference a foundational study done by

673
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:22,100
dr. cachet of CCV research and flourish

674
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:24,380
farms and really focus on what he has

675
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:26,659
learned relative to the application of

676
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:29,570
optical day lighting to an indoor growth

677
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:33,710
facility so in this study what we're

678
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:36,529
gonna look at is a fully optimized

679
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:38,590
system where daylight is the dominant

680
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:41,389
light source and then it's supported by

681
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:43,759
LED lighting on the shoulder hours of

682
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:46,490
the day where we might want to provide a

683
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:49,819
little bump up in daytime illumination

684
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:54,500
or actually the ppfd

685
00:24:49,819 --> 00:24:57,109
levels on the plant canopy here's an

686
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:59,720
example of some of the growth chambers

687
00:24:57,109 --> 00:25:03,559
that he was experimenting on these are

688
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,779
10 by 12 sheds they lit with four

689
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:08,359
optical systems each of these optical

690
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:12,529
systems can produce around 55,000 lumens

691
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:13,939
during the day this is the inside of the

692
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:16,359
growth chamber and what was kind of

693
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:18,650
interesting is that what he discovered

694
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:20,359
anecdotally is that the daylight

695
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,220
actually provides a different quality of

696
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:24,769
illumination in the space it actually

697
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,900
provides volumetric lighting so rather

698
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:29,569
than is laying the top of the canopy of

699
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:31,400
the the plants themselves it actually

700
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:34,369
fills the space with light so we

701
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:39,290
actually extend the growth the depth of

702
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:42,529
the growth area in the usable area from

703
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:45,289
an energy standpoint relative to you the

704
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:48,139
typical HBS system now if we look at the

705
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:50,149
daily energy consumption when we apply

706
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,990
the daylight what you see in the lower

707
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,850
green

708
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:55,190
barso we're looking at the course of the

709
00:25:52,849 --> 00:25:57,879
day in the use of electric lights in

710
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:59,350
response to you or to provide makeup

711
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,059
ppfd

712
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:04,279
levels inside the growth chamber itself

713
00:26:02,058 --> 00:26:07,369
we see that we're able to fully displace

714
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:08,808
the need for the electric light for a

715
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:10,579
significant portion of the day on

716
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:14,178
average between five to eight hours per

717
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:16,279
day in doing so we're able to

718
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:18,860
significantly reduce the annual energy

719
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:21,109
cost both for lighting as well as for

720
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:22,639
heat removal in the growth chamber so we

721
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:25,579
can keep the plants at optimal

722
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,980
temperatures and we can also provide the

723
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:30,139
desired spectral content that we want

724
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:35,150
for the plants to grow so we can reduce

725
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:37,400
the energy consumption by 1/5 or more or

726
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:41,150
more to dissociate we have a traditional

727
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:44,090
indoor agricultural environment so

728
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:47,570
looking at the spectral content of

729
00:26:44,089 --> 00:26:50,089
daylight that back farthest most

730
00:26:47,569 --> 00:26:53,839
spectral region is going to be for

731
00:26:50,089 --> 00:26:55,879
daytime noontime illumination a DL 5500

732
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,949
sources we would call it and we see that

733
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,570
as a full spectrum light source we also

734
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,730
see that it peaks in the blue

735
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:04,909
wavelengths which is what we want for

736
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:06,289
photosynthesis the light sources in

737
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,910
front of that are gonna be the more

738
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:10,819
traditional electric light sources that

739
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:12,920
we would see in the standard illuminated

740
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:15,289
space and again we see that the shapes

741
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,820
are very different so daylight really is

742
00:27:15,289 --> 00:27:19,700
the reference source that we need to

743
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:23,839
consider this chart the lower left hand

744
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:27,880
corner represents the Makri curve so the

745
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:29,889
the Photosynth photosynthesis or

746
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,940
photosynthetically active radiation

747
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:35,059
spectral response curve that we want

748
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,940
between 400 and 700 nanometers and then

749
00:27:35,058 --> 00:27:39,649
the central curve in the center reflects

750
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,660
what we were able to achieve with the

751
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:43,400
optically filtered daylight through

752
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:46,910
optical systems and we see this

753
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:50,720
beautifully biased curve that is perfect

754
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:52,370
for photosynthesis so what does it look

755
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,579
like when we're actually growing plants

756
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:58,669
so again we concede that when we provide

757
00:27:55,579 --> 00:28:00,109
this day light we can do so again five

758
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:03,140
to eight hours a day without the need

759
00:28:00,109 --> 00:28:04,709
for any makeup electric light and we can

760
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:07,320
also see that we have very

761
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,808
our deep penetration of the growth

762
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:15,269
canopy itself while the plants are

763
00:28:09,808 --> 00:28:16,829
growing in working towards maturation we

764
00:28:15,269 --> 00:28:21,058
can see some early stages in the

765
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:22,230
flowering process and in the end you can

766
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:24,298
see the end result

767
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,759
now what was very interesting is there

768
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:30,000
is some discussion on whether we need UV

769
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:31,798
for growing plants now so tubes or I

770
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,269
should say optical day lighting is

771
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:36,778
unique and that we can actually start to

772
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:38,369
filter out the the UV that we don't want

773
00:28:36,778 --> 00:28:41,640
and what was very interesting from these

774
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:43,769
studies as anecdotal information dr.

775
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,038
cachet was able to to discover or

776
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:50,038
discovered that without the UV we don't

777
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:52,349
have the browning effect of the flowers

778
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:56,700
so as a result of the flowers literally

779
00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:59,219
have a longer shelf life here's an

780
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,528
example in a hemp facility so we're

781
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:02,990
going from a small-scale kind of

782
00:29:01,528 --> 00:29:06,690
proof-of-concept

783
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:11,298
application to some large agricultural

784
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:14,490
applications so here we have cultivation

785
00:29:11,298 --> 00:29:16,288
facility in Arkansas and you can see a

786
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,940
range of optical systems being applied

787
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:20,069
to the roof and what's really

788
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,710
interesting is that in the case of the

789
00:29:20,069 --> 00:29:24,869
hemp growth facility where you're you're

790
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:27,990
growing seedlings and then preparing

791
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:29,489
them for planting you have a hardening

792
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:32,759
process that you normally have to go

793
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:35,669
through with electric growth chambers

794
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:37,500
that doesn't or is not required when we

795
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:41,600
use daylight's so the plants emerge

796
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:45,630
fully pre hardened ready for planting

797
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:47,428
okay so very quickly just again some

798
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:50,370
examples of the hemp cultivation

799
00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:53,220
facility of these pre hardened plants

800
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:56,038
and a nice comparison side-by-side of

801
00:29:53,220 --> 00:30:04,740
daylight date/time daylight illumination

802
00:29:56,038 --> 00:30:06,509
to nighttime LED illumination and that's

803
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,259
optical day lighting we'll talk more

804
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:09,420
about it later

805
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:14,190
okay thank you

806
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:17,500
[Applause]

807
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,788
my name is Cindy Rajan mutia Lu so I'm

808
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,900
gonna talk a little bit about sunlight

809
00:30:18,788 --> 00:30:28,150
and biomimicry aligning with aligning

810
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:30,490
with nature so I think to do this

811
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:32,710
it isn't just lighting we need a very

812
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,900
symbiotic relationship going inside

813
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,759
especially indoors so you have to

814
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:39,130
understand why are you growing this well

815
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:41,819
what's the reason for it you want full

816
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:44,350
nutrition nutrient value you want

817
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:46,658
cannabis that has all of the compounds

818
00:30:44,349 --> 00:30:48,819
so you can actually heal and not be

819
00:30:46,659 --> 00:30:51,789
extractive in the sense of just going

820
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:53,470
high THC as an example and not bringing

821
00:30:51,788 --> 00:30:55,419
out all those beautiful compounds so

822
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:57,850
you've got to grow like Mother Nature

823
00:30:55,419 --> 00:31:00,669
you have to preserve and really grow the

824
00:30:57,849 --> 00:31:03,069
genetics and get genetic diversity

825
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:06,038
rather than putting genetics down

826
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:08,168
because in the way of cannabis pretty

827
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:10,629
much all started with Afghan many years

828
00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:13,659
ago and people kept going down to the

829
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:17,640
point where we're down to a significant

830
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:20,440
amount of chemo VARs that are the same

831
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,299
so achieve full genetic expression from

832
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:25,659
optin nutrient grow junk you know

833
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:28,418
generality and beyond organic and then

834
00:31:25,659 --> 00:31:31,419
produce really freshly and delicious

835
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:33,070
food cuz Sun is the energy you know it's

836
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:36,220
the the main source of the whole world

837
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:39,129
and a definition of science is seeing

838
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:41,710
how nature does it and emulate that

839
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:44,679
through biomimicry so we know plants can

840
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,890
heal and so the questions I'm interested

841
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:51,309
in are a little bit different than just

842
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:55,720
designing of light and this one here is

843
00:31:51,308 --> 00:31:57,940
very controversial in the sense that we

844
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:00,190
believe from coming from a wellness and

845
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,320
sustainability come that if you're

846
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:04,630
growing with artificial lights you're

847
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:07,149
bottle feeding you're an asterick 'el

848
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,470
you know very sterile medium with and

849
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:12,400
then finishing off with things like

850
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:14,890
pesticides you get really a lot of

851
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:17,169
limited genetic expression because

852
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:19,570
you're tightening that plant down into a

853
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:23,350
very narrow place rather than mother

854
00:32:19,569 --> 00:32:28,119
nature going back then obvious

855
00:32:23,349 --> 00:32:31,629
nature yep sunlight true living soil

856
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:34,149
very hard to do indoors completely

857
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:37,660
organic healthy plant immune system has

858
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:40,330
to set and full genetic expression and

859
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:42,910
to get the entourage effect and

860
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:46,960
especially for things like well not

861
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:50,140
things like but cannabis so we're a

862
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,870
company that's really tech agnostic and

863
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:56,679
so nature is their reference point for

864
00:32:52,869 --> 00:33:02,379
us so you have to have a biotic and

865
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:05,740
abiotic conditions to really have an

866
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:09,659
optimum and grow of plants to get

867
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:12,669
maximum expression and bioavailability

868
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:14,080
so from the plants point of view is what

869
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:16,509
you need to look at when you're growing

870
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:18,730
indoors not from the growers point of

871
00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:22,658
view not from the soil guys point of

872
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:25,659
view but for what the plant once so you

873
00:33:22,659 --> 00:33:28,630
have to do a very symbiotic kind of

874
00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:31,600
system of looking at water transpiration

875
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:34,090
VPD the living soil so you can have

876
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,129
microbes that help and not flip the

877
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:39,538
whole room with co2 which by the way

878
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:41,950
thickens leaves and closes stomata often

879
00:33:39,538 --> 00:33:44,529
so you want to look at it from the

880
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:46,150
plants point of view and I'm going to

881
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:49,240
talk a little bit different than the

882
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:56,169
gentleman have so far I want to talk

883
00:33:49,240 --> 00:34:00,069
about outside of par and par it's really

884
00:33:56,169 --> 00:34:02,169
only 43 percent of the sunlight we have

885
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:05,079
a lot of plans to grow outdoors that

886
00:34:02,169 --> 00:34:07,889
gets everything so when we start

887
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:10,299
limiting it you know you limit the par

888
00:34:07,888 --> 00:34:12,279
it's really artificial lighting in that

889
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:15,220
power range because that's what really

890
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,149
the systems can produce so you you

891
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,819
basically do that

892
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:20,199
more and more we're getting away from

893
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:24,090
that and getting more full-spectrum

894
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:28,480
light so when you have no ultraviolet

895
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:30,070
and no infrared you know it lacks the

896
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,608
uniformity and density of sunlight

897
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:37,889
frequencies and it really limits genetic

898
00:34:33,608 --> 00:34:40,358
expression as well as diversity

899
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:41,980
for instance rather than talking about

900
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:45,690
McCree I'm going to talk about the

901
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:49,869
combinations of different light UV and

902
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:55,659
blue which you have to have UV to be

903
00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:58,780
able to get a good immune system and you

904
00:34:55,659 --> 00:35:01,030
want to get some secondary metabolites

905
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:04,060
as we were just talking about a little

906
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:07,079
while ago are extremely important as

907
00:35:04,059 --> 00:35:09,849
well for the plant and infrared

908
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:12,280
circadian rhythms this like you just

909
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:13,838
mentioned a moment ago it's very

910
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,740
important for the plant how fast they go

911
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:19,289
to sleep they're growing when it's dark

912
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:23,578
most of the growing is when it's dark

913
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:27,420
it's just getting energy during the day

914
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:30,400
so I'm going to spend a little time here

915
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:33,608
the little two little dots at the bottom

916
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,349
there this is where all the lighting

917
00:35:33,608 --> 00:35:37,179
technology currently is it's within

918
00:35:35,349 --> 00:35:41,410
typically the par range there are some

919
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:45,159
that go out when you look at UVA I mean

920
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:49,629
when you look at the Sun which is the

921
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:52,480
yellow here our technology emulates that

922
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:54,940
a hundred percent the other is when you

923
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,838
look at HPS you see this range is

924
00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:01,869
actually just here and also mostly LEDs

925
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:04,989
are in that same and it's very

926
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:07,240
normalized frequency which means you're

927
00:36:04,989 --> 00:36:12,608
normalizing those dots to be able to get

928
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:15,879
the curve to match rather than then in

929
00:36:12,608 --> 00:36:19,150
the way our technology every quarter

930
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:23,108
wave everything is present it's not just

931
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:25,950
trying to mix it or putting a filter in

932
00:36:23,108 --> 00:36:29,828
front of it to be able to get the waves

933
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:32,469
wavelengths so what does that look like

934
00:36:29,829 --> 00:36:35,560
in the Grove here's a five hundred

935
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:36,969
square foot grow with HPS you can see

936
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:41,920
all the air-conditioning systems

937
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:43,179
necessary and it really relies on doing

938
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,530
some things to your plant you really

939
00:36:43,179 --> 00:36:49,299
don't want to do but you got to get it

940
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:50,619
to grow at forty things so here's so

941
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:52,568
that is twenty

942
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:55,180
four thousand watts twenty four lights

943
00:36:52,568 --> 00:36:59,768
air conditioning to be able to cool that

944
00:36:55,179 --> 00:37:02,558
room down we replace that lips with one

945
00:36:59,768 --> 00:37:06,159
light that's eleven hundred watt light

946
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:08,950
now would we do one in this girl no we'd

947
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:12,368
probably do five so that we have uniform

948
00:37:08,949 --> 00:37:14,439
you UV but that's a significant not only

949
00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:18,749
savings and you can see the difference

950
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:23,440
here if you look at the the shadows even

951
00:37:18,748 --> 00:37:25,179
compared to what you see here very clean

952
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,059
very Chris what does that mean even the

953
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:31,778
tie down here you can see it's just a

954
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:35,880
sheer number of photons coming out very

955
00:37:31,778 --> 00:37:38,619
dense very uniform just like sunlight

956
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,670
and the reason it's just like sunlight

957
00:37:38,619 --> 00:37:43,838
we actually developed this for sunlight

958
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:45,880
there's a lot of numbers here but

959
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:47,739
basically we just did an economic study

960
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:51,400
on a fourteen hundred square foot

961
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:56,368
facility and not only do you have a

962
00:37:51,400 --> 00:38:02,470
savings in energy you get full plant

963
00:37:56,369 --> 00:38:07,480
expression I'm gonna pass that one but

964
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:14,230
here's a grow of 2,100 square feet in

965
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:18,130
Oakland that's 66 HPS lights in here

966
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:22,358
sixty six thousand watts we replaced

967
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:24,670
that with 20 and the there was a leading

968
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:27,460
LED company that bid for this let's put

969
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:32,650
a hundred and ten LEDs in here so I can

970
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:37,239
imagine the amount of power so what are

971
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:41,798
those plants look like I have to say

972
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:44,079
that I am from the cannabis world have

973
00:38:41,798 --> 00:38:47,048
been starting to grow in Berkeley when I

974
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,930
was 12 in 13 and it's definitely

975
00:38:47,048 --> 00:38:52,028
cannabis and not marijuana to me so I

976
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:56,679
don't mind talking about it at any

977
00:38:52,028 --> 00:38:58,059
conference so this is one some of the

978
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:01,538
things you can start doing is doing land

979
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:03,030
races when you can do completely living

980
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:06,690
soil

981
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:08,930
and full sunlight and you do lots of

982
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:11,789
different combination headband here is a

983
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:16,049
notorious for popcorn type of growth

984
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:17,550
rather than distance and so you can see

985
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:22,039
these things and this is a hoop house in

986
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:24,900
Oregon with no heat so you can see and

987
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:27,869
then the fruity pebbles here just wanted

988
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:30,210
to show you a little diversity we also

989
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:33,089
do food if anybody's looking at

990
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:37,880
trichomes take a look at that everything

991
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:42,329
here was grown by the Sun on demand and

992
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:46,550
except obviously the rice and the rap so

993
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:46,549
we can grow indoors that's it

994
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:56,070
so we'll open it up for questions if you

995
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:58,200
don't have any I can start posing some

996
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:00,240
but son what is the underlying

997
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:04,469
technology that's giving you twice the

998
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:10,139
efficacy of plasma it's a plasma light

999
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:13,199
so it's not a point source so it allows

1000
00:40:10,139 --> 00:40:15,179
for a lot of photons to come out so what

1001
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,309
would the efficient like that micromoles

1002
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:19,259
per Joule of your system be when you

1003
00:40:17,309 --> 00:40:23,630
start talking about ppfd it's the same

1004
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:27,000
as the Sun 2100 electrical efficiency

1005
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:29,930
meaning like how much electricity you

1006
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:35,480
get per electricity or energy in ooh

1007
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:35,480
that's a good question I would say from

1008
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:42,029
I'll buy your question I'm sorry well

1009
00:40:39,449 --> 00:40:44,250
for light usually measured in you know

1010
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:46,590
like a typical efficient fixture

1011
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:50,369
efficiency would be 2.5 microns per

1012
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:53,610
Joule oh okay so a number of photons per

1013
00:40:50,369 --> 00:40:56,789
energy and other like LED fixture or HPS

1014
00:40:53,610 --> 00:41:00,769
to be 1.8 yeah I can't answer that but I

1015
00:40:56,789 --> 00:41:00,769
can information to you okay

1016
00:41:02,389 --> 00:41:06,170
are you v's making a breakthrough on

1017
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:08,389
life or are they still about the eight

1018
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:13,369
to ten thousand hours on the led UV

1019
00:41:08,389 --> 00:41:19,549
dance who is the question directed

1020
00:41:13,369 --> 00:41:21,920
towards the panel okay guys so the

1021
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:32,150
question is life of the LEDs source

1022
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:33,050
itself yeah well yeah that's a great

1023
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:36,530
question

1024
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:39,350
there's still a shorter life span than

1025
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:42,140
any of the corn of dominant LED

1026
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:43,699
technologies so like anything within the

1027
00:41:42,139 --> 00:41:45,619
visible spectrum has kind of the

1028
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:46,909
comparable lifespan whether whether

1029
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:48,739
you're talking about a prospection diode

1030
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:50,989
like I just a generic like a a warm

1031
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:52,429
white or a cool white or or if you look

1032
00:41:50,989 --> 00:41:54,919
at narrowband you look at like a blue

1033
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:56,059
diode and a red diode and a less so

1034
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,309
amber in green because that technology

1035
00:41:56,059 --> 00:42:02,199
is also a little bit behind but yeah UVs

1036
00:41:58,309 --> 00:42:02,199
are still they have a ways to go

1037
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:07,699
so with LEDs typically I'm a thin-film

1038
00:42:05,869 --> 00:42:11,089
engineer as well and we developed a lot

1039
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:12,619
of diodes you're starting to about a

1040
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:14,210
hundred thirty thousand hundred forty

1041
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:17,599
thousand hours depending on which diode

1042
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:20,869
you start start losing spectra and

1043
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:23,449
typically cycle times three three years

1044
00:42:20,869 --> 00:42:26,059
maybe some people are now going up to

1045
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:28,460
five but that's by cooling because

1046
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:30,170
you've got a lot of heat dissipation our

1047
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:32,990
lights a hundred thousand hours without

1048
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:38,420
losing any kind of spectra so that's one

1049
00:42:32,989 --> 00:42:40,059
of the beauties of plasma any other

1050
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:44,320
questions

1051
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:46,929
oh yeah I'll pose one here um so we

1052
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,870
heard a little bit about the costs and

1053
00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:51,250
structure but if I can actually do it

1054
00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:54,159
has anybody actually done a calculation

1055
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:55,780
based on a number of units of light that

1056
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:57,639
are able to be produced over a year

1057
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:59,230
period using each one of the

1058
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:01,059
technologies so if you're gonna be doing

1059
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:03,550
the solar tube obviously there's an

1060
00:43:01,059 --> 00:43:05,199
installation capex cost and then

1061
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:07,990
hopefully the light is free at that

1062
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:09,939
point as opposed to the LED which is

1063
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:13,779
there's a cost of buying the LED and

1064
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:15,909
electrical cost as well as for the for

1065
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:19,450
the plasma system has anybody actually

1066
00:43:15,909 --> 00:43:21,219
done that so we have I mean we've looked

1067
00:43:19,449 --> 00:43:23,559
at various systems for daylight

1068
00:43:21,219 --> 00:43:27,759
obviously the capex is going to be

1069
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:29,980
largely climate driven so it depends on

1070
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,690
where you are constructing your facility

1071
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,969
that will determine how many day

1072
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:38,349
lighting systems are required to provide

1073
00:43:33,969 --> 00:43:42,309
the necessary power lumination on the

1074
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:44,380
plant canopy here in California or

1075
00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:46,840
anywhere where it's we have a nice

1076
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:49,180
robust sunny climate actually we're

1077
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,440
looking at something where based on

1078
00:43:49,179 --> 00:43:52,539
energy savings you're probably looking

1079
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,429
at about a one-year payback to pay for

1080
00:43:52,539 --> 00:43:56,650
the the day lighting system and at that

1081
00:43:54,429 --> 00:44:01,149
point it's free there's no maintenance

1082
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:06,280
of the the system and it's just okay

1083
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:08,470
works wrong yeah so I think on the

1084
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:12,430
operational expense side Nia is probably

1085
00:44:08,469 --> 00:44:13,659
going to have me beat at free LED can't

1086
00:44:12,429 --> 00:44:16,899
quite compete with that

1087
00:44:13,659 --> 00:44:19,449
as for the capital expenditure LED is

1088
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:22,750
certainly more expensive than HBS on day

1089
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:24,339
one but that that narrative tends to

1090
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:25,659
fall apart pretty quickly and I'm not

1091
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,039
going to pretend to be an expert on that

1092
00:44:25,659 --> 00:44:29,949
but I have a couple colleagues here

1093
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:31,989
Corrine Wilder and Brady Namath are a

1094
00:44:29,949 --> 00:44:32,679
little bit more plugged in on a few

1095
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:34,779
things there's some really interesting

1096
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:37,899
stuff going on with utility providers

1097
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:40,840
and rebates and a lot of the capital

1098
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:42,130
expense that's associated with LED and I

1099
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,600
probably shouldn't say this but I would

1100
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:45,190
imagine probably some more efficient

1101
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,630
technologies in general there are a lot

1102
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:50,050
of initiatives to kind of encourage

1103
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:51,760
people to go that route and governmental

1104
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:53,080
bodies will absorb some of that cost so

1105
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,680
you can work through your a utility

1106
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:55,469
provider

1107
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:59,259
really have the capital expenditure

1108
00:44:55,469 --> 00:45:00,759
become kind of a non-issue so again I'll

1109
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,780
if you're interested in that part of the

1110
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:06,280
story I can connect you with those

1111
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:08,740
people after the fact well with our

1112
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,930
systems the with the bulb of a hundred

1113
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:14,079
thousand hours you don't have to to

1114
00:45:10,929 --> 00:45:17,739
obviously change bulbs all the time

1115
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:20,139
for a new installation we actually pay

1116
00:45:17,739 --> 00:45:22,299
for the lights before a plant goes under

1117
00:45:20,139 --> 00:45:25,389
it because you're half the air

1118
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:27,400
conditioning you're 20 lights versus

1119
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:30,489
sixty six lights so a lot of

1120
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:34,389
infrastructure goes away and I think the

1121
00:45:30,489 --> 00:45:36,250
other area is the use of materials when

1122
00:45:34,389 --> 00:45:38,829
you're doing it in living soil you're

1123
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:42,789
buying less inputs you're doing less

1124
00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:45,400
pest control strips because you have UV

1125
00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:47,650
and you have all of the spectro

1126
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,150
available just like outdoors right so

1127
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:51,849
the plants are healthy and they're

1128
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:54,010
immune so you also save in that arena so

1129
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:56,650
I didn't know if you just meant from a

1130
00:45:54,010 --> 00:46:01,120
manufacturing perspective in total the

1131
00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:03,280
full system yeah yeah if I may I mean

1132
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:04,989
certainly I think the important aspect

1133
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,000
is that when we talk about a well

1134
00:46:04,989 --> 00:46:09,189
designed facility we want to integrate

1135
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,320
all the systems and we want to optimize

1136
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:14,500
them so they all work together so the

1137
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:16,750
nice thing about a daylight enhanced

1138
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,070
growth facility is that we're not just

1139
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:20,170
talking daylight we're actually talking

1140
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:22,450
about a fully integrated system where we

1141
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:27,990
have the electric light source that's

1142
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:30,819
providing the make up par or ppfd

1143
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:32,799
intensities where we need them in doing

1144
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,300
so though in when daylight becomes the

1145
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,789
dominant light source we significantly

1146
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:40,150
extend the life of the electrical

1147
00:46:36,789 --> 00:46:43,929
components so your facility actually has

1148
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:45,700
might much greater life expectancy we've

1149
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:48,519
increased the efficiency significantly

1150
00:46:45,699 --> 00:46:51,099
and we reduce the cost of goods

1151
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:54,159
dramatically for the product in the end

1152
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:56,019
so it's a win-win and also when it's

1153
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:58,539
properly done as we've seen in the

1154
00:46:56,019 --> 00:47:01,360
research is that when you have properly

1155
00:46:58,539 --> 00:47:04,929
monitored or metered systems you can

1156
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:06,519
actually prevent failures of electrical

1157
00:47:04,929 --> 00:47:07,359
components because you can start to see

1158
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:10,389
where a problem

1159
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:12,220
might be arising get it corrected before

1160
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:16,509
it becomes an issue that damages the

1161
00:47:12,219 --> 00:47:18,549
crop yeah and actually I think probably

1162
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:19,930
everybody in this room is picking up on

1163
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:21,670
a common thread here which is that

1164
00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:23,379
although the three of us are

1165
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,450
representing three pretty distinct

1166
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:27,250
technologies the common thread here is

1167
00:47:25,449 --> 00:47:29,679
that we're all advocates of

1168
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:31,719
broad-spectrum light whether that's

1169
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:34,029
plasma technology which admittedly I'm

1170
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:36,279
actually less well-versed in or sunlight

1171
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:40,750
which we all have some familiarity with

1172
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:43,840
or brought some extra LEDs really what

1173
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:46,539
you could be taking away from that from

1174
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:48,400
us as a group is that broad spectrum is

1175
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:49,690
really going to be better for plant

1176
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,030
quality in a whole lot of ways and

1177
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:54,550
whether it's channeling sunlight around

1178
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:56,350
or creating sunlight or using LED for

1179
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:59,590
broad-spectrum light you do end up with

1180
00:47:56,349 --> 00:48:02,170
a more robust plant and whether that is

1181
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:05,380
making easier to manage heat load or

1182
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:06,789
mitigate pathogen stress or other

1183
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:08,289
applications for plant hardening or

1184
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:12,099
achieving certain chemo cars with

1185
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:13,389
cannabis that's you know for good reason

1186
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:21,309
that's the way the entire industry seems

1187
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:23,529
to be moving to comments on the plasma

1188
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:25,360
desert I'm wondering first if there's

1189
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:27,550
any restriction on ceiling height if you

1190
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:31,090
need a higher ceiling height than you

1191
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:31,990
would for a LED or hyper Shore sodium

1192
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:35,070
and also if there's any special

1193
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:37,209
reflectance you need off the ceiling

1194
00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:40,539
reflective materials off the ceiling to

1195
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:42,039
distribute that light sure sure you saw

1196
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:47,170
that one didn't have a reflector in the

1197
00:48:42,039 --> 00:48:49,900
photo obviously you want to save photons

1198
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:52,480
for sure I mean it's a lack of them

1199
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:55,660
right you know a lot of people said to

1200
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,309
me about your like the Sun really well

1201
00:48:55,659 --> 00:49:01,029
no Rinat really I mean that's point

1202
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:02,889
three point seven four times 10 to the

1203
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:06,490
37th watts

1204
00:49:02,889 --> 00:49:10,210
I'm 1,100 watts there's no way that kind

1205
00:49:06,489 --> 00:49:12,819
of power is going to come down so I

1206
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:15,579
would arrest years question what was

1207
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:17,680
that you had three Oh ceiling height

1208
00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:20,259
nine nine feet nine and a half feet

1209
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:20,500
we're about a hundred two hundred and

1210
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:23,740
four

1211
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:26,320
four square foot footprint obviously

1212
00:49:23,739 --> 00:49:32,619
when you put him that way that one room

1213
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:34,750
had 220 lights and so we do measure we

1214
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:37,630
make this for a solar simulator people

1215
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:41,110
put in a whole Mercedes to see in 1000

1216
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:43,750
hours what 20 years does so yeah a lot

1217
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:46,720
of a lot of area was there so so the

1218
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:48,699
question was when we have utility

1219
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:51,339
companies that are either requiring some

1220
00:49:48,699 --> 00:49:52,960
sort of size site-based generation to

1221
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,780
account for the power consumption of the

1222
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,909
facility or the utilities themselves are

1223
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,620
having a ramp up power generation

1224
00:49:57,909 --> 00:50:01,960
themselves is there a benefit and

1225
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:05,559
absolutely because we're able to

1226
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:08,079
displace you know 50 60 percent or more

1227
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:11,259
of the electrical consumption associated

1228
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:13,539
with lighting and reduction in Kuta and

1229
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:15,190
cooling energy as well so there is

1230
00:50:13,539 --> 00:50:17,320
definitely a benefit for the utilities

1231
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:19,480
and certainly for the growth facility

1232
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:22,330
itself we would definitely decrease the

1233
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:25,389
need for generation or at least use of

1234
00:50:22,329 --> 00:50:27,340
the generation equipment over time so we

1235
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:28,599
keep talking about solar spectrum but

1236
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:30,220
for my understanding it changes

1237
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:31,900
throughout the day and you can change

1238
00:50:30,219 --> 00:50:35,469
depending on what your latitude is on

1239
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:37,300
earth how are you how are we determining

1240
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:40,509
what solar spectrum is I mean we

1241
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:43,300
presented multiple graphs showing a

1242
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:44,890
different distribution it seemed like

1243
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:47,130
some of them were different from others

1244
00:50:44,889 --> 00:50:49,029
especially in early on the presentation

1245
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:50,410
so I'm just wondering if there's a

1246
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:53,710
standard methodology for determining

1247
00:50:50,409 --> 00:50:56,349
what sunlight is so you're right the the

1248
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:58,750
special content of daylight does change

1249
00:50:56,349 --> 00:51:00,759
to a certain degree the underlying

1250
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:03,250
principle is that daylight is continuous

1251
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:05,200
the it is always going to be rich in the

1252
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:07,059
blue end of the spectrum where things

1253
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:09,549
start to change is when we have

1254
00:51:07,059 --> 00:51:11,679
turbidity in the skies so we go from a

1255
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:14,200
clear sky day to an overcast sky day

1256
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:15,909
some of the reds may change during the

1257
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:18,159
course of the day and so the general

1258
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:21,699
curve may alter whether we're talking

1259
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:25,750
about a 5,000 K like day light source or

1260
00:51:21,699 --> 00:51:28,389
a 6500 K day light source but the the

1261
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:30,880
overall intensity of the light in the

1262
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:33,539
critical regions stays consistent and

1263
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:38,050
very useful

1264
00:51:33,539 --> 00:51:39,670
the other is that you have to have some

1265
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:41,710
kind of a standard to be able to do so

1266
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:43,659
sunlight outside is the standard that's

1267
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:47,170
what we should be doing because that's

1268
00:51:43,659 --> 00:51:50,710
what plants how they came into play

1269
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:52,510
right so we've pretty much ruined our

1270
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:54,818
atmosphere so by the time you get to the

1271
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:56,650
surface of the earth by the time you hit

1272
00:51:54,818 --> 00:51:58,300
all the water molecules especially the

1273
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:00,940
smaller wavelengths you lose a lot of

1274
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:03,099
that the reason use the latitude and

1275
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:05,380
longitude make a big difference is the

1276
00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:08,260
amount of atmosphere it's going through

1277
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:13,900
so you see the refraction of light as an

1278
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:16,660
example a peacock is that actually brown

1279
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:18,460
or almost a brown gray it's just our

1280
00:52:16,659 --> 00:52:21,159
eyes it's the surface that creates those

1281
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:23,400
colors so it isn't color anymore it's

1282
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:26,710
not luminous flecks it's electromagnetic

1283
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:29,318
so if you look at a Class A bulb for

1284
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:31,358
instance in Europe there's been a lot of

1285
00:52:29,318 --> 00:52:33,579
work in and looking at what is the Sun

1286
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:36,279
spectra so that's the one you should

1287
00:52:33,579 --> 00:52:38,890
kind of take because in our marketing

1288
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:41,769
material will make everything fit to

1289
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:43,598
sell products right so you have to go

1290
00:52:41,769 --> 00:52:46,568
back to the real standard of what

1291
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:49,809
sunlight is and then talk to lighting

1292
00:52:46,568 --> 00:52:51,699
guys what is that plant or what does

1293
00:52:49,809 --> 00:52:57,429
that product look like outdoors and now

1294
00:52:51,699 --> 00:53:02,129
show me you did the same thing question

1295
00:52:57,429 --> 00:53:04,480
first solitude for both your research

1296
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:06,910
facilities like the the sheds that were

1297
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,940
shown there as well as for production

1298
00:53:06,909 --> 00:53:11,769
facilities what ppfd have you been able

1299
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:14,079
to achieve for specifically for

1300
00:53:11,769 --> 00:53:17,019
flowering cannabis great questions so

1301
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:19,599
what we see from diffuse daylight the

1302
00:53:17,019 --> 00:53:21,280
research was able to show that diffuse

1303
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:25,930
illumination or a ppfd

1304
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:27,089
is in the 300 to 600 range over the

1305
00:53:25,929 --> 00:53:29,919
course of the day and then we have

1306
00:53:27,088 --> 00:53:32,349
transitory bright spot which actually is

1307
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:34,420
beneficial for the plants which if I

1308
00:53:32,349 --> 00:53:37,269
recall correctly ranges from about 1300

1309
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:41,019
up to about 1900 ppfd

1310
00:53:37,269 --> 00:53:43,838
so again that's going to vary based on

1311
00:53:41,019 --> 00:53:47,079
on whether it's a cloudy day or a sunny

1312
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:49,208
day but so nice robust levels

1313
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:53,619
and obviously the desire of keeping it

1314
00:53:49,208 --> 00:53:56,699
in the 500 6600 ppfd range is readily

1315
00:53:53,619 --> 00:53:59,559
achievable over the course today okay

1316
00:53:56,699 --> 00:54:00,818
there would be top of canopy yep okay

1317
00:53:59,559 --> 00:54:03,339
well I'd like to thank everyone for

1318
00:54:00,818 --> 00:54:05,858
coming to this session and hopefully you

1319
00:54:03,338 --> 00:54:07,719
enjoy the rest of the conference here

1320
00:54:05,858 --> 00:54:10,808

1321
00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:13,700
