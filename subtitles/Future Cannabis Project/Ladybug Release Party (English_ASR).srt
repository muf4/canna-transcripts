45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,079
ladybugs

47
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,319

me

50
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,718
sorry guys okay so normally we should

51
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,960
have let the ladybugs out at night

52
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,000
right before it gets dark out don't

53
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,519
touch them

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,318
because uh that's when the bugs that

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,560
they eat

56
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,839
are most active that's when the bugs

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,400
they eat are

58
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,319
are eating the plants and we want the

59
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,280
ladybugs to eat the bugs that eat the

60
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,759
plants

61
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:29,360
by and so we also have lace wings

62
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:31,359
in the other container and

63
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,599
we're also gonna get some predatory

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,040
mites that are gonna eat the

65
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,839
no no no okay let them crawl on your

66
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,799
finger we're gonna get some predatory

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,360
mites

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,560
that are gonna eat uh spider mites and

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,239
broad mites

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,159
that's what they like to eat but the

71
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:51,200
ladybugs don't really eat the spider

72
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:53,199
mites that much

73
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,878
so anyway this is how we control the

74
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,039
bugs in here

75
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,359
because we don't want to spray bad

76
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,840
things on our plants

77
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,840
