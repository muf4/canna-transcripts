THC effects we have the CBD side here to

00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:36,059
where you can get the medical benefits

32
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,850
without feeling the high effectiveness

33
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,219
is that it because isn't it illegal to

34
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:44,309
do hemp-based CBD out of a dispensary so

35
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:47,069
is that just lotia it's just lower THC

36
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:51,570
correct alright so it has THC it's just

37
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:53,039
not very correct okay I was like

38
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:54,569
hopefully he's not incriminating himself

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,570
right now like we're doing some

40
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:59,609
completely illegal shit no not at all

41
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:02,368
lastly we're gonna have our concentrates

42
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:05,670
these are the dabba Bowl if you will

43
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:09,300
products we have everything from crumble

44
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,960
wax shatter sauces we just got in some

45
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,480
moon rocks that have been really popular

46
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:16,550
so any of the old-school smokers that

47
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:18,979
like the hash we have that also inside

48
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:21,530
temple balls temple balls powder hash

49
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:23,539
everything kind of included there so

50
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:25,759
let's start there what hash brands are

51
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:29,629
you carrying so we have and what do you

52
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:37,789
like to smoke for the hash I like our

53
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:41,539
biscotti company here got a nice powder

54
00:02:37,789 --> 00:02:43,729
hash here very good for topping off your

55
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:45,709
bowls you can smoke it by yourself by

56
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:48,139
itself if you like this is one of my

57
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,120
favorite companies for the hash and

58
00:02:48,139 --> 00:02:52,189
where are they based out of biscotti

59
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,980
I believe they're located out of LA area

60
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:59,419
okay so it's probably like indoor crash

61
00:02:54,979 --> 00:03:01,579
correct and then we do have a few more

62
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:03,079
concentrates more of our top tier stuff

63
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,210
in the fridge over there some of the

64
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,570
products need to stay on at a cooler

65
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:10,280
temperature to preserve their turf 7/10

66
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:12,469
lab some of the raw Gardens product

67
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,909
serving the shop over there and so

68
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:16,430
that's like a lot of the live resin

69
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:18,409
stuff is that stuff popping off the

70
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,990
shelves that is one of our top sellers

71
00:03:18,409 --> 00:03:22,819
in the whole shop so give me a category

72
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:25,939
what's what's like the category that's

73
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:29,439
exploding so it top three is going to be

74
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:31,550
flour then concentrates then cartridges

75
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:34,250
sometimes cartridges outwait

76
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,960
concentrates sometimes concentrate away

77
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:38,240
the cartridges the kind of very is kind

78
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,129
of week by week and and how long have

79
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:44,330
you guys been open for we've been open

80
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:46,549
about a year and a half April 20th was

81
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:49,910
our grand opening last year so just over

82
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:52,700
a year and a half okay so those are

83
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:55,780
Trenton what's declining as far as a

84
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:58,969
product like category is kind of like

85
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:01,039
like if something's increasing something

86
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:03,199
else has to be decreasing right yeah

87
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,870
kinda I mean I would say if anything

88
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,049
it'd be saw really less fast some of the

89
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,050
teams

90
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:15,250
some of the tinctures maybe stuff like

91
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:16,689
that that people haven't been I guess

92
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,069
pleased with the way that they worked

93
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:21,040
out I would say something like that

94
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:23,730
would be the most decreased but again

95
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,960
the tinkers is not a one-size-fits-all

96
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:28,629
everyone has a different type of ratio

97
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:30,819
that they kind of need to to fulfill the

98
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:32,439
benefits that they're looking for so

99
00:04:30,819 --> 00:04:35,889
talking about you guys have a lot of

100
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:37,420
product on the shelves and then there

101
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:38,769
are other shops where it's like very

102
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,750
minimalist so kind of what's the

103
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:44,109
decision-making process of how to layout

104
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:46,870
the shop so here at HPC one of our huge

105
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,120
I think advantages we like to have a

106
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,519
large variety of product we want to

107
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,149
overwhelm the customer we feel that our

108
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:57,279
bud tenders have a very good knowledge

109
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:59,409
so that the overwhelming feeling can

110
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:02,919
calm down once it's explained to them

111
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,480
and they can feel comfortable with any

112
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,939
any kind of purchase that they got going

113
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,620
on so you intentionally overwhelmed them

114
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:11,589
and then you throw them the life raft

115
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:15,370
exactly exactly in terms of an educator

116
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:17,619
and again back to the one size fits all

117
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,418
there's so many different types of flour

118
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,079
different types of cartridges different

119
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:24,849
types of concentrates it's everyone

120
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:26,439
needs a different type either indica

121
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,990
hybrid or sativa so we like to have a

122
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:30,490
huge variety so they can try multiple

123
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,400
different types and find out exactly

124
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,590
what works best for them as well as what

125
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:37,659
they enjoy them so we like to have that

126
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:40,599
huge variety we always like bringing on

127
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,490
new different products so that when they

128
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,419
come in one week maybe the next week

129
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,579
they're gonna have something that they

130
00:05:43,418 --> 00:05:48,549
haven't seen before and we can offer it

131
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:50,859
to them as a good substitute or an even

132
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,930
better product and they try it so what's

133
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,050
an example of a newish product that you

134
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:59,199
that you like and your so we just

135
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:02,379
started carrying the moon rocks so a

136
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:05,649
moon rock is going to be a nugget flower

137
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:08,350
it's going to be soaked in an oil and

138
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:11,589
then it's going to be rolled in Keef so

139
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:13,720
this is something that will burn for a

140
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:16,449
very long time it is not going to be

141
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,550
just a one-hit kind of deal it's it's

142
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:22,620
going to keep on lasting for you

143
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:24,819
this is like brandis's this is by a

144
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,579
chieftain we'll shout out here from

145
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:30,789
caviar they have a sativa hybrid or

146
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:32,740
indica option for you so you have all of

147
00:06:30,788 --> 00:06:35,500
your bases covered with what the moon

148
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,449
rocks so are you in charge of onboarding

149
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,490
brands like are you kind of them I'm

150
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:42,009
part of the decision maker I'm part of

151
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:43,840
the purchasing team I kind of do a lot

152
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:46,629
around here I've met I have many hats if

153
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:49,959
you will so talk about what it's been

154
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:51,939
like as one of the few dispensaries in

155
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:53,680
all event or a county just getting

156
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:57,250
overwhelmed with brands that want to get

157
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,709
on your show so that is an interview

158
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:03,339
must be a popular guy its shelf space is

159
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:06,250
an issue as you can see everything is

160
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:09,459
full we have grown out of our space if

161
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:12,009
you will but one thing that we kind of

162
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:13,959
look at numbers make sure that if there

163
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:15,610
is something that might not be moving

164
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,168
quite as quick we will kind of

165
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,759
substitute something that we want to try

166
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:20,829
to get in that might move a little bit

167
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:22,389
better back to we always want to have

168
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:25,418
something new on the shelf for people to

169
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:28,329
kind of check out and just give them a

170
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:31,029
variety of awesome new products what's

171
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:33,310
kind of your mix of like small scrappy

172
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:35,559
upstart brands and the big light like

173
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,870
are you carrying candy I see like forea

174
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,740
canned s like Papa and Bart are you

175
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,959
carrying Condesa

176
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,759
so we have some of the canned essent

177
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:47,228
pre-rolls we don't have their flour

178
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:49,840
currently in stock we have we used to

179
00:07:47,228 --> 00:07:51,819
have their flour in the shop they they

180
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,279
sold pretty well the pre-rolls

181
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:56,019
definitely are a killer hit so we

182
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,750
decided to kind of stick to what was

183
00:07:56,019 --> 00:08:00,879
really really well working for our shops

184
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:03,129
give me a really small brand that you

185
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,689
want to show some love let's see here

186
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:08,519
any product category I would say

187
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:10,110
we'll start with these guys here that

188
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,779
I've been pretty popular moving him

189
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,629
pretty quick these are the doctor Rob's

190
00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:18,419
pre rely I know him well and these guys

191
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:20,579
have done a really good job in our shop

192
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,790
it's it's a five pack of Cree rolls

193
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:26,009
that's a very affordable price

194
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:28,379
these guys are killer for on the go each

195
00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:31,289
pre roll is individually wrapped so once

196
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:34,860
you open the box only the one joint that

197
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:36,389
you open up individually is exactly so

198
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,210
that's really smart on their point I

199
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:41,069
think so so if you were to get into the

200
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:42,990
mind of the consumer like you've kind of

201
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,810
articulated some reasons why you think

202
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:48,060
this is resonating like the price point

203
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:49,889
the fact that when you open it it's not

204
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:53,489
like you don't need to smoke them all

205
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:54,929
immediately correct correct again

206
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,940
there's some of the companies with their

207
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:58,679
packs once you open up the pack it's all

208
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,120
getting their doubt you better smoke

209
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:02,939
them all fairly quickly or they're gonna

210
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,769
get dried out they're gonna kind of wear

211
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,480
down on you that they did a really good

212
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:11,759
job on how they pack their their

213
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:14,159
products right okay so if we move can

214
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:18,899
you talk about kind of the flour mix

215
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:21,029
between like your consumer do they love

216
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:24,299
their indoor do they love their outdoor

217
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:28,199
do they love I would say our top sellers

218
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:31,319
are our kind of outdoor budget shelf if

219

anywhere from 20 to 80 for an eighth

222
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:41,939
like I said we cover all categories if

223
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:45,750
you're a connoisseur and you want the

224
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:48,870

move you got you all covered here so our

229
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,909
budget shelf does a lot of movement

230
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,560
which implies you have a budget

231
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:03,209
conscious consumer

232
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,028
exactly one more consumer that

233
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:07,769
appreciated sangra exactly the exact and

234
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:10,528
it's like I can't believe this stuff so

235
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:12,419
cheap it's amazing yes and honestly most

236
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:14,399
of the flower there is actually decent

237
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:16,229
it's it's not something that you're

238
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,559
gonna come in and shake your head to and

239
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,720
pass there's a lot of really good

240
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:23,969
strains in that in that budget shelf

241
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,490
there for you what what's your typical

242
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,980
like typical retail the mark-up is a

243
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:31,230
hundred percent are you guys doing like

244
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,820
if you buy something for a ten are you

245
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:37,409
selling it for twenty you selling it for

246
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:39,060
thirty its we don't markup anywhere near

247
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:43,169
as much as the other shops around here

248
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:46,439
we would rather sell more product than

249
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:49,469
sit on products and have it make us our

250
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,870
money we want everyone that comes into

251
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,899
the shop to be benefited by the price

252
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:57,299
that's our main focus if we'd rather you

253
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,769
not drive out to LA we want you to come

254
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:01,049
here so we'll have the most affordable

255
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:04,169
prices for everybody and how many shots

256
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:07,349
are in for 20 I believe currently there

257
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:09,719
is five there is another one opening us

258
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,879
up soon kind of down the street from us

259
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,980
so I think there'll be six in total and

260
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,809
420 me and you might set sense you're

261
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,700
kind of an oasis in the middle of a

262
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:19,949
cannabis desert like you probably get

263
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:22,650
people driving from 30 miles away

264
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,870
I mean Ventura County has been becoming

265
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,549
more and more of a destination for lots

266
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,399
of different people from all over the

267
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:32,849
world we're only ten 15 minute drive

268
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:34,559
down Victoria so we're we're one of the

269
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,149
closest if not the closest if we got

270
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,939
people coming from Santa Barbara we have

271
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:40,289
people coming from Woodland Hills

272
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:43,380
there's a lot we have a lot of foot

273
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:45,870
traffic around here we can see up to 700

274
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:48,689
people on a weekend during the week we

275
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:51,810
average probably around 500 people so we

276
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:53,910
we see a lot of people daily here what

277
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:56,729
what's been the reaction of people who

278
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:59,939
are taking kind of high dose edibles or

279
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,050
whatever when they know like max out of

280
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,300
milligrams yeah

281
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:07,299
so the edibles have changed over the

282
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:10,389
past few years here with with the cap

283
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:12,609
being at 100 milligrams I know that a

284
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:13,509
few years ago you can get a thousand

285
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,778
milligram

286
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:19,298
type of edible everyone has their own

287
00:12:16,778 --> 00:12:21,220
dose I know people that can have 3,000

288
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:24,458
milligrams in a day and I know people

289
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,569
that can take 5 milligrams and feel a

290
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:29,229
little woozy

291
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:30,759
so we have the capped at 100 milligrams

292
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,188
so if you don't have the highest

293
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,959
tolerance it's perfect to get a 100

294
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:37,238
milligram bag you can dose yourself out

295
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,188
as needed to either help with your sleep

296
00:12:37,239 --> 00:12:40,869
help with your pain or to get through

297
00:12:39,188 --> 00:12:43,118
your day but like are you getting

298
00:12:40,869 --> 00:12:46,720
complaints from like the cancer patients

299
00:12:43,119 --> 00:12:49,059
who are like we we have ridiculous we do

300
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,778
get a lot of people that are upset with

301
00:12:49,058 --> 00:12:55,568
the new ways as you will see I kind of

302
00:12:52,778 --> 00:12:58,928
agree with them it's not it's not the

303
00:12:55,568 --> 00:13:00,729
the best when you used to buy that

304
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:03,610
thousand milligram bar and you can eat

305
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,980
half of it and feel as good as you need

306
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,499
it to you would have to buy a few more

307
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:11,980
bags in this case now to get up to that

308
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:15,189
milligram a lot of chocolate correct but

309
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:17,829
I think that because of certain people

310
00:13:15,188 --> 00:13:22,389
were not necessarily overdosing but

311
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:24,428
feeling too too high off of those types

312
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:28,058
of products is why they decided to drop

313
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:31,948
it down to the hundred milligram cap we

314
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:31,948
go check out the fridge yeah let's go

315
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:37,259
[Music]

316
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:41,340
and yes quickly since we just passed the

317
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:44,340
like the pods and the 510 thread stuff

318
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:47,340
are like pods like what are what's the

319
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:49,680
good what's kind of the reaction to pods

320
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:52,350
one feet like versus the open source

321
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:54,629
kind of 510 threads the proprietary

322
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:57,899
packs pods like with their own unique

323
00:13:54,629 --> 00:14:02,070
battery got it versus the 510 thread

324
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:05,399
traditional beep I would say that most

325
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:10,920
people go for the 510 the C cell based

326
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:13,319
batteries I like it I have all types of

327
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:17,279
batteries there are certain strains that

328
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:20,640
I like more for the tax pen there's some

329
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,980
that I like more for the 510 it's

330
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,629
honestly I just go down to basically the

331
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,220
screen itself in the oil that's in the

332
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:28,139
product I don't care what battery is

333
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,360
used for if I got to get a new battery

334
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:32,069
and I like that that pod I'm gonna get

335
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:36,870
it so show me what you're currently

336
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:40,890
smoking so currently right now this is

337
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:43,679
the Fisher Pinsky's pod door cartridge

338
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:45,330
here the jell-o gelato on this is one of

339
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,329
my favorites from them if not my

340
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:52,259
favorite it is a very potent a very

341
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:55,200
tasty clean smooth cartridge and is it

342
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:57,480
like a co2 extraction or this is going

343
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:01,140
to be a full spectrum of co2 basically

344
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,360
there so that's what you're hitting

345
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:05,600
right now correct and that's just a

346
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,940
straight-up 510 thread is not like a pax

347
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,560
yeah I just see cell-based any any

348
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:14,370
battery with a button that cartridge

349
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:17,449
will work for all right let's go check

350
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,450
out the fridge

351
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:30,080
so here we got our fridge we have some

352
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:36,319
of our chocolates the Kiva bars in there

353
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:38,240
we have some drinks sodas we have some

354
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,950
of the concentrates that need to be kept

355
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,159
at that cooler temperature to preserve

356
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:46,580
the Terps some people might not realize

357
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:48,049
that if you have your concentrates in a

358
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,020
warmer temperature it is kind of just

359
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:52,639
going to degrade the quality slightly as

360
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:55,069
far as your flavor and your experience

361
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,169
so for those people we like to keep them

362
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:59,028
at a very cool temperature so that when

363
00:15:57,169 --> 00:16:03,579
they get home they are going to enjoy it

364
00:15:59,028 --> 00:16:03,580
just as it left the manufacturer there

365
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,940
[Music]

366
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:15,350
my favorites are gonna be the 710 labs

367
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:19,009
products they just do a phenomenal job

368
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:22,700
on my brand on either the live resins

369
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:25,039
their batters their water hash some

370
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,959
people don't like to smoke anything

371
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,879
that's been extracted with the solvent

372
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:31,039
so they have their water hash that it's

373
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:34,278
gonna be solvent list to give you a

374
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:36,199
really good clean smoke and that's

375
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:38,088
that's actually some of my favorite the

376
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:42,339
water hash also there it's just a super

377
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:46,310
tasty very potent type of a hi there

378
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:49,520
what's the what's the highest selling

379
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:51,500
brand you have right now like what brand

380
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,919
is cred just in any category what brands

381
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,720
crushing it I would say like where

382
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:57,409
people are literally coming and asking

383
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,480
for it

384
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:03,079
mostly back over to that budget flower

385
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:06,558
we have a company called house weed they

386
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,970
offer a very affordable flower every

387
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,009
single day well that's going to be our

388
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,460
top seller so it's been are they selling

389
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:15,369
by the ounce it's by the eight all right

390
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:17,980
correct yep so yeah like I said daily

391
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:20,289
people from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. people in

392
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,450
here looking for that flower if we're

393
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:25,089
out of it they're a little bit upset but

394
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:26,590
we get it weekly so they might have to

395
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:28,409
wait it there's and where's that groan

396
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:31,149
you know that is going to be up north

397
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:33,700
kind of Emerald triangle kind of area up

398
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:35,920
there so basically they're hitting like

399
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,900
the budget conscious person would like

400
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,370
quality at a good at a reasonable price

401
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,840
correct that's correct and and that's

402
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:42,849
starting to resonate where people are

403
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:45,369
coming in and specifically asking for

404
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:47,589
them correct I mean there's some of the

405
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:50,529
budget flower that can be up into the

406
00:17:47,589 --> 00:17:53,639
higher 20% and there's some of the

407
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:55,930
top-shelf that can be maybe around 23%

408
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,690
I'd say the main difference is it's

409
00:17:55,930 --> 00:18:00,700
going to be just that smoothness that

410
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:03,940
tastes that you get for more that

411
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:05,799
top-shelf flower not necessarily the

412
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,259
high is what everybody goes for some

413
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:09,609
people really enjoy the terpenes the

414
00:18:08,259 --> 00:18:11,259
flavor that they get from the flower

415
00:18:09,609 --> 00:18:13,569
that's usually why you go for a

416
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:15,640
top-shelf type of product in my opinion

417
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:17,109
that's my experience with it but there's

418
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,540
some of the budget stuff that can have a

419
00:18:17,109 --> 00:18:21,039
really high potency that if you just had

420
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:23,289
a bad day you want to get really high

421
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,759
and and take care of your it kind of

422
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:26,829
worries there so what some of your

423
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:31,089
favorite top-shelf flower right now I

424
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:33,519
would say we have the connected flower

425
00:18:31,089 --> 00:18:36,159
the gushers is a really good strain so

426
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:38,079
connect it's indoor correct correct yeah

427
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,140
that's that's going to be one of my

428
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,909
favorite strains by far cookies has a

429
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,980
really good line also for their indoor

430
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:48,790
flower they have a really good strain

431
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:50,470
line up and I see collective they're

432
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:52,750
from up north they do a really good job

433
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:54,549
on their product also is that also that

434
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:58,779

437
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:06,670

438
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:09,339
connoisseur if you will I do like my top

some people who grow up in humbles and

442
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,150
Trinity in Mendocino may have a

443
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:21,610
different definition of what to cut it

444
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:24,850
up that is actually that is true I mean

445
00:19:21,609 --> 00:19:28,469
you guys are super busy it surprised me

446
00:19:24,849 --> 00:19:32,709
as a little shop on a third floor of a

447
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:34,660
sort of strip mall complex like I said

448
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:38,410
today's Friday we're gonna see between

449
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:41,620
six and seven hundred people today our

staff is amazing they they don't rush

451
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:46,839
anyone out of here we always like to

452
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:48,369
cater to everybody we don't want to sell

453
00:19:46,839 --> 00:19:50,740

455
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:55,930
tenders if you don't like it do not

456
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:59,710
recommend it offer them something that

457
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:02,049
you that you really enjoy so they come

458
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:04,000
back and they have a conversation aid

459
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:05,740
what you offered me was amazing I want

460
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,150
to try something like that if you have

461
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,480
anything else that you've tried that you

462
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:14,170
like we're here for the patients we want

463
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,660
everyone to feel taken care of and in

464
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:19,330
wanting to come back for their next for

465
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:23,500
the next day and kind of at any one time

466
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:26,889
I see Henry's and absolute if you kind

467
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:29,380
of peek at like two two vendors at a

468
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:31,300
time given the limited space correct

469
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,700
will peak up at 3:00 believe it or not

470
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:36,159
we can get three tables set up here with

471
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,350
different peds going Wednesdays through

472
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,060
Saturdays are the days that we have PA D

473
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:43,779
is just going all day everyone likes

474
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:45,429
usually between eleven and seven will

475
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:47,829
kind of break it up like 11:00 to 2:00

476
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:49,660
and then one from like two to five so

477
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:51,759
you'll change the brands in an hour

478
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,769
Brett are they all fighting to get those

479
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:57,400
slots like yes

480
00:20:53,769 --> 00:21:00,190
we daily get companies contacting us

481
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,680
trying to get in here for a PhD we

482
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:05,230
booked out are they paid to do it are

483
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,759
they no no we we want them here as much

484
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:08,289
as they want to be here is that when

485
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:09,879
they're here their product moves quicker

486
00:21:08,289 --> 00:21:12,220
which means we can get another order in

487
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,150
and get the product movement as quick as

488
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:19,210
possible

489
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:26,320
I would say that it benefits us as much

490
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:29,049
as it benefits them I agree so yeah so I

491
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:32,649
imagine I mean because it's it seems

492
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:35,049
like you know they're a ton of brands

493
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,730
fighting for limited retail space like

494
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:38,710
what what are the like are there any

495
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:41,860
brands that stand out in terms of

496
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:44,200
supporting you guys as a vendor I mean

497
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:45,399
definitely Henry is original they've

498
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,960
kind of been here from the beginning

499

500
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:56,079
supposed to be here from 11:00 to 2:00

501
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:58,360
every Friday they offer a BOGO deal when

502
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,129
you buy their products they also offer a

503
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,539
BOGO deal even if you don't buy their

504
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:03,670
product they will give you one of their

505
00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:06,009
products which is one of the only

506
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:11,050
companies that does that so when I walk

507

00:22:39,369 --> 00:22:42,250
some shops because I live in Santa

518
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:48,909
Barbara it was like do you want to smoke

519
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:54,548
weed and you're like I've been doing

520
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:55,450
that for 40 years so yeah they they show

521
00:22:54,548 --> 00:22:57,490
a lot of support

522
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:59,019
like I said 11:00 to 2:00 but don't be

523
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:01,058
surprised if you see Richard here till

524
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:02,519
3:00 or 4:00 sometimes we sometimes we

525
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:04,119
have to kick them out the relentless

526
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:08,700
he's an animal

527
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:13,658
yes he doesn't want to stay retired no

528
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:17,200
right cool so I need peanut gallery

529
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:29,500
questions or Lance is usually so

530
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:31,120
talkative what so talk to me I don't

531
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,409
know people like media analytics or

532
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,849
headset thought i/o or

533
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:36,070
new frontier data you know some of the

534
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:38,349
companies aggregate data on sales and

535
00:23:36,069 --> 00:23:40,569
trends dispensaries but typically it

536
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:43,178
seems like 50% of the sales are flour

537
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:45,970
50% err we'll just call all concentrate

538
00:23:43,179 --> 00:23:47,470
okay are you starting to see a pivotal

539
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,730
ship or you guys I mean you have a great

540
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:51,009
flower selection but you also have a

541
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:53,409
pretty good concentrate selection too I

542
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:55,480
would say like I said I think I

543
00:23:53,409 --> 00:23:57,940
mentioned earlier kind of teeters there

544
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,490
are certain days where concentrates are

545
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:03,370
the number one seller and most of the

546
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:05,940
time though it's the flower there are a

547
00:24:03,369 --> 00:24:08,678
lot of people that haven't quite

548
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:11,399
experienced or ventured off to the kind

549
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:14,740
of concentrate or cartridge side yet

550
00:24:11,398 --> 00:24:17,109
that is growing and growing no daily a

551
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:19,839
lot of people come in they want to try a

552
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:22,928
cartridge they want to know kind of what

553
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:26,470
the hype is about it's actually very

554
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:27,880
convenient as far as the smell as far as

555
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:29,710
what you have to take with you you don't

556
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,460
need to bring a pipe and a lighter and

557
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,289
your me

558
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,450
you can just take your battery with your

559
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:36,399
cartridge and you're good to go

560
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:42,100
so it's it is very very growing very

561
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:45,130
fast with the concentrates like what

562
00:24:42,099 --> 00:24:47,529
percentage of people obviously have

563
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:50,140
people who smoke concentrates coming in

564
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:52,029
to buy it but like when somebody has

565
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:55,030
never done it before and is like how the

566
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:56,649
hell would I even smoke this like are

567
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:57,970
you selling a lot of those people are

568
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:01,769
you introducing a lot of people to

569
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:04,059
concentrate it so for the most part I'll

570
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:06,069
start them with kind of something on

571
00:25:04,059 --> 00:25:07,450
that hash side or the crumble side

572
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:10,419
that's something that you can very

573
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,710
easily top your bowl off with I can kind

574
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,759
of put a little bit on top of your we

575
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,789
don't need to buy any additional

576
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:19,059
hardware correct correct it's definitely

577
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:23,349
more for the connoisseurs and a brick or

578
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:24,669
your pumpka exactly exactly that would

579
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:26,980
again I would say that's kind of more

580
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:29,529
for the connoisseur that likes that

581
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:31,329
the high of just that concentrates more

582
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:32,740
than combining it with their flour just

583
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:35,619
a top off something like that or

584
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:37,359
canister exactly cancer and then for the

585
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:39,159
older demographic since we know the

586
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,619
fastest growing is really like the 50

587
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:44,050
and up are you seeing that more are so

588
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:46,359
attracted to the edibles tinctures the

589
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:49,690
topicals the transdermal yes I mean

590
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:51,639
we'll see the 18 year old kid that just

591
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:53,920
got his card wants to come experience a

592
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,509
shop and we'll see the 80 year old

593
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,940
grandma that comes in here that has hit

594
00:25:55,509 --> 00:26:00,039
problems and needs a good rub or a good

595
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,360
salt to help out with their pain every

596
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:03,339
day we'll see a mixture of everything

597
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,109
there I'm gonna help you out we're gonna

598
00:26:03,339 --> 00:26:11,069
redo that where you're not gonna say

599
00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:16,079
that with their medical part all right

600
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:18,669
that's got it that's perfect a zero with

601
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:21,039
eighteen year old with a medical card is

602
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:23,200
only accepted in our shop here right

603
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:27,639
tell us about that so a lot of people

604
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:31,660
don't know what happened with kind of

605
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:35,350
segue into 64 for prop 215 so how did

606
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:37,870
the physician the medical patient so for

607
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:41,049
us here in every city kind of has their

608
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:44,829
own I guess way they want to go about it

609
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:47,139
we don't have a tax exemption for

610
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:49,720
medical or recreational we have the same

611
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,700
price for everybody the main difference

612
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,519
is going to be it ADA's equal

613
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:56,799
opportunity with its tax rate correct so

614
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:59,400
you have your medical card the main

615
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,990
benefit you can get more of a quantity

616
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,240
leave us up to eight ounces of flour you

617
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,220
can get with your medical card if your

618
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,740
just recreational you can get up to only

619
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:11,170
one else so if you do find yourself

620
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:13,089
needing more than just that ounce you're

621
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:15,370
more than welcome to go to a doctor and

622
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:18,639
get your card so that you can get more

623
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:22,719
for yourself and you and your team what

624
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:25,320
I tell me about your do you dream of

625
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,319
metric

626
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:33,230
night Marinette metric metric has been

627
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:36,620
quite a challenge here it is not the

628
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:38,240
most fun thing to go through at all it

629
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:41,329
is very necessary though if we want to

630
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,339
stay in business so we're we are close

631
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:45,289
to being on top of metric it's been

632
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:47,869
about two weeks now that we've been

633
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:49,430
converting over to metric it's not been

634
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:52,519
fun but it's something that we know

635
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:54,410
weeks work at so since mid-september yep

636
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:55,700
you guys have been taking metric very

637
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:59,540
seriously correct

638
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:02,090
erratic oh I would say bye-bye another

639
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:04,819
two weeks our shop will be fully metric

640
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:09,859
integrated and fully compliant with all

641
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:13,519
of the new regulations so let's say Mori

642
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:16,399
Ajax of the BCC is watching this video

643
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,009
is there anything is there anything you

644
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,030
would like to say that is kind of

645
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:25,640
frustratingly ridiculous

646
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:28,789
as you um deal with metric or so it's

647
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:31,880
it's very tedious work that needs to get

648
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:35,269
done in order to have everything in

649
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:37,910
place into their standards I'm not

650
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:40,039
really trying to complain its I

651
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:46,820
definitely feel like there's some steps

652
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:48,619
that can be possibly altered or shifted

653
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:50,629
around to make it a little bit more

654
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:53,179
beneficial for the actual shop here so

655
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:57,710
that we're not not necessarily wasting

656
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:59,900
time but we're still moving along in a

657
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:02,329
timely fashion as opposed to having to

658
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:04,550
stay working late hours trying to get

659
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:06,250
everything in place that was very

660
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:13,329
diplomatic

661
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:16,700
very gentle is is there talk to me about

662
00:29:13,329 --> 00:29:20,119
kind of the consumers reaction to the

663
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:22,370
tax rate when they see that do your

664
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:25,658
taxes show up as one line item or like

665
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:28,209
multiple line items on their phones we

666
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:30,220
I like to say we absorb most of the

667
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:32,950
taxes that are shop here what you see

668
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:35,319
tax wise is the local city taxes on your

669
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:38,048
receipt your only it is what in eight

670
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:39,970
point seven five eight seven five in

671
00:29:38,048 --> 00:29:41,408
Port Hueneme so that is the only tax

672
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:44,200
rate that you will see on your receipt

673
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:46,539
that is only what we charge you again

674
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,450
we're here for the for the customers we

675
00:29:46,538 --> 00:29:51,009
want them to feel we don't want them to

676
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:53,830
feel like they paid too much for what

677
00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:55,509
they bought so we we only charge them

678
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:59,079
that local city taxes on our on our

679
00:29:55,509 --> 00:30:01,750
products so just talk trade samples and

680
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:04,658
you know yeah so before metric is

681
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:07,298
actually fairly easy for a vendor to

682
00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:09,070
come by and you know give us samples of

683
00:30:07,298 --> 00:30:11,710
their products so that we can try and

684
00:30:09,069 --> 00:30:14,230
see if the price point the the quality

685
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:16,389
is going to work out in our shop dealing

686
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:20,048
with metric now it's been a lot more

687
00:30:16,388 --> 00:30:21,398
tedious of an effort to get the product

688
00:30:20,048 --> 00:30:24,009
in here we have to create its own

689
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:26,319
manifest just to get the product into

690
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:29,048
the shop which means on the vendor side

691
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:30,668
they have to create the manifest for us

692
00:30:29,048 --> 00:30:33,879
we have to accept it we have to put it

693
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:36,429
into our system so it's not a quick and

694
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,260
easy come on by drop it off process we

695
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:40,480
have to schedule appointments and stuff

696
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:41,859
like that for just to get a sample of a

697
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,860
product so we can see if it's gonna work

698
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:46,569
out in our shop or not and if you try

699
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:48,398
that sample doesn't the vendor

700
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:50,288
technically have to pay what the sales

701
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:52,689
tax collected on that product would have

702
00:30:50,288 --> 00:30:55,778
been correct correct so it's definitely

703
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:59,440
a little bit more pricey of a of a

704
00:30:55,778 --> 00:31:01,028
process now so so the small brands you

705
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,919
deal with how are they handling that

706
00:31:01,028 --> 00:31:05,138
because that's a big expense for a small

707
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:07,750
brand that's not well-funded you know

708
00:31:05,138 --> 00:31:10,000
it's a it's actually pretty tough for

709
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:12,099
them I know that they have to like I

710
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,019
said kind of eat a little bit of their

711
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:16,359
of their profits there just to get us in

712
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:18,638
the shop but for the most part any of

713
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:21,459
the vendors that are in our shop have

714
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:23,648
noticed an increase in their sales after

715
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,149
the fact so it is somewhat of a risk but

716
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,229
it usually pays off in the end for them

717
00:31:25,148 --> 00:31:27,879
no matter what

718
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:30,808
basically with knowledgeable about time

719
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,809
correct correct
