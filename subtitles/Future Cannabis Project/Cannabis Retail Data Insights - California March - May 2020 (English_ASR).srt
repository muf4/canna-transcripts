1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:10,138
okay we are live on the book of faces

2
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:13,710
California operators data geeks who look

3
00:00:10,138 --> 00:00:15,769
at retail and brand data and can drop

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:20,868
knowledge and insights we have

5
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:24,299
regulation gurus so I'm Peter Suvari and

6
00:00:20,868 --> 00:00:26,910
that is me and we're gonna kick it off

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:32,700
with Tamar from BDS who's gonna give us

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:35,130
a quick quick snapshot in time knowledge

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,950
data dump of what she's seen in the

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,980
cannabis market mostly in California so

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,649
tomorrow take it away we will be

12
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:46,849
covering some high-level market insights

13
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,379
and Kovach 19 update and then

14
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:52,890
specifically focusing a little bit at

15
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:54,149
the end on upcoming trends but as I'm

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,960
hearing on the street I'm not

17
00:00:54,149 --> 00:01:01,079
necessarily anything that will be

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,030
showing via the data but just to kick

19
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,728
off the discussion in terms of what we

20
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,978
can expect oh well we can all hope to

21
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:12,239
see with the development of cannabis

22
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:14,489
post these crazy - Kovach 19 days let's

23
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,329
start off with a little bit of a higher

24
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:23,789
view a little bit of a macro perspective

25
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:30,539
just again understanding of you know the

26
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:34,560
significance the US markets specifically

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:39,990
in California so looking out and then of

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,240
course 2020 through 2020 or 2025 details

29
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:45,810
we can see that currently not

30
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:48,118
surprisingly the US and Canada make up

31
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,219
the majority of global sales that's

32
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:53,250
expected to continue to be the case

33
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:54,390
through 20 to 25 however I do want to

34
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,188
just call out that current you know

35
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,430
obviously you have more activity from

36
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:02,639
other countries currently us in Canada

37
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,820
represent about 90 percent of all global

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,250
cannabis spending and so really they are

39
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:10,829
the dominant players in global cannabis

40
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,879
at the moment and looking specifically

41
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:17,610
within the u.s. at the

42
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:21,120
legal markets right medical and adult

43
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,430
use in this case for 2019 and 2025 we

44
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,680
can see the California obviously has

45
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,400
been and is going to continue to be one

46
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,129
of the primary drivers of growth for the

47
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:36,300
US market and of course as we look to

48
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:38,310
other states coming online specifically

49
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,880
Florida New York with adult use with

50
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,140
adult use sales we can expect a

51
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,659
significant market when those come

52
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:47,669
online by 2025

53
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:49,889
obviously that's driving a lot of that

54
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:54,269
the u.s. volume that we expect to see by

55
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:58,069
them now of course all of this is

56
00:02:54,270 --> 00:03:01,650
accounting for the covered 19 impact

57
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:05,509
however of course it's important to call

58
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:08,099
out that we are going to have a you know

59
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:12,179
regulatory and legislative impacts due

60
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:14,159
to due to Co bid obviously slowing

61
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,870
things down and not just the federal

62
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:22,109
level but this the local level as well

63
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:24,509
now looking specifically at Co very 19's

64
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,790
impact on cannabis so zooming in a

65
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:31,139
little bit into the legal cannabis

66
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:35,039
markets we can see that almost all

67
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:38,519
markets posed growth in March over

68
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:41,909
previous months Nevada's a little bit of

69
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:44,700
an exception obviously there were a lot

70
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:49,169
of significant restrictions in the

71
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:52,169
Nevada market around delivery only for

72
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:54,780
adult youth sales now a market that's

73
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:58,049
also highly dependent on tourism when

74
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:01,110
tourism is essential as a stem cell is

75
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:05,790
going to be even further impacted by

76
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:07,380
that lack of foot traffic and so so not

77
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:09,870
surprising to see Nevada take a little

78
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,459
bit of a hit however we did see medical

79
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,129
sales in Nevada

80
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,930
take a little bit of a spike you can see

81
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:21,209
that broken out here but at least

82
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:26,519
medical sales were up in that it I'm now

83
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:27,720
looking at sort of ranking of maturity

84
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:32,310
by markets and

85
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:35,670
we can see that the more mature cannabis

86
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:41,129
mark it's actually are the ones that

87
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:43,620
fared better with the Cova 19 in fact

88
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:46,670
not surprising right that the older

89
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,230
markets the more mature markets rather

90
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:51,480
obviously california's younger than

91
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:55,140
organ in colorado but it's in in in

92
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:58,530
legality but it's more mature and and

93
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:00,060
how long it's it's been operating and so

94
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:02,159
it's not surprising obviously to see

95
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,709
that the younger states with the newer

96
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:11,939
ordinances were more severely impacted

97
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:14,699
right and we've seen this before but in

98
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:19,918
case we have an i'm just going to focus

99
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:21,959
on a few key points first of all we're

100
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,539
looking right now across all states not

101
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:28,769
just California all legal states in the

102
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:31,530
US we can see this you know surges that

103
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:34,979
we've all seen already on of course the

104
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:39,059
Friday the 13th March 13th when the

105
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:42,270
pandemic was announced we see the 316

106
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:45,560
Monday surge right where the

107
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:48,930
shelter-in-place was announced and then

108
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:52,110
and then of course continuing into that

109
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:54,540
following Friday we see a typical Friday

110
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,370
surge and then however you she had

111
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,280
dropped following those that initial

112
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:01,769
stock up right so so you can see

113
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,959
obviously a slight decline right after

114
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:06,870
that initial stock up where daily sales

115
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:08,219
are following falling below average but

116
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,490
that's start as you can see it picks

117
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,370
back up coming in to 420 and actually

118
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,710
looking specifically at California we

119
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,860
can see that the dip below average is

120
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:22,889
Nestle slight dip in those days between

121
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,069
the surge and coming back into 420 but

122
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:29,129
not as much as as all states combined so

123
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:31,319
we're definitely seeing California as we

124
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:34,800
mentioned before right a more mature

125
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:37,348
market that's capable of handling a lot

126
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,090
of these supply chain disruptions in

127
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:40,680
this case it was a demand disruption

128
00:06:39,089 --> 00:06:45,239
right you know

129
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:49,350
and followed by erratic mainly alow and

130
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,840
but but but what we did see in

131
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:55,400
California more specifically and that's

132
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:58,529
actually across all states but we saw a

133
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:00,329
slight decline in the early transactions

134
00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:04,379
but an increase in the average

135
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:06,810
transaction value which is further now

136
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:12,149
promoting the notion that the consumers

137
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:15,120
were stocking up right in advance of the

138
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:17,549
uncertainty right but you saw them

139
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,610
making fewer purchases but larger

140
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:24,978
transactions and now one of the big

141
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:27,720
questions right that you know I am um

142
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:31,199
proposing to myself and you know bookie

143
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,419
than I out in our research is is it is

144
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:37,080
this indicative of consumers consuming

145
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:39,269
more right obviously I mean the purchase

146
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:41,279
purchasing less frequently income but

147
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:47,279
they're producing at a significantly

148
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:48,839
higher act are they going to blow

149
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,728
through that there now that everyone's

150
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,799
at home right I know I for I for a fact

151
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:53,908
from a flower consumer and I'm

152
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,908
definitely concerned making more than

153
00:07:53,908 --> 00:08:03,598
more than or coal so see if that's

154
00:07:58,908 --> 00:08:06,300
something that that continues I have a

155
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:09,899
quick question about this um any

156
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:13,949
indication if the stimulus payments have

157
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:15,149
played a role in now in sales yes and so

158
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:17,610
actually I'm glad you brought that up I

159
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:20,689
have a note here not until so coming

160
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,550
into 420 we were actually pretty

161
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:26,329
concerned I don't know

162
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:28,310
we as an industry also PBS on Linux but

163
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:33,500
everybody was keeping an eye out to see

164
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:39,259
how 4/20 was there and as you may or may

165
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:41,509
not be aware that you do have instead of

166
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:43,250
one major assertive day on 4/20 you've

167
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:45,769
got some certain states leading up to

168
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,720
420 right and you can definitely see

169
00:08:45,769 --> 00:08:51,590
that when the government stimulus tip

170
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,950
started with them in fortunately for

171
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:57,470
everyone just in time for 4/20 as well

172
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:59,629
as for the consumer but also what's

173
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:00,920
great about it is you know the way

174
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:10,330
California at least there was a

175
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:21,860
flattened delete button the 4/20 / but

176
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:23,810
incentive going around that flooding

177
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,629
into the shops on 4/20 right and

178
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:30,169
obviously defines social distancing

179
00:09:26,629 --> 00:09:31,519
requirements so so yeah that's good to

180
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:35,389
see that and he actually managed to find

181
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:38,120
the fourth 23rd checks coming in

182
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:41,269
certainly aided with for 2014

183
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,759
nonetheless 4/20 wasn't bigger than the

184
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:46,789
surge day of March the biggest surge day

185
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,759
of March March 13th in fact March 13th

186
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:55,490
was the third biggest day in California

187
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:56,590
across all of history so March 13

188
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,879
through 16

189
00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:00,950
yeah mic restriction was the biggest day

190
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,950
across all history so sorry excuse me

191
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,750
March 16 in dollar sales legal tract

192
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:09,110
market history let's just be clear

193
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:16,610
doctor yes legal legal legal California

194
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:21,019
history yes and and that's third to I

195
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:25,240
think 420 of 2017 and 2018 so obvious

196
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:29,769
sorry excuse me 2018 and 20 no 2759 2019

197
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:31,970
correction so 2018 obviously was still

198
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:34,340
getting its feet off the ground with a

199
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,190
new adult new sales and then 2020 as we

200
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,139
can see here they actually managed

201
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,600
flatten we did not want to see a surge

202
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:42,460
on 4/20 and we did it well we did but

203
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,090
not as big as it should have been had we

204
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:51,370
not flattened before 23rd um all right

205
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:55,389
so now with in price point bands right

206
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:58,269
so we see that not surprising right in

207
00:10:55,389 --> 00:11:00,699
addition to consumers you know making

208
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:04,059
fewer transactions right obviously with

209
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:07,300
limitations on I'm going into shops and

210
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:09,729
and such and with a higher transaction

211
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:11,909
values we're also seeing that the

212
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:13,870
majority of the volume behind

213
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:15,879
transactions is actually driven with the

214
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,370
lower price point products wares are

215
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:21,519
buying they're trading down so they're

216
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:24,129
buying more cheaper products overall

217
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,799
right now of course a lot of this is

218
00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:29,559
driven by flour and I didn't I don't

219
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:32,500
have any slides pulled up to reflect

220
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:35,049
that I intended to but enough time so we

221
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,450
can you can do another time but but I

222
00:11:35,049 --> 00:11:41,019
can tell you that a lot of lower priced

223
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:43,509
volume is driven by the flour category

224
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:45,460
which did see a bit of a surge on these

225
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:47,230
or did see a bit of a peak on these peak

226
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:50,889
days along with edibles and things

227
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:53,289
actually and interestingly looking right

228
00:11:50,889 --> 00:11:56,679
now just at California and shop and have

229
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:58,449
store pickup and delivery right we can

230
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:00,849
see when I say pick up and curbside

231
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:03,970
picked up we can see that you know

232
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:06,879
following the immediate days of the

233
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,470
announcements and with state with the

234
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:09,939
state allowing for curbside right for

235
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,740
justin regulations to offer curbside

236
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,810
delivery we see curbside beginning to

237
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,570
take share i'm in terms of consumer

238
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:20,559
fulfillment type or purchasing

239
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:23,589
fulfillment and incidentally that trend

240
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:26,829
seems that now also delivery took share

241
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:31,780
right well delivery maintain share we're

242
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:34,360
actually seeing that as as sheltering in

243
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:37,088
place restrictions start to ease and

244
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,399
consumers start to to get back out

245
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:42,820
actually in-store is beginning to take

246
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:46,419
share back away from curbside pickup but

247
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:49,939
delivery is maintaining all right so now

248
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:52,548
focusing on the california

249
00:12:49,938 --> 00:12:54,828
humor a little bit I mean we're just

250
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:59,088
like a quick over you kind of question

251
00:12:54,828 --> 00:13:03,368
um would you say that the market is up

252
00:12:59,089 --> 00:13:06,679
down or roughly where it was in relation

253
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:08,449
so if if you see if you look here and

254
00:13:06,678 --> 00:13:11,928
actually let's just kind of stay on

255
00:13:08,448 --> 00:13:18,108
California so you can see California for

256
00:13:11,928 --> 00:13:20,418
the most part is is where it was we are

257
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:22,249
however though okay look this is looking

258
00:13:20,418 --> 00:13:26,629
through the first few days of May if you

259
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:28,569
kind of look for you know similar view

260
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:30,739
is just daily conductions and average

261
00:13:28,568 --> 00:13:32,719
average transaction value but daily

262
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:36,349
transactions we are certain we are

263
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,109
starting to see and I count these few

264
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:41,119
data points is at the beginning of May

265
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:43,788
but even further I mean the you know

266
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:47,119
until we're mid May now so the last week

267
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:50,598
or so we have been seeing a slight

268
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:55,069
return to normal in increase in sales

269
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:58,369
also we're starting to see more regular

270
00:13:55,068 --> 00:14:02,448
cyclical you know weekly trending you

271
00:13:58,369 --> 00:14:04,129
know we see the general peaks on the

272
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:06,498
Fridays right before people go into the

273
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:08,599
weekend so post paycheck and and before

274
00:14:06,499 --> 00:14:09,769
they go into the weekend right we're

275
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:12,970
starting to see that come back to normal

276
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:17,089
right so we saw our last you know Friday

277
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:18,678
last real Friday on March 20th right and

278
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,979
then that's when you know you started to

279
00:14:18,678 --> 00:14:25,009
have you know abnormal blow slightly

280
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:27,049
below average transactions are taking

281
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:30,979
place right daily transactions taking

282
00:14:27,048 --> 00:14:33,828
place and now coming into the first

283
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:35,689
Friday of me and and and second Friday

284
00:14:33,828 --> 00:14:37,038
of May which I don't have displayed here

285
00:14:35,688 --> 00:14:40,129
but I can tell you that we're starting

286
00:14:37,038 --> 00:14:43,308
to see normal weekly cyclical activity

287
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:47,749
taking place at them so hopefully

288
00:14:43,308 --> 00:14:51,708
hopefully that means that that means

289
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:54,408
that we can expect things to be you know

290
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:57,708
going somewhat back to normal right I of

291
00:14:54,408 --> 00:14:59,600
this depends on on when people get their

292
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:01,368
jobs back right I changes regionally

293
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,720
speaking specifically to California I

294
00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:04,029
know there's still a lot of question

295
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,610
marks around the timeline

296
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:10,579
but but the biggest question really is

297
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:13,279
around the uncertainty around consumer

298
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:16,610
spending right I mean how tight are

299
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,980
there pockets going to be and will they

300
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,289
continue spending on cannabis will they

301
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:24,350
trade down either to lower to your or

302
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:26,569
price products that like we saw over

303
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,659
here or will they leave the legal market

304
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,200
altogether right all of that remains to

305
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:32,959
be seen

306
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:36,200
I'm also wondering does your data tell

307
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:39,410
you about new people coming into the

308
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:44,900
cannabis market locked up people who are

309
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:51,740
like new to it I you know what asking me

310
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:53,209
shall receive two seconds so so actually

311
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,220
looking let's look specifically

312
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:57,370
California but yes one one of the

313
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:00,410
questions I've been posing right and now

314
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:03,830
are jumps of consumer research right we

315
00:16:00,409 --> 00:16:07,610
do semi-annually we do quantitative

316
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:09,129
surveys asking you know the consumers as

317
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:12,019
well as the acceptors and rejecters

318
00:16:09,129 --> 00:16:14,389
we'll get into that in a second about

319
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:17,929
the cannabis preferences activities

320
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:20,179
consumption habits etc now we are

321
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:23,089
currently in the field with our sixth

322
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:27,589
wave okay so we will be collecting

323
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:30,259
information on changes in consumer you

324
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:33,410
know among the acceptors is what we call

325
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:39,439
them but but you know as a result of

326
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:41,659
this Cove in 1910 endemic now I before I

327
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,990
jump into discussing the acceptor or

328
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:47,480
what I like to call the new consumer or

329
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,919
the consumer coming in let's just talk

330
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,610
about the existing consumer in

331
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:55,370
California so you know benchmarking to

332
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:58,629
other states we can see that when when

333
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:01,190
I'm looking here the you know poor older

334
00:16:58,629 --> 00:17:05,539
older than California adult you say it's

335
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:10,130
right you can see that California still

336
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:12,200
got a ways to go right an opportunity to

337
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,120
capture or increase its consumer base

338
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:18,400
especially comparing it to say a

339
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:18,399
Washington or an Oregon right

340
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,000
well actually in Oregon Washington

341
00:17:21,288 --> 00:17:26,148
actually is a little bit of a funny

342
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,839
state but but California you did

343
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:34,250
we did see a 60% in percent of the

344
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:36,528
California consumers from 2017 to 2019

345
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:41,359
if you benchmark that to Colorado

346
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:44,839
Colorado saw 75% in consumers over that

347
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:51,079
same time period and so we definitely do

348
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:52,849
have a nice growth potential still in

349
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:55,220
terms of capturing additional consumers

350
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:57,829
if we actually look at at this breakup

351
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:02,058
in California of the consumer acceptor

352
00:17:57,829 --> 00:18:03,408
rejector now the consumer is these are

353
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:05,269
folks that don't currently consume what

354
00:18:03,409 --> 00:18:07,278
are open to it I'm sorry the consumer is

355
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:09,888
sorry these are folks that consume right

356
00:18:07,278 --> 00:18:11,148
you can see that purple segment in

357
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:13,428
California as we saw before slowly

358
00:18:11,148 --> 00:18:14,479
increasing over time the acceptor these

359
00:18:13,429 --> 00:18:18,320
are the folks that don't currently

360
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,120
consume but are open to it that's you

361
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,009
know call it your low-hanging fruit call

362
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:24,918
it your untapped target market whatever

363
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:26,658
that may be but that's a significant

364
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:29,299
portion of the population this is adults

365
00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:31,278
over 21 in California that doesn't

366
00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:32,569
currently consume but is waiting for

367
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:35,058
somebody to tell them what to buy and

368
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:36,829
where to buy it essentially now I've

369
00:18:35,058 --> 00:18:40,638
been talking about this segment for

370
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:42,500
years years I mean you can probably I'm

371
00:18:40,638 --> 00:18:44,898
sure Peter remembers me talking about

372
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:48,710
these acceptors from three four years

373
00:18:44,898 --> 00:18:53,479
ago i I've been long waiting for them to

374
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:55,880
come in and I am now well we cannot

375
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,409
speak to this in the data just yet as

376
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,649
like I said we're still in the field

377
00:18:57,409 --> 00:19:02,778
with the next wave of this survey I can

378
00:19:00,648 --> 00:19:04,819
tell you that I have been seeing and

379
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:06,349
hearing seeing and hearing from

380
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:10,099
dispensaries right as well as

381
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:12,740
anecdotally reported from my friends my

382
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:16,129
cohort that a lot of these consumers are

383
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:18,798
now turning to cannabis right to just

384
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:21,110
solve a lot of their kovat 19 problems

385
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:24,679
if you will you know they're stuck at

386
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:25,969
home with two kids you know drinking

387
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:28,639
half a bottle of Chardonnay and I

388
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:31,370
looking to make healthier choices for

389
00:19:28,638 --> 00:19:34,519
them and their family and our Chinese

390
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:38,029
and actually see Peters sharing the

391
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:44,839
photo I shared with him and now who told

392
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:48,710
this person what to buy so so so this is

393
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:50,109
my friend never she actually I've

394
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,700
watched over the last four years

395
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:54,289
involved from a rejecter to an acceptor

396
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:58,100
and then an exec and accepted to a

397
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:59,779
consumer and and actually that that last

398
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:00,589
evolution just took place in the last

399
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:03,259
few weeks

400
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:05,419
she called me you know you're she's your

401
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:07,309
typical I will refrain from using her

402
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:10,550
name but she's your typical Chardonnay

403
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:12,259
soccer mom you know thirty mid thirty

404
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:16,369
year old mother of to Southern

405
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:20,000
California disposable income I'm looking

406
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:23,149
to you know substitute her Chardonnay

407
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,339
with healthier choices and so I'm here

408
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:27,340
let me reassure my screaming again but

409
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:31,909
but this so this my you know my friend

410
00:20:30,619 --> 00:20:34,699
called me a couple weeks ago and said

411
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:36,170
tell me what to buy right and I gave her

412
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,819
a list of a bunch of different products

413
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:41,120
to try as you can see you know mostly I

414
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:44,539
stuck to low dose wrap it on set right a

415
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:47,529
couple free rolls but you know wanted to

416
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:52,519
give her the experience of a different

417
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:53,980
ingestion or intake methods but she as

418
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:56,480
you can tell she had no problem dropping

419
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,120
180-190 dollars right I mean she that

420
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,160
was in one in one visit and so actually

421
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:03,079
as we look at you know previous slides

422
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,410
with in you know increased consumer

423
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:09,199
spend or average transaction size

424
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:12,529
increasing we could pose the question is

425
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,200
it existing cannabis consumer is buying

426
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:18,319
more low-priced products that at higher

427
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,809
volume right stocking off or is it

428
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:24,829
potentially some new consumer is also

429
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:27,500
coming in and spending a larger amounts

430
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:31,189
right like like this unnamed friend of

431
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:32,599
mine so that remains to be seen but I'm

432
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,980
actually gonna move quickly through this

433
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:37,730
because I realized I've taken way more

434
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,380
time than I wanted to what's important

435
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,880
to note here is that we're seeing the

436
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,530
total consumer plus acceptor base

437
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,140
increasing right so the total

438
00:21:42,529 --> 00:21:45,519
addressable market

439
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,710
whether being existing humors or

440
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,000
prospective consumers is increasing in

441
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:51,130
California and that's always good news

442
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,109
and zooming through this really fast

443
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:57,190
it's a summary of the 2019 California

444
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:58,750
consumer with this fun little visual we

445
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,779
can see that consumer predominantly

446
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:04,990
skewed men not surprising made up of a

447
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:08,019
combo of Gen X and Gen Z Millennials

448
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:10,359
right that's mainly in that 25 to 55

449
00:22:08,019 --> 00:22:14,079
demographic about 20 percent of

450
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:16,990
consumers though are in that humor 55

451
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:20,019
plus year old demographic consumers of

452
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:23,700
per month spend about 135 dollars on

453
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:28,180
average about two and a half product

454
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:31,450
really use use cannabis to relieve pain

455
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:33,220
minutes audience sleep their purchasing

456
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,080
is predominantly influenced by taste and

457
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,960
flavor which is actually something that

458
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:39,309
I noticed sort of move up and down in

459
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,670
terms of being number one purchase

460
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:44,919
driver our purchase influencer that has

461
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,870
gone up in recent waves meaning

462
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,850
consumers really care about taste and

463
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:52,299
flavor which I will I will touch on in a

464
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:53,709
bit obviously price but but it's always

465
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:56,799
surprising to me to see taste and for

466
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:58,809
ever have such animal looking now and

467
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:03,220
within you know we're seeing obviously

468
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:06,250
trends within a cannabinoid specific

469
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:10,019
mostly CBD products especially in the

470
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:12,789
sublingual the sublingual subcategory

471
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:14,650
distillates within the vape category

472
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:17,649
accounted for almost two thirds of sales

473
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:19,450
not surprising top-selling edible flavor

474
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,590
was watermelon just throwing out so

475
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,880
quick highlights here that I know I'm

476
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:23,980
running through and not having a lot of

477
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,820
color but um I do just want to wrap this

478
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:31,900
up again give me this tender to chat

479
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:33,939
we saw constitutes an hour each doing

480
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,980
about a billion dollars in sales in 2019

481
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,430
edibles almost half a million and the

482
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:41,980
top three strains of 2019 or blue dream

483
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:45,670
poison and salary so a quick question

484
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:50,440
any idea on how frequently the average

485
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:52,600
person shops goes into a place once a

486
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,028
week but once it

487
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:59,199
it depends I have we have insights on

488
00:23:55,028 --> 00:24:01,778
that I think that I think that about

489
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:07,659
I think it's like 10 to 20 percent of

490
00:24:01,778 --> 00:24:09,700
consumers shop the most frequent is once

491
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:12,220
a month and I think about 10 to 20

492
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:17,110
percent of consumers purchase about once

493
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:19,538
a month and the rest you know bell

494
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:21,699
curves from there into you know weekly

495
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:24,908
daily and you know less than once a

496
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:27,990
month but I'd have to pull those exact

497
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:32,320
numbers I don't know if they talk Amman

498
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:36,399
and so so now look you know at 2019 an

499
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:39,908
aggregate we can see that a lot of the

500
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:42,058
growth was you saw 18% growth overall

501
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:44,980
over 2018 and a lot of that growth was

502
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:47,019
driven by not surprising the

503
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:50,470
concentrates which is predominantly

504
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:52,210
driven by Bay right category still

505
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:53,889
closing 22 percent growth year over year

506
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,538
for a massive category which is very

507
00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:57,219
impressive but we're also singing

508
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:59,138
impressive growth with smaller more

509
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,569
adult use oriented categories right

510
00:24:59,138 --> 00:25:03,908
which isn't surprising as you look at

511
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:06,819
the image that Peter shared what my you

512
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:09,070
know my friend my anecdotal Chardonnay

513
00:25:06,819 --> 00:25:11,288
soccer mom purchased we saw her

514
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:11,829
purchasing right even though yes I told

515
00:25:11,288 --> 00:25:14,440
her to buy it

516
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:18,939
we saw her purchasing you know easy to

517
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,230
use low dose products right so pre-rolls

518
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:23,110
I put that in the easy to use not

519
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:27,610
necessarily low dose but but edibles

520
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:30,490
right sub sublinguals I mean I don't

521
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:33,788
know that you would call the nanos

522
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:34,690
sublinguals but I say the fast onset is

523
00:25:33,788 --> 00:25:36,519
what I'm getting at

524
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:41,669
right she wants something that's

525
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:48,548
accurate easy to dose and and has an

526
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:50,830
onset so now obviously as this new

527
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:52,388
consumer enters right and has been

528
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:57,878
entering and we have seen an evolution

529
00:25:52,388 --> 00:25:59,740
in in you know the category mix and in

530
00:25:57,878 --> 00:26:02,528
general obviously you know faith has

531
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:04,309
been or had historically been grabbing

532
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:08,390
insane amounts of market share as

533
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:11,539
very easy to use discrete rapid onset

534
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:13,759
form of consumption however in aftermath

535
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:15,109
of a stay in the second half of 2019 we

536
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:17,029
definitely saw if they take a little bit

537
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:18,919
of a hit giving an opportunity obviously

538
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:20,559
for other categories to continue to

539
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:23,840
capture share such as edibles and

540
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:26,950
sublinguals as we see here but also and

541
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:29,149
improve oles excuse me sorry but also

542
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:32,150
giving an opportunity for flower to make

543
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:34,430
them a bit of a comeback and so just

544
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:37,160
kind of wrapping up what we what we just

545
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:39,200
went through you know we're going to see

546
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:43,220
bright new markets continue to come

547
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,620
online you know now in fact I'm hearing

548
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,630
specifically in California for major

549
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:49,250
markets that makeup up to about a

550
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:50,810
million and actually Dooley will

551
00:26:49,250 --> 00:27:00,230
probably speak better to this hey Julie

552
00:26:50,809 --> 00:27:07,460
say your pop in there but but I think

553
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:11,569
Anaheim Concord Fresno and another major

554
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:13,789
California city seem to be discussing

555
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:16,039
putting ordinances in place those four

556
00:27:13,789 --> 00:27:19,460
cities together make up about a million

557
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:20,990
people in population so obviously having

558
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,789
these additional cities and additional

559
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:26,059
access come online will be a huge boon

560
00:27:22,789 --> 00:27:28,730
to California cannabis we're gonna

561
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:30,919
continue to see this new consumer come

562
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:34,220
in right and thus the consumer evolve

563
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:36,110
the question is you know is now you know

564
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,660
we've seen this slow entrance of the new

565
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:40,490
consumer but is now going to be the time

566
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,040
right is now going to be there real in

567
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,599
flux is it finally as cannabis has been

568
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:48,589
deemed in a central business right

569
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:50,299
nationwide in most markets is that you

570
00:27:48,589 --> 00:27:52,699
know really the stamp of approval for

571
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:55,279
the you know that final D stigmatization

572
00:27:52,700 --> 00:28:00,370
right that final okay to everyone this

573
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:03,649
is a safe and healthy alternative and

574
00:28:00,369 --> 00:28:04,939
and finally with that you know we're

575
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:06,530
going to see continued product

576
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:09,320
development right so to address these

577
00:28:06,529 --> 00:28:11,329
new consumers who expect you know a

578
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:13,329
certain level of delivery in their

579
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:17,059
product whether it be inaccurate

580
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:17,529
accuracy with extra dosing or onset and

581
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:20,019
offset

582
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,609
right or even just packaging and

583
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:25,420
delivery of you know the consumer

584
00:28:21,609 --> 00:28:27,250
aesthetics you know is this gonna be the

585
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:28,570
year right you know we've seen obviously

586
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,619
this evolution across a lot of party

587
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:33,069
categories I know we've been talking

588
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:35,799
about beverages for four years now

589
00:28:33,069 --> 00:28:37,929
everyone's been expecting you know that

590
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:40,569
beverage boom that we haven't seen well

591
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:43,210
along with that new consumer starting to

592
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:45,759
or continuing to come in perhaps that a

593
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,590
more accelerated rate is 2020 gonna

594
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,619
finally be beverages this year right

595
00:28:47,589 --> 00:28:52,569
with with advancements in you know on

596
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:57,099
set offset technology and emulsification

597
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:59,049
right and and and then and as well taste

598
00:28:57,099 --> 00:29:02,709
and flavor which we saw I was very

599
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:04,750
important to the consumer you know

600
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:06,519
especially in recent years so I I'm

601
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,230
curious to see where we evolved and

602
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:10,349
that's just you know posing some

603
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:13,660
questions for the group to discuss

604
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:16,859
hopefully that was useful and yeah all

605
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,860
right so let's get to it
