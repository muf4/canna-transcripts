27
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:58,919
anyways let's get to the point who here

28
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,299
thinks they're a good

29
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,879
person

30
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:04,599
[Music]

31
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:06,200
we I think you heard me say this before

32
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,079
all right so our attorney general Jeff

33
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,000
sessions says that good people don't

34
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,319
smoke pot who here still thinks they're

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,319
a good

36
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,478
person what do youall been

37
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,079
smoking who here thinks our industry

38
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,079
should have access to

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,960
banking who here thinks that our

40
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,478
industry should have the same rights for

41
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,478
uh tax deductions on the federal level

42
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:33,319
as any other industry

43
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:35,000
who here thinks that patience and

44
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:37,879
non-violent offenders should not spend

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,879
years in

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,519
prison so you guys all apparently think

47
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:45,519
the work that we're doing in DC is good

48
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,920
work because you're good

49
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,118
people I got of always say that ncia

50
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,239
we're kind of the bridge between some of

51
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,478
the nonprofits the local level and the

52
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,319
businesses it's an awkward place to be

53
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:57,039
sometimes but it's really the ability to

54
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:58,478
able to bridge that Gap and to make sure

55
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,478
that we're part of the community and to

56
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:01,679
hold our businesses accountable

57
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,640
as well as everyone else in the

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,079
community commandable on the same level

59
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,920
