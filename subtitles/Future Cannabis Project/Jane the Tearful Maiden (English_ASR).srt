1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:11,879
okay so so it's commonly known that that

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:13,469
in in in full variables that there's

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,030
approximately a hundred and thirty six

4
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:19,829
original landraces

5
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:24,268
from around the world and within about

6
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:27,049
four hundred years that tripled because

7
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:29,399
of cross-pollination due to you know

8
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,868
regions that they were growing in and so

9
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:33,179
on and so forth and that's why you get

10
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:35,250
some of your breakdowns of the different

11
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:37,380
types of Afghani or the different you

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,070
know your your base sativas and so on

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,950
and so forth

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,628
one of the one of the pure strains that

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,750
I was able to locate was called la

16
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:48,960
Juanita lacrimosa Jane the tearful

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,219
maiden I went over to Spain I spent 90

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,789
days over there I worked with a

19
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,800
cultivator just outside of Barcelona he

20
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,100
actually gave me the entire history of

21
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:03,289
that strain and it dates back to the

22
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:06,989
plague first first getting to Spain and

23
00:01:03,289 --> 00:01:10,349
nun in a cloister had been growing the

24
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:13,829
la Juanita they they used it as natural

25
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:15,509
medicine it was it grew inside the I

26
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:19,259
don't know what you call the courtyard

27
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:22,170
of of that of that convent there and

28
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,390
when she saw the signs of the plague in

29
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,009
the fishermen's village she went up

30
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,680
there and stripped all the leaves off

31
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,609
the plant boiled them in water and went

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,850
down and served that tea to everyone

33
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:35,099
okay

34
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:38,868
only people who died from the plague

35
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:41,158
during that period and of infestation

36
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:43,469
were the people who did not drink the

37
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,759
tea who refused to drink it they thought

38
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:50,670
it was a devil's you know thing okay so

39
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:52,290
and and the preservation of that was

40
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,368
actually carried on through the

41
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:59,009
religious sect not so much as the common

42
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:02,099
farmer you know having it available to

43
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,930
them and when villagers got sick they

44
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:07,559
would go to see the nuns the nuns would

45
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:09,569
take care of them but the name of the

46
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,140
strain actually came because of the

47
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:13,899
woman she was beheaded you know by the

48
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:16,958
king of Spain

49
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:20,830
for for healing those people there was a

50
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,259
land deal involved and they needed the

51
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:26,409
villages cleared out so that they could

52
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:28,060
build a French port and Isabella would

53
00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:31,568
have married the king of Spain at that

54
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,759
time and it was at that time that they

55
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:36,250
found out that this woman altered their

56
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:38,348
plans and there's a famous painting that

57
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,150
it was done of the woman hanging upside

58
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:41,889
to her body upside down in the form of a

59
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,569
cross and her head in the spike right

60
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:46,059
next to it but did koi stir is in the

61
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:48,339
background of the painting and in the

62
00:02:46,060 --> 00:03:00,670
window you will see the hundred percent

63
00:02:48,340 --> 00:03:05,079
sativa leaf yeah it was tripled tripled

64
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:07,479
quadrupled so so in from well that would

65
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:08,859
be from today we're talking about four

66
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,959
hundred years because you have to

67
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:12,310
remember hump was in huge production

68
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,219
back at the beginning and the

69
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:17,859
establishment of this country so we had

70
00:03:15,219 --> 00:03:19,810
seeds coming in from all over all the

71
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:23,280
European continents you know between

72
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:27,459
Spain God you know and Ireland Scotland

73
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:31,810
every place that they you know even Rome

74
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:35,289
Italy Italy was known for some of the

75
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:37,329
best highest grade hemp available for

76
00:03:35,289 --> 00:03:40,810
making you know for clothing and for

77
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:43,840
sales so you think about a lot of the

78
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:46,689
strains that that were crossed into the

79
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,639
original land races were hemp that were

80
00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:50,439
crossed into it and that's where you'll

81
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,290
find variations when you do a hundred

82
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:56,229
seeds you can find a variation of a seed

83
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:58,448
that gives you a higher CBD value to it

84
00:03:56,229 --> 00:04:00,878
so it's important that when you get the

85
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:03,459
plant to this tall that you take a cut

86
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:06,668
of it grow it out you know do it do a

87
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:09,098
quick flower of it and get a CBD value

88
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:11,889
on it get your THC values find out what

89
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:13,628
your CBG values are you know with having

90
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:16,598
the laboratories available through those

91
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:20,019
that we have today we should be able to

92
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:21,819
break down all of the individual

93
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:23,709
cannabinoids to a point where there's

94
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:26,279
not an illness on this planet that we

95
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:26,279
can't fix

96
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:34,219
you know I think when the creator

97
00:04:32,029 --> 00:04:36,459
reached his finger down and touched a

98
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:40,310
spot and the first cannabis plant grew

99
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:45,859
he knew exactly what he was doing okay

100
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:49,310
and up until man got in the way in 1928

101
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,840
man got in the way okay I don't think

102
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:53,089
our federal government should collect

103
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:55,339
any taxes I don't think our states

104
00:04:53,089 --> 00:04:56,929
should collect any taxes I don't think

105
00:04:55,339 --> 00:05:00,079
our Police Department should be using

106
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:03,650
any money raised from this okay because

107
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:06,139
they lied to you for 75 years they lied

108
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:09,079
to you they took this out of a doctors

109
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:11,000
hands okay so that they could push a

110
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:13,879
pharmaceutical industry that has done

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,930
nothing but cause harm and cause macular

112
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:23,139
degeneration to the human genetic that

113
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:23,139
is today and we need to take it back ah

114
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:33,228
my Panama red came out like Panama red

115
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:35,329
and I'm talking 1974-1975 Panama red and

116
00:05:33,228 --> 00:05:37,430
if you came out to the farm I would

117
00:05:35,329 --> 00:05:42,139
smoke some with you and you'd be you'd

118
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:45,740
be happy you met Panama red okay it said

119
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:48,019
this is the one thing you know the the

120
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:49,970
the the difference between okay when you

121
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:52,189
put a plant outside for the first time

122
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:55,070
okay generally within seven to nine days

123
00:05:52,189 --> 00:05:56,719
it starts to you know you're starting to

124
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:58,490
get your boost growth and everything but

125
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,410
it can take you up to 30 days to finally

126
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,990
get a sex on that plant unless you're

127
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,680
using something like Philo's okay but I

128
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,090
can't recommend laboratories for sexy

129
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,180
okay there was a point that I thought I

130
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:17,060
could but I cannot do that I had an 80%

131
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:20,660
you know success you know rate no is 80%

132
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,610
success rate with getting females out of

133
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,610
the seeds that we were you know that we

134
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,080
were that we were germinating for the

135
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,689
first two years but as soon as the

136
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:33,259
recreational kicked in and everybody was

137
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:36,079
doing it I think time became a

138
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:38,990
constraint again it boils down to profit

139
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:44,539
last year's test results

140
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:47,300
were 90% inaccurate 90% okay now you

141
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:50,090
think about that I grow 423 patients

142
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,639
that we have cards for everybody else

143
00:06:50,089 --> 00:06:54,049
gets their medicine for free all the XS

144
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,689
that we grow on our farm

145
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,210
I sell plants that's what I do I don't

146
00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:01,819
sell buds you will never see my buds

147
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:03,948
you'll see my strings in the dispensary

148
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:06,288
any of if any of you've ever smoked or

149
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:08,330
consumed the Strawberry express that was

150
00:07:06,288 --> 00:07:11,120
designed for adult seizures it works

151
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:14,180
I created it it's I worked my ass off in

152
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,470
order to do it and I don't care who

153
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,360
takes credit for it but the original

154
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:20,690
name was strawberry - - but they

155
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,770
wouldn't let me use - - it was a it's

156
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:24,259
mazar-i-sharif

157
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:25,909
that's the land race of Saudi Arabia

158
00:07:24,259 --> 00:07:27,469
crossed with the time wreck from

159
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:30,919
Southern California that's a natural

160
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:32,570
grown mountain side plant okay and then

161
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:35,299
infused what Kyle kushman Strawberry

162
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:38,389
Cough okay I went from having 18

163
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:41,840
seizures a day to maybe two maybe three

164
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:43,848
and that's it and now after continued

165
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,369
