1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,520
there we go all right so we have

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,759
proposed regulations for

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,080
certification of comparable to organic

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,760
standards for cannabis in the state of

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,719
california

6
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:16,160
uh anybody want to give their actually

7
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:19,039
scott i'd just like to start with you

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,480
give me your thoughts so i read it

9
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,720
before the podcast

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,118
and it seems very similar in nature to

11
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:28,399
what we deal with in agriculture

12
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:30,320
i guess to be clear and concise is um

13
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,000
yeah we work in the organic sector but

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,920
i'm not an advocate of organic

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,719
certification

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,359
um you know we've worked for large-scale

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,239
organic farms that use glyphosate right

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,280
in front of us so

19
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:48,238
casually you know so to me

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,879
i view it as um uh

21
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,238
unnecessarily restrictive which will

22
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,599
keep you

23
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:59,358
into a certain type of problem set

24
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:02,239
so i don't believe that it's not

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,239
necessarily that beneficial it's it's

26
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:04,959
unnecessarily difficult to navigate as a

27
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,960
farmer

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,319
and i think it's a far better goal that

29
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,438
is community-wide

30
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,079
we determine a new category that has

31
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:13,919
merit with

32
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,759
the the public that we inform them on

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,960
like living soil or

34
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,040
like what elaine is doing with

35
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:21,280
biologically complete

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,400
because you know there's certain

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,799
products that we use

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,320
that are too much of a hassle to get

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,840
organically certified because of

40
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,279
intellectual property on how they're

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,159
created and how the nutrients are

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,840
chelated

43
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,520
and they're perfectly fine but because

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,880
they're not stamped you can't use them

45
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,478
but if you do use them

46
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,078
you don't have pest issues and don't

47
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,599
need pesticides

48
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:44,239
so that's kind of the problem of it um

49
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:46,559
you know i i'm not a big advocate of the

50
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,239
entire process personally

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,680
and i think it's better to just farm

52
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,920
really respectably

53
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,040
and don't worry about a label to confine

54
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,759
yourself further

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,680
to further regulation and and um

56
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,239
scrutiny

57
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,520
you know i was i was excited to read it

58
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,039
because you know you always want to see

59
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,920
the positive

60
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,200
but you get to about page 30 of the 66

61
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,520
pages

62
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,800
and from that point to the end it's

63
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,120
punitive

64
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,480
it's these are all the punishments and

65
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,360
costs you will incur

66
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,759
if you do not comply with this and

67
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,560
there's only like maybe 10 pages

68
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:24,079
of material that directed you on what

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,159
they wanted you to do

70
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,840
and then it really referred to addendum

71
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,520
lists of

72
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,519
licensed products that had been

73
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,640
certified by somebody who paid

74
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,959
to be able to be in that position but it

75
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,318
was

76
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,959
the half of the document is punitive

77
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:43,359
and so i read it and i said to myself i

78
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,000
said you know i was gonna go grab

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,519
uh i wanted to go for this because i was

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,680
like hey this would be beautiful we can

81
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,759
create this beautiful situation it's

82
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,760
accepted people understand it

83
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,799
but as you go through it you realize

84
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,759
that

85
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,159
it's it's it's another punishment and an

86
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,318
extraction in pricing

87
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,158
and so if you if you start your

88
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,238
certification program early

89
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,799
it's this much but each year you go

90
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,200
forward and wait to begin the program

91
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,480
it increases the cost of the actual

92
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,958
program so

93
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:15,679
it's if you're not a first adopter

94
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,280
you're going to get

95
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,319
taxed two or three years into it and

96
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,840
there was there was costs on it that was

97
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,679
confusing but it was

98
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,039
the lesser the greater of a hundred

99
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,080
dollars or 25 percent of your gross

100
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,719
and so i'm trying to understand how they

101
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,080
intend to extract the monies from you

102
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:40,239
and how they will structure the fees

103
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,080
and it gets to the point where it

104
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,680
started making me wonder did i want to

105
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,920
even go through it

106
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,280
exactly and i was somebody that was

107
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:48,798
really like hey you know this is

108
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,439
something that could be positive because

109
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,480
it could give

110
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,719
us some form of recognition in the

111
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,959
in the agricultural world as a clean

112
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,479
product because we have such a stigma

113
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,640
even though we're really the cleanest

114
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:03,280
products in the market

115
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,798
which is the ironic part but being

116
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,560
certified does that mean you're not

117
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,159
going to fail a test though i mean you

118
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,920
can be certified whatever

119
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:15,039
and get a heavy metal fucking or a drift

120
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,759
fail and so then what you know and is it

121
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,358
going to cause

122
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,599
is it going to get more money because i

123
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:22,000
don't know what certification

124
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,680
has got fetched more money because the

125
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,959
price of wheat is the price of weed you

126
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,800
can add value

127
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,159
there's a story behind it you can get

128
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,439
more volume sold

129
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,600
maybe but is any certification

130
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,959
saying okay boom now you get this much

131
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,199
more money

132
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:40,560
now yeah not yet so if you compare it

133
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,319
to what's going on in the industry

134
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,319
already with dragonfly earth medicine

135
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,240
doing the dem pure certification and

136
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,959
then you have envirocan

137
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,360
um and then there's clean green there's

138
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:55,439
a series of different certifications

139
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,560
that are being offered lydia

140
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,800
i'm sorry what's broner's cert sun on

141
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,800
earth

142
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,240
yeah that one as well exactly and so

143
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,240
there

144
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,360
there's multiple options for what's

145
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,199
going on in the industry

146
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,639
um i really like dragon ball earth

147
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,120
medicine the

148
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,240
kelly and josh really have it together i

149
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,959
really like everyone that runs with

150
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,160
their crew

151
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,599
um just as a personal aside but you know

152
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,800
you have people in the industry that

153
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,560
have been in the industry for a long

154
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,360
time that respect the plant that are

155
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,399
here for

156
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,800
for reasons that you know go far beyond

157
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,038
just trying to make a bunch of money

158
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,800
and run a large uh scale process but

159
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,399
you're going to be seeing

160
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,478
are adopters of this just like they're a

161
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,079
biodynamic you know there's there's

162
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,519
people that are doing organics people

163
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,879
are doing biodynamics and

164
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:45,120
in regular you know the regular ag world

165
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,959
and it's a small percentage even still

166
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,478
and so just like you guys are saying

167
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,159
from a laboratory perspective just

168
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,918
because something's organic doesn't mean

169
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,360
it passes you know people go through and

170
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,879
they get organic

171
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,319
products to make their edibles like i

172
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,879
was mentioning earlier and they can

173
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,080
still

174
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:02,800
fail the testing requirements that are

175
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,000
um you know that are put out and

176
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,840
mandated by the state

177
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,360
for cannabis products to get to the

178
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,799
market so it's one of those things where

179
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,520
i do think it's really important that if

180
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,038
you have

181
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,198
any interest in the game you should

182
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,439
definitely be looking at the ocal

183
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,038
proposed regs you can make comments on

184
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,800
it until july 7th

185
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:20,079
which i encourage anybody that has a

186
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,319
commentary about

187
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,318
that specific topic to please you know

188
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,800
submit it because they really do seem to

189
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,000
listen

190
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,680
is what i've noticed in california um

191
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,759
but you know whether or not someone just

192
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,199
decides to adopt that or not doesn't

193
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,000
necessarily mean that their product is

194
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,000
going to be better or

195
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,439
worse than another person's and then

196
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,360
additionally as we're watching the

197
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,680
appalachians project

198
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,120
unfold you know that started years ago

199
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,240
um and they still haven't come

200
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,439
into a reality with that yet um you know

201
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,720
terroir and

202
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,560
you know the amount of plants that are

203
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,160
actually grown in native soil versus

204
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,439
those that are not which is

205
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,160
um you know a fairly large swing between

206
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,560
the two

207
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,840
um it's just something to really be

208
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,560
considerate of

209
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,399
you know again like those organic

210
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,918
certifications they can cost hundreds to

211
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:06,959
thousands of dollars you know

212
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:08,478
the amount that they're going to be

213
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,680
taking off your back end when we're

214
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,279
already dealing with such

215
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,759
difficult taxation issues in the

216
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,959
cannabis industry anyway

217
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,879
and whether or not that's right for

218
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,598
somebody's business is a personal

219
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,759
decision

220
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,439
but i do think that it's it's

221
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,759
interesting that after a couple years

222
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:26,160
they finally came out with it

223
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,759
um i think the naming convention is

224
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,800
pretty interesting that they're actually

225
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,840
using the word

226
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,840
you know um organic certification

227
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,519
um through the state of california's

228
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,318
department of agriculture and so i think

229
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,079
that you know

230
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,199
at least as within the realm of this

231
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,639
conversation it's going to be

232
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,639
interesting to watch all of that

233
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,120
come into reality no matter what it

234
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,680
looks like yeah

235
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,439
i yeah one of the hydroponic facilities

236
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,478
we work for has an employee that's a

237
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,478
lobbyist

238
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:54,240
and they're actually very active in the

239
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:56,000
ocal and so i think what the organic

240
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,840
people need to understand

241
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,439
is that they need to be as active in

242
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:00,638
their own certification as their

243
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,839
opposers are

244
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,639
and i would start there in real life

245
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,318
it's mostly

246
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,079
paperwork though it's not a lot of

247
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,199
testing i mean they do check to see

248
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:14,159
where you store all your shit but i mean

249
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,000
my farm was certified organic i went

250
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,360
through the whole process

251
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,079
to do farmers markets many years ago

252
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,520
and it's just a big paperwork thing you

253
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,918
know they come look at the farm

254
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,159
go right on you know but other than that

255
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,839
there's no soil testing that they did

256
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,440
at least you know through any of the

257
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:36,718
processes i went through so i mean

258
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,760
it's watered down at best

259
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,760
so uh have we have we covered the uh

260
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:43,200
organic certification standards for the

261
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,919
cdfa

262
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,920
yeah i think kevin had the best

263
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,958
description of the first three pages are

264
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,039
definitions

265
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,958
there's nine pages of what to do and

266
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,000
then 33 pages of how much it's going to

267
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,319
cost you and how much

268
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,759
trouble you're gonna be like i think

269
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:07,200
that tells you most of what you need to

270
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:07,200
know right there
