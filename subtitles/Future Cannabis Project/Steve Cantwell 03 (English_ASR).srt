1
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:20,820
you got to make sure that you're easy

2
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:23,489
your your your product is as easy to

3
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,960
sell on the back end is it is on the

4
00:00:23,489 --> 00:00:26,219
front end because again if they're

5
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,449
purchasing managers at these stores

6
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:30,359
don't want to buy your product I don't

7
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,669
care how cool a logo you have how what

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,408
kind of catchphrase did you run how good

9
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,299
your your your branding your this your

10
00:00:34,408 --> 00:00:37,619
that is you know they're gonna blackball

11
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:38,908
you they're not gonna want to deal with

12
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:40,140
you if you make it a pain and I ask

13
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:44,100
every time you show up to their story it

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,780
takes fucking three hours to take it

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,550
your order in with all the metric

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,170
systems and all this well guess what you

17
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:50,279
only take this to the half-hour they're

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,259
on point they're in and they're out I

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,609
got nothing to doing these here they're

20
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:55,289
gonna go with that guy even if you grow

21
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:58,408
sucking meds and you go the best weed in

22
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,640
the world that's just how it is so

23
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:01,530
that's definitely one thing you want to

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,460
focus on is making sure that your your

25
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,320
whole operation you know it's just

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,420
growing the best cannabis but you're

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,279
also have a really good sales team have

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,159
really good marketing team and you have

29
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,599
a really complete picture because it's

30
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,000
it's a different breed out there that

31
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:17,669
the market nowadays I mean you have good

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,899
grower you have you have a grow team

33
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,579
that there's nothing but grow the best

34
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:21,989
cannabis and they have geneticists and

35
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:23,399
have all schools and they have a sales

36
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:24,750
team does nothing but sell camps then

37
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,700
they have a marketing team that there's

38
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,799
nothing said on Instagram all day I'm

39
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,170
posting ads and writing people and you

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,649
gotta compete with that if you want to

41
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,570
be successful so you really do gotta

42
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:39,080
focus and really hit it on all on all

43
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:41,548
points again you can't just have LG Kush

44
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:43,289
and growing it you can't just have OG

45
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,118
Kush is growing it really good expect

46
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,770
you to expect to be successful you've

47
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,049
got to be good at every aspect of the

48
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:51,840
game and another thing you got to

49
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,810
embrace is the state in the regulations

50
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,939
if you want to be successful you have to

51
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,439
play ball to a certain point I know you

52
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,819
guys in California going through some

53
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:05,129
things now and it's not easy but

54
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:07,109
unfortunately it will it will weed some

55
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:10,649
people out and early on but if you can

56
00:02:07,109 --> 00:02:12,900
just get through it it'll get easier

57
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,900
like Nevada the the rules and the

58
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:19,349
regulations like even with branding we

59
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,688
had a had a product called baby J's we

60
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:23,158
can't do it we ran it for two years and

61
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:25,430
they told us that you can't do it the

62
00:02:23,158 --> 00:02:29,179
regulations are too strict

63
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:32,030
the big baby J's is slang J's is slang

64
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,099
you can't do it so we had completely

65
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,419
rebrand our brand from NASA cube but at

66
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:38,408
the same time I think they want to spend

67
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:40,789
50 grand arguing with the state in court

68
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:42,048
and making them wrong and proving them

69
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:43,250
wrong and all these things because

70
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:44,269
that's nothing to help my brain I saw

71
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,739
the helmet business that the way the

72
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:50,209
waste time in the wrong place so be able

73
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:51,620
to pick your battles with the state

74
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:54,200
regulations something like that is gonna

75
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,359
be really key now there is a time to

76
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:57,708
stand up to him like microbial testing I

77
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:58,879
was on every phone call I could for a

78
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:00,919
longest time about microbial testing

79
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,658
there the microbial testing with a joke

80
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:06,799
the longest time and if you don't voice

81
00:03:02,658 --> 00:03:09,259
your opinion it'll continue to to help

82
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,000
the people example uh synthetic growers

83
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:12,378
they don't worry about microbials like I

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,878
worry about microvilli because I use

85
00:03:12,378 --> 00:03:15,318
microbials you know back in the day we

86
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:17,780
had a total of aerobic count that they

87
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:19,548
tested for total over I mean is anything

88
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,829
that grows on that plan you will fail

89
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:22,879
for that was a problem so that was like

90
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:25,489
something you'd want to argue to state

91
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,858
about so to pick your battles with that

92
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,449
because again there's to be lots of

93
00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:30,919
challenges and there's there's so many

94
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:32,479
things that are wrong with the industry

95
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,040
right now you can't just go in there

96
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,290
guns a-blazing every single day trying

97
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:41,598
to make it make what's right what's

98
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:46,489
wrong right overnight anyways some new

99
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:49,399
data yeah so should we can pay the

100
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,688
market tons of brands one of the things

101
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,329
that you guys are gonna see going on

102
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:54,408
very shortly is that brands will start

103
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:56,199
to get bought out and I started to

104
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:58,638
consolidate and all these cool things

105
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:01,479
that's not always a good thing so don't

106
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,500
try to when you see that happening

107
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:05,000
getting bought out and all these things

108
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,699
it's not always a good thing I'm gonna

109
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,188
tell you is it can be but just make sure

110
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:11,780
you be careful who you partner with

111
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:12,828
coops here are you guys have a history

112
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,139
of coop coop

113
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:17,180
can work if they're they're written down

114
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:18,500
correctly and properly placed there

115
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,780
they're very beautiful you guys can get

116
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,300
a lot of strength by doing that so I

117
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:25,399
definitely recommend that that model but

118
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,050
just make sure that you're not getting

119
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:29,060
into business and building a brand with

120
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:29,780
the wrong people so because that's one

121
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,790
of the biggest things that could really

122
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:33,099
take down a partner

123
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:35,170
- I'm sorry accompany - is part getting

124
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,189
into bed with the wrong people so make

125
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,480
sure - trying to build a brand and

126
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:40,149
trying to build a brand with people that

127
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,650
stand for what you stand for because

128
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:43,209
again if you're trying to build a brand

129
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:44,859
or build a brand around the regenitive

130
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:46,120
movement and you've got somebody who's

131
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,710
trying to build a brand around they

132
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,220
don't care they just want the Green Rush

133
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:53,709
money it's not always in a jive that you

134
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,890
didn't have issues so just make sure you

135
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:58,569
pick a good team that can you know stay

136
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:00,099
in their Lane and back you up where you

137
00:04:58,569 --> 00:05:03,610
need to be backed up and not try to run

138
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,710
the ship like I was blessed in that area

139
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,120
I have four general contractor's as my

140
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:10,000
team they know nothing about cannabis

141
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,790
they're good old country boys they they

142
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,899
work 12-hour days and they're all in

143
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,379
their sixties and they still work

144
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:18,909
12-hour days and they trusted me to

145
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:21,399
build their brand to build their company

146
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:23,590
and they stay in their lane for the most

147
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:26,589
part and that's a really good thing I've

148
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:28,149
seen other companies that all the tools

149
00:05:26,589 --> 00:05:30,519
in the world for success there's no

150
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:32,139
reason they can't be successful except

151
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:33,279
for you know people didn't know how stay

152
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:34,959
in their Lane people didn't know how

153
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,759
stick to their strengths and it

154
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:44,889
basically cancer just basically rotted

155
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:46,060
out from the inside so anyways you guys

156
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:47,669
in California you guys didn't going

157
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,230
through a lot of things again there's

158
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:52,090
more farms more people going careful I

159
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,150
know how to grow cannabis then probably

160
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:58,659
anywhere the United States so being

161
00:05:54,149 --> 00:06:01,599
having a good brand I have a good story

162
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:04,090
behind your brand isn't a geeky because

163
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,540
if you don't have something again you're

164
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:09,039
just a white label and anybody can grow

165
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,420
able to dream anybody can grow oh gee

166
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,069
coach and your book and Girl Scout

167
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,720
cookie so you definitely want to make

168
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:16,089
sure that you're putting your name not

169
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,130
just on the strain not just on the grow

170
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:19,719
method but on the whole package like

171
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:21,459
when you point you by GOP you're not

172
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:24,220
just buying you know a no-till in

173
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:28,029
organic soil you're not just buying or

174
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,580
LED Brown you're not just buying any one

175
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:34,369
thing you're buying a note

176
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:36,000
iled grown properly cured good packaging

177
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,800
product you know you can you can

178
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,509
guarantee it's going to be what you want

179
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,150
to be every single time it's consistent

180
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:43,680
it's it hits on all points and that's

181
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:45,779
really what you want you have to be at

182
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,658
this at this stage if you're not copping

183
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:51,109
out at freaking 100 acres if you don't

184
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:53,938
have freaking coca-cola as an investor

185
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,158
trust me you wanna you want to take a

186
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:57,629
small niche organic market and that's

187
00:06:56,158 --> 00:07:00,449
that's what's on the save you right now

188
00:06:57,629 --> 00:07:02,280
because I assure you all these big

189
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:04,468
corporate farms that do have that

190
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:08,698
coca-cola backing this at that hundred

191
00:07:04,468 --> 00:07:10,288
million acres of light depth beautiful

192
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,408
freakin state-of-the-art greenhouses

193
00:07:10,288 --> 00:07:15,209
then trust me they're not thinking like

194
00:07:13,408 --> 00:07:17,848
that they're thinking how do I make the

195
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:21,388
most money how do we get the cheapest

196
00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:24,089
deal in rockwool how do I mix my own

197
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:25,079
nutrients so I don't have to buy them

198
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:26,538
from something I could just you know

199
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,188
make my own and dump them down the drain

200
00:07:26,538 --> 00:07:32,188
and all these crazy things so they're

201
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:35,278
not even thinking about attacking the

202
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:37,468
regenerative organic side of things it's

203
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:39,569
like you have a couple of small people

204
00:07:37,468 --> 00:07:41,278
that will try and then and I hope they

205
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:43,289
are successful because we need more to

206
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:46,019
be successful but the end of the day

207
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:48,838
it's really the only saving grace for

208
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:51,149
the small farm small farmer that doesn't

209
00:07:48,838 --> 00:07:54,778
have you know the billionaires behind

210
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:56,218
them I guess I got lucky

211
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:57,718
four years ago I thought everybody was

212
00:07:56,218 --> 00:07:59,370
gonna be doing it I was super nervous

213
00:07:57,718 --> 00:08:00,718
and I was like man freaking I didn't

214
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,949
wish like show nothing on Instagram I

215
00:08:00,718 --> 00:08:04,019
thought everybody in their mom would be

216
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,819
flocking to this style and we started

217
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:07,288
cropping out and we started doing her

218
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,879
brainy way start branding hey well you

219
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:10,649
know vatted know we had branding if we

220
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,150
start chasing our branding and trying to

221
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:14,908
follow our branding ideas and things

222
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:18,508
like that and nobody tried touching our

223
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:19,680
soil as samples I really blew my mind

224
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:23,270
and nobody was trying to sleep in our

225
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,889
gang soil indoors or outdoors anything

226
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:27,538
and yeah just a just show that nobody

227
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:29,490
wants to even attempt it I was it was

228
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:31,168
like my safe spot that I thought it

229
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:33,089
wasn't and it completely wasn't scared

230
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:34,649
is here the big-money investors away

231
00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:35,870
they you tell them that you grow a weed

232
00:08:34,649 --> 00:08:38,360
with bugs in the state

233
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:43,339
microbial testing they give me money for

234
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:47,450
shit it's a fact so it but it works

235
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:49,660
it truly does it I I probably say at

236
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:53,500
four years we probably have about what

237
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:56,750
80% success rate failures bill pass

238
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,980
about 85% it's a failed success rate and

239
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,339
keep in mind other first startup here

240
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,420
man

241
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:01,260
well you know about indoor

242
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:04,610
dehumidification and things like that

243
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:04,610
[Music]

244
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:11,470
yeah we got Aspergillus now since I was

245
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:16,100
my guide when you guys one of my guys

246
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:17,540
anyways so a lot of things watch out for

247
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,970
man and I just just know that when you

248
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:21,469
build a brand it's not one thing again

249
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:24,379
there's a million things you gotta be

250
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:26,330
able to hit on all oh it's like a race

251
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:28,039
team yeah have a good driver you gotta

252
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,970
have a big car got a good pit crew got a

253
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:30,588
good manager you gotta have a whole

254
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,089
thing running really smooth and

255
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:33,830
efficiently if you want to be

256
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:36,070
competitive and of course and that's

257
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:40,278
where we're at right now there's no

258
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:42,140
planet when I get to it this that willy

259
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:45,740
nilly you really gotta be on point and

260
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:47,389
data is your best friend in this new age

261
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,789
in this new industry there's so much

262
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:51,319
data out there that we can now for the

263
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:53,480
first time start to collect and actually

264
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,410
make sense of so again if you want to be

265
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,639
successful really looked at data I

266
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:59,899
probably one of my biggest leaf we were

267
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:04,189
just talking about this just the other

268
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:06,110
day and in our grill wasn't okay I use

269
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,029
this nutrient liner oh I did this

270
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:10,278
technique there's no we actually looked

271
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:12,019
at the data locate this drain test the

272
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:14,299
most which therefore makes the most

273
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:16,549
money this drain yields emotion which

274
00:10:14,299 --> 00:10:17,750
then obviously makes the most money and

275
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:19,399
we've sort of weeding out the ones that

276
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,110
don't yield don't test hide this now the

277
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:23,870
other thing we start structuring our

278
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:25,220
grow more based off of the data that we

279
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,870
were getting over the last four years so

280
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,480
now I know how to plant my rooms to hit

281
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:32,330
certain target yields but the same time

282
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,550
I got any sure I hit certain I can't

283
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:36,139
grow five pounds of a 10% strain you

284
00:10:34,549 --> 00:10:38,750
know I gotta grow I really go five

285
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:38,980
pounds of a 30 percent strained and you

286
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,840
know

287
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:43,210
20 pounds of a five percent strain any

288
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,440
sense so knowing your strengths knowing

289
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,350
with knowing what the plant when to

290
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,700
plant it is gonna be key and there's a

291
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,590
lot of data out there with this new age

292
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,810
of testing with all these regulations

293
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,490
that the state makes you go through it's

294
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:56,319
all it's at the end the day you can flip

295
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,720
it on and talk good data they're making

296
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,450
you take good data unfortunately making

297
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,370
sure with them but at the end of the day

298
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,509
it's good data is useful and you can use

299
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,190
it to build your brand to make your

300
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:07,600
company stronger to make things better

301
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,970
and more efficient

302
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,909
so definitely utilize that don't be

303
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,980
afraid to a lot of people will just will

304
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:17,469
bark at it like I said it's a chore oh

305
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:19,420
it's a burden if you look at it like

306
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,220
that your whole business is gonna be a

307
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:22,779
burden everything about what you do is

308
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,240
gonna be a burden the love of going to

309
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:26,829
plant is gonna die and you'll just

310
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,810
you'll hate what you do every single day

311
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,190
so first it's fighting and I recommend

312
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:38,919
embracing some of the things that is

313
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:39,970
best you can but yeah so again what we

314
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:41,589
did in the battle we were we were

315
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,600
blasting we were in the first market I

316
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,639
know you guys up here aren't don't have

317
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,230
that luxury of being first to market I

318
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,399
like I think I just heard Johnathan say

319
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:50,289
you guys just got some of your first

320
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,579
like ordinances passed or something like

321
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:54,549
that you guys and finally start to grow

322
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,379
out here up here up north so with that

323
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:57,819
being said it's an even more harder for

324
00:11:56,379 --> 00:12:00,340
you guys because now you guys are

325
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:03,610
stepping into arena full of people it's

326
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:05,620
hard to get your voice heard so again I

327
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,120
recommend doing things right doing

328
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,549
things that you know greedy people

329
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,929
aren't even to think of and that's just

330
00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:12,459
what's best for the planet it was best

331
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:15,309
for the patients what's best for the

332
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:18,250
people if you're thinking like that if

333
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:19,599
you're thinking more generative you got

334
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:23,200
the competitive advantage already

335
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,950
because again the 99% of who you're up

336
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,530
against ain't thinking like that so

337
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:33,920
you'll be alright other than that guys

338
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:37,149
pretty much out of words

339
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,149
[Applause]

340
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:43,039
you

341
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:43,039
[Applause]

342
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,539
you
