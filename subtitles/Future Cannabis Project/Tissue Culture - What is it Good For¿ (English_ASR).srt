1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,879
so we're talking tissue culture and you

2
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:10,259
said you've recently been dabbling in it

3
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:16,410
yeah yeah we hired a stem-cell

4
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:20,100
researcher three years ago we started

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:23,278
with by the way it was a stem-cell

6
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,350
researcher in human stem cells so he had

7
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,599
to quickly learn the tissue culture for

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,070
plants but it was the right person to do

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,130
it they spent about six months

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,710
developing tech and we went from just

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,450
quickly did he say anything that he

12
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,750
learned that was different doing plant

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,700
stem cell versus human I mean yeah

14
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,738
there's a lot of differences to it but a

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,690
lot of the protocols for clean run were

16
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:49,530
very important so having someone real

17
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:50,878
familiar protocols when in terms of yeah

18
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,198
the technology itself it's a lot

19
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:56,539
different but it started as just reading

20
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,460
papers on the

21
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:00,710
and then trying to replicate the studies

22
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:05,299
and then after that it was okay let's do

23
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:07,250
some real hardly anything there's a

24
00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:11,509
couple of famously bad paper job yeah

25
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:16,549
and there's a we started but after about

26
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:19,459
a strangle this auto scientist I mean it

27
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:22,130
was like doing from scratch learn it and

28
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:24,889
then you know the conclusion that we

29
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:27,959
came to in our here in Apple is that

30
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:31,950
it's great for certain things

31
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:33,809
or general propagation you know mom's

32
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:39,659
and cutting still seem to be the way to

33
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:42,599
go yeah yeah we started way before he

34
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,899
goes tot talk about what what was it

35
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:48,000
good for in your scenario so well we

36
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,810
were just starting to get into the

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,099
research on cleaning up plant material

38
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:59,040
and this is right about the time where

39
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:01,949
we've started to hear better you know it

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,850
is about this these mutations energies

41
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,069
being actual virus or viroid but we even

42
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:10,379
had the information and then it came out

43
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,139
you know about a year and half later you

44
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:15,150
guys did some research right only think

45
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:20,869
that Layton and please how blatant

46
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,870
poverty I think there's probably others

47
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:31,989
okay yeah definitely pop wait

48
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:34,389
yes really Wow as a cultivator you know

49
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:39,310
I've been growing for 20 years now

50
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:41,469
started to see those like real oh geez

51
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,140
and like any kind of old you later Brian

52
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:48,818
is it seem like at first and anything

53
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:51,518
that we but yeah it's an interesting

54
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:54,339
kind so there's there's been a lot of

55
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,829
like crazy research in the tissue

56
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,229
culture but it's good to hear that some

57
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:02,139
of the top guys found the same thing we

58
00:02:59,229 --> 00:03:08,048
didn't put in tons of money in tissue

59
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:10,540
culture for propagation IV yeah I know I

60
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:13,090
mean like we were in the space like

61
00:03:10,539 --> 00:03:14,259
probably like 2004 14 or so we started

62
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,239
it and it is funny because I was

63
00:03:14,259 --> 00:03:20,098
thinking back on this for us it was a

64
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,099
big thing was like we were out there

65
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:25,810
commands let's check out a tissue

66
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,340
culture because yeah tissue culture

67
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,289
we're like wow you do the math you'd be

68
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,979
like a million plants and read 10 square

69
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:34,310
feet and so we started exploring it you

70
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,318
know we built our lab

71
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:39,170
and same thing did you look at the

72
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,939
papers and never accomplished what the

73
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:42,708
papers promised but we actually did

74
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:44,689
launch a commercial line of plants

75
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:47,719
through tissue injuries scallop collapse

76
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:50,989
pretty aggressively we have this lab

77
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:52,580
that line of powder so we did but you

78
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:54,469
know at the end of the day you do the

79
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:58,040
math and you're like Jesus or our tissue

80
00:03:54,469 --> 00:03:59,539
culture plants cause there's just it

81
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,759
just didn't and then you know we would

82
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:04,549
do trials as well as question like our

83
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,169
tissue culture plants higher quality are

84
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:07,730
they more productive you know they

85
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:11,329
branch Warren every time we did a trial

86
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:12,949
in life good yeah no it was pretty damn

87
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:15,530
close either way it's pretty dang

88
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:17,839
closest note there's no clear there was

89
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,790
no clear advantage position culture so

90
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,738
yeah but like you said I think what did

91
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,990
become really a bug to us was especially

92
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:26,918
around

93
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:28,300
sanitation yeah and you know we saw in

94
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:30,038
Frank League like going back all the way

95
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,919
you know for my whole Tigers in the

96
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:35,199
industry people have always talked about

97
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:37,180
genetic drift right so genetic drift

98
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,939
don't you notice that plants do worse

99
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:42,610
over time and I'm like you know like as

100
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:44,259
like you know my life energy net assists

101
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:47,229
tell me that that's not a thing yep

102
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:49,360
right but what could be happening is

103
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:50,859
we've got those disease pressures right

104
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,960
and we didn't know what they were

105
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,900
frankly we haven't eaten in symptoms at

106
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:58,750
the time but we said like let's start

107
00:04:55,899 --> 00:05:02,138
figuring out like play-doh sanitation

108
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,180
like mariculture techniques and like

109
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:06,819
other like treatments of arafat to

110
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:11,860
eliminate viruses thyroids and other

111
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:15,189
pathogens and but it took like four more

112
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,870
years before we were really able to you

113
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,279
know we really had that we had we had

114
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:21,310
the phyto sanitation stuff but then we

115
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:22,579
had to do the sequencing diagnostic one

116
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,610
actually

117
00:05:22,579 --> 00:05:27,649
was over the culprits right now and the

118
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:28,800
hot lady I would was just that's all you

119
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:31,138
need to get a thing

120
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,329
yeah that was the biggest one I mean

121
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,550
that's that we're confident we should

122
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:38,189
like causality we really want you know

123
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,840
Jeremy warren is now director of plant

124
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:42,658
health was really able to go all the way

125
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:46,318
to identifying that causes the tutting

126
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:47,610
symptoms that we see but we you know

127
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,840
since we published that we've had people

128
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,120
come to us with other symptoms hey

129
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:58,500
what's this what's this and we're now

130
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:59,459
seeing other symptoms that are hp/lb but

131
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,288
we think they're probably something else

132
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:04,408
so we're going through a second a second

133
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:07,740
set of sequencing see what are some of

134
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:09,418
the symptoms you're seeing and yeah I

135
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,879
mean it's like all across the board

136
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:13,318
Jeremy's really the best to explore this

137
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:15,538
but you know frequently we'll see like

138
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:18,419
bearing leaf deformities or like really

139
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:20,610
common especially when they're like you

140
00:06:18,418 --> 00:06:22,769
know this is like kind of my like and a

141
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,500
farmer hat you know my farmer

142
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:28,978
descriptions like you'll see Leafs where

143
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:32,968
they have like asymmetric deformities

144
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:35,818
though like curved like various forms of

145
00:06:32,968 --> 00:06:39,389
modeling mosaic II type symptoms kind of

146
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:41,189
looks like variation but it's yeah yeah

147
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:44,360
we have I've seen that a lot structural

148
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:44,360
issues on the lead

149
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,639
it's not different than ago right right

150
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:53,069
you have it various forms of like even

151
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,718
like various terms of leap curving read

152
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:56,460
like leave talking and stuff like that

153
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:58,740
sometimes that's just nutrient but other

154
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:02,638
times it seems to be something else is

155
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:05,129
going on there so yeah whole plethora

156
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,319
even like you know weird like Fox

157
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:11,129
sailing on flowers and stuff like that

158
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:13,889
it's funny because h blvd we have found

159
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:15,150
is very widespread yeah like you know

160
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:16,829
now that we've got that and this is

161
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:19,560
really the key for us and what we've

162
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:21,000
done with tissue culture is turn the lab

163
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,939
into what we call a clean plant program

164
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,579
so we marry this tissue culture with the

165
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:29,069
mariculture various pre treatments to

166
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,718
get clean plants but also really

167
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:33,000
importantly we have the diagnostic lab

168
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:34,500
right so we have to after we go through

169
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,478
the process we have to like run it

170
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,550
through the lab to confirm whether is in

171
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,438
fact it's a plant and then frankly like

172
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,810
in what we call our elite mom repository

173
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:44,610
routinely test to make sure that those

174
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,110
plants have not become reinfected right

175
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,028
because i mean you really have to get

176
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,930
rid of the viral all the way throughout

177
00:07:48,028 --> 00:07:53,949
the plant okay you can hide it

178
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:55,280
where you have a lower branch that has

179
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:57,319
yeah

180
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,269
that's one of the really surprising

181
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,159
things is that this is like you know

182
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:02,959
it's been described to me as like you

183
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,090
know it's like you would be looking for

184
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,859
one person on the planet Mars right it's

185
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:08,989
like potentially the scale you're

186
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:12,110
dealing with and even like with really

187
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,400
precise pcr Diagnostics like for us we

188
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,500
don't really consider anything clean

189
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:18,158
until tests clean three times

190
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:21,658
consecutively that's great news

191
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:23,829
because you get a lot of false negatives

192
00:08:21,658 --> 00:08:26,228
one thing that's interesting we were

193
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:27,758
able to reduce the Dunning just by mom

194
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:29,378
select she's not even doing teaching

195
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,090
poultry just really aggressive mom

196
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:33,070
selection you know you take your

197
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:35,860
thousand cuttings from your mom's and

198
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,610
then you take you know the top thirty

199
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:40,009
and those become long

200
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,570
do that generations and generations and

201
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:43,519
eventually you just kind of selecting

202
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,800
towards mm and you could reduce

203
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,049
it and we've seen that help along the

204
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,879
statistical yeah 100 percent like even

205
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:53,778
the first thing we ever saw published on

206
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:56,059
studying because Rick Prum presented

207
00:08:53,778 --> 00:08:58,189
like the Emerald Conference years ago

208
00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:59,569
and that was like really best practice

209
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:01,399
you know even before anyone knew that

210
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:04,640
Wow yes it's just why he's doing it a

211
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,889
select select select select call call

212
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,028
bad stuff select select and it's funny

213
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:10,250
we still have known enough about the

214
00:09:08,028 --> 00:09:12,200
thyroid to like know exactly how that

215
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,720
works but yeah they do call it late

216
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,079
reasonably if it can exist a

217
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,350
symptomatically and frequently does so

218
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:22,639
you know presumably you just get the

219
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,300
pressure below a certain point or

220
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,819
something like that

221
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:26,870
you can yeah he can manage but that's a

222
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,300
really good point yeah I mean we've

223
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:32,299
noticed also it seems I mean this is

224
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:34,039
just kind of observation that the

225
00:09:32,299 --> 00:09:36,078
environment and you know the way they

226
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:38,639
grow the plant can also influence how

227
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:41,639
the symptoms

228
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,990
so baby you know your your environment

229
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,490
is on point everything's perfect

230
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,820
Lighting's perfect planets super happy

231
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:50,700
and the viroid does it effectively to

232
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,520
something it's dress yeah I know like so

233
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,620
my version of that is like we we get

234
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,980
receive many more symptomatic clients

235
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:01,289
with inner growers but like green house

236
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,259
and especially outdoor growers seem to

237
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:05,549
have far fewer symptoms and so like we

238
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:07,200
don't know exactly what that is but

239
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:10,079
probably something environmental as well

240
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:17,730
yeah yeah hot and cold or maybe it's the

241
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:20,370
light or something the epigenetics I

242
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:22,830
mean I guess it's the the plants ability

243
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:24,750
to trigger certain certain genes and

244
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,550
I've heard that with like outdoors rust

245
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,340
wherever you put something that's indoor

246
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:31,199
it seems to be real weak out and within

247
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,180
you know our season you could bring it

248
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,050
back in its strong and maybe it's UV

249
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:39,809
light or yeah yeah it's really a

250
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:41,519
jeremy's field of study on our team but

251
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:44,849
I do know like the plants do have a

252
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,220
immune response system yeah so you know

253
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:50,220
in an environment where that system can

254
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:53,310
work better it's going to be better at

255
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,220
it so yeah I mean I think just in

256
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:59,349
general indoor barak indoor environment

257
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:01,360
is much more stable yeah

258
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,550
although you can control it but the

259
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,199
stability itself is a lot different it

260
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:06,939
can be hard yeah well and it's just

261
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:08,528
unnatural right there's stuff that

262
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:11,370
doesn't doesn't always work the way to

263
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:11,370
find expects it to her

264
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,129
right one

265
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:19,720
I just want to get back to the port cozy

266
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:23,169
when we were over there before we came

267
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,610
over here it was for us here just

268
00:11:23,169 --> 00:11:26,979
specifically like the three things

269
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,539
tissue culture is good like remember we

270
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,670
talked about like keeping your library

271
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:33,969
right so can you just get into like like

272
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:37,509
what if why do we use tissue culture for

273
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:39,910
as a functioning grow operation and

274
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:41,528
where is it not really relevant because

275
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:43,870
then you got it to like it's easy to

276
00:11:41,528 --> 00:11:45,750
take a thousand clippings a week right

277
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,310
right yeah so for like proper

278
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:49,500
propagation Methodist general production

279
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:52,088
at a facility

280
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,490
seems like mom clone is still the way to

281
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:57,490
go for cannabis at least right now when

282
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:59,860
we did research on tissue culture the

283
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,629
one yeah the one benefit we thought and

284
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:04,240
we didn't really get to test it as much

285
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:06,330
as we wanted to but it was if you are

286
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,950
doing breeding and phenotype selection

287
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:10,750
storing those varieties you know it's a

288
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,370
lot less space and you can store for

289
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,889
quite a bit of time if you have the

290
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,110
right thing

291
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:17,639
but that's you know I still think

292
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,610
there's a lot of research it needs to be

293
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:23,129
done you can probably speak of that more

294
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:27,000
terms of storage 300 percent that's

295
00:12:23,129 --> 00:12:28,350
basically so that's for us we have to

296
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,539
clean by a program and we have the

297
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:32,909
genetic library that's you know it helps

298
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:34,769
us it you know it's the two combined for

299
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:36,870
us was what's really important right we

300
00:12:34,769 --> 00:12:38,940
can take a new genetics clean them up

301
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:42,690
add them to the library got something

302
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:45,320
like 100 varietals now at the lab you

303
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:48,120
know which allows us to offer more

304
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:51,310
interesting genetics more frequently and

305
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:54,279
also to know that they're clean

306
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:56,500
have you guys done any long-term stores

307
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,379
with cryo freezing or is it just kind of

308
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,149
life

309
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:02,560
wheezing about zero degrees

310
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:04,720
we haven't done any cryopreservation

311
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,609
stuff yeah yeah we have done a variety

312
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,579
of life long-term storage protocols

313
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:13,709
which have been mostly successful for us

314
00:13:09,578 --> 00:13:13,708
but never like the liquid nitrogen bath
