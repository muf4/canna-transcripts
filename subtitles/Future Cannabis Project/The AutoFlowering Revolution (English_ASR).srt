[Music]

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:15,120
sure yeah a history lesson okay well let

3
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:16,500
me just let me the reason why I'm

4
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,679
talking about it is because I've written

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,768
a book not for you and not for most of

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:25,350
the people that listen to this podcast

7
00:00:21,768 --> 00:00:27,538
but for your mother or your aunt and

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,269
uncle because I'm convinced that

9
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,510
autoflowering cannabis is the next

10
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:34,829
tomato once or twice in a lifetime as a

11
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:36,750
garden writer because that's what I

12
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,670
that's what I do in a different life as

13
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,609
a garden writer I can tell you that once

14
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,850
or twice in a lifetime a new plant is

15
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:46,469
introduced last time it happened that

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,710
you might remember that I certainly

17
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:52,379
remember is the snap pea when the sugar

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,210
snap peas came out oh my god people went

19
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:56,280
nuts it was a brand new plant nobody had

20
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,980
ever I've ever seen and so people went

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,250
nuts I'm convinced that autoflowering

22
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:04,530
cannabis is the next tomato it's a snap

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,450
pea in terms of a new introduction and

24
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,909
the reason why I say that is is is it

25
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,609
there are a couple of reasons the first

26
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:15,409
is that these plants which most people

27
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:18,060
have never heard of these plants are a

28
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:19,830
normal-size plan unlike sativa and

29
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:24,478
indica which could be you know anywhere

30
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:30,438
from 8 to 15 feet tall these plants are

31
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:33,450
anywhere from 18 inches to maybe 4 feet

32
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:36,868
they're shrubs at the best but they're

33
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,670
but they're smaller they grow in pots as

34
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:41,310
well as outdoors in the soil you can

35
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,049
grow indoors or outdoors the reason why

36
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,840
they're called odo flower is because

37
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,909
they don't have a photo period which

38
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,820
makes all the difference in the world

39
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:54,880
they are a cross between a sativa or

40
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:57,459
indica or sativa and indica and

41
00:01:54,879 --> 00:02:00,489
a Rudi Alice these were plants that were

42
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:04,118
discovered in the early 1900's in Russia

43
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:06,728
they were escaped from plantations where

44
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:08,590
they were growing hemp and evolution

45
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:11,800
created a situation where they went from

46
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:19,480
seed to flower without a photo period

47
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:21,160
only based on genetics and so yeah there

48
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:23,049
any number of you know grass

49
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:24,340
I mean lawns there are any number of

50
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,819
plants that are auto flowering plants

51
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,500
now the key thing about this is that is

52
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:31,299
that if you live in the northern

53
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:35,318
hemisphere even if you live on the

54
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:37,689
equator that 12-hour darkness plus is a

55
00:02:35,318 --> 00:02:40,238
problem we get 12 hours in Anchorage

56
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:41,969
Alaska right when the frost hits so

57
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,060
we're never gonna get a planted flowers

58
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:50,349
the plants that we are are all using

59
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:52,299
today have Afghani as a basis somebody

60
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:54,189
went over there and got this plant not

61
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:57,129
knowing really what it was what was for

62
00:02:54,189 --> 00:03:00,489
it turns out these things take six seven

63
00:02:57,129 --> 00:03:02,979
eight months from seed to harvest what

64
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:06,310
we have in OTO flowers is the ability to

65
00:03:02,979 --> 00:03:10,629
grow a plant from seed to harvest in

66
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:14,890
seven to nine weeks now when they were

67
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:16,750
first commercialized in 2000 two or

68
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:19,449
three with a low rider

69
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:24,939
they were crappy plants they were small

70
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:30,669
the yield was terrible the the strength

71
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:32,829
wasn't all that good the early often and

72
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,389
so as a consequence if you started to

73
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:35,799
look at them and breed them and fool

74
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:37,719
around with them people laughed at you

75
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,030
if you were on one of the you know one

76
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:41,620
of the internet websites you know they

77
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,900
threw you off basically

78
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,340
so somebody started Auto flower and net

79
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,760
which people want to go take a look at

80
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:51,870
today the science because these things

81
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:54,639
can be bred so quickly advanced

82
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:57,459
exponentially and around two thousand

83
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:00,099
eight nine ten the streets started to

84
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:02,189
get better the quality was phenomenal

85
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:05,370
the size of the plants changed

86
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:08,159
and I would say today we are at the

87
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:15,390
point where they need to be so what are

88
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:16,738
some of the improvements well depending

89
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:19,500
on what your perspective is you can

90
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:24,599
either Breeden's you know CBD and cetera

91
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:27,329
et cetera THC the lack of powdery mildew

92
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,700
has been you know that stuff has been

93
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:32,939
bred out and bred in to make these a

94
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:37,110
plant which your mother would grow in

95
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:38,639
her house or honor condo deck it is such

96
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,110
an easy plant to grow that if you add

97
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,139
fertilizer to it

98
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:44,939
you're probably causing a problem these

99
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,189
are plants that grow so quickly that

100
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:50,610
when an insect hits it very often what

101
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:53,339
happens is is the the life phase of the

102
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:56,819
plant is gone that the insect requires

103
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:59,539
holy crow so so the whole idea of

104
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:02,069
growing these plants has gone from

105
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,650
complicated you know you had to have a

106
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:06,810
degree in chemistry yet you know I don't

107
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:09,929
know but hydroponics lab lab left to the

108
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:12,209
most simple easy you go buy a bag that

109
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:14,670
soil you're sticking in a five-gallon

110
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:16,139
pot you put the seed in the pot you

111
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,480
don't even transplant it because they

112
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:21,918
don't like to be transplanted and bingo

113
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:26,000
seven to nine weeks later you have a

114
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:28,289
usable and I mean a usable cannabis crop

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,509
well these plants can be anywhere from

116
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:34,470
this big you know to about four feet

117
00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:38,519
four and a half feet well I saw yield

118
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,530
the other day eighty grams on a cola and

119
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,409
there were about eight colors on the

120
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:45,149
plant so the yield is phenomenal if you

121
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,860
just pop on the Instagram and look up

122
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:50,279
autoflowering cannabis you will be

123
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,350
phenomenally surprised this is the next

124
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:55,109
tomato now from a commercial growers

125
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,390
perspective in places like Oregon

126
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,689
they're beginning to use these because

127
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:04,319
the the advantages are phenomenal first

128
00:06:00,689 --> 00:06:05,310
of all you get a uniform size plant very

129
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,250
important

130
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,480
second of all you can you you don't have

131
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,918
to worry about the photoperiod

132
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,869
what that means is that that if you are

133
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:15,718
growing photo period

134
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:18,479
you can put these plants in between your

135
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:20,368
photo period plants whether you're in a

136
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,968
veg stage or a flower stage and still

137
00:06:20,369 --> 00:06:26,839
get results absolutely spectacular the

138
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:31,069
the ability to breed these things is

139
00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:33,990
wonderful because they are so quick and

140
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:37,229
you know the the fact that you can turn

141
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,968
over any number of crops means that if

142
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:42,418
you're growing outdoors you can put one

143
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:44,399
in the ground you know now and and

144
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:47,088
probably get two more crops in before a

145
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:50,430
frost hits sometime in October

146
00:06:47,088 --> 00:06:52,949
just beat Acula the plants really are

147
00:06:50,430 --> 00:07:02,728
there any specific breeders that you've

148
00:06:52,949 --> 00:07:06,439
talked to and kind of yeah well you know

149
00:07:02,728 --> 00:07:09,300
I would say on a general and the general

150
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:11,009
level for the home grower the tomato

151
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,610
grower I would I would take a look at

152
00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:17,759
mephesto seeds mephesto genetics

153
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:21,209
phenomenal in Oregon there's a company

154
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,968
called new breed seeds which is a sister

155
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:25,680
company to territorial seeds which sell

156
00:07:23,968 --> 00:07:28,379
already sells tomato plants so we're

157
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:34,168
really in a great spot you know it's

158
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:36,658
it's it's worth looking around now yes

159
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:41,248
and they're able to work on the genetics

160
00:07:36,658 --> 00:07:43,259
so that we can back back trace to some

161
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:45,449
of the land races this is really an

162
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:52,139
exciting tool that we've developed so

163
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:55,800
it's not necessarily no absolutely not

164
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:57,838
it's a tool it's a tool because you can

165
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,968
breed these with regular cannabis take

166
00:07:57,838 --> 00:08:01,709
some of the advantages of these and in

167
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:04,278
the advantages of regular cannabis the

168
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:06,899
bigger cousins does I'd like to save it

169
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:08,259
transitioning from my mom sure to the

170
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:11,290
hardcore

171
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:13,629
commercial cultivator selling flour into

172
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,890
the California market or yeah market the

173
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:17,949
Washington State market

174
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:20,169
what are those growers like when you you

175
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:22,449
meet people all the time what are their

176
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:26,680
thoughts on adding autoflowering into

177
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:28,209
their mix of light depth can I add

178
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,310
hunter not sure what about the

179
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:31,959
cultivator who says appellation is a

180
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,299
really impart of part of my future

181
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:36,759
survive sure well let's let's work with

182
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:39,549
the the the Appalachian part first I

183
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:41,049
mean I said you know Appalachian you

184
00:08:39,549 --> 00:08:44,889
know it has to do with it what I call

185
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:48,009
the three-legged stool genetics light

186
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:50,289
what's the light in your area and the

187
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:52,450
soil the microbes in the soil obviously

188
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:55,659
I would be a microbe guy and what gives

189
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:58,780
what gives the planter or I think are

190
00:08:55,659 --> 00:09:01,089
the microbes in the soil and the light

191
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:03,610
because the light has such an incredible

192
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:07,269
impact on the microbes in the soil which

193
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:09,100
make available all of the 18 nutrients

194
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:11,289
that the plant needs to have now we can

195
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,379
put all the other crap we want in a

196
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:16,750
plant that's not what the plant uses it

197
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:19,120
uses those 1718 nutrients and that's it

198
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,639
and and the ability to be able to have

199
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,980
specialized microbes in your area to

200
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:26,110
create that order so works with these

201
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,820
plants just like any other plant so it's

202
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:34,810
no different than a regular cannabis

203
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:36,879
plant and because you can grow these in

204
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:39,219
pots very easily and move them around

205
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:42,429
very easily you can create your own tour

206
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,440
or to a certain degree you can bring in

207
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:46,809
soil is my questions they can go into

208
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,370
the ground oh absolutely and or they

209
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:50,259
going absolutely because you know

210
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:51,669
oscillation purists go if you're in a

211
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:53,379
pot if you're not in the ground here

212
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:54,699
yeah well if you're really if you're in

213
00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:56,259
a pot but you have the soil that you

214
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,360
take I know but then then they go well

215
00:09:56,259 --> 00:10:01,169
then you can grow humble appellation in

216
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:05,350
anywhere in the world and that's true I

217
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:08,469
hate to say it but but these are these

218
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:11,529
are really spectacular plants the colors

219
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:14,680
the varieties oh my god it's

220
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:17,350
unbelievable and you know the fact that

221
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:21,819
you can grow a plant in a little teeny

222
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:23,950
area and get a usable harvest Wow so I I

223
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,990
think the future of cannabis is going to

224
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,700
be auto flower I think we're gonna end

225
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,649
up in a situation once it's fully

226
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:33,490
legalized where you're gonna be able to

227
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:34,990
walk into your you know your best buy at

228
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,940
Christmastime and they're gonna be a

229
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:39,039
little Christmas trees Auto flower

230
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:41,290
cannabis at Easter it's gonna you know

231
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,719
it's gonna have same tree but it'll have

232
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:46,990
that you know it's a little agreeing on

233
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,730
stuff well you know I said the same

234
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,669
thing about legalization and it took a

235
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:55,930
while but but I think we're there you

236
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:58,659
know I I predicted I a pretty well the

237
00:10:55,929 --> 00:11:00,549
microbe wave this is not a great book

238
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:02,379
it's it's just that it hit the wave at

239
00:11:00,549 --> 00:11:09,569
the right time I think I predicted

240
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:12,399
pretty well the mycorrhizal wave this is

241
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:15,160
so when you go to a dispensary very

242
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,309
often they sell the seeds the seeds do

243
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:20,100
not contain THC in them obviously so you

244
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:22,119
should be able to buy them in the mail

245
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,639
you know unless you live in a place like

246
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:29,560
Alaska where they've made seeds part of

247
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:31,419
the place you don't need to be but you

248
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:36,059
can pick these seats up there very very

249
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:36,059
available but but for homegrown

250
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,600
flowering sounds like it's going to

251
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:42,429
that's right you're gonna be able to go

252
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,680
to a seed rack and when you buy your

253
00:11:42,429 --> 00:11:46,899
tomato plant and your celery or your

254
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:48,549
carrots there's gonna be four or five

255
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:52,629
different kinds of wonderful is it open

256
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:53,349
source Science and Technology yes yes no

257
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,389
secrets

258
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,840
Rudi Alice plants are available people

259
00:11:55,389 --> 00:12:01,779
can breed their own you know so far it

260
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,700
looks like a very clean entry into the

261
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:06,009
industry I think it's gonna be really

262
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,080
helpful for everybody but we have

263
00:12:06,009 --> 00:12:10,600
improved everything we've done you know

264
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:12,910
I mean and we've we've introduced CBD or

265
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,670
brought it back we've introduced you

266
00:12:12,909 --> 00:12:17,509
know all sorts of things and this is

267
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:22,360
just another tool

268
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:22,360
in the chest and really an important

269
00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:32,959
