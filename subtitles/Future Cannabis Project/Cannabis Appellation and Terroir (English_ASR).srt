1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:18,290
[Music]

2
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:24,929
right citrus so it's like it's

3
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:30,150
antifungal but then I was to say was you

4
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:32,399
know I live on the coast Mindo coast so

5
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:35,488
even even by inland property it really

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,439
makes it time yeah exactly so you know

7
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:39,780
and and and that breeding came from like

8
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:41,759
decades of farmers coming in saying like

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,530
hey dude goat cheese and pineapple

10
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,599
that's what chicken and now I'm growing

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:50,460
a lot of royal cush the role cuz she's

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,820
actually doing gonna watch out for p.m.

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,090
oh that's so funny - that definitely

14
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,100
like that's that's that's our front

15
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:02,180
dudes funny you said you said royal cush

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,530
and pineapple right so so there's this

17
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:06,209
so there's this terpene it's a very

18
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,070
obscure terpene that you never really

19
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:10,079
see show up as a primary terpene it's

20
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:13,079
called awesome een and it's just an

21
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:15,900
awesome turf it just sounds like it's OC

22
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:19,679
IME you have awesome yeah and so awesome

23
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,150
mean you see in Mike so often we also

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,310
mean you see either track with me Racine

25
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:25,560
or you see track with Triple Aim so uh a

26
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,570
lot of the Hawaiian sativa strains

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,950
they'll be pedaling and awesome een but

28
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:30,269
then like you have this whole group of

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,070
the mirror scene strains like where it's

30
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:33,459
Mircea awesome een and that's things

31
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:36,579
like papaya and

32
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:39,879
Go Green crack dream clean stuff like

33
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:42,489
that but then also you know you have you

34
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:45,280
know in a similar group you have like in

35
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:47,640
the finds certain pineapple pushes you

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:52,150
know and and and so in this in this

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:55,960
varietal called royal Pines it's a cross

38
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:57,070
of in the pines and royal push and we

39
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:59,829
just tested it from a few different

40
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:01,689
places in Mendo to be awesome mean

41
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:03,340
dominant with very little mere seen and

42
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:06,640
so it's like it's so that I mean that's

43
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,200
that's such an exciting area during the

44
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,879
direction for us where we can help into

45
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,399
our breeders and farmers because it's

46
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:14,500
like if you can identify all the

47
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,789
archetypes smells and the roadmap and

48
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,289
then start working with them to see

49
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:19,000
which one's work better in your act and

50
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:21,310
your climates and your Appalachians and

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,409
all this stuff you know and then from

52
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:26,469
that knowledge you can start creating

53
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:27,939
and crossing obscurities where you don't

54
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:29,769
see certain terpenes ever show up in

55
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,269
with each other you know and and that's

56
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:33,550
where I feel like the real magic isn't

57
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:34,510
so much of us bringing back what this

58
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,920
plant has to offer

59
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:37,780
you know it's through the empowered

60
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,000
farmers and breeders who are you know

61
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,409
geek out on this Terp subject and more

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,620
then you know yeah like identifying oh

63
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:47,680
shit awesome in Fino dominated that's

64
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,900
you know point zero five percent outlier

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,090
in the ten thousand sample dataset you

66
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:56,829
know it's like that's unique you know so

67
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:58,719
but it's a regionally specific breeding

68
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:00,489
to it it's like to that so that that

69
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,099
royal pines is something we're working

70
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:05,739
on as well we go off mean gene and and

71
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:07,989
Ben Anderson from from animal family

72
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:09,640
they're doing they're like our emerald

73
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:13,659
mountain farms and that's man LeBron we

74
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:15,578
saw yes mandala brother and then we've

75
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:16,329
got gene and then we've got so we got

76
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:18,400
the end of

77
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,820
I mean jeans pineapple and we've got

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,400
this RK 47 and we're so which is which

79
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:27,400
was mandals like star child and we have

80
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,480
both of those going in because they're a

81
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:35,159
1 number 1 performers on our specific

82
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:39,909
land yeah they were bred I mean the

83
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:42,370
jeans pineapple was bred on the North

84
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:44,439
Face of the cotton Valley in Layton

85
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,230
though right so that's like you know

86
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:49,479
you're getting its dark by 5:00 and you

87
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:51,609
know and he's low he's got the old river

88
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:55,030
mountain rock influence so it's like

89
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,890
it's cold and it's sort of dark sorry

90
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,069
right not good not good

91
00:03:56,889 --> 00:04:02,619
you know and then then you have you know

92
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:06,430
so Jean is the perfect grower you know

93
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:09,370
breeder work with us yeah man most of

94
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:12,700
this stuff you know in you know redwood

95
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:15,099
you know Duff soil in comp tree you know

96
00:04:12,699 --> 00:04:17,439
so like and it now be it took off she

97
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:19,779
obvious we're like copy Alby desert to

98
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:24,699
so it's like so we're having this you

99
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:28,259
know this like you know cold or you know

100
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:31,750
low lumen dominant you know you know

101
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:33,189
pineapple which becomes susceptible any

102
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,279
other stream would be susceptible to

103
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:38,560
piling mildew and rot rot get botrytis

104
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:41,949
and surprising probable is again stocks

105
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,399
- yeah it does I have I have I just

106
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:48,759
harvested a green

107
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:51,549
before I came here and the out of boy

108
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,979
and I did yeah I did it the night I was

109
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,319
leaving for here I harvested the entire

110
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:58,180
green up and and then I left my wife I

111
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,770
think she's accused to be watching this

112
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:11,500
and the pigs and the horses and other

113
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:13,120
sounds like she was throwing shoes she

114
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:24,490
fucked up and taught me she could do

115
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:27,038
dabs so we you know we pulled it in it's

116
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:32,740
the first greenhouse I have ever pulled

117
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:35,740
in my entire life that had zero Wow

118
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,978
what dude you know how many oscillating

119
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,030

well zero do you and that's well that's

122
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,310
the thing is it's like that light and

123
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,709
it's like and we you're not and you're

124
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:53,139

125
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:55,388
nature you're like you know being

126
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:56,560
humbled by nature and helping and and

127
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:58,658
being able to connect into it to find

128
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,069
because I mean it's impossible I mean so

129
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:02,110

00:07:20,528 --> 00:07:24,278
indeed I went over incomes and you're

165
00:07:22,028 --> 00:07:26,860
not adequately posted or staked your

166
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:30,009
trellis it's like so devastating that

167
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,919
like you know thousand-pound are mean

168
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:35,408
$1,000 like you know arm just broke off

169
00:07:32,918 --> 00:07:37,870
oh and premature it's like Oh

170
00:07:35,408 --> 00:07:41,620
so basically appellation of origin right

171
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,990
is appellation of origin okay so like

172
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,689
the origin of how the plant Express

173
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:48,759
right so you have to watch which comes

174
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:50,259
in until was love right it's what I say

175
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,819
it's like you can't define love you

176
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:53,769
can't define to tell what it's like but

177
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:55,389
you know layman's definition would be

178
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:56,560
the epigenetic qualities of the plant

179
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:59,169
coming out through the environment

180
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,300
suppression of the person you know the

181
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,340
environmental impacts you know and and

182
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:06,990
so therefore you know panels express

183
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:11,379
itself fully in what environment the

184
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:15,910
truth around toois and the truth around

185
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:18,399
expression right is in Appalachia okay

186
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:20,939
it's defined an appellation of origin it

187
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:24,250
has to be the boundary that protects our

188
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:26,680
ability to grow in soil growing and

189
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:29,829
growing in the smart pot growing in an

190
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,129
engineered soil in the Sun is great good

191
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:32,679
job

192
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:34,269
good good good job you did a good job

193
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,769
growing outdoors you got your all your

194
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:37,809
smart pause everything it's like you

195
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:41,590
know way to not be indoors you know

196
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:43,689
saying you know now let's talk about how

197
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:46,120
your plan expresses itself in this soil

198
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:48,370
and we're talking about I mean the

199
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,049
numbers get thrown around about like 75

200
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:54,220
yeah it's totally esoteric we're talking

201
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:55,899
about the microbiome yeah with all the

202
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,610
applications everything the entire

203
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:59,079
environment there they're tapping into

204
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,210
each other you know what I'm saying it's

205
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,870
like it's it's Internet services like

206
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:07,810
the ig4 for plants you know and so yeah

207
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:12,279
and so now we say okay great good job

208
00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:15,369
okay you know the the the outdoor farmer

209
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:17,490
just became a telephone room right it

210
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:18,928
just became an appellation for

211
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,610
and that's where you're gonna start to

212
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:22,528
see the reserve clause that's where you

213
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,678
start to see the hand touches the all

214
00:09:22,528 --> 00:09:27,808
the things that you want to see right

215
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:29,818
coming from a high quality project

216
00:09:27,808 --> 00:09:31,708
product whatever a regenerative Lea

217
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:33,868
farmed product coming out of that

218
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:36,118
appellation system the standards are

219
00:09:33,869 --> 00:09:39,540
gonna be set like I said about 25

220
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:41,939
engineers 75 native that 25 engineered

221
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:44,129
is probably gonna most likely gonna have

222
00:09:41,938 --> 00:09:46,379
interfered either on-site or within the

223
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:49,289
Appalachian so it's sharing the same

224
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:52,259
microbiome that it's inoculated with the

225
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:54,958
same you know fungal spore and content

226
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:57,990
that that that's native to that region

227
00:09:54,958 --> 00:10:00,118
so does this mean that people who grow

228
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,339
in for example the areas of humble or

229
00:10:00,119 --> 00:10:04,589
the they always say the clip that the

230
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:07,350
soil is so clay like that I need to use

231
00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:10,199
so much potting soil from whatever

232
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:12,540
vendor that they probably won't be able

233
00:10:10,198 --> 00:10:14,188
to achieve application well there is

234
00:10:12,539 --> 00:10:16,169
they're not educated they're not

235
00:10:14,188 --> 00:10:19,588
educated on the fact that I just work to

236
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:21,659
create a living soil the mineral content

237
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:23,309
right if you live in huh if you live in

238
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:25,469
Humboldt and you have an area that's you

239
00:10:23,308 --> 00:10:28,438
know this is like oh my god my clay soil

240
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,569
like it's impenetrable it retains all of

241
00:10:28,438 --> 00:10:33,328
the moisture there's no way there's no

242
00:10:30,568 --> 00:10:37,828
drainage i I have to use engineered soil

243
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:39,688
you know I call BS because the idea is

244
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:41,669
now with regenerative farming it's not

245
00:10:39,688 --> 00:10:43,919
now with regenerative for me enter in

246
00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:47,868
back in regenerative farming practices

247
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:50,878
or engineered soil engineered soil right

248
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:52,980
isn't from a bad right it's human touch

249
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,709
soil like it's like this you can

250
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:57,990
engineer soil right like that's what I

251
00:10:55,708 --> 00:11:00,208
do i engineer soil every day

252
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,759
I am a soil farmer it's my

253
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:04,378
responsibility to my plant especially

254
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,928
growing an annual that's not going to be

255
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:08,639
able to grow year after year after year

256
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:11,159
after year after year in the same hole

257
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,659
and I have six months to grow that one

258
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,278
plan or eight months to grow that one

259
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:15,528
plant

260
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:17,870
that I have to engineer the highest

261
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:21,078
quality soil derived from my specific

262
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:24,620
Toa it goes into that now in conditions

263
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:26,508
the native soil right it conditions and

264
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,149
now year after year after year after

265
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:31,938
year after year my soil when you dig

266
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:34,129
your hand in it is permeable like right

267
00:11:31,938 --> 00:11:36,349
I've put mine on so that way it doesn't

268
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:39,139
start that way so what I saw the

269
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,449
microbes all the living organisms from

270
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:43,549
the wood shipped kind of tree native to

271
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:45,469
your land you know that degrades over

272
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:47,269
two years and becomes a super-high humid

273
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,339
source human source with all these

274
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:50,688
protozoa and native fungus and I mean

275
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:52,879
yeah it's and it's constantly feeding

276
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:54,438
organisms and like all of a sudden it's

277
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,938
like you know creating this living

278
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:57,110
entity you know it's like through and

279
00:11:55,938 --> 00:11:59,599
then you're feeding it you know and then

280
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,669
and yeah over time it it and it then is

281
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,350
able to become like I mean there's

282
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:04,639
there's ways that you know through

283
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,709
regenerate farming practices you can

284
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,299
regenerate inches of topsoil you know

285
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:10,489
the most fertile rich topsoil you know

286
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:12,049
and it you know can reverse the effects

287
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,600
of desertification you know when done

288
00:12:12,049 --> 00:12:16,008
right oh it's life back to the soil it's

289
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,300
you know you're living in concert with

290
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:19,159
the environment in the earth I mean

291
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:21,558
that's it and then it it's it is

292
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:25,458
necessary that we use this time in place

293
00:12:21,558 --> 00:12:27,409
to to push regenerative farming

294
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:29,929
practices or two of these hold space for

295
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:31,969
regenerative army practices to the rest

296
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:33,799
of the world right and since at your

297
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,600
point to the humble farmers who make

298
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:38,000
that claim that's why I'm using the big

299
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,069
smart pots well here's the deal the

300
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,958
claims are the guys that are there using

301
00:12:40,068 --> 00:12:44,269
the big smart pot says they're lazy

302
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:46,909
right they're lazy in one way because

303
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:49,429
they want to get the biggest plant but

304
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:50,659
right for the least amount of work and

305
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:52,549
that's what I mean I don't mean that

306
00:12:50,659 --> 00:12:54,078
they didn't work to haul their soil and

307
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:56,269
actually in a lot of ways they probably

308
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:57,318
worked a lot harder but you know to get

309
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:59,000
all that soil and to build all that

310
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,159
infrastructure to make sure that that

311
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,730
plant was able to grow hella fast in

312
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:04,589
hell a short amount of time

313
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:08,370
right because at the end of the day we

314
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:10,230
want 15 pounders you know like huge my

315
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,870
wife thinks I'm an idiot because I like

316
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:15,090
to grow one pounders and I like to grow

317
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:18,029
a lot of them I do got a lot of one

318
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:20,970
pounders in native soil because I see

319
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:23,100
highest-quality animus I see the highest

320
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:25,950
quality of my life like children's life

321
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,259
like that like my patients lives when

322
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:31,860
they're smoking my cannabis subscribe in

323
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:33,509
my soil you know so it's like I yes it

324
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,950
would be great it would be great if

325
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:36,899
somebody wanted to come and just give me

326
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,520
a million bucks I'd be awesome I'm not

327
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:40,649
saying don't ever give me money I know

328
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,309
I'm not in it for the money but I'm

329
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:46,500
saying I'm not willing to sacrifice

330
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:51,629
summarize the earth you don't think to

331
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:54,120
that capacity for money you're saying

332
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:57,090
you can't do it start now start like

333
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,850
building up your take your clay soil and

334
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:03,600
basically slowly what I say to humble

335
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:07,590
farmers if you want to be recognized as

336
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,860
Appalachian grown cannabis you must grow

337
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:13,769
in soil because the relationship between

338
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:17,460
soil and Sun is where it's at local soil

339
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:20,159
nope nope like native sweat round your

340
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:21,629
soil right and Sun right

341
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,459
so when yeah when I say so I like I

342
00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:25,500
don't even add an engineered soil

343
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:28,530
because like it's like whatever like I

344
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,200
you know but it's not like I'm going to

345
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:33,720
oh yeah I mean yeah so it's like so it's

346
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,220
like I mean I would hope that everyone

347
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,850
who has a cannabis farm has a huge

348
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,470
compost pile right like it just makes

349
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,680
sense right your participation as much

350
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:45,960
as your you know a would get some wood

351
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,639
source you know native to your land your

352
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,210
family tree guys are out on the roads

353
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,519
clear

354
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,930
you know PG&amp;E stuff everyday out for

355
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:53,669
nice graphic trust me I know

356
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:55,439
like I got a dump site every one of my

357
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:57,689
furnace man I high-five those guys when

358
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,250
they stop you know because they they all

359
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:00,870
know how to get into my farm they all

360
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:03,000
know which gate to go into they all know

361
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:05,850
where to dump all of my chippings I get

362
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,220
them to come by chip up all my stuff my

363
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:11,070
piles oh dear you're so awesome ruin all

364
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:12,570
my gold yeah it's like gold and that's

365
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,129
and that's a thing and it's like I have

366
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:16,290
that's the thing Apple down the road

367
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:18,179
then I get all of my sawdust chips from

368
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:19,679
chip all that and you know just mix all

369
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:21,239
of that and I mean I have

370
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,819
I mean I've collard greens with leaves

371
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:27,209
like that big on them grown in like pigs

372
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:29,790
shit and redwood Duff you know like like

373
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:32,039
no bottle of anything you know just just

374
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:34,980
pig shit and read with top and that's

375
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:36,659
there and they're raging you know and

376
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,339
then I look at like engineered soil

377
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:40,708
patches and things of that nature that

378
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:42,649
I'm like they're doing all right you

379
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:46,559
know but they didn't holy ingeniously

380
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:49,110
evolved with my soil right my soil has

381
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:52,409
been active you know on that land it's a

382
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:54,330
participant in my system right it is you

383
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:56,278
know it's in synergy there's no one

384
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:58,709
dominant participant right it's all

385
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:00,689
equal parts to make up the whole right

386
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:03,389
so it's like so that's that's that's

387
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:06,000
energy and that's what we're doing we're

388
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:08,838
building synergy and the Appalachian

389
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,159
system standards are going to be around

390
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,490
synergistic

391
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:16,169
right system regenerative like that's

392
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:18,600
those are gonna be the important

393
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:20,819
platforms you know going forward for

394
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,610
standards in that relationship and and

395
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:28,680
and I'm in that yeah that's so humble

396
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:32,669
farmers you can do it you know starting

397
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:35,939
to start the path people like you should

398
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:39,329
get out Franken to do that awesome good

399
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:42,630
job no Mendel farmers to yeah you know

400
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:44,250
it's all farmers farmers men that's

401
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:46,049
where it it's where it all comes from

402
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,149
that's you know it's the foundation of

403
00:16:46,049 --> 00:16:50,759
everything and and you know it's like I

404
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:53,189
think as long as people focus on just e

405
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,139
or not not not trying to focus on how

406
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,330
big other people are doing and how big

407
00:16:55,139 --> 00:17:00,449
everybody's going just focusing doing

408
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:02,070
what you're doing well and learning more

409
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:03,570
and more by the day from you know every

410
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:05,400
day is a school day and like learn from

411
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:07,078
the plant learn from the earth it's like

412
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,490
if you just plodding up in the smart

413
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:10,769
pots with Mike and Pro mix and

414
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:13,170
three-part ga Qing it it's like you're

415
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:14,818
almost in a huge way out of touch with

416
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:17,009
this whole life cycle that the plant can

417
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:18,449
empower you it and then make you you

418
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:20,250
know the best farm in the world you know

419
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:22,470
but it's like teeming with microbes and

420
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,849
understanding the symbiosis of like just

421
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,140
you know the systems approach towards

422
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:26,969
how we go as planned how the plant grows

423
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,290
off yeah so I mean you said that though

424
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:30,299
big isn't always better

425
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:31,889
I mean your own holily for throwing

426
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:35,389
hella stock you're growing how you know

427
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,390
like these large clover

428
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:51,910
