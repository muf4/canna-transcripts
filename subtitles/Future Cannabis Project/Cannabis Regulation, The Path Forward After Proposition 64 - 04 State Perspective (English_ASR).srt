presentation on brief presentation on

19
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:53,640
implementing the medical cannabis

20

regulation and Safety Act and

proposition 64 and then provide a status

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,590
of the regulations and our timelines

23
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:03,359
under these new laws the Bureau is

24
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,180
responsible for the licensing and

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,719
enforcement of the distributors the

26
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:11,850
transporters the dispensaries testing

27
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:14,908
labs and the micro businesses under

28
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:17,819
proposition 64 we're also the lead

29
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,670
agency to coordinate the efforts with

30
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:22,139
the other licensing authorities with

31
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:24,719
Department of Food nag and Department of

32
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,700
Public Health in addition to the many

33
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,298
other there's many other state agencies

34
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,600
involved that we're working with on a

35
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:35,759
quite a frequent basis our priorities

36
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,798
and implementing both statute is the

37
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,438
protection of the public the patient and

38
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,180
the environment it's important to know

39
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:45,449
that right from the start when we first

40
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,299
started the bureau I got stashed at the

41
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,850
bureau in February of last year and we

42
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,500
decided that the one of the most

43
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:54,899
important things we wanted to get out in

44
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,688
front of the public and listen to their

45
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,478
concern learn about the industry and so

46
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:03,478
we did informational tours across the

47
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:05,908
state from nine of them across the

48
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:07,890
street just to meet with the public and

49
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,409
a lot of the people that were there were

50
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:14,180
local government patients the public

51
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:17,490
local law enforcement and the industry

52
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,379
we went as far north as arcada and all

53
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,930
the way down to San Diego to these

54
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:24,870
informational session it was really

55
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:28,230
beneficial for us to learn about the

56
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:31,950
concerns of the industry of the public

57
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:34,500
and we got a lot of feedback we then

58
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:36,659
followed that up with our pre regulatory

59
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,209
meetings that we did it last year in

60
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:41,250
September of October we went to eight

61
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:43,530
locations across the state and that we

62
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,409
actually floated some regulatory

63
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:49,800
concepts and actually got involved with

64
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:52,620
we had small group discussions to

65
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,360
actually get feedback on what's the best

66
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,659
way to go forward with the developing of

67
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,370
the regulations so we did a lot of

68
00:02:57,659 --> 00:03:02,430
listening we did a lot of asking of

69
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:05,459
questions and now we're at a point at

70
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,159
our pre regulatory stakeholders in total

71
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,780
we had over 2,000 people attend now

72
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,019
we're at a point with the other two

73
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:15,419
licensing authorities that we are

74
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:17,730
developing the medical regulations we

75
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:20,789
plan to notice those with the Office of

76
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:23,159
Administrative Law early spring all

77
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:25,048
three of us will be noticing our medical

78
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,319
regulations and then we'll kick off the

79
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:31,469
45-day comment period and we also be

80
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,009
holding hearings across the state to

81
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:36,840
take public comment we feel like a lot

82
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:42,358
of what we have developed in the medical

83
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:46,379
side is going to align very well with

84
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:48,510
the proposition 64 regulations that we

85
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:50,639
also have to develop at least where

86
00:03:48,509 --> 00:03:52,739
there are similarities as you all know

87
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:56,219
there's some key differences between the

88
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:59,700
two statutes and so for those

89
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:01,530
differences we are going to see what

90
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:03,709
happens during the legislative process

91
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:07,469
and then we plan to use the emergency

92
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:09,780
regulation authority that we have under

93
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:13,620
both the medical and the adult use side

94
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:17,250
and and notice our regulations for the

95
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,829
adult use coming up approximately in

96
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,408
September we want to make sure that we

97
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:27,199
see what happens through legislation and

98
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:30,680
then go forward with developing those

99
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,199
regulations that is the status of our

100
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,660
timelines and happy to answer any

101
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,949

You mr. chair madam chair members my

107
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:51,649
name is Jim Houston I'm the

108
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:53,959
Undersecretary at the California

109
00:04:51,649 --> 00:04:56,870
Department of Food and Agriculture it's

110
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:58,969
been echoed by my colleague both the

111
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,250
passage of Merkerson and prop 64 has

112
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,410
presented new challenges to the

113
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,939
Department of Food and Agriculture first

114
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,550
and foremost were responsible for the

115
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:09,529
licensing of the growth sites and

116
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,889
enforcement of medical and adult used

117
00:05:09,529 --> 00:05:14,619
cannabis and throughout the state with

118
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:16,459
particular consideration given to

119
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,740
sequence so the California Environmental

120
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:21,469
Quality Act where the lead agency for

121
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,879
purposes of that licensing beyond that

122
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:24,860
we're also responsible for developing

123
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:28,040
the track and trade system that will be

124
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:31,730
used from seed to sale to track the

125
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,410
cannabis both through as flower state

126
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:37,100
and then whatever sort of masa nations

127
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:39,110
occur after that in terms of our

128
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,260
regulatory work you know we are sort of

129
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:44,600
lockstep with our other agencies we held

130
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:47,149
eight listening sessions throughout this

131
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,820
state all up and down both in the north

132
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:51,949
and the south and the central many of

133
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:56,000
those occurred with other agencies in

134
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:57,829
tow some did some not we likewise you

135
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,490
know have been proceeding as we did

136
00:05:57,829 --> 00:06:04,909
expeditiously and plan to submit our

137
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,829
regulations in early spring to oal we've

138
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:10,550
already prepared our economic analysis

139
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:13,669
otherwise known as a Syria and then

140
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,710
that's with my cursor and sort of

141
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,600
parallel to that is the secret timeline

142
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:20,569
so we will be shortly releasing our

143
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,000
draft environmental impact report as it

144
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:24,800
will go early spring and then that will

145
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,180
sort of begin the process we've built in

146
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,550
a lot of public comment for both of

147
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,160
those and plan on submitting those late

148
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:34,670
fall around November for their final

149
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,110
disposition and then in August likewise

150
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,480
we plan on using our emergency

151
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,889
regulatory authority to implement prop

152
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,319
64

153
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:43,639
you know as extent expressed both on

154
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,800
legislature and here and in other

155
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,749
hearings and will be continued to be

156
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,778
discussed the harmonization between

157
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:52,310
recursive and prof 64 is dynamic and

158
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:55,278
occurring and so we want to be able to

159
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:57,439
adapt and put in any of those changes in

160
00:06:55,278 --> 00:07:01,639
August so that we don't have to sort of

161
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:03,680
unwind the clock so August use the

162
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,800
emergency and then we will follow that

163
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,879
up with regular rulemaking as well and

164
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,079
that also presents a unique challenge

165
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:13,789
for us that is sequa for because we have

166
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:17,089
our mckersie sequined then we also have

167
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:19,759
to do prop 64 sequence but thankfully

168
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:22,728
you know we were able we believe will be

169
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:26,120
able to utilize the information that's

170
00:07:22,728 --> 00:07:30,079
in Arma curse' sequel analysis apply

171
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,819
that to our prof 64 analysis and while

172
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:35,120
there are some differences believe that

173
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:38,360
that overlap will allow us to meet the

174
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,908
January one 2018 deadline there is

175
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,370
currently an RFP out to do the

176
00:07:40,908 --> 00:07:44,778
consulting work for that so we

177
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,379
anticipate that should be wrapped up

178
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:51,079
shortly and then we will begin so you

179
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:52,550
know we I will say we've had I've been

180
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:55,098
very very impressed with the level of

181
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,629
coordination that we've had and the

182
00:07:55,098 --> 00:07:59,300
level of dialogue that we've had with

183
00:07:56,629 --> 00:08:01,158
both yourselves stakeholders and our

184
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,629
sister agencies and so look forward to

185
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:03,829
seeing this through to completion and

186
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:05,270
have to answer any questions you may

187
00:08:03,829 --> 00:08:07,158
have thank you thank you i know the

188
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:10,158
questions as well especially around vas

189
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:13,009
cultivation and whatnot this that's

190
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:15,168
please dr. Spencer Thank You Keith good

191
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:16,729
afternoon cares good morning committee

192
00:08:15,168 --> 00:08:18,139
members I'm dr. Karen Smith I'm the

193
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:19,310
state public health officer and the

194
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,680
director of the california department of

195
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,000
public health today I'm going to talk

196
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,918
briefly about the Department of Public

197
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,658
Health implementation of the medical

198
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:30,948
cannabis regulation Safety Act and prop

199
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:33,139
64 as you all know the medical cannabis

200
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:34,519
regulation Safety Act and 64 both

201
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:37,158
mandates the Department of Public Health

202
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:38,599
the license and oversee medical and

203
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:41,000
adult used cannabis product

204
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,039
manufacturers the department's approach

205
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,570
these regulations with the intent of

206
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,278
creating strong foundation for the

207
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:48,620
protection of public health and safety

208
00:08:46,278 --> 00:08:50,600
what without making the regulatory

209
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,370
compliance so owners that manufacturers

210
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,009
of the cannabis products would choose to

211
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,019
remain in the

212
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:56,610
underground market we're drafting

213
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,649
regulations that are substantially

214
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,909
similar to the manufacturing practices

215
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:02,370
currently in place for food

216
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:04,350
manufacturers and the regs will include

217
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,019
things along the lines of licensing

218
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,930
requirements process control security

219
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:12,149
safety sanitation destruction labeling

220
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:15,149
packaging product standards and

221
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:17,870
compliance enforcement we developed the

222
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:20,159
regulations to include those

223
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,870
substantially similar both to food but

224
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,299
also to dietary supplements because

225
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:26,009
there are things about cannabis being

226
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:28,589
added to food products that are very

227
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:31,919
similar to that from microbial

228
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:33,480
contamination by employees to or the

229
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,879
environment to incorporation of foreign

230
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,170
elements like glass hair or insects to

231
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,689
contamination of a product with

232
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:42,209
unintended allergens the manufacturing

233
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,920
processes are provide numerous

234
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,139
opportunities for hazards to be

235
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,639
introduced the minimum facility

236
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:49,980
requirements and standard operating

237
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:52,080
procedures for sanitary manufacturing

238
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,389
established by the department's proposed

239
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,300
regulations are intended to reduce or

240
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:59,490
eliminate potential contamination the

241
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:01,439
regulations also limit the products that

242
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,389
are allowed to be infused with cannabis

243
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,800
because certain types of manufactured

244
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:07,319
products are more susceptible to

245
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,849
microbial contamination the department's

246
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,920
highest priority and implementing the

247
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,139
act and proposition 64 is the projection

248
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:15,149
of the public's health based on feedback

249
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:17,490
that we received from stakeholders the

250
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:19,860
department is contemplating additional

251
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,750
license types beyond those allowed for

252
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,430
in the current regulation one of which

253
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,070
is an additional license type for

254
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:27,809
businesses that only manufacture

255
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:30,180
products such as edibles that don't

256
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:32,429
conduct the extractions from the plant

257
00:10:30,179 --> 00:10:34,379
and then a second license type for

258
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:36,870
businesses that do not manufacture the

259
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:40,919
actual product but package and label

260
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:42,990
them we have extensive experience in the

261
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:45,360
food manufacturing processing and safety

262
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,570
but the cannabis industry how is new to

263
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,840
us as well as others we estimate that

264
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:53,580
there will be approximately a thousand

265
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:56,610
applications for medical cannabis

266
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,540
manufacturing and potentially as much as

267
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:02,399
twice that for the adult use

268
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:03,870
manufacturing this required us to really

269
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,429
develop a quickly develop an

270
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,659
understanding of this entirely new

271
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:09,088
industry which is

272
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:11,850
evolving very rapidly us I think you're

273
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:13,290
all aware and because of the nature of

274
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,589
the industry there isn't a great deal of

275
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:19,500
data actually available to so it becomes

276
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:21,209
difficult to verify to educate ourselves

277
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,578
we met with numerous industry

278
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:25,619
representatives and associations and the

279
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:27,239
department staff visited manufacturing

280
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,578
sites of various types throughout the

281
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,129
state to learn more about extraction and

282
00:11:29,578 --> 00:11:34,019
manufacturing processes the staff also

283
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:36,360
had numerous calls with other states who

284
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,879
have implemented similar programs during

285
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,769
the pre regulatory stakeholder meetings

286
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,889
we also heard from local health

287
00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:46,379
jurisdictions and and others within the

288
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:48,060
local jurisdictions who represent they

289
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:50,730
are very clear about their desire to

290
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:52,469
both maintain some level of local

291
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,449
control and that they are important

292
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,949
partners in the regulatory process this

293
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:58,019
is consistent with the way we practice

294
00:11:55,948 --> 00:12:00,359
in food manufacturing and other

295
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,980
activities in the department timely

296
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,139
completion of the regulatory packages is

297
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:06,028
also top priority for us and we've been

298
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:07,980
coordinating Alice has been said before

299
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:09,958
we also are on the same timeline we

300
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:11,670
anticipate releasing the medical

301
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,469
cannabis regulations for public comment

302
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:15,838
in early spring and full adoption by

303
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:18,000
January first because of the compressed

304
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,790
timeline we also anticipate using the

305
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,740
emergency regulatory process for the

306
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:25,828
adult youth regulations which will

307
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:28,169
substantially be the same as proposition

308
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:30,659
64 although there are some differences

309
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:31,679
that will need to be addressed to thank

310
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:34,620
you for the opportunity to share our

311
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,000
progress and plans in implementation and

312
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,259
I'm happy to answer any questions that

313
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,958
you may have thank you thank you for

314
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:45,060
your testimony so let's figure out we

315
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,799
will start with you dr. Smith and then

316
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:50,219
we'll work her questions all the way

317
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,409
through and first yeah I appreciate the

318
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:53,670
time as we were trying to grapple with

319
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:56,490
some of these issues some of the things

320
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:58,169
you touched upon the packaging the food

321
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,329
manufacturing because I believe you're

322
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:02,429
just looking at this is even from the

323
00:13:00,328 --> 00:13:04,198
food manufacturing making sure that the

324
00:13:02,429 --> 00:13:07,169
public is safe because that's your

325
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:09,838
charge so make sure that things are safe

326
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:12,389
for the public consumption but can you

327
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,279
talk a little bit more about how we're

328
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:15,629
trying to standardize that I thought we

329
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:18,088
had this discussion but I like to put it

330
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:20,278
on the record standardizing so if you go

331
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:22,230
to one dispensary as opposed to an

332
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:23,999
other that you're still receiving the

333
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:26,430
same product and how does that relate to

334
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:30,120
potency and what does that mean for an

335
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:31,919
individual so there's a broad variety of

336
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,350
regulations that touch on that some of

337
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,628
which of which are with us and

338
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,430
dispensaries themselves are within the

339
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:40,980
local control so we don't we don't

340
00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:45,778
regulate that however sanitary practice

341
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:48,149
is part of it one overarching safety

342
00:13:45,778 --> 00:13:50,370
measure that we are going to propose is

343
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:52,620
that we only will allow cannabis

344
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:56,730
infusion of shelf-stable food products

345
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:59,549
because of the possibility for foods

346
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:01,889
that require refrigeration or some other

347
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:03,899
level of maintenance at a particular

348
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:06,180
under particular characteristics at the

349
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,769
local level most dispensaries are not

350
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:10,588
prepared to do that and it becomes a

351
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:13,350
much more difficult thing for local

352
00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:15,689
jurisdictions to actually regulate that

353
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:18,269
on a dispensary by dispensary basis and

354
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:20,338
so that's one of the things that we're

355
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:21,659
going to propose in the regulation the

356
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:25,079
other thing is we will be proposing

357
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:27,480
maximum THC levels in products that

358
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:31,169
edible products in particular as well as

359
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,000
topical products because we believe that

360
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:34,669
it's the most one of the most important

361
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,049
things for us is making sure that

362
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:40,139
children in particular who may

363
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:41,849
inadvertently consume a product that

364
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:44,698
looks like a food product that they're

365
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:48,449
familiar with that we maintain a package

366
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:50,578
so that it doesn't have so much THC in

367
00:14:48,448 --> 00:14:52,849
it that the child ends up in emergency

368
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:56,239
room or the hospital there have been

369
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,379
examples in other states of well

370
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,000
pediatric poisonings actually increased

371
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:02,370
dramatically in Colorado after they

372
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,470
originally put using what we doing

373
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,480
obviously is a great deal of education

374
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,720
public education and about how to use

375
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,058
this product safely thank you yeah now I

376
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,790
know that's a concern of one of the

377
00:15:12,058 --> 00:15:16,828
questions I also get back home is you

378
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:19,740
know some people know what they classify

379
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:21,088
is the good shops and right this one's

380
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:22,318
more potent than the other so I'm glad

381
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:23,459
that we're looking into it I know we

382
00:15:22,318 --> 00:15:24,838
have a number of questions I have

383
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:27,208
additional questions as well but let me

384
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,610
go into that divert some of my my

385
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:31,419
colleague just really briefly and it may

386
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:34,509
not totally fall under your

387
00:15:31,419 --> 00:15:37,719
fiction but folks under Section eight

388
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:39,220
housing and people who you know need to

389
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,160
apply to that or on the waiting list

390
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:44,920
it's actually illegal for them to use

391
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:48,399
marijuana because of the federal you

392
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:50,879
know saying that's an illegal narcotic

393
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,809
so that's an issue looming and it's

394
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,389
disenfranchising people as well and

395
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:57,849
folks may not even know that who are you

396
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:59,409
know needing section 8 so I just wanted

397
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,149
to kind of bring that up and I didn't

398
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:05,409
know if it was under the jurisdiction or

399
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:07,090
not mr Wood has questions public health

400
00:16:05,409 --> 00:16:08,559
question first of all I want to say that

401
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,320
I appreciate the opportunity we met with

402
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,759
you and the work you're doing very

403
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,910
impressed with the work and the thought

404
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,860
has gone into where you are so far I

405
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:20,110
also appreciate the fact that you're not

406
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:22,029
trying to be overly onerous I think the

407
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,129
industry has is going to take a while

408
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:25,839
for people to get up and running there

409
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:28,689
and I think the worst things can do is

410
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,160
be overly onerous on a lot of these so

411
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,810
that give people an opportunity to

412
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,059
actually come into compliance reasonable

413
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:36,219
best practices so my idea have a

414
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:37,839
question which to questions and one is

415
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,629
how are we going to reconcile some of

416
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,820
the oversight issues because mtrs a was

417
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:44,710
pretty particular about at Department of

418
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:48,129
Public Health's role and now and then

419
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:50,350
prop 64 has changed that so do we is

420
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:53,259
there is that some there room for

421
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:55,629
reconciliation on that one because you

422
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:57,519
know we clearly after studying that six

423
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:58,750
months the governor's office had had a

424
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,329
very different vision of how things

425
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,669
should be done well be really the only

426
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:05,740
place where that comes up is in in the

427
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:08,740
oversight of the testing laboratories

428
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,359
and we are assisting the bureau with

429
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,579
development of the medical cannabis

430
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:14,500
regulations for the testing laboratories

431
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:17,379
we actually do believe that it will be

432
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,289
possible through legislation to align

433
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:23,140
the to the the drafters of prop 64

434
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:26,470
didn't intentionally our understanding

435
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:27,850
is put it back to the California

436
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:30,009
Department of Public Health they were

437
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:33,159
working from an early version of the

438
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:34,930
medical cannabis Act the reason for

439
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,029
moving the the testing laboratories

440
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:40,420
really was to facilitate the industry's

441
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:44,200
work distributors are the are the entity

442
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,950
within the process who actually take the

443
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,269
product

444
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:48,549
original product of the testing

445
00:17:46,269 --> 00:17:50,379
laboratories right now distributors and

446
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:52,240
all other licenses except the very

447
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,890
specific agricultural license and

448
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,579
manufacturing licenses are with the

449
00:17:53,890 --> 00:18:00,250
bureau so it was the the conclusion of

450
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:03,429
the group that the best alignment is to

451
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:05,650
have it with with the Bureau also DCA

452
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:08,769
has far more experience and licensing

453
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:10,570
complex types of entity that we do but

454
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:13,049
we would anticipate working very closely

455
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:15,339
with them over time it's likely that

456
00:18:13,049 --> 00:18:16,960
given the science of testing is

457
00:18:15,339 --> 00:18:19,689
developing that we're going to want to

458
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,220
be looking at the regulations over time

459
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:23,380
for the laboratories but I think that

460
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,880
that's a resolvable confident in my

461
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,790
final question from a public health

462
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,820
perspective become aware of the infusion

463
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:32,889
of cannabis in a variety of top of foods

464
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:35,470
and things but yesterday was brought up

465
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:37,420
to me and I'd this may be a question for

466
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:40,259
everybody I don't know who's going to

467
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:43,060
oversee the infusion of cannabis in

468
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:44,619
spirits and wine which is happening out

469
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:48,369
there and how's that going to play out

470
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:50,259
so our proposed regulations are not

471
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:52,569
going to allow the infusion of cannabis

472
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:54,640
and alcohol products into alcohol

473
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:56,799
products and that's based on science

474
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,500
that demonstrates that to depressive

475
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,329
effects which both marijuana and and

476
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,279
alcohol are both central nervous system

477
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:07,109
depressants actually can potentiate

478
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:10,599
there's also very early information that

479
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:13,029
there can be very real consequences of

480
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:15,699
that playing out particularly in the

481
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:17,769
realm of automobile accidents there's a

482
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,110
recent study done by law enforcement in

483
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:23,019
Colorado looking at fatal automobile

484
00:19:20,109 --> 00:19:25,240
accidents from using autopsy data what

485
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:27,849
they found was that is that it was

486
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,740
incredibly rare for one of these for

487
00:19:27,849 --> 00:19:31,240
someone who was had one of these

488
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,819
substances in their system for it to be

489
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,880
only marijuana in overwhelming number of

490
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:38,950
cases it was both alcohol and marijuana

491
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,790
and potentially other substance as well

492
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:45,819
and while people will always Co imbibe

493
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:48,609
we don't think that it's responsible to

494
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:53,019
allow to actually facilitate that by

495
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:55,500
allowing products that contain both okay

496
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:58,450
thank you Miss come here

497
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,759
thank you dr. Smith um I'm there is a

498
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:04,170
significant amount of concern around the

499
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:08,410
issue of infusion into products that

500
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:12,070
children would perceive as things they

501
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:15,910
eat yeah and well you have that the

502
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:18,009
ability to really and I'm thinking about

503
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:20,320
the situations where because with

504
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:21,549
medical marijuana right now it's infused

505
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,460
in anything and there's really no

506
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:27,849
regulatory oversight so stepping back

507
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:32,730
from that and changing what they can be

508
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:35,230
infused into has me concerned because I

509
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:37,349
I'm concerned that we won't have the

510
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:43,179
ability to be able to go into it to a

511
00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:45,039
retail facility take out and test and be

512
00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:48,100
able to determine whether they're living

513
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,619
up to their the requirements that are in

514
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:53,500
the regulations in particular for those

515
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:56,769
products they're cooked or where their

516
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:59,410
property has changed are you doing the

517
00:20:56,769 --> 00:21:01,960
research to be able to know whether the

518
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:04,870
infusion if it's put into a product

519
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,329
changes over time and to be able to

520
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:10,479
really know whether the potency is such

521
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:13,029
that it's consistent on the product in

522
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,679
the product so we don't have the

523
00:21:13,029 --> 00:21:16,299
resources to be engaged in that research

524
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,640
although it is an active area of

525
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:21,129
research there's actually a multi-state

526
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,870
meeting of public health officials from

527
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:24,780
the states with legalized cannabis

528
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:26,469
happening in California right now and

529
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:28,240
that was actually one of the

530
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,910
conversations we had yesterday and

531
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,679
Colorado's actively pursuing that as

532
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:36,070
well as others I think that's an area

533
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:38,830
that's really going to develop over time

534
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:43,089
but we are going to be proposing maximum

535
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:45,009
levels of THC in manufactured products

536
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:47,529
and that means we will be able to test

537
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:49,660
those products after manufacturing to

538
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:51,190
ensure that they don't exceed that we're

539
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,170
also addressing the issue of children

540
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:55,480
from several other ways the products

541
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:57,670
cannot look substantially like a food

542
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,120
product that children recognize the

543
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:04,720
packaging cannot cannot use bold colors

544
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:08,239
cartoons etc as well as it being opaque

545
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,339
so if it is a product that does roof

546
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,319
bolus of food product that that is

547
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:15,619
commonly in use the package has to be

548
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:17,928
opaque it has to be tamper child

549
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:19,308
resistant and in addition if it has more

550
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:21,019
than one serving in it has to be

551
00:22:19,308 --> 00:22:24,859
resealable so we're building in some

552
00:22:21,019 --> 00:22:26,450
pretty we hope strenuous regulations

553
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:29,659
without making it impossible to actually

554
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,100
make manufactured products and thank you

555
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,600
for that I appreciate that I know those

556
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:34,609
are some of the concerns to make sure

557
00:22:32,599 --> 00:22:36,500
that we this doesn't get in the hands of

558
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:38,689
children right on so we need to make

559
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,859
that sure that that's paramount but let

560
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,259
me just ask that they were quick before

561
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:43,639
we moved about this that relates so

562
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:47,420
earlier you mentioned some of the

563
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:49,070
science and the research what is that

564
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,230
science what does that research can just

565
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:54,200
elaborate a little bit more on that on

566
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:56,720
that specific issue of how how potency

567
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,308
changes I think that essentially what

568
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,660
they're doing is in laboratory research

569
00:22:58,308 --> 00:23:01,609
laboratories they're actually taking

570
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:04,308
various manufactured products currently

571
00:23:01,609 --> 00:23:05,869
for sale and there are there's

572
00:23:04,308 --> 00:23:07,039
everything from really basic science

573
00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:09,849
research looking at the molecular

574
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,980
changes in in the molecular

575
00:23:09,849 --> 00:23:17,389
concentrations and the flavor profiles

576
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,920
all the way through to you why testing

577
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,780
the product on humans if you is not

578
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,019
truly human testing that volunteers who

579
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:25,460
imbibe the product who can provide

580
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:29,150
subjective information to inform it as

581
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:31,130
well and so it's not the same because

582
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:35,120
earlier you said up to this research

583
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:38,000
about allow scientific research for the

584
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:41,629
infusion and alcohol and spirits great

585
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,839
so so I was speaking to one as a overall

586
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,520
we know that when you take to central

587
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:48,230
nervous system depressants and you add

588
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:50,058
them together and that would be the true

589
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:53,000
of opioid products for example and

590
00:23:50,058 --> 00:23:57,529
alcohol and many other types of drugs

591
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,089
and dietary supplements that you can get

592
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:00,889
a potentiating effect in other words

593
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:02,990
that's stronger and synergistic rather

594
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,990
than just additive and as I think

595
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:07,849
there's emerging evidence to demonstrate

596
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:10,009
that that may in fact be true that is in

597
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:11,509
true is also true for marijuana okay

598
00:24:10,009 --> 00:24:12,930
thank you for the clarification mr.

599
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:15,369
Mathis please

600
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:17,350
dr. Smith is you're talking and you're

601
00:24:15,369 --> 00:24:20,969
talking about the science and all that I

602
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:26,019
know we get into discussing CV oil and

603
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:27,610
when we percentages of THC within and a

604
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:29,740
lot of that from some of the science

605
00:24:27,609 --> 00:24:32,169
that I've been going through and folks

606
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:34,359
I've been talking to talks about I mean

607
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,820
you literally get into like a molecular

608
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:39,219
level of how the plants grown what it's

609
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:41,980
grown with and trace amounts of

610
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,839
different things being into that so what

611
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,870
was your department looking into those

612
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,879
things as part of the standards and also

613
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:51,189
as far as moving product and from other

614
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,900
states ensuring that the products that

615
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:56,080
are coming in as well meet the same

616
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:59,380
standards that we're putting on the

617
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:00,730
products here in California and this

618
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,430
gets more too awful like with the

619
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:07,720
medical side I mean if you're saying you

620
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:10,600
know three ounces of THC oil is going to

621
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,940
be this much is it really and it kind of

622
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:14,649
gets into the purification standards and

623
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,230
issues of that and I'm just interested

624
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,390
in where you got to write with that so

625
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,759
the the science is really limited it's

626
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:24,250
rapidly evolving and there's a

627
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:27,250
distinction between THC which is the

628
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:29,799
psychoactive part and other cannabinoids

629
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:31,829
in particular CBD those are the ones

630
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:35,409
that most people believe have the

631
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:37,750
medicinal properties so you can get

632
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:40,000
profiles and people do this actually of

633
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,730
every single there are many enter Keynes

634
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,430
which provide flavor and apparently some

635
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:47,289
level of the kind of high that's the

636
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:49,000
language that people use you can tell

637
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:52,480
this isn't terribly scientific at this

638
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,529
point we are not in we are we are taking

639
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,509
a of that based on safety as opposed to

640
00:25:56,529 --> 00:26:01,359
efficacy as if it were a drug that we

641
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:02,950
could that we knew about potency so what

642
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:06,159
we're saying is that there can only be

643
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:08,830
this much a maximum concentration of phc

644
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,600
because that's the more psychoactive

645
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:14,230
substance the one that creates the

646
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:17,529
impairment that is a safety issue in in

647
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:19,779
a serving essentially and that so that's

648
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:22,839
fairly that's very simple it's easy to

649
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:24,819
verify we can test for that I think that

650
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:25,750
over time as the science develops there

651
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:28,059
will be

652
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:31,119
more information but for what we know

653
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:34,539
now that's the way that we have landed

654
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:36,759
on is being the safest way to regulate

655
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:38,980
how much of the psychoactive substance

656
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:43,720
people are going to be in Justin thank

657
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:45,400
you thank you mr. Dalli real quick I

658
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,920
don't know this is for the Department of

659
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,200
Agriculture or for your office but so

660
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:52,509
I'm a farmer regulated heavenly by the

661
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,779
Department of Food nag on I'm a seed

662
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:59,250
farmer so I racy but the chemicals i use

663
00:26:55,779 --> 00:27:01,660
in the process of my seed is all

664
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,730
reported to the Department of Ag and so

665
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:06,160
the consumer knows what's been applied

666
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:09,130
to the products that I sell and when

667
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,470
it's ingested for human use to so who's

668
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,700
going to take who's going to know what

669
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,279
the growers out there putting on the

670
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,740
plants and who wears that regulation

671
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:21,879
commitment okay we'll segue into mr.

672
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:24,670
Houston yeah thinking mr. jolly I think

673
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,990
you know that's a good question and tore

674
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:27,340
my pesticide regulation will retain

675
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,440
their authority they've issued

676
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:30,879
guidelines you know it's a little bit

677
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,880
tricky because there's no federally

678
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,130
registered pesticides for cannabis but

679
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,780
they've done a lot of work on issuing

680
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:41,320
guidelines for cannabis growers as to

681
00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:42,700
what substances can be used and those

682
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:44,829
will continue to be reported to the

683
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:47,710
county commissioner and utilize that

684
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:50,439
process to keep track of what pesticides

685
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:52,480
and then the testing protocol as well so

686
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:55,779
all the distributors have to drop it off

687
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,730
at a lab you know statistically

688
00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:59,920
significant sample size like like we do

689
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:02,860
in our produce testing so I'll produce

690
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,480
is tested for pesticide residue to make

691
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:06,129
sure this in compliance with laws and

692
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,900
all cannabis and product will be

693
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:12,600
likewise tested to make sure it's in

694
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:14,950
compliance with the laws so so the

695
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:17,079
agriculturists out there Asian that is a

696
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:21,779
crop is going to be permitted and then

697
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:23,859
has to is going to be required to also

698
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:25,240
let the County High Commissioners know

699
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:29,279
when they're what they're applying and

700
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,279
when they're applying it yes okay

701
00:28:29,378 --> 00:28:35,148
could I just ask just to clarify for the

702
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:36,980
record though what is current practice

703
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:40,939
in terms of cultivation sites for

704
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:43,399
acreage and you mean what is that like

705
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,769
you know I when I go back home I talk to

706
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:46,788
the city managers and supervisors as

707
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:49,190
they're all worried about mass

708
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:52,759
cultivation okay yeah so the limit right

709
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:55,759
now is 22,000 square feet which is about

710
00:28:52,759 --> 00:29:01,308
half acre so that's going to be the the

711
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:03,200
maximum size and that is a level 5 all

712
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:06,230
right well which comes into effect in

713
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:09,159
2022 so there's going to be large scale

714
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:12,470
grows that will come into effect then

715
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:14,149
but the there's two things they're

716
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:16,069
supposed to the statutory sort of

717
00:29:14,148 --> 00:29:18,408
licensing restrictions but also our

718
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:21,470
sequel analysis will shed some light on

719
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:23,929
that so you can foresee that there will

720
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,548
be you know as you get bigger and bigger

721
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:29,360
and you utilize more and more resources

722
00:29:25,548 --> 00:29:32,628
the mitigation burden on that entity you

723
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:34,849
know grows it lengthwise and so that's

724
00:29:32,628 --> 00:29:36,888
going to factor in to how large the

725
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:39,189
grows do get but it isn't something

726
00:29:36,888 --> 00:29:41,508
we're also likewise very concerned about

727
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:44,450
to make sure that I think that's why the

728
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:46,610
drafters of prof 64 put in the five-year

729
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:49,399
delay my understanding is the intent was

730
00:29:46,609 --> 00:29:52,028
to allow for small growers to get a

731
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:54,258
foothold in the market and as we've seen

732
00:29:52,028 --> 00:29:55,548
you know both in the agricultural field

733
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:58,480
but we'll see it in cannabis and it's

734
00:29:55,548 --> 00:30:01,368
going to be hard for small growers to

735
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,378
and so what is a CDF a doing to help

736
00:30:01,368 --> 00:30:05,538
bring people into compliance because you

737
00:30:03,378 --> 00:30:09,498
know we keep hearing of yeah illegal

738
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:11,929
growers yes well as I said before at you

739
00:30:09,499 --> 00:30:14,808
know sort of my mantra you know we

740
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:17,980
really need to focus on having a

741
00:30:14,808 --> 00:30:22,999
reasonable and as simple as possible

742
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:25,190
regulatory system so very mindful of the

743
00:30:22,999 --> 00:30:28,249
small grower you know as I talked about

744
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:30,110
in the Senate hearing and mr. wood when

745
00:30:28,249 --> 00:30:33,129
i went up to read way you know it's very

746
00:30:30,109 --> 00:30:36,859
illuminating to see the the diversity of

747
00:30:33,128 --> 00:30:39,079
farmers that are participating and and

748
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:41,240
the one thing that I really worry about

749
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:41,509
I mean you know the larger folks the

750
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,390
green

751
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:45,589
house folks the well-heeled you know

752
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:49,190
capitalists for lack of a better term

753
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:51,439
are going to probably be okay but it's

754
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:53,240
the you know small fruit and veg grower

755
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,460
who's got a half acre a cannabis or an

756
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:59,450
acre cannabis you know what are they

757
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:02,120
going to do now and and you know however

758
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:05,210
simple we can make our registration

759
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:08,119
process and the the cost associated with

760
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:10,340
that license you know we're all on

761
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:11,869
borrowed money right now and the

762
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:13,970
expectation is it's going to be paid

763
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:16,429
back through the cannabis program but

764
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:18,309
we're very mindful of that and so trying

765
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:21,200
to limit costs trying to limit

766
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:23,450
registration fees and education and

767
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,680
outreach to those growers utilizing both

768
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:28,670
you know the sort of NGO community

769
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,009
legislators such as yourselves in your

770
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:32,570
outreach but also you know doing our own

771
00:31:31,009 --> 00:31:34,609
outreach I'm as much as possible

772
00:31:32,569 --> 00:31:37,359
utilizing ad commissioners to get the

773
00:31:34,609 --> 00:31:40,789
information out there to assist folks

774
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:42,919
with their compliance obligations and

775
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:44,420
like I said keep the fees down and so

776
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,880
the more people we can have in there the

777
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:50,810
easier it's going to be on the flip side

778
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:52,880
but the flip side is you know both going

779
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:54,259
to be complaint driven primarily but I

780
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,270
mean it's not something we can do on our

781
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:58,549
on our own you know the California

782
00:31:56,269 --> 00:32:00,559
Highway Patrol federal drug enforcement

783
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,940
agencies local law enforcement all need

784
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,279
to be involved when we're talking about

785
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:06,080
illegal grows and and that's all going

786
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:08,720
to depend on the skies the size and

787
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:10,429
sophistication of those operations ok

788
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,019
thank you I believe mr. wood at mr.

789
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,970
Dalli traditional costume mr. would

790
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:16,160
please yeah thank you thank you also for

791
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:18,200
your availability and willing to reach

792
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,830
out and work with us I think someone's

793
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,660
worked on this issue just in general

794
00:32:20,829 --> 00:32:25,639
this way Ajax everybody has been has

795
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:27,890
been very accessible we really really

796
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:30,560
appreciate that done a lot to help us

797
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:32,570
along the way my question goes back to

798
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:36,049
you talked about 20-22 and the potential

799
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:38,359
for these type five licenses is it a

800
00:32:36,049 --> 00:32:40,309
fair characteristics that if they can

801
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:41,689
meet someone could meet sequa and there

802
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:44,509
was plenty of resources that we could

803
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:49,670
have conceivably an unlimited growth

804
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:51,680
size I mean really really large growth

805
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:54,080
after their son to your kitchen that

806
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:58,580
will prove that their one little number

807
00:32:54,079 --> 00:33:00,829
of actual limit to their but um I mean

808
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:02,599
theoretically yes and I think that's one

809
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:05,449
of the things that we want to be mindful

810
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:06,379
of but it's not it's not a conversation

811
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,850
that we're just having with ourselves

812
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,950
I'm its conversation that we're having

813
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:12,049
with sister agencies with yourselves

814
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:14,360
with stakeholders I mean I think

815
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:16,009
everybody the one nice thing about this

816
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:18,289
for the for the most part is everybody's

817
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:22,069
rowing in the same direction we all want

818
00:33:18,289 --> 00:33:25,490
a successful regulatory program come

819
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:27,439
January one 2018 we want those we want

820
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:29,150
to participate to be able to and we want

821
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,000
those who don't want to participate to

822
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:34,580
be able to stay out and and you know

823
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,519
having a marketplace that allows for

824
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:40,099
growers to have access to not have

825
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,839
imbalances of power between the

826
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:43,189
different entities between distributors

827
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,500
and growers manufacturers and

828
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:47,600
distributors I mean we've you know we've

829
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,910
seen a rich history in this country of

830
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:52,519
how these things play out and how these

831
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:55,220
imbalances ultimately almost always

832
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:58,460
impact the consumer the person on the

833
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,839
low end the farmer the tumor so we're

834
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:03,400
trying to have a conversation to get

835
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:05,949
ahead of that to make sure that the

836
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:08,360
fairness I guess sort of rules the day

837
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,710
that that do you have an equal

838
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,179
marketplace when the folks are allowed

839
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,918
to compete I mean that's what I think

840
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:15,139
you know we need them to do is to

841
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:16,579
compete and then so that's a

842
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:19,940
conversation will continue to have so

843
00:34:16,579 --> 00:34:26,929
yes theoretically that could happen but

844
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:30,110
I don't think it's likely mr. golly

845
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:32,210
Thank You chairman so I represent nine

846
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:34,820
counties I'm in the same boat as a

847
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:37,159
member of a wood were my counties are

848
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:38,570
it's the Wild West all right and so

849
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:41,659
counties are looking at it as a revenue

850
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:43,370
source there so and then some have tried

851
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:46,129
some things they didn't like and change

852
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:48,500
those rules so I got all my County's

853
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:50,500
doing something different so very

854
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,900
difficult for the growers for the

855
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:55,969
processors for locals who have been

856
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:59,500
there abiding by rules and rules are

857
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:59,500
changing so what is your role

858
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:04,470
coordinating with the county I guess

859
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:07,980
because I'm just giving an example

860
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:10,230
shasta county had and pretty much do

861
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,429
what you want for a while until they

862
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:15,108
realized there was a lot of prop

863
00:35:11,429 --> 00:35:16,889
conflicts with neighbors in with

864
00:35:15,108 --> 00:35:18,449
dispensaries so they didn't that they

865
00:35:16,889 --> 00:35:20,879
ban they said we're no more outdoor

866
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:23,909
grill so the county i live in last and

867
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,500
had really restricted it and then they

868
00:35:23,909 --> 00:35:28,368
decided to open it up a little bit so

869
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:31,739
basically what happened was last year

870
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:33,390
around my farm all right where we live

871
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:35,789
people are buying up land like crazy and

872
00:35:33,389 --> 00:35:37,769
putting in all these groves and its

873
00:35:35,789 --> 00:35:39,690
really the Wild West I mean my wife is

874
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:42,929
afraid to even drive to our farm it's

875
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:45,659
that crazy so what is your role with you

876
00:35:42,929 --> 00:35:46,799
you is there some some something that's

877
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:48,269
going to be put out so this may take

878
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,280
Connie this is going to be the process

879
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:54,389
that this is how this is up the chain

880
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:56,190
abri it from grower to processor to

881
00:35:54,389 --> 00:35:58,199
consumer this is going to be the

882
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:01,800
statewide this is how we're going to do

883
00:35:58,199 --> 00:36:03,328
it so to some extent yes and I think

884
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,550
that's one of the reasons why we've been

885
00:36:03,329 --> 00:36:07,800
coordinating with our sister agencies to

886
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:09,900
make sure that the regulations unfold

887
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,339
sort of commensurate with one another so

888
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,829
that oaks are able to get a complete

889
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:16,828
picture however we are restricted to

890
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:18,599
some degree at the local level because

891
00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:21,420
you know it's up to those locals so our

892
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:24,000
challenge is how do we stay coordinated

893
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,440
set so you know one of the probably the

894
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,420
most important thing that we want to

895
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,849
accomplish is to bring order to that

896
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:33,450
chaos you know I think that's all of us

897
00:36:29,849 --> 00:36:34,950
that's why this was all done so you know

898
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:38,068
we certainly want to accomplish that and

899
00:36:34,949 --> 00:36:40,348
I think as this gets going that is going

900
00:36:38,068 --> 00:36:41,759
to be you know one of the things that is

901
00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:43,260
successful as folks are going to see the

902
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,150
regulatory environment they're going to

903
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,470
be able to participate in it they're

904
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:49,050
going to be able to have feedback etc

905
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:51,509
there will be a you know a period of

906
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,099
adaptation you know I'm sure things are

907
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:56,010
going to be anticipated and there's

908
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:57,510
going to need to be some changes but but

909
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:59,579
as long as folks are participating and

910
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:02,190
feel confident about it you know that is

911
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:04,200
good with respect to what's happening

912
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,329
sort of you know at the local level with

913
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:08,429
speculation and whatnot there's going to

914
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:10,829
be a settling out I mean there are going

915
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:14,279
to be people who bet wrong and that's

916
00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:15,210
not something we can really control but

917
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,070
you know

918
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:20,099
we have to work closely with the

919
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:22,170
counties and our primary you know

920
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:23,880
contact resolve ously the county AG

921
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:25,858
commissioner they have a lot of

922
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,390
advantages you know both their their

923
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:29,250
responsibilities and understanding of

924
00:37:27,389 --> 00:37:30,358
their County Board of Supervisors but

925
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,159
also their connection to the growing

926
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:34,108
community so they know more than anybody

927
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:37,469
else what's happening at the county

928
00:37:34,108 --> 00:37:40,139
level and and what the wishes of the

929
00:37:37,469 --> 00:37:41,848
county board of supervisors are and that

930
00:37:40,139 --> 00:37:44,368
is sort of where we are being

931
00:37:41,849 --> 00:37:46,500
deferential to so so you know in your

932
00:37:44,369 --> 00:37:49,140
case where you've got a county that

933
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:53,039
doesn't want to do anything you know

934
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:56,460
their hands off we we we step it so you

935
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:58,019
know there are there may be cities that

936
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,070
in with in that county they want to

937
00:37:58,019 --> 00:38:02,070
participate that's certainly what you

938
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:04,019
see in Southern California so if the

939
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:05,280
county AG commission if the County Board

940
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:07,230
of Supervisors tells the county AG

941
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,599
Commissioner hey don't touch this at all

942
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:11,490
then we will step in and we will do the

943
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:13,800
licensing and enforcement at the local

944
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:16,199
level to the extent that the county AG

945
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,510
commissioner is allowed to you know

946
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:19,799
regulate the the local municipalities or

947
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:21,780
whether it be the county of the city

948
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,880
reform cooperative agreements much like

949
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,310
we do in our c program and others where

950
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,380
they'll carry out the work so that's

951
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:30,750
sort of how we're trying to attack that

952
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,430
and to bring some certainty but but

953
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:35,608
feedback and communication is really

954
00:38:32,429 --> 00:38:38,399
important thank you sis man just one

955
00:38:35,608 --> 00:38:41,549
word on manufactured products while the

956
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,530
local jurisdiction would decide whether

957
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:45,660
or not they want to have a manufacturing

958
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:48,630
plant of some sort in their jurisdiction

959
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:51,230
the regulation rests entirely with the

960
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:54,210
department so they don't set local

961
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:56,490
manufacturing regulations it's different

962
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:58,800
what allowed to be sell a fold in a

963
00:38:56,489 --> 00:39:01,319
dispensary what's allowed to be made

964
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,440
falls under the department's produces it

965
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:07,050
is similar to food in that way so there

966
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,179
isn't there there's no wild wild west as

967
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:11,640
far as manufactured products or edibles

968
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:13,829
that's where the thing or at least not

969
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:15,059
though if we do this right and we can

970
00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:17,009
move people out of the black market

971
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:18,269
there will be single regulatory

972
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:20,700
structure for the state as far as

973
00:39:18,269 --> 00:39:22,409
manufactured products ya Yin extra

974
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:23,679
clarifier regulations as well set the

975
00:39:22,409 --> 00:39:27,068
floor for

976
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:30,250
level so so the locals can can go sort

977
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:32,199
of below what our regulatory our license

978
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:34,480
requirements are they can exceed them

979
00:39:32,199 --> 00:39:36,429
they can further restrict but they can't

980
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,920
say oh hey you can have a thirty

981
00:39:36,429 --> 00:39:42,578
thousand-square-foot license you can't

982
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:44,170
go just an observation from more i come

983
00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:46,059
from it i was with county government for

984
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:47,619
16 years I totally understand I'm and

985
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:49,210
I'm regulated by the Department food

986
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:51,190
nagging my own business you know the

987
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:53,019
agriculture community that has been

988
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:56,380
growing crops to feed the world

989
00:39:53,019 --> 00:39:58,150
understands the process what we've had

990
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,890
is those those who are coming and don't

991
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:01,150
understand the process of how we get I

992
00:39:59,889 --> 00:40:02,769
totally understand where you're trying

993
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:03,910
to go and how you're trying to do it you

994
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:05,858
know that something you're right at some

995
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:07,239
point we'll have mega-farms out there

996
00:40:05,858 --> 00:40:08,529
and will destroy all these little guys

997
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:10,209
that are trying to I mean that's what we

998
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,800
do we put each other out of business all

999
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:14,889
day long in the agricultural community

1000
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,240
we over produce it will eventually level

1001
00:40:14,889 --> 00:40:18,098
out and then the price will come down

1002
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:20,500
and it won't be the Wild West it will

1003
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:22,510
level out but we need to try to figure

1004
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:25,920
out a way that we can capture that

1005
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:25,920
revenue for the state there are a lot of

1006
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:31,180
consequences that come with you know

1007
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:32,410
bringing this into the regulated market

1008
00:40:31,179 --> 00:40:33,818
that we don't even know yet talking

1009
00:40:32,409 --> 00:40:35,529
about driving impaired than all those

1010
00:40:33,818 --> 00:40:37,568
things there needs to be a revenue that

1011
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:39,910
comes with that when we when we came out

1012
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:41,889
prohibition we've made it was set up a

1013
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:43,449
little better right we basically said

1014
00:40:41,889 --> 00:40:45,460
hey you're going to go buy it from this

1015
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:46,750
store and they have a license so if you

1016
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:50,019
want to do alcohol you had to your

1017
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:52,269
license yet to be controlled and if you

1018
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:55,269
weren't at that license you you got a

1019
00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:56,440
penalty right now with the way that as

1020
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:58,179
you all know when that way it came

1021
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,519
through with the propositions is there's

1022
00:40:58,179 --> 00:41:01,808
no place to really we're trying to force

1023
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:05,259
ourselves into that because it's been

1024
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:06,819
set up wrong so I think all or what

1025
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,200
you're doing and I think most of the

1026
00:41:06,818 --> 00:41:09,400
members here are trying to get to that

1027
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:11,169
point where we actually capture that

1028
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,639
revenue and we actually get it in the

1029
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:14,980
control bar so the consumer at the end

1030
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:17,019
knows exactly what when they buy my seed

1031
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:18,818
they know what's in the bag and that's

1032
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:20,409
what we need to know when they when we

1033
00:41:18,818 --> 00:41:22,000
sell this stuff that the consumer the

1034
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:24,429
other end goes okay this is what I'm

1035
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,619
getting this the potency this it has it

1036
00:41:24,429 --> 00:41:28,179
what's it been sprayed with what those

1037
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:29,858
tape cards in there so I appreciate what

1038
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:31,649
you're doing I thank you for taking the

1039
00:41:29,858 --> 00:41:34,420
time to come down today appreciate it

1040
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:36,130
thank Jack I know there's several

1041
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,220
questions are for you but let's just ask

1042
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,990
the first

1043
00:41:37,219 --> 00:41:43,519
told question is will we be ready in

1044
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:48,049
January yes all right I like that we

1045
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:53,269
could just make that clear what to

1046
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:55,849
further expand I'm sorry thank you I the

1047
00:41:53,269 --> 00:42:00,380
level of coordination January 2018 Yeah

1048
00:41:55,849 --> 00:42:01,880
right right there it has been the level

1049
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,740
of coordination between the other two

1050
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,530
departments and all the state agencies

1051
00:42:03,739 --> 00:42:08,209
we are committed to making sure that

1052
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:10,160
this is off the ground and we're

1053
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:13,400
accepting applications on january first

1054
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:16,848
2018 and where we can issue some

1055
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:19,190
licenses on january one 2018 we've made

1056
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:21,619
it very clear not everything we can't

1057
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:24,349
issue everybody a license obviously on

1058
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:25,670
january first 2018 and we we recognize

1059
00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:27,559
there's going to be some transitional

1060
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,780
periods that we're going to have to make

1061
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:31,489
some decisions like once we license a

1062
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,200
dispensary what do we do is the product

1063
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:35,509
that's currently in the dispensaries

1064
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:37,009
because it won't be it won't be tested

1065
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:39,109
and whatnot it won't be in track and

1066
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:40,609
trace so those are some transitional

1067
00:42:39,108 --> 00:42:43,309
issues that i think will work through

1068
00:42:40,608 --> 00:42:44,960
over the first year and then probably be

1069
00:42:43,309 --> 00:42:47,509
working with you to make some tweaks or

1070
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,420
making tweak to our regulations as that

1071
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:51,830
occurs yeah absolutely i know we got a

1072
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:54,740
couple spot builds and a lot of members

1073
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:55,789
that are interested but can you talk a

1074
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,469
little bit cuz you talked about it is

1075
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:59,630
your testimony the emergency regulations

1076
00:42:57,469 --> 00:43:02,529
how that's going to work out how long

1077
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:06,320
you anticipate those to be as we consist

1078
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:08,839
start transitioning into the whole full

1079
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,369
regulatory body work alright so at least

1080
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:13,190
for the medical side we're going to go

1081
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:14,750
through the full rulemaking process we

1082
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:17,480
are we are going to like we say we're

1083
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:19,250
going to notice them early spring and

1084
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,250
it's going to kick off our 45-day

1085
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:24,079
comment period we're going to have our

1086
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:26,210
hearings across the state get feedback

1087
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:27,789
and then respond to that feedback and

1088
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:31,190
maybe even have to go out for another

1089
00:43:27,789 --> 00:43:33,679
comment period then those that we think

1090
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:35,119
a lot of what's in the medical that is a

1091
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:37,909
lot of it's similar to what's in

1092
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,440
proposition 64 that is the feedback we

1093
00:43:37,909 --> 00:43:42,230
get from that that's going to help us

1094
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:45,380
with those emergency regulations for

1095
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:47,630
prop 64 and then also any legislative

1096
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:49,309
changes we will then do that through the

1097
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:51,079
emergency regulations so we

1098
00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:53,539
plein de I think you know we're all

1099
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:57,289
looking at august/september once we have

1100
00:43:53,539 --> 00:43:59,360
a clear what the legislature is going to

1101
00:43:57,289 --> 00:44:02,420
do and then we're going to work on

1102
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:04,910
probably noticing those and I believe

1103
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:07,159
the statute gives us like 180 days we're

1104
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:08,899
still going to go through the comment

1105
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:10,519
period it'll just be after the fact that

1106
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,800
the emergency regulations will take

1107
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:15,289
place an effective immediately or

1108
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,180
there's a there's a time period there

1109
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:20,570
got it but you have a game plan in place

1110
00:44:17,179 --> 00:44:22,730
and you're ready to go yes we have a

1111
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:24,580
game plan and we have to change that

1112
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:29,119
game plan frequently we're always

1113
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:30,409
reassessing our timeline constantly ok I

1114
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,299
have additional questions that I know

1115
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:33,949
members are anxious to ask you to plenty

1116
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,330
of questions but let's start with mr.

1117
00:44:33,949 --> 00:44:41,089
Cooley and then we'll move to mr.

1118
00:44:35,329 --> 00:44:42,349
Johnson really two questions for all the

1119
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:45,500
attendees I thank you very much for

1120
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:48,199
being here this is very much the basic

1121
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:51,440
idea behind 266 was to have a lead

1122
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:52,730
agency apartment with other agencies to

1123
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,980
make sure we cover the whole waterfront

1124
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:56,990
but take advantage of expertise so I'm

1125
00:44:54,980 --> 00:45:00,349
delighted to just kind of see how it's

1126
00:44:56,989 --> 00:45:02,149
unfolding and I mentioned the

1127
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:04,489
characterization just generally not

1128
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:06,289
warranting the level of this but how are

1129
00:45:04,489 --> 00:45:07,699
you staffed up at this stage for what

1130
00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:10,940
you think you're going to end up being

1131
00:45:07,699 --> 00:45:12,559
and I sort of feel like ms Ajax you have

1132
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:14,590
a different challenge than the

1133
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:17,119
established agencies that were sort of

1134
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:17,930
tackling in there is this danger but I'd

1135
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,569
be incident getting a quick

1136
00:45:17,929 --> 00:45:22,099
characterization from folks on that and

1137
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:24,680
then I'd like to hear a little bit about

1138
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:26,569
the advisory committee I always felt the

1139
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:30,519
advisory committee was a very important

1140
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:35,030
transitional body because the original

1141
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:37,369
prop from 1996 dealt with affordable

1142
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:39,530
access we're going into a different

1143
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:41,119
market and that was a place where issues

1144
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:44,360
of access we're going to be able to be

1145
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,949
discussed and it became a way to let low

1146
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:47,900
and moderate income Californians people

1147
00:45:45,949 --> 00:45:49,819
dependent upon the old system to have

1148
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,650
their voice in the system but so a

1149
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:54,050
characterization of staffing levels just

1150
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:57,349
gently across the 38 season in the

1151
00:45:54,050 --> 00:46:00,980
Advisory Committee I'll start with a for

1152
00:45:57,349 --> 00:46:03,230
the bureau we were we have a 15 position

1153
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:06,019
that we were through the bcp

1154
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:08,929
that were authorized we currently have

1155
00:46:06,019 --> 00:46:11,989
six vacancies but we've also utilized a

1156
00:46:08,929 --> 00:46:15,169

1159
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:22,460
we're partnering up with water resources

1160
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:25,489
with MoU with them to help us with that

1161
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:26,929

1166
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:38,029
vacancies are we've we've helped staff

1167
00:46:35,989 --> 00:46:39,589

1168
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:41,150
the Department of Consumer Affairs that

1169
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:45,850
helps us with a lot of our

1170
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:48,470
administrative tasks with budgets and

1171
00:46:45,849 --> 00:46:51,190
helping us with human resources issues

1172
00:46:48,469 --> 00:46:53,269
and contracts and so they've been

1173
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:55,970
supplementing us and helping us through

1174
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:59,750
for for our staffing great overview

1175
00:46:55,969 --> 00:47:02,809
thank you very much for the Parma Sweden

1176
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:06,230
agriculture we have a hard 22 people so

1177
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:08,980
far and but I mean in terms of how that

1178
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:12,500
relates to the scale budget proposal

1179
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:13,909
proposals to hire 60 people next year

1180
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:16,789
and anticipation because you know the

1181
00:47:13,909 --> 00:47:18,618
gamer ones in the budget year and then

1182
00:47:16,789 --> 00:47:21,380
but we're full scale we're going to be

1183
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:25,039
you know in excess of 150 employees for

1184
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:27,680
the bid for the division and so I can't

1185
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:29,000
provide you with exact numbers but we're

1186
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:31,608
staffed for the development of the

1187
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,619
regulations and what we've done is also

1188
00:47:31,608 --> 00:47:35,980
submit for additional positions in the

1189
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:38,900
bcp in order to help us establish

1190
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:40,280
training for people to who want to do

1191
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:42,710
manufacturing I want to become a

1192
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:46,180
licensee's but then also to establish

1193
00:47:42,710 --> 00:47:47,990
five at this point we're thinking five

1194
00:47:46,179 --> 00:47:49,730
offices throughout the state of

1195
00:47:47,989 --> 00:47:51,169
California so there's ready access in

1196
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:52,519
all the different areas and that's going

1197
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:55,700
to require additional staff as well

1198
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:59,869
thank you and for the advisory committee

1199
00:47:55,699 --> 00:48:01,730
question so under the medical cameras

1200
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:03,920
regulation and Safety Act there was a it

1201
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:07,309
was a there wasn't required it was a May

1202
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:10,849
and so we are approached with to really

1203
00:48:07,309 --> 00:48:12,349
do a robust public outreach for the

1204
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:14,269
first because you know a lot of our

1205
00:48:12,349 --> 00:48:16,099
staff including myself there was a lot

1206
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:17,300
of learning we had to do to learn about

1207
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:19,639
the industry how they

1208
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:22,570
operate here about all the concerns so

1209
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:24,739
we use that approach under the medical

1210
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:27,650
instead of the advisory committee but

1211
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:31,039
under proposition 64 is required and we

1212
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:33,170
are working on putting out the process

1213
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:35,179
for selecting those committee members

1214
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:39,050
because we really think that going to be

1215
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:41,359
very helpful when we do the adult use

1216
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:43,970
regulations going forward and where we

1217
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:46,610
really want that input like you said we

1218
00:48:43,969 --> 00:48:48,799
need that input let me just ask wouldn't

1219
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:52,240
you anticipate that first advisory

1220
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,830
committee coming together for a meeting

1221
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:56,809
well first where we're going to have an

1222
00:48:54,829 --> 00:49:00,860
application process and then make the

1223
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:03,980
selection I would wear that's a priority

1224
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:06,980
right now for the for the bureau and so

1225
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:09,409
I expect that to happen very soon okay

1226
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:12,289
so selection process will conclude when

1227
00:49:09,409 --> 00:49:15,049
they have anticipated date now or not

1228
00:49:12,289 --> 00:49:17,210
yeah we expect to have the application

1229
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:19,220
process of be able to announce that

1230
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:21,500
probably within the next week or so with

1231
00:49:19,219 --> 00:49:23,689
like a 30-day period for people to apply

1232
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,639
and then make selection so I would

1233
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:27,829
anticipate a first meeting being at

1234
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:29,150
least several months down the road okay

1235
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:31,159
thank you i think mr. Cooley had a

1236
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:33,619
follow-up question i was more going to

1237
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:35,690
make a fall just on session my

1238
00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:38,389
recollection is through most life of

1239
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:41,420
this discussion the advisory 20 was was

1240
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:44,509
a shall at the end it probably was

1241
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:47,180
switched to a may but i think the issues

1242
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:48,980
had covered and the and the foot hole

1243
00:49:47,179 --> 00:49:53,629
that gave certain people to kind of be

1244
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:55,429
inside the conversation and my statute

1245
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:58,280
sort of affirmed that their viewpoint on

1246
00:49:55,429 --> 00:50:00,259
those issues was important is probably

1247
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:02,930
an important piece of kind of how it

1248
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:06,490
moves forward so I do understand as the

1249
00:50:02,929 --> 00:50:09,409
Lord of this we shall in May but I think

1250
00:50:06,489 --> 00:50:12,769
for the chemistry of how we sort of

1251
00:50:09,409 --> 00:50:15,379
advanced a conversation I definitely

1252
00:50:12,769 --> 00:50:18,619
think that protected on the issue of

1253
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:21,710
access that's a very important body to

1254
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:23,239
constitute in it and it gives you a way

1255
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:26,480
to give some people and see that the

1256
00:50:23,239 --> 00:50:30,859
table that might otherwise feel sort of

1257
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:33,980
not included and I think it becomes it

1258
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:36,920
may be an a but it may be a very useful

1259
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:39,409
management tool for the conversation so

1260
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:42,860
observation on it thank you very much I

1261
00:50:39,409 --> 00:50:46,039
need right Thank you Thank You mr. rules

1262
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:50,200
chair looks good i move to mr. reginald

1263
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:56,079
Byron Jones Sawyer senior very good

1264
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:59,539
Thank You mr. chair you know part of and

1265
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:02,059
it might be for all maybe just miss age

1266
00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:04,400
actually because you've been singled out

1267
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:08,090
more than anything else part of the

1268
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:10,840
reason why a B 266 was successful after

1269
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:14,000
years and years of people trying to

1270
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:16,780
basically get regulations in I think it

1271
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,460
because we had several joint authors

1272
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:22,519
between Mr Bond circle allegiance or

1273
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:23,750
Lackey and mr. wood which we

1274
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:26,960
affectionately call ourselves the

1275
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:30,260
fabulous five we were able to get

1276
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,300
something done that nobody else had been

1277
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:35,290
able to do and I think because we were

1278
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:38,060
inclusive we were a broad spectrum of

1279
00:51:35,289 --> 00:51:40,789
mod aggressive a broad spectrum of

1280
00:51:38,059 --> 00:51:43,340
different geographic areas and I think

1281
00:51:40,789 --> 00:51:46,519
most important we also were bipartisan

1282
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:50,480
and I think that really really helped

1283
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:51,949
and us moving to where we are now if you

1284
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:55,400
if you think about if we hadn't put into

1285
00:51:51,949 --> 00:51:58,159
regulations now prophet64 passes we

1286
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:02,210
would be starting from scratch scratch

1287
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:05,299
scratch and and so it was the input of

1288
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:08,900
everyone and so from a predominantly

1289
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:13,220
Latino African American community or I'm

1290
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:15,500
very concerned that we may or may not

1291
00:52:13,219 --> 00:52:18,500
have an opportunity to be at the table

1292
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:22,159
may not have an opportunity to to have

1293
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:25,010
input I would not I mean I am concerned

1294
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:27,109
that we look up one day we get all this

1295
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:29,810
done and the mobility of people who are

1296
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:32,840
in business are white males with a lot

1297
00:52:29,809 --> 00:52:35,150
of money or corporations as my colleague

1298
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:37,220
talked about and we don't afford the

1299
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:39,230
opportunity of people of color to

1300
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:41,539
participate in this in any substance of

1301
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:45,590
ways and i'm not talking about selling

1302
00:52:41,539 --> 00:52:48,279
to us because we are great consumers but

1303
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:51,230
do we have an opportunity to participate

1304
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:54,050
the second part of that is the impacts

1305
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:56,659
that it can have on our community I know

1306
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:59,720
when we went down this road of having

1307
00:52:56,659 --> 00:53:02,690
liquor stores for example probably more

1308
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:04,609
affluent areas that probably became

1309
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:07,340
liquor store boutiques where they're so

1310
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:10,400
fine wines they were unbelievable

1311
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:13,039
detriment to disadvantaged communities

1312
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,530
and I think at the onset nobody ever

1313
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:17,659
really could perceived that it would be

1314
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:20,480
a problem and I think part of that is

1315
00:53:17,659 --> 00:53:22,190
because no one included people from

1316
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:26,929
disadvantaged communities Latino African

1317
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:28,639
American in the process in my district

1318
00:53:26,929 --> 00:53:31,819
I'm not certain if you reached out or

1319
00:53:28,639 --> 00:53:33,139
had any hearing in my district the 50

1320
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:36,470
nights Assembly District which is south

1321
00:53:33,139 --> 00:53:39,069
los angeles as you can show me that that

1322
00:53:36,469 --> 00:53:43,009
would be fine it would be great to know

1323
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:45,080
but more important if the outreach has

1324
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:48,710
not been a successful because i don't

1325
00:53:45,079 --> 00:53:51,739
know is there ways that we can make it

1326
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:55,599
even more successful in the future going

1327
00:53:51,739 --> 00:53:59,179
from a positive point of view if it's a

1328
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:05,360
whatever we can do to ensure that you

1329
00:53:59,179 --> 00:54:07,969
get full full of input from from these

1330
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:10,579
disadvantaged communities we need to do

1331
00:54:07,969 --> 00:54:15,189
that especially as we move from medical

1332
00:54:10,579 --> 00:54:19,159
marijuana to to full class adult use

1333
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:21,860
again it's my responsibility Valerie's

1334
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:23,829
an assemblyman but to to look out for

1335
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:25,910
the impact that will have on

1336
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:28,279
disadvantaged communities and try to see

1337
00:54:25,909 --> 00:54:31,819
it see ahead of it instead of waiting

1338
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:33,560
for it to drop on us disadvantaged our

1339
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:35,390
communities and then we have to be back

1340
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:38,360
here trying to figure out how to clean

1341
00:54:35,389 --> 00:54:40,969
it up this is a great opportunity now to

1342
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:43,880
have those discussions and not wait

1343
00:54:40,969 --> 00:54:47,539
until later and so I and I I'm hearing

1344
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:51,079
about hiring I'm hearing about a an

1345
00:54:47,539 --> 00:54:52,940
advisory committee hopefully we're

1346
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:54,578
looking at making sure it's inclusive of

1347
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:58,510
everyone

1348
00:54:54,579 --> 00:55:00,589
that you don't become advisory board as

1349
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:03,710
I like to say it the white is white

1350
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:08,389
board you ever seen but you do include

1351
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:12,230
people of color in these discussions and

1352
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:16,818
and make sure i guess most important

1353
00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:21,409
that they're heard any comic or also

1354
00:55:16,818 --> 00:55:24,650
heard crickets again no I completely

1355
00:55:21,409 --> 00:55:26,659
agree with you and I we the bureau and I

1356
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:29,028
think all of us are committed to making

1357
00:55:26,659 --> 00:55:30,980
sure we hear from everybody and I think

1358
00:55:29,028 --> 00:55:32,778
from day one that's what we want we want

1359
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:37,278
to get input from everybody not just

1360
00:55:32,778 --> 00:55:38,420
certain folks but to be inclusive and I

1361
00:55:37,278 --> 00:55:40,369
think there's always room for

1362
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:42,528
improvement I look forward to working

1363
00:55:40,369 --> 00:55:45,680
with your office we were in the LA area

1364
00:55:42,528 --> 00:55:48,679
and but downtown where people could

1365
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:50,298
hopefully get to easily but I think the

1366
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:52,308
more outreach we do the better our

1367
00:55:50,298 --> 00:55:54,469
regulations are going to be and the

1368
00:55:52,309 --> 00:55:55,940
better informed we are also working with

1369
00:55:54,469 --> 00:55:58,459
the locals we've worked a lot with the

1370
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:00,740
local cities and counties because there

1371
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:02,720
is local control they do they've been

1372
00:56:00,739 --> 00:56:05,778
dealing with this a lot longer than the

1373
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:08,028
state and so learning from them on their

1374
00:56:05,778 --> 00:56:10,309
affected communities what you know there

1375
00:56:08,028 --> 00:56:13,068
are some really good robust cities and

1376
00:56:10,309 --> 00:56:15,759
counties out there that have cannabis

1377
00:56:13,068 --> 00:56:20,268
regulations and learning from them and

1378
00:56:15,759 --> 00:56:21,588
moving forward with that so I am

1379
00:56:20,268 --> 00:56:23,328
committed to work i think the other

1380
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:24,949
thing is is our application process

1381
00:56:23,329 --> 00:56:28,068
making people understand the application

1382
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:29,899
process once we notice our regulation

1383
00:56:28,068 --> 00:56:31,818
doing that outreach and telling people

1384
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:34,548
about the opportunity and what they need

1385
00:56:31,818 --> 00:56:36,440
to have in hand on day one when they

1386
00:56:34,548 --> 00:56:38,389
want to apply with the bureau or one of

1387
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:40,068
the other departments and explaining

1388
00:56:38,389 --> 00:56:42,828
that process and getting out to the

1389
00:56:40,068 --> 00:56:45,920
communities so that they are empowered

1390
00:56:42,829 --> 00:56:48,349
to go seek a license and not have to

1391
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,088
hire a lawyer or consultant to do it for

1392
00:56:48,349 --> 00:56:51,950
them so i think that also comes into

1393
00:56:50,088 --> 00:56:55,909
play with our regulations and making

1394
00:56:51,949 --> 00:56:57,230
them simple and comprehensive and so

1395
00:56:55,909 --> 00:56:58,788
that's what we're committed to going

1396
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:00,740
forward and i look forward to working

1397
00:56:58,789 --> 00:57:02,509
with your office so it sounds like the

1398
00:57:00,739 --> 00:57:04,259
message has been received and it's a

1399
00:57:02,509 --> 00:57:05,639
good segue into our next panel to

1400
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,650
to see how that's actually working on

1401
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:09,269
the local level but I just have to quick

1402
00:57:07,650 --> 00:57:10,619
follow-up questions for you but say Jax

1403
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:12,659
and then we're going to move on unless

1404
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:14,880
members have additional questions but

1405
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:17,339
you know you touched upon you know us

1406
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:20,460
making sure we're how long the licenses

1407
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:22,079
ready for 2018 is there a priority like

1408
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:23,760
how are we prioritizing that how are we

1409
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:26,159
going to work through that I don't know

1410
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:28,020
if you expand on that just a little bit

1411
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:31,139
and then going to have one more question

1412
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:35,639
so there is priority licensing in both

1413
00:57:31,139 --> 00:57:38,250
medical and the adult use statutes and

1414
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:39,929
so we're going to be looking at you know

1415
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:41,789
most of it is people who are currently

1416
00:57:39,929 --> 00:57:44,039
in operation or good standing so we're

1417
00:57:41,789 --> 00:57:46,730
going to be looking at that when we

1418
00:57:44,039 --> 00:57:51,150
prioritize who we licensed fun on

1419
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:53,340
starting in january of 2018 and there is

1420
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:56,130
also authority in the adult use for us

1421
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:57,539
to a temporary licenses okay thank you

1422
00:57:56,130 --> 00:58:02,430
and then maybe I should ask this is all

1423
00:57:57,539 --> 00:58:05,489
three of you as mature women caballero

1424
00:58:02,429 --> 00:58:08,069
sherman mr. wood and myself there's a

1425
00:58:05,489 --> 00:58:10,699
lot of bills being talked about and

1426
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:13,200
proposed and spot bills are currently

1427
00:58:10,699 --> 00:58:15,779
before us are going to come before us

1428
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:17,369
but do you anticipate anything that we

1429
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:19,290
should be focusing on I know we touched

1430
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:22,949
off a little bit earlier or we need to

1431
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:25,800
do the entire fix but something we

1432
00:58:22,949 --> 00:58:29,099
should be looking at specifically as the

1433
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:30,840
chairs of these three committees yeah I

1434
00:58:29,099 --> 00:58:34,170
mean I think we're having discussions

1435
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:36,420
but both internally and those folks are

1436
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:38,340
having conversations with legislative

1437
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:40,320
representatives about sort of what those

1438
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:41,850
areas are I mean certainly at the

1439
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:43,650
department food nag there's a difference

1440
00:58:41,849 --> 00:58:45,329
between the two licensed types other

1441
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:48,180
requirements under Merkerson and if

1442
00:58:45,329 --> 00:58:51,389
acquirements that our prop 64 are

1443
00:58:48,179 --> 00:58:53,250
different so reconciling those something

1444
00:58:51,389 --> 00:58:56,400
that you know that's our sort of part of

1445
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:58,760
the conversation is that I think other

1446
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,840
entities have sort of similar

1447
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,370
discrepancies but I know that there's

1448
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,870
sort of a working group of folks that

1449
00:59:02,369 --> 00:59:04,889
are hammering those out so maybe I

1450
00:59:03,869 --> 00:59:06,000
should ask a question a little bit

1451
00:59:04,889 --> 00:59:09,059
differently because I know we're going

1452
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:11,219
to have the reconciliation bill later on

1453
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:12,630
but are there any specific legislative

1454
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:14,579
needs to specifically for

1455
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:16,740
department that are dated at this time

1456
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:19,049
or we're just kind of work through it

1457
00:59:16,739 --> 00:59:21,649
will figure it out yeah I think it's

1458
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:21,650
matter
