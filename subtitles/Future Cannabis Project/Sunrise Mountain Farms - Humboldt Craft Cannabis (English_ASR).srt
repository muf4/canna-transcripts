on good good to see you guys um tell us

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,719
a little bit about how you got started

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,760
in cannabis like what's the background

10
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,640
um

11
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:25,199
for me i've always had a love of

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:28,000
cannabis ever since i was a teenager and

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,920
just moving out to humboldt county

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,920
i actually came here because it was just

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,320
a really beautiful place that talked to

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,920
me and called me in and then being here

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,960
i kind of just got

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,439
into the uh i got my eyes opened up to

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,039
the cultivation side of things and i

20
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:44,718
just kind of felt like it was something

21
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,719
i just started to play with because i

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,280
just love cannabis and then next thing i

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,520
knew i just really connected with it and

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,439
found myself kind of immersed in it yeah

25
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,000
how long how long has that been for you

26
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,959
it's been 21 years now

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,960
wow yeah that's that's the stretch yeah

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,799
that's amazing and so

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,879
you know as far as what you do for

30
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:06,319
farming i mean is it for

31
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,680
is it more for the do you like some

32
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:09,199
people do it for the plant some people

33
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,040
do it for the people

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,079
it's like where where do you stand with

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,080
uh i mean i kind of like play around

36
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,840
both of that you know it's like the

37
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:19,519
connection to the plant

38
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,159
but it's the medicine that it's creating

39
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:24,478
that's going to the people amazing yeah

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,200
for sure so it's cool

41
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:29,599
yeah i got into cannabis um also about

42
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,600
20 years ago well actually longer about

43
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:34,640
22 years ago

44
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:36,559
and um when i started it was in southern

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,320
humboldt and i got to

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,719
learn from people who had been doing it

47
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,158
for like 20 years before me

48
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:43,679
so i feel like it was kind of a

49
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,399
privilege to learn from people who had

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,759
been growing organically

51
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,560
in harmony with nature but still like

52
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,599
they were gorilla growing actually

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,519
and um but in like a really this kind of

54
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,959
sustainable way where it wasn't like

55
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:00,879
trashing

56
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:02,478
nature and um

57
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,718
and then i also

58
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:07,039
got to work with people who were working

59
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,679
breeding a lot of different strains and

60
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,680
so that was really exciting for me

61
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,479
because i was finding medical benefit

62
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,680
from it and that was really exciting so

63
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,560
for me

64
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,640
um

65
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,439
i've always wanted to bring organic

66
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,719
medicine to people amazing yeah

67
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,159
you guys have been doing it for quite

68
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,840
some time now

69
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,919
um you want to talk a little about

70
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,719
sunrise mountain farms like what makes

71
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:33,919
your farm you know your farm

72
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:37,199
yeah um i purchased the property about

73
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:40,159
18 years ago and have been cultivating

74
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,598
there for 18 years a super very small

75
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,719
scale of course

76
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:48,079
for medical cannabis and

77
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:50,639
yeah and so we've had a long time to

78
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,400
work in that location and really get to

79
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,159
know our terroir

80
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,879
and really get to know like what works

81
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:00,239
and what doesn't work and the influences

82
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:02,239
of the climate and the soil and even

83
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,599
different locations on our property yeah

84
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,280
i was curious about that because you

85
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:06,878
guys i watched you guys on instagram a

86
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,120
lot and i haven't been to your farm yet

87
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,120
even though i would like to visit but i

88
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,759
see you guys are up at higher elevations

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,959
what is it 20 something yeah it's about

90
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:20,000
2200 feet uh the property ranges between

91
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,280
22 and 26 the the farm itself is

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,158
probably like right in the middle of

93
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,000
that

94
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,519
and so um

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
yeah and you know it's been you know we

96
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,319
talked about like 18 years and it's so

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,719
the property has been like a slow

98
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,399
evolution of

99
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,719
what our vision has

100
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,799
been you know and so it's

101
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,239
not like this we came in and like a lot

102
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,840
of people just

103
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,439
bulldozed and

104
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,360
put a garden and it's like we really

105
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,158
connected with the land we're like

106
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,120
homesteading styles so we always grew

107
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:52,479
with

108
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,200
fruit trees and plants and you know

109
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,039
companion planting and permaculture has

110
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:59,839
always been a part of our

111
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,679
gardening practices and

112
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,000
we used to work with

113
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,959
making teas and just experiment a lot

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,719
because back like 15 20 years ago

115
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,438
you know there wasn't really very much

116
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:13,438
knowledge about growing cannabis like

117
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,919
you know now you can like just look up

118
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,918
anything but we were just really like

119
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,599
it's really fun and exciting to like

120
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,439
experiment with it

121
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,759
um it was also scary at times when

122
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,600
there's like helicopters flying or you

123
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,319
know really

124
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,439
but um yeah so it's just really cool to

125
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,918
be

126
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,160
uh part of that kind of

127
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,399
time yeah it's amazing did you have

128
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,080
anything unique you know that you do

129
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,000
like something that you know you do in

130
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,519
your farm it's like

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,759
mulching compost teas you know recycling

132
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,000
what anything the past five years i've

133
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,319
been getting into the k f and jadam

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,199
methodology

135
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,199
so really just breaking away from buying

136
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,040
any nutrients and just really looking to

137
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,720
the land and also

138
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,039
sourcing stuff that are more like you

139
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,479
know organic fruits and vegetables and

140
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,079
and then finding

141
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,800
every year there's always so much more

142
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,159
learning that goes in with that and so

143
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,680
um

144
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,560
being able to

145
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,918
take

146
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,959
old products and turn it into fertilizer

147
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,079
fun you know forest microbes and imo's

148
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,799
and just

149
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:23,680
deferments and just bringing that into

150
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,800
the fold and not having to rely on

151
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,199
store-bought products and

152
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,439
our results every year been getting

153
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,038
better it's been pretty amazing so it

154
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,038
seems like the more we're breaking away

155
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,800
from that and just getting into this

156
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,478
idea

157
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,400
and to go back also what laura lee was

158
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,399
saying when we got started like we had

159
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,879
our gardens mixed in with our fruit

160
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,839
trees and our vegetables

161
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,759
and

162
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,038
uh because of regulation we had to

163
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,560
switch a lot of things around so we had

164
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:54,319
to move

165
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:56,240
our garden spots and so right our garden

166
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,800
itself like you know it's like part of

167
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,960
it is older but really a lot of it is

168
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,240
newer because we had to move things

169
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,439
around and you know just consolidated uh

170
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,680
you know parts because we have these

171
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,759
little micro climates yeah the apple

172
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,759
tree then the bed yeah

173
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,759
these inner lace

174
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,600
operating systems

175
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,840
and now it has to be like no it's like

176
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,400
this area that's here's the cannabis you

177
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:23,599
know and so and so now we're working on

178
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:26,000
like that kind of newer garden to add

179
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,240
more plants and fruit trees to that area

180
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,720
and when we did move our gardens we

181
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,639
actually took some of that old soil

182
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,039
a lot of that old soil and we moved it

183
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,439
to the new site because we've been soil

184
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,719
building for 15 years you know more than

185
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,160
yeah for the years yeah so

186
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,160
yeah we've been soil building so we

187
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,840
wanted to bring that you know to the new

188
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,319
garden site and so we're working on

189
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,560
developing that more there it's amazing

190
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,360
and then also like how to capture water

191
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,598
just by how you're designing your your

192
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,280
plot you know so we have a slope so we

193
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:58,800
worked with swales

194
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,038
you know so on the slopes we have our

195
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,960
swales to capture all that rain water

196
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,199
and hold that stone when it does come

197
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,198
down and at the right below that we did

198
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,960
mounds because it flattens out a little

199
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,038
bit to kind of help capture any kind of

200
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,959
runoff and then we just store that water

201
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:14,560
as it's raining and coming down when

202
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,159
it's present so it's

203
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,319
there for the plants later like better

204
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,160
are you talking about storing in a uh

205
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,240
above ground or just in the actual in

206
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,319
the actual soil so it just stays so if

207
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,639
the beds are nearby

208
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,639
the moisture level general in the ground

209
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,240
yeah it's like a permaculture um

210
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,639
technique where it's like swales will

211
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,199
kind of collect the water you know so

212
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,960
yeah yeah so it's been really like

213
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,280
awesome to be able to implement all

214
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,758
these different ideas into what

215
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,918
sunrise mountain is now and what we're

216
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,400
shaping it and forming it to be you know

217
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,719
because now in our new area that we are

218
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:50,799
farming we are going to incorporate the

219
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,960
companion planting and the fruit trees

220
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,439
again and start bringing in these

221
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:56,878
elements that kind of make it more of a

222
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,399
whole like one

223
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,000
holistic kind of do you think you guys

224
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:01,679
are gonna do like because i've i don't

225
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,759
know in my mind it's like if you have to

226
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,918
have the cannabis plot in one area then

227
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,160
like the borders on the outside of that

228
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,878
would be where you have the permaculture

229
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,800
systems like running yeah yeah it works

230
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,960
best that way i mean we do also we kind

231
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,960
of experiment every year with like

232
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,120
growing plants companion planting like

233
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,799
within the cannabis beds too but then

234
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,639
sometimes that can block airflow and

235
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,840
things so it has to be the right kind of

236
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,960
plants like

237
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:26,159
yeah i did carrots one year two years

238
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:26,159
camera chamomile

239
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,639
ago

240
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,278
a huge row of carrots down a little

241
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,759
flower bed and it was wild how many

242
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,200
ladybugs came in oh really

243
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:37,918
i'll show you some photos it was wow oh

244
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,879
yeah

245
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,478
that's good

246
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:41,838
i mean the only thing a caveat i would

247
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,800
say is that there's increased water

248
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,760
usage

249
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,120
and increased fertilization requirements

250
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,919
to maintain both

251
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,000
plants

252
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,879
what i tried this year was the potatoes

253
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,958
and i actually i i list i will follow

254
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,320
nick on resource gardens you know and he

255
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,799
kind of turned me on i listened to this

256
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,760
podcast with him and chango los actually

257
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,278
and

258
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,278
it was really good and i just was like

259
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,958
oh potatoes man i'm gonna try that and

260
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,278
actually it was awesome because it

261
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:08,958
created an awesome living mulch and then

262
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,879
you're eating potatoes throughout the

263
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:12,319
year and it didn't interfere with the

264
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,320
with the plants at all and actually it

265
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,760
was kind of nice because what i found

266
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,839
with that living mulch because it was a

267
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,240
little higher it made my plants not so

268
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,160
much just go outward to fill their space

269
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,080
they came up a little bit so when the

270
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,159
potatoes started to die back and it came

271
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,720
time for like pruning time it really

272
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,639
like the plant structure was how it was

273
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,040
better it was it was helped shape by

274
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,480
that higher living canopy and so can you

275
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,799
do me a favor because i'm a stickler for

276
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,320
detail sometimes can you give me an idea

277
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,479
of the

278
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,959
base planting so the potatoes like were

279
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,639
planted around the base of the plants so

280
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,879
i can give you exactly it's a 40-foot

281
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,559
row that's four feet wide and i have the

282
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,480
plants running right down the center and

283
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,879
i had the potatoes right along the edges

284
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,399
oh perfect it's very clear yeah oh cool

285
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,919
i might try that i've got a i just

286
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,559
planted a row of garlic so maybe on the

287
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,559
other side i'll try potatoes this year

288
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,000
and another plus to that too is also if

289
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,838
you have rodent problems like ground

290
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,039
running moles and bowls and things they

291
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,800
don't really particularly like the

292
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,000
potatoes because they get in the way oh

293
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:09,199
interesting so all of a sudden you're

294
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,039
creating another

295
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,959
barrier that you're like you know a lot

296
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:14,958
of the stuff we've done in developing is

297
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,719
also wiring our beds to keep the ground

298
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,559
rodents out but there's always ways they

299
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,639
find their way in so that's a unique to

300
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,679
you guys situation because i don't have

301
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,600
we're

302
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,439
not very far apart maybe

303
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,278
as a crow flies five or ten miles but

304
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,279
i'm only at 200 feet

305
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,838
in the valley and i don't have any we

306
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,919
don't have any problems with with

307
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,440
rodents like one errant one that comes

308
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,599
through once in a while gotcha so you

309
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,079
guys have to deal with that yes

310
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,959
see the complexities of farming that are

311
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:45,039
real every site has its own complexities

312
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,799
it's so true that's so cool well yeah

313
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,439
i'm gonna try the potatoes i remember i

314
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,278
got i got tuned in with potatoes from um

315
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,120
alpenglow craig was telling me about it

316
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,200
because i was researching symphonies and

317
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,200
dealing with sinful ends and maybe the

318
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,200
potatoes were actually like you know a

319
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,200
good addition to a garden to kind of

320
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,440
mitigate maybe their give them a food to

321
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,879
go to right you know the root system

322
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,480
yeah but then there's the argument of

323
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,919
like what you're attracting a man too

324
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,759
right and then you're breeding i know

325
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,679
it's all very valid i don't think the

326
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,600
science is settled on that so but it's

327
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,879
an interesting interesting time to

328
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,320
research it

329
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:17,600
well cool um

330
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,519
that's really interesting about your

331
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,278
farm i appreciate it i think now we

332
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,440
should look and check out your really

333
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,278

that there is a new strain we pheno

338
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:37,039

the property oh sweet it's our creme de

340

luna

341
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,360
which is a cultivar that we've been

342
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,399
growing now for 12 years

343
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:50,480
and it's also crossed with this triple

344
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,799
berry goo which is i can yep afghu cross

345
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,399
with um

346
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,399
blueberry

347
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,600
razzleberry and

348
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,839

349
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,399
oh man it's berry it's so buried and

350
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,959
it's a berry with a with a sour it has a

351
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,720
sour thing and it almost has a hint of

352
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,239
cheese or something

353
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,000
yeah it's like a creamy it's probably

354
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,440
the creme creme everyone's got generally

355
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,278
factory you know you pick up different

356
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,040
scents but yeah yeah

357
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,480
wow yeah it's really complex it's a

358
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,120
complex profile

359
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,039
and i mean again like is it i hate to

360
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,120
use the words since we're trying to get

361
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:25,278
away from indica sativa this is really

362
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,799
like a kind of a balanced hybrid so our

363
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,879
creme de luna which we've been growing

364
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,439
for 12 years like you said it's super

365
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,958
indica really good for sleep muscle

366
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,839
spasms

367
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:37,518
and um relaxing and really good for like

368
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,480
bringing your focus in that's the creme

369
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,399
de luna

370
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,039
so we yeah really like bring your focus

371
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,559
into one focus or quieting your mind at

372
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:46,319
the end of the day it's really high in

373
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,319
mercene

374
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,639
and so we cross that with more of the

375
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,200
daytime strain which is the berries the

376
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,560
triple berry and so that brings it um

377
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,720
there's pinene in it and so yeah so it's

378
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,638
actually mercing pinene

379
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,079
really berry flavors and there's a lot

380
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,320
of um

381
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,799
there's some sesquiterpenes in there and

382
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,480
there's like a lot of um kind of micro

383
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:11,759
terpenes in there so

384
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,159

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,600
stoked on its structure i mean the plant

389
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,519
itself is just

390
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,879

colas you know

394
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,159
and i think the uh i know people are so

395
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:40,239
into thc i think the thc on that was 32

396
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:43,198
percent oh hey that doesn't hurt it

397
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,360
doesn't hurt and then total total terp

398
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,799
or yeah total cannabinoids i mean total

399
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,800
cannabinoids were

400
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,799
37

401
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:59,600
dz3 dz3 now dz3 is a dozy zos uh bred by

402
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:02,159
green fire genetics we

403
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,680
are calling coining it the dz3 to help

404
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,360
uh

405
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,359
we have two different phenos that we

406
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,079
grow on the farm and so we want to have

407
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,399
a different name to kind of like just

408
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,399
help the customers understand that there

409
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,399
are two different cultivars and they're

410
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,720
different from each other

411
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,879
one leans towards skittles one leads

412
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,959
more towards dossier dough crossing the

413
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,958
skittles yeah yeah you can complete you

414
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,679
i smell the skittles yeah it's got that

415
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:30,319
real candy and with the with the gas

416
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,838
that gas mix it's a candy gas candy gas

417
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,480
handy gas

418
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,320
the custis or the custies will pass easy

419
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,399
three leans towards the skittles first

420
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,800
yeah this is nice it's really nice and

421
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,320
it's chunky too chunky and the flavor

422
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,319
like that nose comes through in the

423
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,720
flavor so good we actually work with

424
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,399
papa select with that to make uh live

425
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,480
rosin and oh nice we we got tenth uh in

426
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,039
the emerald cup with that and so it's

427
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,839
correct it gets up there gets a little

428
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,599
yeah so it's uh

429
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,680
recognized dz3 dz3 is also kind of a

430
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,720
hype more of a hybrid we like to smoke

431
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,000
it well during the day or early evening

432
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,560
but um

433
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,559
yeah it's super flavorful it has like a

434
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,958
little hint of lemongrass kind of

435
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:15,119
tropical fruit

436
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,599
pretty euphoric i kind of i kind of like

437
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,000
that a little bit psychedelic yeah it's

438
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,519
kind of trippy psychedelic

439
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,958
it is

440
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,959

is exciting all right let's see and then

444
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,799
the strawberry

445
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:39,278
cbg cbd

446
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:41,679
all right strawberry g is a cbd

447
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,519
variety it's like

448
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,359
it changes every year we've been growing

449
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,039
it for about five years now we pheno

450
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,959
hunted it um

451
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,958
about five years ago along with a lot of

452
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,359
other cbd strains and we really like

453
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:56,559
this one for the plant structure the way

454
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,120
it grows and then also the effects

455
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:02,239
um it's usually a two to one sometimes

456
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,078
it's closer to a one to one depending on

457
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,159
you know the year and the environmental

458
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:08,319
factors because it changes slightly sure

459
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,759
so you guys are bri that what makes i

460
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,440
mean i was gonna wait but i might as

461
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,759
well interject now and what makes your

462
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,440
farm unique is you guys you know you're

463
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,560
br you're you're female you're i

464
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,120
shouldn't say female cults of our

465
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,719
hunting cultivar hunting and breeding

466
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,078
and you're breeding and as opposed to

467
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,320
just like getting what's on the market

468
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,559
you're doing more of your own we love

469
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,839
growing our own strains that's like part

470
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:31,838
of what makes it so fun right

471
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,759
let's take this amazing strain and that

472
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,600
strain and let's make like you know i

473
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,440
think i think of like the medicine that

474
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,759
that can create for people like bringing

475
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,880
these terpenes together with those or

476
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,360
the you know these different

477
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,519
cannabinoids yes you know it's like we

478
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,759
you know yeah and then also you know

479
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,600
phenol hunting the amazing work of other

480
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,600
breeders too you know and so we were

481
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,159
able to find these unique cultivars

482
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,278
within these amazing genetics you know

483
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:56,799
and and

484
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,480

we love

499
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,120
smoking it and it's very relaxing and we

500
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,120
tend to also make other products out of

501
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,879
it so we have it is that what this is

502
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,879
yeah we have a tincture there and then

503
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,880
we also have a pre-roll that's infused

504
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,280
with the keef of the strawberry g as

505
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,039
well so it gives you a little bit more

506
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,558
amazing punch yeah i think i don't know

507
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:43,759
as i get older i almost lean more

508
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:47,440
towards the cbd rate balanced ratios

509
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:50,000
balance ratios like actually cbd and thc

510
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,038
work synergistically together

511
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,839
and um it just kind of amplifies the

512
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:58,798
medicine but it also they balance each

513
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,798
other so you might not get as high

514
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:03,200
but your body is going to feel better

515
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:05,519
yeah exactly it's really kind of more

516
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,038
medicinal because i think like

517
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,639
you know breeders and the emerald

518
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:09,440
triangle here

519
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,440
for

520
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,279
decades have been growing you know we

521
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,798
weren't testing things or whatever so

522
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,038
we've been growing for like this

523
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:19,200
euphoric feeling right

524
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,960
well cbd doesn't give you that euphoric

525
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,279
feeling so there's so many strains that

526
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,160
are super high thc and people are really

527
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,519
into that but the cbd is really great

528
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,798
for

529
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,480
anxiety

530
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,639
or you're just kind of calming their

531
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,880
nervous system yeah i feel like i have a

532
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,160
lot of sports injuries like

533
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,280
achy bones

534
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,480
and it

535
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:42,879
remediates roomy that's funny relieves

536
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,599
the achiness yeah for me that's what cbd

537
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,400
does yeah it does it's great for that

538
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:50,639
too for chronic pain we've had a lot of

539
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,880
people um give us feedback about our

540
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,038
tincture and smoking the flower it

541
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,600
really works for them and then also we

542
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,839
got feedback from uh retailers

543
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,759
dispensaries that that strain was really

544
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:04,639
helping their patients who were having

545
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,798
seizures oh wow yeah yeah so it's really

546
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,480
good for you know for some people

547
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,000
perhaps especially don't make any

548
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,120
medical claims or anything it's

549
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,038
something that we you know it's a

550
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,719
cultivar that we grow because we know

551
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:16,720
it's true medicine

552
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,200
you know and so it's hard to not it's

553
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,480
not like the favorite in the market but

554
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,160
but to be honest with you there's a

555
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,558
niche of the market that really looks

556
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:28,000
for that you know so there it is in

557
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:30,000
medicine and it it tends to lean toward

558
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,919
those folks who aren't looking for that

559
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,160
punch in the face maybe it's like

560
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,919
i mean i you correct me if i'm out of

561
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,200
place here but the boomer market oh no

576
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,359
packaging i i could create all the

577
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,000
packaging too and

578
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:14,319
um i was working with a box maker we

579
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,480
figured out how to make a triangular box

580
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,000
and so oh it's a little tray yeah it's

581

like a little oh that's so cool and

582
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,919
that's a picture of the strawberry g

583
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:24,158
plant inside that's amazing so yeah

584
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,080
parallel matters yeah

585
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,559
yeah it talks about our terroir that's

586
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,639
really cool and we try to stay away from

587
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,079
plat we totally stay away from plastic

588
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,440
and mylar because we're really

589
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,519
environmental and that's a big enough

590
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,679
file to actually reuse for multiple

591
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:40,319
other yeah we really encourage people to

592
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,759
reuse these glasses wonderful tubes yeah

593
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,839
that's lovely

594
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:46,000
amazing yeah well thanks for sharing all

595
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,678
that stuff guys um i think probably the

596
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,119
final question would be

597
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,480
you know

598
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,319
in light of everything that's happened

599
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,759
in the industry like what's one thing

600
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,918
you would like to see change like if you

601
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,359
had to pick just one thing you could

602
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,280
change either with education or

603
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,439
regulation what do you think would make

604
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,240
the most impact i think one thing that

605
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,798
would really make a huge impact is if

606
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,480
we were allowed to sell directly to our

607
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:12,558
consumer base so farmer market style are

608
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,880
just supporting the small farmers in a

609
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,879
way that connects us to our consumer

610
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,320
base so that the consumer base can

611
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,400
really understand

612
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,399
what we're doing what we're creating

613
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,559
where we came from and what the medicine

614
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,640
that we're producing to give to them or

615
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:29,440
bring to them is really all about i

616
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,880
agree i couldn't agree more i feel that

617
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,840
you know avenues to sales for us you

618
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,840
know yeah you know more more retail yeah

619
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,678
not having to go through

620
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,199
distributors that all have their own

621
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,038
brands that they want to always push

622
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,200
their own brands first and then we're

623
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,200
kind of like oh yeah yeah on the side so

624
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,960
if there were distributors that didn't

625
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,880
have their own brands and that would

626
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,720
work you know that model in california i

627
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,440
think would work better but

628
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,038
you know most people are you know

629
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,679
pushing their own brand and business as

630
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:02,319
they should yes yeah yeah they're direct

631
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,240
to consumer and that yeah so

632
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:06,960
we do make our own sales you know i

633
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,519
connect with buyers um myself calling

634
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:12,319
them um yeah and actually a lot of the

635
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,400
work that we i that i do now is like

636
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,639
bookkeeping and um really the

637
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,038
administrative kind of stuff and sales

638
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,200
and marketing and packaging and all this

639
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,000
stuff and so i've kind of transitioned

640
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,558
from

641
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,720
