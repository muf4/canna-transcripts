1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,480
what's up what's up guys my name is

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,359
brandon i'm with athena one of the

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,359
founders

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,039
um we're gonna be bringing on jungle

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,559
boys

6
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:13,279
pretty quick here um what we're gonna be

7
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:15,919
doing is

8
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,640
um we're gonna be we had to post a week

9
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:18,320
ago

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,920
that went over the difference between

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,960
vdc

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,760
and um media ec so

13
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,278
what i did was i called ivan and he had

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,240
a lot to say about it and i wanted to

15
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,599
bring him in

16
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:34,159
and here he is what's up guys

17
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,238
so obviously we did that post last week

18
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:39,039
uh the difference between vdc

19
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:40,558
and um maintaining ec in your media and

20
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,839
that's why we kind of got this whole

21
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,599
thing started

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,600
um but i wanted to start off and talk

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,840
about your guys's

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,679
new facility that you got coming online

25
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,960
i think it's cudahy

26
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,878
yep what uh like how many lights

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,399
like how many rooms like what do you how

28
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,558
did you guys set it up do you guys feel

29
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,840
comfortable talking about it

30
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:04,239
sure i'll uh i'll let roach give the run

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,960
down uh since he's our project manager

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,118
over there

33
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,719
uh that'll give you a little bit of a

34
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:10,159
rundown of cudahy and where we're at on

35
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,679
it right now

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:17,680
yes basically two-story facility

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,720
uh it's got eight flowering rooms

38
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,240
ranging from about 70 to 80 lights

39
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:28,000
um and a 260 light veg

40
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:31,519
and genetic holding area mother area

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,759
um so full recirculating

42
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:38,719
uh runoff we take all the one off

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,040
clean it sanitize it and then re-feed it

44
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:44,319
back in through the netaflex

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,159
um it's definitely the most

46
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:51,359
technological facility we've built yet

47
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,200
excited to put plants in it for sure

48
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,078
so is that recirculating new for

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,759
california is that active yet or is that

50
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:02,919
it's not active yet i think it's 2021

51
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,319
i believe where uh it's

52
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,719
department of fish and wildlife or the

53
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,439
water board or both of those two or

54
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,878
requiring

55
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:15,439
all cannabis facilities to be

56
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,598
uh recycling their runoff and not just

57
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,878
dumping everything down the drain

58
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:23,119
yeah 2021 no it's got eight rooms how

59
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:26,560
many lights in each room

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,879
70 to 80. okay is there

61
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,159
no now i i go through a lot of your

62
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:31,598
facilities you know

63
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,359
through the factory and different

64
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,560
different facilities like that they seem

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,959
to have a similar amount of rooms um

66
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,800
based on how many weeks right do you so

67
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,840
you guys plan on taking one room down a

68
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,400
week

69
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,080
yeah that's kind of the goal uh with the

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,439
eight rooms basically you'll pull down a

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,160
room every week

72
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,759
be kind of a smooth smooth kind of

73
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,639
schedule

74
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,919
transition nice cool man well good job

75
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,919
on that i saw

76
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,759
what two weeks ago i haven't posted that

77
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,359
nutrient room is probably the

78
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,280
prettiest nutrient room i've ever seen

79
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,920
so good job roach

80
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,120
thank you thank you so let's let's get

81
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,359
into the questions

82
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,840
um the first question you know we want

83
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,640
to go over that post that athena did

84
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,120
a week ago um what the difference

85
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,719
between

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,879
feed ec and ec in your media

87
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,479
um as far as that would be your runoff

88
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,479
as well can you talk about and give us

89
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:28,479
some insight on how you guys

90
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,479
your sops on that and what you guys do

91
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,400
yeah so there's two different ways to

92
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,080
look at it you can look at it

93
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,599
i'm trying to make it into i'm trying to

94
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,120
when i speak i'm trying to speak in

95
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,439
growers terms i'm not trying to make it

96
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,080
too complicated for everybody

97
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,759
um so if you look at there's two ways to

98
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,680
water your plants right let's say you

99
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,759
have a rockwool cube right let's take a

100
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,840
six inch cube for example

101
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,560
you can you can water it and each time

102
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,158
you water it you can get runoff right

103
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,479
so think of it every time that you're

104
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,679
watering that cube you're resetting that

105
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,560
cube

106
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,159
right so if i'm doing a 3.0 ec and i'm

107
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,438
getting runoff

108
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:09,679
that cube that the ec inside the cube

109
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:12,959
is not building as much right

110
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,239
now the way that we do it

111
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,840
going to say this is the right way

112
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,358
because we've done it both ways and both

113
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,280
ways work really great and have a really

114
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:22,959
good result with it right

115
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:25,039
is you can stack that cube so imagine

116
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,680
you take little tiny waterings

117
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,080
throughout the day and you're giving

118
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,720
them

119
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,599
short tiny bursts of watering eight ml

120
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,199
10 miles seven ml whatever your drippers

121
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:41,759
rating is is what we do right so

122
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,520
imagine uh in a twelve hour flowering

123
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,360
the lights come on the first hour now

124
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,799
every hour we're giving them tiny little

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,319
bursts of water

126
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,439
but what's happening is now we're

127
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,759
stacking that nutrient inside the cube

128
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,360
so now that 2.0 we see that we

129
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,919
originally fed

130
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,280
now a couple weeks later that 3.0 ac is

131
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,799
a 5.0 ec

132
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:05,279
of 6.0 ec right but the thing

133
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,199
that you have to be careful with is now

134
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,679
when you start hitting those dry backs

135
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,960
right

136
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,439
and the plant starts drying out right

137
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,439
there's not any water and there's not a

138
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,600
lot of water inside that cube

139
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,680
right so now you're now competing on

140
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,800
that really fine line of burning your

141
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,319
plants

142
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,079
right and

143
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,360
not having enough water for your plants

144
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,839
to pick up

145
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,520
but you also get amazing results doing

146
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,279
that right you can really sit there you

147
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,560
can stress the plan out you can see

148
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,559
you can see things happen that you've

149
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,918
never seen happen before

150
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,759
you know we feel

151
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,038
that not one way is better than the

152
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
other necessarily

153
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,199
right i feel like if you have people

154
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,959
that are not as experienced and not

155
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,639
there every single day and watching

156
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,918
everything and have monitoring on every

157
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,840
single cube

158
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,079
and and you know you're you have someone

159
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,599
at your facility 24 hours a day

160
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,839
feeding with a little bit of runoff is a

161
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,520
lot safer you know i don't want people

162
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,519
to take this and everybody go run out

163
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,879
and start putting you know a 7.0 ec

164
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,079
inside their cube because the jungle

165
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:07,680
boys told us to do it

166
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,439
you know we're not telling people to run

167
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,560
out do this we're just sharing what we

168
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,959
do

169
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,800
so what ends up happening is that we put

170
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:18,239
a feeding chart out there

171
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,240
and we say hey start out at a 2.0 ec

172
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,400
right and they almost start feeding a

173
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,680
2.0 ec and they have a bunch of runoff

174
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,599
and then they come to us they're like

175
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,319
hey it's not enough food for our plants

176
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,759
right

177
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,360
you guys are set that's what we've been

178
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,360
seeing yeah

179
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,160
you guys are setting us up for failure

180
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,720
our plants are turning yellow

181
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,280
there's i hate feeding charts you know

182
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,479
you know

183
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,318
i've always said this you know what i

184
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,478
mean because it's one well first off

185
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,000
it's all strange specific

186
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:45,918
you know some strains eat a lot more

187
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,720
than others from somebody very little

188
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:51,279
nutrients some you're sitting

189
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,039
you know so for us we try to give a

190
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,719
general guideline

191
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,800
and if you're if you're giving your

192
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,160
plants a bunch of runoff

193
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,319
you know and you have a heavy eating

194
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,199
strain a 3.0 vc a plant can take all day

195
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,000
long

196
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,639
no 300 35 ec with a high amount of

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
runoff

198
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,319
because that's what your media is

199
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,360
maintaining exactly

200
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,080
yeah all day no problems you know but

201
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,080
then

202
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:16,240
there's also the flip side of that right

203
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,439
let's take a strain like strawberry

204
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,199
shortcake right

205
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,639
strawberry shortcake we would never feed

206
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,319
a 3.0 ec2

207
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,240
it just doesn't it does it won't take it

208
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,439
up it won't eat it you know so there's

209
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,319
always that

210
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,680
small amount of strains that no matter

211
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,360
what you tell someone to feed it's going

212
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,038
to be too much and then there you take

213
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,680
something like topanga

214
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:38,240
or wi-fi 43 or strain that eats a lot

215
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,360
and you tell someone to give it a 2.00

216
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,960
they're going to come to you and be like

217
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,000
it wasn't enough i didn't give my plants

218
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,439
enough

219
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,519
you know so that's why when nutrient

220
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:49,120
companies put out the

221
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:51,120
char it's just a baseline it's to get

222
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,639
you to where you need to be

223
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,478
but depending on your runoff and

224
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,000
depending on how you're stacking your

225
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,598
your cubes in your watering

226
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,519
that's what tells you whether or not you

227
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,759
should be feeding high or low you know

228
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:05,439
and of course we don't want to go down a

229
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,598
whole another rabbit hole

230
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,478
but then there's there's a whole other

231
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:09,839
uh

232
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,598
there's some other stuff that we're

233
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,399
playing with feeding way higher than

234
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:14,719
that

235
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,560
and doing a lot more drybacks but you

236
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,639
really have to be on your game

237
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,000
you know it's like i always tell people

238
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,000
you know you go to the batting cage and

239
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,680
someone throws a softball at you you hit

240
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,160
it you're like i'm a man

241
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,720
you know someone throws a fastball yeah

242
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,120
you're like

243
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,479
let me get the fuck out of here i suck

244
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,959
you know and that's what happens when

245
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:32,958
you're

246
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,038
stacking these feedings and you start

247
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,598
pulling back waterings you know you can

248
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:37,598
easily

249
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,959
destroy your crust you can easily fry a

250
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,278
crop

251
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,038
you know but if you're off the game and

252
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,639
you know what you're doing

253
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:45,759
you know you're going to hit numbers and

254
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,879
you're going to you're going to see

255
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,000
things that you're going to see

256
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,200
you know thc levels and tribal levels

257
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,360
you're going to see that stuff just

258
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,200
let's go through the roof you know

259
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,959
but it's a very funny moment we don't

260
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,759
want to go and put some cruiser card out

261
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,679
there

262
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,319
and say hey guys start expecting these

263
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,000
moves with a 3.0 led

264
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,680
you know and getting too much build up

265
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,679
and locking everything out

266
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,439
yeah 100 because they're because their

267
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,079
runoff is not sufficient

268
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,200
you know i was over at the factory what

269
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,839
a week ago roach

270
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,278
and i saw that all your tanks were at a

271
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,040
2ec

272
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:22,000
now understanding that the genetics are

273
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,599
getting affected by

274
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,720
the ec value differently are your

275
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,839
water shot volumes changing

276
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,160
based on genetic to build ec higher or

277
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,080
lower based on genetics in that room

278
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,799
while you're feeding a 2ec

279
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,959
does that make sense yeah so usually

280
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,359
we're not really changing the run time

281
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,079
to alter the in the block we'll adjust

282
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,680
it just

283
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:50,160
how long the dry down period is okay

284
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,479
simple answer you could if you wanted to

285
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:55,120
lower the ec inside the block you could

286
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,360
use a longer run time and that would

287
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,720
therefore give the plant more runoff and

288
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,800
then lower the ec

289
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,800
or you could do the shorter run time if

290
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,958
you're really trying to stack that ec

291
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,439
to where you get no runoff and then that

292
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:09,199
goes back to the stacking technique

293
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,200
but you got yeah you guys aren't

294
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,360
changing your run times

295
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,399
you're just changing the frequencies

296
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,639
yeah the time is between frequency

297
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,519
now now given that the factory was

298
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,078
wanted to

299
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,278
running at a 2ec baseline for pretty

300
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:27,519
much all its flower rooms

301
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:28,958
though depending on genetic of that room

302
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,959
is depending on how

303
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,159
you're going to monitor that how high

304
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,199
that ec value

305
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,159
goes in that block depending on that

306
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,800
genetic

307
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,838
while using a 2ec you know because

308
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,559
that's the thing

309
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,920
you're not feeding a genetic more you're

310
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,518
just monitoring

311
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:50,399
that raise inside the cube

312
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,120
verse giving it you know full blown

313
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,120
three four

314
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,399
you know three and a half ec yeah that's

315
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,480
really the only

316
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,639
real reason we're able to do that is

317
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,120
because of the substrate monitoring that

318
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,799
we have

319
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,240
you know if we didn't have the rockwell

320
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:04,639
monitoring and the ec

321
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,360
and the water content it would be you

322
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,439
know a full-time job for several people

323
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,120
to be checking runoffs on all these uh

324
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,000
on all these rooms and strengths

325
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,959
but having it in like a half where you

326
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,120
can kind of see

327
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,359
water content right there on all the

328
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,360
rooms

329
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,079
now do you like do you have an optimum

330
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,200
root zone temperature

331
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:29,120
and does that equate to relative

332
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,240
temperature of the room at all based on

333
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,600
that root zone temperature

334
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,600
or what you know what what's your

335
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,839
thoughts on that

336
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,079
oh i mean root's not temperatures for

337
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,480
stir relative to what the room is

338
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,000
you know and if the room's warmer i mean

339
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,839
your meatball is going to be warmer but

340
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,799
it also goes into what your

341
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,480
uh what your what your feet is what your

342
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,159
feed temperatures what your nutrients

343
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,399
are coming into the planet you know if

344
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:54,719
you have like a really long run

345
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,360
and it's up in your crawl space and it's

346
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,839
120 degrees in your crawl space

347
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,000
and then your pvc is therefore heated up

348
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,040
and your nutrients are there for you

349
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,120
you're going to raise your root

350
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,120
temperature you know yeah so

351
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,959
all that stuff is kind of taken into

352
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,320
account like on these build-outs that we

353
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,958
do as well

354
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,320
do you try to watch it or what i mean

355
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,000
what do you do you like to see a certain

356
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,879
number do you like to see it not go over

357
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,519
a certain number

358
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,600
you're just kind of you know anything

359
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,799
over 80 definitely isn't good

360
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,720
yeah get out but um we're not

361
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:31,278
we're we air condition our uh

362
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,519
our irrigation room so our water stays

363
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,120
about like

364
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,720
67 degrees anyways

365
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,799
yeah 73 74 75

366
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:46,160
um so our water's not really getting too

367
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:48,799
ever i personally realize it's

368
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,399
i don't really focus on water temp that

369
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,599
much at my grows

370
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,759
i don't like to see it go over 78 yeah

371
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,278
but other than that you know it's it's

372
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:58,799
pretty but that was one of the questions

373
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,720
that we had gotten

374
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,838
um now yeah i mean if you're if you're

375
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,519
on a small scale and you can you know

376
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,800
really dial in your water temperature

377
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,320
i'm sure you'd see a little bit of a

378
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,599
difference you know but the biggest

379
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,600
difference you're going to see is not

380
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,440
letting it get too warm you know i've

381
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,839
seen large facilities i know a couple

382
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,839
people that just had this issue recently

383
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,760
or like roach was saying they ran all

384
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,680
their pipes up in the attic

385
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,039
and now their attic gets 120 degrees

386
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,479
during the summer time and they're

387
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,000
having all these issues and they're like

388
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,120
oh it's good you know

389
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,240
all this hot water sitting there

390
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,560
yeah i've done that before uh

391
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,159
so when we're talking about blended

392
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,838
compared to pro

393
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,559
i know you guys were flowering some

394
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,079
rooms over at 58 on blended

395
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:46,319
um and then i definitely i know that the

396
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,278
the the nursery is all using blended

397
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,560
right what is

398
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,639
what's your thoughts about the

399
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,278
comparison i mean when would you use

400
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,240
blended

401
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:55,519
as far as you know uh compared to pro on

402
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,919
on a grow

403
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,839
yeah i mean it honestly just comes down

404
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,559
to what our employees are comfortable

405
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,199
using

406
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,638
right so we have we have so food for

407
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,759
both of them

408
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,839
right and some guys like mixing

409
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,519
you know a two part right out of the bag

410
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,800
and some guys just feel more comfortable

411
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,240
mixing a bottle

412
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:18,319
you know yeah for us

413
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,600
if the guys are really good at what they

414
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,800
do and they've been doing it for a

415
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,159
really long time

416
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,719
you know and they've worked on growth

417
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:26,078
for years you know guys been with us 10

418
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,120
plus years

419
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:31,120
you know we have a grower that grows

420
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,799
amazing cannabis says listen

421
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,320
i feel comfortable with this and i like

422
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,159
what i do and i'm used to it

423
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,720
and this is my rhythm and this is my

424
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:42,480
routine that's what i like to do

425
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,278
you know go ahead you know

426
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,320
i think that uh it just comes down to

427
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:47,759
the grower

428
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,360
you know and what they want what they

429
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,879
prefer you know

430
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,480
budget wise too you know i know they're

431
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,838
not there's not a lot of difference

432
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,199
money-wise you know

433
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,680
one might be a little bit cheaper than

434
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:59,519
the other one you know um

435
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,198
yeah that's all it really comes down to

436
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,440
you know

437
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,799
now this is a question that we get all

438
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,000
the time you know

439
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,559
um do you ever sometimes i'll be talking

440
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,240
to people

441
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,000
like yeah you know this is how ivan's

442
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,799
running this is how roach runs it

443
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,198
you know um and they're like come on bro

444
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:17,198
like

445
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:18,879
they're adding other shit in there like

446
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:20,240
i know they're adding something they've

447
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,439
got to be adding some

448
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,278
sweet or or or organic input

449
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,440
or this or that what like what's the

450
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,600
real deal like what are you guys adding

451
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,560
i mean to be honest we spent years and

452
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,879
years and years

453
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,159
um adding a lot of shit to the to the

454
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:35,919
reservoirs

455
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,399
you know i mean there was there was one

456
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:41,838
time we were adding

457
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,839
and he was

458
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,839
all liquids all liquids you know we've

459
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,479
been through it all

460
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,120
you know we've no one has done more side

461
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,199
by side

462
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,679
comparisons and i'm talking real side by

463
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,838
side i'm talking taking thousands of

464
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,919
and taking multiple rooms and doing

465
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,839
multiple side-by-side devices with the

466
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,399
same cranes under the same lights

467
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,079
you know what i mean same room same

468
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,120
everything you know this is in some one

469
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:06,799
row

470
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,480
you know things might look a little bit

471
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,000
better because it gets a little bit like

472
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,920
light you know i'm fucking taking full

473
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,159
60 light runes and doing full

474
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,240
side-by-side you know multiple times

475
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:19,600
over and over and over

476
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,560
yeah and every time we would take

477
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,079
something out

478
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:23,919
and we would take something out and we

479
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,239
would take something out

480
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,078
and then we would get to the very end to

481
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,799
the real base of it what we really

482
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,958
needed we'd always have the best results

483
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,559
sure there was one time that we had a

484
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:36,000
great run and you know that was this

485
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,000
mythical one that everything

486
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,240
lined up and all the stars lined up you

487
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,078
know but at the end of the day

488
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,079
you know what i mean yeah i mean i just

489
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:45,359
think they just brought some dosy killer

490
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:46,559
in there right now that was blue that i

491
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,919
was just like this is fucking

492
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,278
unbelievable

493
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,399
you know what i mean there's a fucking

494
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,720
fire

495
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,480
you know and that was you know there's

496
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,120
one thing

497
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,680
you know nothing at it you know we had

498
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,360
to claim

499
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:06,159
we have clinton and that's it

500
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,519
you know there's we really do try to

501
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,038
keep it simple

502
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:12,240
you know well we really do try to

503
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:14,959
eliminate all those questions and errors

504
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,720
and did this get out at the right time

505
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,798
did they add too much of this

506
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,160
we've kind of eliminated all that you

507
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,000
know i think

508
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,919
i think seems like you guys are focusing

509
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,160
more on your dry backs

510
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,959
and your dr you know your dry backs to

511
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,960
increase that

512
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,279
that terpene content and that thc verse

513
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,960
thinking that an organic input of some

514
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,599
sort is going to do it for you because

515
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,079
if you had to talk to me three years ago

516
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,000
and

517
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,359
knowing what i thought i knew back then

518
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,200
i would say hey

519
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,639
you have to add an organic input to get

520
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,519
the container

521
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,038
yes and but the more that i had kind of

522
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,879
adjusted to

523
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:56,000
just going with core girl or core bloom

524
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,600
cleanse the more i was like whoa like

525
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,480
this is where it's at

526
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:02,079
so um my ghost do you guys use any

527
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,480
micros with your clones anymore i knew

528
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:04,639
that

529
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,640
you know a few years ago you did are you

530
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,640
guys using anything yeah we

531
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,120
we did for a really long time you know

532
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,759
what i mean it it might shave off a day

533
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:13,439
or two

534
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,679

stuff was fire

539

540
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,720
shaving off a day or two

541
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,039
you know what i mean we weren't really

542

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,880
in la where we have to deal with a

610
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,558
a bunch of issues you know what i mean

611
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,520
we got homeless people right outside the

612
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:57,759
door

613
00:20:53,519 --> 00:21:00,558
you know and we'll we'll also we'll also

614
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:02,319
do we'll also fog the rooms we we uh we

615
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,279
play around with with uh heating the

616
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:05,119
rooms a lot

617
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,798
you know after each run we'll keep the

618
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,479
room as hot as we can get them

619
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,359
you know and when i say as hot as we can

620
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,200
get them 150 degrees plus

621
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:15,119
yeah you know because because because

622
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,640
that temperature matters you know if you

623
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:18,158
if you really look at the chart and what

624
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,280
actually starts killing things you know

625
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,960
you got to get the rooms

626
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,639
really hot you know i mean we've gotten

627
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,558
the room so hot before that we broke the

628
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,440
sprinkler bags before

629
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,000
you know that so you got to be careful

630
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
you know

631
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,960
and i'm not talking getting your room to

632
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,880
100 degrees i'm talking about getting

633
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,079
your room to 150 degrees

634
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,200
what's the hottest we've ever gotten

635
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,158
into uh it was like 150 on the floor 165

636
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,919
on the ceiling

637
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,440
yeah yeah so what we do for that

638
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,759
and this is a really good tip for any

639
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,320
grower without plants that was with not

640
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,960
without

641
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:48,960
there was no plants

642
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,119
yeah yeah there was no plants in there

643
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,519
that was after we tore it out

644
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:57,439
so you teared them in your room and now

645
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,679
all the plants are out right so anything

646
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,960
that was airborne any spores or anything

647
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,679
that that could have

648
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,360
could have uh gotten into your room at

649
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,200
that point is the time to heat treat

650
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:08,479
your room as fast as you get the plants

651
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,519
out of there as fast as you can heat

652
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,880
treat that room

653
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,359
that's what you want to do and when i

654
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,559
say heat treat 150 degrees there's a

655
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,199
there's a number

656
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,639
i'll i'll i'll come back and edit this

657
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,480
and get the exact number

658
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,559
but we shoot for as high as possible

659
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,880
because you gotta remember at 120

660
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,200
it does like powdery mildew even if we

661
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,600
don't

662
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,400
you know if we never have an issue we do

663
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,798
this

664
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,840
we do this religiously at all of our

665
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:35,599
facilities

666
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,038
and the way we get this is we cut off

667
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,279
our air conditioners

668
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,038
we turn on our dehumidifiers because the

669
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,639
dehumidifiers make heat

670
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,319
and we turn our lights up all of our

671
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,080
lights up to 100

672
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:51,200
and we let the room bake how long yeah

673
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,079
how how long usually three hours three

674
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,440
hours

675
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,960
yeah yeah and the key is is not doing it

676
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,679
and going home and then coming back the

677
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,120
next day

678
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,720
when you're when you're i mean we've

679
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,038
literally had schedule 80

680
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,919
melt on the wall because the room is so

681
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:07,279
hot

682
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:10,799
yeah yeah so

683
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:12,639
on using the athena ipm

684
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:13,918
look are you using are you using

685
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,520
anything else

686
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,919
then other than athena ipm to spray

687
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,359
no not currently you you know i mean

688
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,360
well uh

689
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,839
in our in our nursery we'll hit it we'll

690
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,119
uh hit uh the moms with regalia every

691
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,199
once in a while

692
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,199
okay you know as if not as a drench as a

693
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,759
full year but our main

694
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,798
go-to spray is ipm that's that's our

695
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:36,640
go-to that's our

696
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,720
you know we you gotta remember it's a

697
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,120
drench you have to drench the plants you

698
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,960
you can't just go in the room and open

699
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,119
the door up and spray a few plants

700
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,600
like okay i sprayed my room you have to

701
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,519
saturate the plants top to bottom

702
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,480
we get it we get the stems we get those

703
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,480
plants should be dripping

704
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:57,278
uh yeah two times a week i mean minimum

705
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,359
is two times a week

706
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:00,640
you know three times if you have a

707
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,399
problem or whatever just

708
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,240
exactly i mean if you have i mean to be

709
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,080
honest if you have a problem you know if

710
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,440
you're battling something like pm or

711
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,439
mites or something

712
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,480
i'd hit it as often as possible we'd hit

713
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,278
it sometimes twice

714
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,880
you know twice in the same day you know

715
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:16,558
morning and later on in the day i mean

716
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,960
this is if you're battling something bad

717
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:18,399
you know

718
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,919
we haven't battled anything in years you

719
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,440
know what i mean we keep really clean

720
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,000
and sterile facilities but

721
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,278
if i came in here and i seen i mean i i

722
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,480
don't remember the last time i seen a

723
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:27,759
spider mite you know i mean but if

724
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,519
someone was like hey we've seen some

725
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:32,000
lights or something you know what i mean

726
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:32,960
i go i go to war with them you know and

727
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,159
i'd hit them apart

728
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:40,240
you know but e-treating with

729
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:42,400
ipm i mean really killer combo right

730
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,400
there

731
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:50,799
okay um cool yeah that's not very often

732
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,919
when you talk to somebody at that scale

733
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:56,319
and they say hey i use one thing

734
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,360
so people are just probably like how's

735
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:59,599
you know and that's

736
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,038
i had the reason why is because i had

737
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,959
the same reaction

738
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,960
you know when when we were when we were

739
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,600
developing it and going over all that

740
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,840
stuff

741
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:10,480
you're like bro i use one thing this is

742
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,959
it yeah i'm just saying yeah

743
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,440
i mean we'll we'll bust out uh sanitate

744
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,480
2.0 oxidate 2.0 you know what i mean

745
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,840
we'll bust it out and we'll we'll rotate

746
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,558
every once in a while you know what i

747
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:22,000
mean

748
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,000
just for peace of mind so we're not

749
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,319
using the same thing over and over again

750
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,919
you know what i mean uh like i said

751
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:29,759
we'll use we'll use some regalia on the

752
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,400
moms just to boost their immune system

753
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,038
early on

754
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,960
you know what i mean um but are we

755
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:37,839
spraying regalia in all the rooms

756
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,798
all the time like we're doing ipm no you

757
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,000
know what i mean

758
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:45,519
um i think that it just comes

759
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,720
down to like i said if you're spraying

760
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:48,400
something in your facility and you're

761
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,880
not having any issues

762
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,919
stick to it just keep going with it yep

763
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,600
keep going

764
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:59,679
you know all right sop for cloning

765
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:02,719
you know that's probably you know

766
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,840
maybe what ec value you know what cubes

767
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,600
are you using

768
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,918
what do you like to feed ec value in

769
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:10,879
your cubes what do you like to maintain

770
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,919
maybe possibly a drench initial drench

771
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,120
ec

772
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:18,080
and yeah what do you use yeah so

773
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,639
uh we have a what we call the nursery

774
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,480
right

775
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,240
so we have a nursery crew that handles

776
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,360
all of our cuttings and our moms and all

777
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,519
that stuff

778
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,359
and this is all stuff that we've done

779
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,679
over the years and we've kind of refined

780
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:29,759
it

781
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,200
and we're all we all do the same thing

782
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:32,798
right so we have one

783
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,480
major hub that puts out all of our

784
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,639
cuttings for us and all of our moms but

785
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,319
each facility also does their own moms

786
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,880
and cuttings so

787
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,158
imagine you need ten thousand cuts a

788
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,840
week right

789
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,360
seven thousand of those cuttings come

790
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:46,798
from our nursery and then you're

791
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,558
responsible for your other three

792
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:52,480
thousand cuttings

793
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:54,079
right for every spot every location yeah

794
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,079
and that's how we run our locations

795
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:59,278
right wow so what's happening

796
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:01,278
behind that um because all of our

797
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:02,558
genetics aren't in one building so if we

798
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:04,839
ever have an issue

799
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:07,119
right everything is protected so each

800
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:09,839
facility houses genetics

801
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,359
right let's say we had a fire or god

802
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:11,918
forbid anything happened you know what i

803
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:14,158
mean

804
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,278
we somebody broke in and installed our

805
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,559
genetics you know which would be

806
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:18,159
impossible to do because you're talking

807
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,000
about thousands of likes you know

808
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,000
but at least we know we have them backed

809
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,240
up somewhere and they're not with some

810
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,398
other random person that we don't know

811
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,000
or some tissue culture lab that we don't

812
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:28,879
know what they do behind the scenes you

813
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,480
know what i mean

814
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,399
so we kind of protect all of our

815
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,240
genetics in-house you know

816
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:38,959
that's why that makes sense yeah so uh

817
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,480
right so when you when i knew this

818
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,240
question was going to come up so

819
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:47,360
uh i wrote it all down so uh 3mls

820
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:51,359
of uh grow a b right

821
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:55,119
200 ml of calmac that gives you an ec

822
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:58,959
of 0.7

823
00:27:55,119 --> 00:28:02,000
okay ph of 5.5 5.7

824
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,000
so this is taking your initial preso

825
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,919
right you get your clone tray you get

826
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,119
your individual cubes they're on a map

827
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:12,320
right we take that in that right

828
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:15,599
three mls eight three mls of b right

829
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:19,200
two mls calmag right

830
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:21,678
ph of 5.5 5.7 we do 5.7 but i always say

831
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,798
5. but listen if it's 5.4 to

832
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,759
5.8 you're fine yeah yeah but everyone

833
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:31,839
likes to know what we do we do it at 5.7

834
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,839
and grow down

835
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,919
lower ph's higher ph's

836
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,558
we've had great results with all of them

837
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,520
5.7 5.5 puts us right where we want to

838
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,240
be at

839
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,918
right so now you've you've done your

840
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,038
initial soaking you plugged your

841
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,120
cuttings now

842
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:52,398
it's time to water them right now

843
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:53,278
they're starting to bust through this

844
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,038
time to watering

845
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,720
how long do you weigh how many days you

846
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:57,200
usually i know it's all different right

847
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,558
but

848
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:04,720
you know usually unusual two weeks to 20

849
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:07,119
12 to 10 days to 20 days yeah

850
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,319
10 to 20 days depending on the the

851
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:12,479
strength

852
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:14,720
first water oh first watering uh

853
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,599
five to ten five to ten five to ten all

854
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,519
right yeah

855
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:18,959
depending if you know these ones dried

856
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:19,278
out quick they're busting roots fast you

857
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,798
could

858
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:23,200
see them start coming out you can't pull

859
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:26,879
them out you know

860
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:30,159
okay you know but also we grow

861
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,600
so many different varieties right yeah

862
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,840
i mean you're talking hundreds and

863
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:36,240
hundreds of different strains right

864
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,199
some of them are five days some of them

865
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,240
are or

866
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,840
you know tending you know yeah

867
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:47,359
so clone feed is four to four and a half

868
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:51,119
ml per gallon right

869
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:54,798
2.5 cal mag right that gets you an ec

870
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:58,158
of 1.1 and then same thing pa

871
00:29:54,798 --> 00:30:02,000
5.7 okay okay

872
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:04,000
cool no cleanse

873
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,359
say that again no cleanse is there a

874
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,798
reason why i'm not using

875
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:10,158
uh yeah so we'll use plans as a dunk

876
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:11,759
you know we'll dunk the cuttings and

877
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,080
cleanse you know we use it as a full

878
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,038
year

879
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:16,558
right and then after after they start

880
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:17,759
busting their roots then we'll add the

881
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,079
cleanse to it

882
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:22,079
okay you know uh and that's just like i

883
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:22,960
said that's what the nursery feels

884
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:24,480
comfortable doing

885
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,720
you know and then from there on out it

886
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,599
gets plans all the moms get clams added

887
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,159
to it

888
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,519
but that's you know that's the guys this

889
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,640
is what we do this is what we feel

890
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:35,679
comfortable doing

891
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,640
hey i'm not going to tell you with the

892
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,399
results that we get

893
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,759
these guys are popping up i'm talking

894
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:41,918
you know 6 000

895
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:42,960
cuts a week 10 000 cuts you know what i

896
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,679
mean yeah

897
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,120
per facility you know i'm not going to

898
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,640
tell them hey

899
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,398
do something a little bit different try

900
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,880
to tweak this just leave it alone it's

901
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:54,798
not broken

902
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,919
i tell that to a lot of people just yeah

903
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:57,918
but we we

904
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,519
we failure with plans all the time you

905
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,120
know well that was another thing i guess

906
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,000
that would be part of our ipm too

907
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:04,479
you know we'll the only thing is you do

908
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,480
have to

909
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,599
you do have to use a lot of it that's

910
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,440
the only downfall it's like

911
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,038
how many amount do you have off the top

912
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,640
300 and something ml

913
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:14,079
it's like 300 something in miles per

914
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,799
gallon which is a lot

915
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:18,158
yeah you know so but it's also if you're

916
00:31:16,798 --> 00:31:19,119
having an issue or you see something

917
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,600
that you don't like

918
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,879
it's a go-to you know start hitting

919
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:24,639
things with it you know

920
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,240
yeah and it doesn't have any it's not

921
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,440
harsh on the plants

922
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,278
yeah real real quick on uh when people

923
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,960
are asking questions in the comment

924
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:34,319
we'll try to get to some of the

925
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,679
questions in the comments

926
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:37,359
we gotta tell you right here she's

927
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,159
writing them down cool

928
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:41,759
cool if there's a bunch of spam then not

929
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,760
even

930
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,278
yeah if you see any good ones shout them

931
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:47,519
out and then we'll just go over

932
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:49,200
real quick so we got slp for cloning you

933
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:53,120
got the ec value on that

934
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,720
um co2 controllers and regulators i mean

935
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,398
you feel comfortable talking about what

936
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,399
you're using in your rooms and

937
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:03,759
yeah sure so um we use big giant

938
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:05,439
uh co2 tanks liquid co2 uh

939
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:06,960
and we have a company that comes and

940
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,759
they fill our

941
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,399
co2 so like we're at the factory right

942
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:15,919
now for here we have like eight or nine

943
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:18,158
giant co2 tanks and that feeds

944
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,880
each room we're required to have a high

945
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,799
co2 monitor in every single room

946
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,720
and from there all we're doing is a

947
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,918
simple co2

948
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,919
regulator was it a

949
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,440
you know uh cheap titan regulator you

950
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,480
know

951
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,600
uh turning the co2 on and off you know

952
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,880
okay um but but yeah liquid co2 we don't

953
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:42,798
we used to use gas

954
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,640
and we had issues with propane and then

955
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:46,319
natural gas and then

956
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,559
you know bottles are really hard to fill

957
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,639
so we use a service that does big huge

958
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:52,798
baths of liquid co2

959
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,759
what about controller-wise what are you

960
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:55,839
guys

961
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,200
on the controller well we used to use

962
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:58,639
sentinels which

963
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,240
they made the best controller but they

964
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,519
stopped making them for some reason out

965
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,159
of the blue they just stopped making

966
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,319
them

967
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,600
uh most of our facilities are signals

968
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,200
they've been running for years and we

969
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:10,959
haven't had any issues

970
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,960
um but since we've been able to

971
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:20,719
it's not something that we've done in

972
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,519
the past so cudahy will be all ahead of

973
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,880
him

974
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,960
okay um

975
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,559
now any so you guys are using groceries

976
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,000
right now

977
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:33,599
yes and then uh so we've used grow

978
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,558
stands at all of our facilities

979
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:38,558
and then cudahy we're gonna go with the

980
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,360
yeah full full climate full full

981
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,759
monitoring

982
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:52,479
is there a reason is there a reason why

983
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:54,319
you're looking at doing that or

984
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,759
looking at making that transistor was it

985
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:59,119
is more available more

986
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:01,519
info what do you i mean just the

987
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,639
flexibility we have at that facility we

988
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,200
can pretty much

989
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,000
have every single solenoid in the

990
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,878
building

991
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,079
get it different nutrient and or feed

992
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:13,598
and or

993
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:16,079
time per day like uh just the

994
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,599
full flexibility that we have at that

995
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,119
location compared to some of our other

996
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,359
ones we've basically taken like

997
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:23,280
everything we've learned at these past

998
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:25,039
eight facilities that we built nine

999
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,240
facilities that we built we put it

1000
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:30,159
all in the cut hey so uh definitely kind

1001
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:33,199
of like the top

1002
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:36,240
technological one that we have

1003
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:39,598
with kind of the most uh

1004
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:41,519
kind of tech fancy stuff you could say

1005
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,960
short short forms you know full

1006
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:47,199
monitoring

1007
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:50,159
full recirculation um

1008
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,118
yeah everything on floats yeah it's the

1009
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,919
masterpiece

1010
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,559
it's it's rosh's master plan yeah you

1011
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,598
know

1012
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,239
um awesome no cool yeah i think that's

1013
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,680
going to be big

1014
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:02,879
you know and then uh i get a lot of this

1015
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:04,559
all the time

1016
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,559
cal mag with the pro line everyone's

1017
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:07,199
trying to add cal mag to the pro line do

1018
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:10,559
you guys

1019
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,519
ever ever add cal mag while using

1020
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,799
proline

1021
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:16,480
no that's insane no i don't know why no

1022
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,320
don't do it i don't i don't understand

1023
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,079
why someone would do that

1024
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,760
you know i get it you know what i mean

1025
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,960
cow may count my cow mate you know

1026
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,040
people are trained and

1027
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,880
they get it instilled in their head you

1028
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,079
know but all that stuff is built into

1029
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,720
the line

1030
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,800
you know we spent a lot of years testing

1031
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:34,959
and sending shit off the labs and r

1032
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,079
being it going over and over and over

1033
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,039
with it

1034
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,920
that line is figured out when you can

1035
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:42,639
ask brandon

1036
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,639
i don't let anything get by me yeah

1037
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,799
nothing got by these facilities that

1038
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,719
wasn't tested 100

1039
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,839
and we went through everything a million

1040
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,078
times and

1041
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:53,679
and and trialed and narrowed it over and

1042
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,680
over again before we took this is the

1043
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:58,239
one and release it

1044
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:00,559
yeah no one has spent more money than r

1045
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:02,879
d than we have i promise you that

1046
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,078
yeah i could have retired a long time

1047
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,119
ago

1048
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,920
yeah yeah so no i'm glad we got that out

1049
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,280
of the way because you're

1050
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,119
we're getting guys all the time trying

1051
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,079
to add calmac to the pro line i'm like

1052
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,119
just

1053
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:17,359
don't ruin it like it's perfect you know

1054
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,119
the ratios are perfect you got to pay

1055
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:20,319
attention to your shop volumes and your

1056
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,400
ec and your media

1057
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,920
and how you're going to do that but as

1058
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,480
far as

1059
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,358
what it is just don't add anything to it

1060
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,079
and mess it up

1061
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:30,719
yeah that's kind of my my philosophy

1062
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,400
still work

1063
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:34,000
so we're clear with everyone there's

1064
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,519
there's two lines there's a liquid line

1065
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,358
and there's a powder line

1066
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:42,239
the liquid line yes you add helmet

1067
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:44,880
the pro line the powder line you do not

1068
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:48,719
add cow make it's already built in

1069
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,559
yeah 100 um did you take down some

1070
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:51,838
questions there are some good ones you

1071
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:55,119
want to

1072
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,838
i'm finishing one more all right so this

1073
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,119
is some uh

1074
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:02,880
questions that just come up temp plus

1075
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:05,280
vpd in um flour

1076
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,280
what uh timpin which what do you like to

1077
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,000
run your your temp in humidity and fire

1078
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,760
for vpd

1079
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,400
i mean we we kind of just follow that

1080
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,880
bbd chart right as long as we can we

1081
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,680
push it we push the vpd chart as long as

1082
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,640
we can

1083
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:18,960
right so if you look at that chart you

1084
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:21,920
know

1085
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,760
it it the way everybody builds their

1086
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,720
facility is a little bit different

1087
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,480
right so if you look at that chart and

1088
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:32,319
78 degrees

1089
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,679
and 69 humidity puts you right in that

1090
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,760
sweet spot

1091
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:36,799
that's that number you should stick for

1092
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,960
you know for us

1093
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,839
our temperatures are a little bit warmer

1094
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,320
you know we run our

1095
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:42,880
we run our rooms more warmer and more

1096
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,400
humid

1097
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,480
earlier on veg and flower you know

1098
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,079
but you also you see other people and

1099
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,280
they have all these humidifiers in their

1100
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,119
room and they're trying to get as much

1101
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,800
humidity in their room as possible

1102
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,800
the way we build them and we design our

1103
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,400
rooms is we don't need to do that

1104
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,400
because we built it within the air

1105
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,160
conditioning system within the walls we

1106
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,519
make it so our rooms can get humid when

1107
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:04,719
we want them to be humid

1108
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:06,480
and when we want to pull out that

1109
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:07,358
humidity we can pull all that humidity

1110
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,240
out

1111
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:11,598
you know so if i tell somebody hey we

1112
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:15,358
run our rooms at

1113
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,320
85 degrees and 70 humidity early in veg

1114
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:17,920
and flower

1115
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,280
and they're trying and trying and trying

1116
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,200
to get there and they just can't get

1117
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,599
there and they're chasing those numbers

1118
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:24,960
you know i'd rather see somebody say hey

1119
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,800
i can get to that same

1120
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,880
sweet spot because if you look at the

1121
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,480
vpd chart that's not the only number

1122
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,920
that gets you there

1123
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,880
you know so maybe i'm at 78 degrees and

1124
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,400
i'm at 65

1125
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,039
humidity what we're doing we're actually

1126
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,960
doing the same exact thing

1127
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,400
you know so when people i don't support

1128
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,280
your temperature and humidity it's a

1129
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,000
great question

1130
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,359
because it's very important you know but

1131
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,960
you might not be able to get your

1132
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,239
champion committee where i can get my

1133
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,079
attempted community at

1134
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:53,838
and there's nothing wrong with that you

1135
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,200
just need to look at the vpd chart and

1136
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:56,078
you need to be right within that sweet

1137
00:38:55,199 --> 00:39:00,078
spot

1138
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:02,400
yep cool um what week do you

1139
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,359
i know ideally we don't like to spray

1140
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,079
into flower

1141
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:07,039
i mean with ibm but what week do you go

1142
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,039
up to

1143
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:10,639
well i mean what week if you're on a

1144
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:11,358
we'll do it two different questions if

1145
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,879
you're

1146
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:15,519
on a maintenance program you don't have

1147
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,838
any problems and you're using athena ipm

1148
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,639
what yeah do you stop spraying athena

1149
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:21,838
ipm

1150
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:24,159
like week two week two yeah yeah

1151
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:25,199
you know but hey listen if if you're

1152
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:27,358
like hey i've seen

1153
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,319
problems pop up in the in the past and

1154
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:30,159
i've had issues

1155
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,519
i mean you can spray that all the way

1156
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,480
you know there's no issues with testing

1157
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:33,679
or anything you know

1158
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,599
it's just do you want to spray your

1159
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:36,480
plants late flower nobody wants to do

1160
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,480
that

1161
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,679
yeah you know what i mean but are you

1162
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,880
going to have residuals and are you

1163
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:42,000
going to pass testing

1164
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,358
yeah absolutely you're going to pass

1165
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,159
testing you know i mean you're not going

1166
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:46,799
to have any of you

1167
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,399
you know but we always say you got to

1168
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,359
find that sweet spot

1169
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,119
of when you can spray to you know and

1170
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:54,799
same thing just because we say hey we

1171
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,480
stop as early as possible

1172
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,160
if you're having issues i'm not going to

1173
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,000
tell you to stop spraying

1174
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,399
yeah yeah you know i'm not going to tell

1175
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,519
you don't spray till week three

1176
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,599
you know you need to spray when you have

1177
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:10,000
a problem but ideally we too

1178
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,519
stop ideally with anything you know what

1179
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,358
i mean you want you want to cut it off

1180
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:15,440
as early as possible

1181
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:17,039
you know and that's the thing you know

1182
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,639
plant count how many plants do you have

1183
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,679
in your room what's your airflow what's

1184
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:22,239
all that stuff i mean

1185
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:24,000
there's guys i gotta pray until week six

1186
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,239
or seven and flower

1187
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,079
yeah you know and i'm not gonna tell

1188
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:30,000
that guy like that does what he does

1189
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,359
every single day to stop doing that you

1190
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,838
know what i mean but

1191
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:35,759
it's not ideal you shouldn't have to do

1192
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:39,759
that if you're on your plans and you're

1193
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,599
stripping them early enough

1194
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,280
you shouldn't have to do that if you're

1195
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,880
happy to do that you need to be focusing

1196
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,400
on your environment and fixing the

1197
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,079
problems there before

1198
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:53,440
you know yeah airflow has a airflow is

1199
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:56,480
is very very very important

1200
00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:00,159
um how do you are you guys using powersi

1201
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,159
and how are you guys using it yeah so

1202
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:03,838
uh we'll hit him with the foliar early

1203
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:05,679
in flower

1204
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,199
we don't hit him religiously because

1205
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,679
there's not always times that we want to

1206
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:12,000
necessarily slow down the stretch

1207
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:13,679
yeah you know so if there's times where

1208
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,639
hey we over veg a little bit the room

1209
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:16,399
wasn't ready

1210
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,759
this is the thing is we never chop our

1211
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,800
rooms early

1212
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,839
right we have rooms that go 70 plus days

1213
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,480
you know we don't we don't grow we don't

1214
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:27,759
flower based on hats right so we're not

1215
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,358
we don't have any rooms that are

1216
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,400
dedicated to hatch

1217
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:34,078
right so if we flower a room and that

1218
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,200
room is going to need to go 72

1219
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,599
days the hashmakers can come in at 65

1220
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:39,039
days

1221
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,880
when they scope and they say this is

1222
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:42,159
perfect they can come in at 65 days and

1223
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,358
take the plants out

1224
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:45,199
the rest of the plants are going to stay

1225
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,598
inside the room we're not going to go

1226
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,960
and stop some room at 50 days because it

1227
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:51,440
makes the best blonde

1228
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,519
prettiest hash and then the same flowers

1229
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,559
end up on the shelf we don't do that

1230
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,838
yeah yeah so i think that's also

1231
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:01,279
important to know too

1232
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:02,159
you know is we're taking these plants

1233
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,000
you know

1234
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:05,279
so if you have if you have plants that

1235
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,639
hey maybe you took them over a week

1236
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,839
because they just weren't done enough or

1237
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:09,440
you have one tree in there that needs to

1238
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:11,039
go a little bit longer

1239
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,960
then we'll hit them with some power

1240
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:14,800
outside and slow down the stretch

1241
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,000
you know i mean everyone knows it's

1242
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,760
amazing stuff you hit them you

1243
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,358
hit them in flower i mean it makes

1244
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,800
plants stack it's great stuff you know

1245
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:23,440
it's a great folder to act

1246
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,000
you know um but are we hitting every

1247
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,079
single

1248
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,400
are we hitting la cush cake with it that

1249
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:30,640
that stacks hard isn't it

1250
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,079
four pounds of light no are we hitting

1251
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:33,598
mac with it no

1252
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,200
you know what i mean are we getting some

1253
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,800
ogs that got over

1254
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:38,000
vegged a little bit and i'm looking at

1255
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,079
like damn they should have went on day

1256
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,639
seven and not day twelve

1257
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,760
yeah we'll hit them for sure yeah as a

1258
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:46,960
foiler

1259
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:49,839
yeah okay um

1260
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,358
have you seen me for me all that stuff

1261
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:55,279
i've always been taught

1262
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:57,679
that most of that stuff regalia

1263
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,880
rsi it always works better as a foliar

1264
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:00,639
spray you know

1265
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,000
us as growers we're lazy of course you

1266
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:03,679
want to just give it to them in the roof

1267
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,679
and not have to deal with spraying

1268
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:07,440
but i've always been taught and i've

1269
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:10,159
always seen with my own eyes

1270
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,679
that foliar spray for your spraying

1271
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:13,279
these things

1272
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:15,039
is you know it's like maintaining your

1273
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,400
plants you know it worked

1274
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:18,400
you know it gets them underway

1275
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:28,880
so have you seen a uh a difference

1276
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:31,920
in yield from pro to blended

1277
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,480
or you know or growth from proto blended

1278
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,920
at all

1279
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:37,199
in flower no you know and it comes down

1280
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,960
to the same thing you know

1281
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:43,439
it's it's it comes down to the grower

1282
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,400
you know there's no we don't run now i

1283
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,920
can tell you this

1284
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,079
i have seen a difference compared to

1285
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,880
other lines you know when we did

1286
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,920
side by sides with with uh blended and

1287
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,519
proline you know

1288
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,599
our a liquid line i mean it was

1289
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:59,679
we've seen incredible differences

1290
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,960
quality wise yield wise

1291
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:05,838
but neck to neck head to head i mean

1292
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,800
they're very similar they're both really

1293
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:08,799
clean they both

1294
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,800
they both go and clean come out clean

1295
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,079
you know

1296
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:18,318
white ash you know flush easily

1297
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:20,240
you know uh but yeah it's it's

1298
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:22,079
i can't say i see some huge difference

1299
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:23,838
you know but there's also

1300
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,000
you know if somebody overfed their

1301
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:26,880
plants with the powder line and then

1302
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,318
under fed their pla

1303
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,358
or gave the right amount with the liquid

1304
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:30,800
line of course you're going to have

1305
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:32,239
better results

1306
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,079
yeah so that's what i feel a lot of it

1307
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:35,519
but when i see people test things right

1308
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,720
and they use a new nutrient they're like

1309
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:38,159
oh it didn't work that good i didn't

1310
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:39,759
have that good results well if you did

1311
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:41,838
the same exact thing you were doing with

1312
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,680
your own nutrient line

1313
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:45,119
you know of course you didn't have the

1314
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:46,318
same results because

1315
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,599
everything's a little bit different

1316
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:49,279
there's different ratios and there's

1317
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,318
different numbers and plants uptake

1318
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,000
things differently

1319
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:53,358
you know so it's like it's a good

1320
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,800
baseline you know where to start you

1321
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:56,000
know what your plants like

1322
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,480
but there's always a little bit of

1323
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,679
tweaking higher

1324
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,000
you know let's talk co2 real quick is

1325
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:04,078
there

1326
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,440
i mean do you do you adjust the co2 in

1327
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,400
your flower rooms at all

1328
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,880
uh as far as uh levels of parts per

1329
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,358
million

1330
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,240
or do you equate co2 levels of parts per

1331
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:15,920
line to your feed

1332
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:15,919
ec at all

1333
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:23,680
uh we usually just turn it down uh

1334
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,119
to 500 parts per million like first day

1335
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,879
of week seven

1336
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,280
that's pretty like we usually keep it

1337
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,240
right at like twelve to fifteen hundred

1338
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,319
parts per million

1339
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,759
and then fucking right at week seven cut

1340
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:36,880
it down to 500

1341
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:40,079
day one week eight it's off okay cool

1342
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,000
so i love it simple yeah

1343
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,519
one one other question i've seen in here

1344
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,920
is somebody asking us if we could do a

1345
00:45:43,519 --> 00:45:46,559
fl

1346
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,358
a clone feed chart yeah absolutely so we

1347
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,400
we uh we

1348
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:52,880
shared exactly what we do for clones but

1349
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,440
uh athena would be more than happy for

1350
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,640
our customers to make a clone feed chart

1351
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,079
because we want you guys to have the

1352
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:00,078
same success we're having

1353
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:03,680
for sure yeah yeah we'll do that we'll

1354
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:07,119
make it uh we'll have it up by next week

1355
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:08,159
um so 12 to 1500 questions on the on the

1356
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:09,920
ppms and then

1357
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:12,639
week seven drop it to 500 parts per

1358
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,079
million uh yeah i mean you can go

1359
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:16,239
if you wanted to you can map your

1360
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,359
feedings and and and do all that stuff

1361
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:18,479
you know what i mean we've done it

1362
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:21,119
before but

1363
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,880
12 to 1500 seems to be the sweet spot

1364
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,519
and and another big thing that people

1365
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,400
always miss out on is co2 and bitch

1366
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:30,159
co2 early in flower you know i mean one

1367
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,440
of the most important things in the time

1368
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:32,559
that you're going to see the best growth

1369
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,119
with co2

1370
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:36,078
is early in veg and early and flower you

1371
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,599
know i mean

1372
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,119
it's it's you want to talk about the

1373
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,160
levels and veg that you guys like to

1374
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:43,039
maintain

1375
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:44,960
1500 you know i gotta remember we're

1376
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,119
running our veggies really hot

1377
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,199
hot and humid you know and that's when

1378
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,880
co2 worked the best you know

1379
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:52,000
so we'll get those i mean you i mean

1380
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,440
that's that's how we got the name the

1381
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,960
jungle boys you know you walk into one

1382
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,760
of our rooms you're like holy shit it's

1383
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:59,440
fucking jungle in here you know yeah so

1384
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,280
so you walk into our bedrooms you're

1385
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,039
sweating your glasses automatic i can't

1386
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,599
even wear glasses inside the bedroom you

1387
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:06,719
know because

1388
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:10,240
they automatically you know um

1389
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:12,078
and that's when that's when you see uh

1390
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:13,919
that's when you see that that that

1391
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,318
explosive growth is when you're hitting

1392
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:16,159
them

1393
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:17,440
early in veg and early in flower with

1394
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,480
co2

1395
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,639
nice um somebody asked

1396
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,000
your time really quick i i just went

1397
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:27,199
cure time and flush time so

1398
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,639
we flush for uh about two weeks right

1399
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:30,399
the last two weeks of growth is when

1400
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,159
we're flushing our plants but we're also

1401
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,000
monitoring the inside of our cubes and

1402
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,399
we're dropping our feedings

1403
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,119
so i mean we can we can flush a plant

1404
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:40,000
and get it to a

1405
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:42,000
zero ec in a day or two you know but we

1406
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,039
also allow that plant to recover and

1407
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,318
take all that up

1408
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:46,960
you know and make sure that there's

1409
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:49,279
nothing inside of it so

1410
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,480
the easy answer is two weeks of flush

1411
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,960
time okay

1412
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:52,960
and then cure

1413
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,720
but slowly dropping dc value slowly

1414
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,679
dropping ec

1415
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:03,039
values as we pull our drybacks as as

1416
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:06,078
we're drying the plants out

1417
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,759
more right so later in flower

1418
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,359
you want to take that water out of the

1419
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,440
plant you don't want a bunch of water in

1420
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:13,279
the plant later in flower

1421
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,679
yeah you want to do high hot longer dry

1422
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,519
backs yes but you also got to be careful

1423
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:19,279
with doing dry vacs later in flour

1424
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:20,559
because if there's a bunch of nutrient

1425
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,079
inside that cube

1426
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,920
that's when you walk in the room like

1427
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:25,680
why'd my plants fry why they look like

1428
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,800
shit why do i have all this burnt leaf

1429
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:28,799
on my plants

1430
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,880
because inside of your cube had a high

1431
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:34,480
ec and you were pulling it back

1432
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:37,920
and the plant did water to uptake yep

1433
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:42,400
um what sprayer are you

1434
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:44,720
using for foiler feeds or foil sprays

1435
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,358
uh i mean we don't really i mean if

1436
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:47,358
anything you know

1437
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,480
back in the day you guys made uh the

1438
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:55,599
paint sprayer what's that company

1439
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,079
graco a lot of money oh my god you guys

1440
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,960
you guys i mean their revenue when you

1441
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,119
guys uh

1442
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,318
first dropped the pay sprayer back in

1443
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,800
the day went crazy

1444
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:05,759
i mean i know i switched from that you

1445
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,160
know uh

1446
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,359
that system that was a game changer for

1447
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:12,799
sure

1448
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:15,519
yeah but uh i think you guys are

1449
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,039
were you the dram 50 right now yeah now

1450
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,318
we just have drams in all of our

1451
00:49:17,039 --> 00:49:20,318
facilities you know they cost

1452
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:22,639
as much as a fucking honda civic you

1453
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:24,079
know they're expensive

1454
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:25,598
you know every time i see one i'm like

1455
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,480
damn i just bought a honda civic right

1456
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,680
now

1457
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:32,800
you know um but you know

1458
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:34,239
the time that you save and the the

1459
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,839
being able to have a hose that you can

1460
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:37,199
go throughout the whole facility

1461
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:38,960
like here we have it upstairs and the

1462
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:40,879
downstairs so we have one upstairs we

1463
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,318
only have three here right

1464
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,640
i think we have three here we have one

1465
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:46,960
in the we have one of the badges

1466
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:48,879
one for all our fire rooms downstairs

1467
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,559
and one for our flower rooms upstairs so

1468
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,400
we don't have an elevator here

1469
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,000
um so we can't be carrying those things

1470
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:58,079
up and down the stairs

1471
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,440
yeah um we had another question here

1472
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,039
curing process

1473
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:04,559
you know how long are you guys carrying

1474
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:04,558
flour for temps

1475
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:08,639
yeah so uh so same thing that we've

1476
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,358
always said

1477
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,318
60 60 is what we shoot for in the drying

1478
00:50:11,358 --> 00:50:15,679
room

1479
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:18,960
you know 60 degrees 60 humidity you know

1480
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,318
and depending on how the temperature and

1481
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,119
weather is outside

1482
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:24,719
and all that stuff 14 to 16 days the

1483
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:25,280
plants will sit inside there and hang

1484
00:50:24,719 --> 00:50:27,118
you know

1485
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,400
so at that time that that's the start of

1486
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,240
the cure process

1487
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,599
you know and then from there they get

1488
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,639
bend up in big bends

1489
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,880
you know where they'll sit for about 10

1490
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:39,920
to 14 days

1491
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:42,000
yeah yeah in bands you know and then

1492
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:45,119
from there they'll go to the trimmers

1493
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,318
you know so so total cure time is three

1494
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,640
to four weeks

1495
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:50,318
you know counting drying and when they

1496
00:50:48,639 --> 00:50:52,078
go into the bins

1497
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:53,679
you know which is plenty of time you

1498
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,599
know you got to remember

1499
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:57,279
no one has done more testing than we

1500
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:59,119
have and no one can tell you that those

1501
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,119
terpenes start to degrade

1502
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,119
and anybody that tells you that a long

1503
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:06,160
cure is better

1504
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:06,720
that's some bro science shit because i

1505
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:08,960
spend

1506
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:11,199
millions and millions of dollars on

1507
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,880
testing and sending cannabis to labs and

1508
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:14,399
telling me when is the peak time for

1509
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:18,400
terpenes

1510
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,838
and when once that cannabis is dry

1511
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,160
the every single day those terpenes

1512
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:24,239
degrade

1513
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:25,759
so when people say well why don't you

1514
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:28,159
why don't you guys cure your

1515
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,520
your your flower well we don't want it

1516
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:31,118
it's like saying why don't you open a

1517
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:32,719
banana and sit on the table and eat it

1518
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,720
three weeks later

1519
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:36,239
yeah it's exactly it's the same exact

1520
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:37,919
thing happened you know what i mean

1521
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:40,479
and the testing tells us this all the

1522
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,079
time because when we send a fresh flower

1523
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,519
that's just been cured and just been

1524
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,720
trimmed to the lab

1525
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:48,719
and it's three percent terpenes right

1526
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:50,558
and then three weeks later it's one

1527
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:53,199
percent turbulence

1528
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,480
you know it's degrading you know yeah so

1529
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:56,000
i've always i've been saying this for

1530
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,318
years you know cannabis is like fresh

1531
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,079
fruit you know i like my fruit fresh

1532
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:01,440
i don't like my fruit you know four

1533
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,880
weeks later when it's been sitting in

1534
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,800
the bowl and it's all rotted out and

1535
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,880
it's the same exact thing

1536
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,119
ideally what how many weeks do you like

1537
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:12,559
to see it on your shelf

1538
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:15,039
i mean so let's take we we hung it in

1539
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:17,440
our room that took about 14 days

1540
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:18,800
right and then let's say seven to ten

1541
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,838
days by the time it gets

1542
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:25,280
bent up and trimmed up and processed and

1543
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:27,599
sent off to the lab you know

1544
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,800
so from the time it's actually dried

1545
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:32,160
completely dried

1546
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,839
seven to fourteen days okay and that's

1547
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:35,679
as fast as possible that i mean

1548
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:37,838
you you you can't do any fashion it has

1549
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:39,519
to be trimmed it has to be sent out for

1550
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:40,400
testing you have to wait for the test

1551
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:42,079
results

1552
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,920
then once you get the test results you

1553
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,640
package it you stick it you put it on

1554
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,880
the shelf

1555
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:48,480
that's as fast as possible sure we might

1556
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,760
be able to save off a day or two but

1557
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,280
with the legal market that's about as

1558
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,119
fast you can get it out

1559
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,400
yeah you've seen that delay with testing

1560
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:58,838
probably about a week or so

1561
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:02,079
five days yeah i mean you know if

1562
00:52:58,838 --> 00:53:03,519
if three days is like a really fast

1563
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,280
turnaround for the lab

1564
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:07,039
but five days is about where all the

1565
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,920
labs are at right now

1566
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:10,960
okay any other questions those are the

1567
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,838
main big ones

1568
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:14,079
i think those are the main big ones you

1569
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:16,480
know yeah

1570
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,839
that was about an hour yeah so real

1571
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,119
quick i just got another one unknown

1572
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:21,358
profit what up bro

1573
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,318
ec and coco what's the maximum you

1574
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:24,400
suggest

1575
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:25,759
so if you caught the beginning of this

1576
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,480
we talked about it and we're going to

1577
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,800
replay it

1578
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,400
it goes for this when we talk about coco

1579
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,240
when we talk about rockwool

1580
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,200
they're both hydroponic mediums they're

1581
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:36,799
both very similar the only downfall

1582
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:38,239
about cocoa is you can order the

1583
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,559
substrate

1584
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:42,399
there's not a lot of tools out there

1585
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,839
like grow sense that'll let you monitor

1586
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,280
the substrate

1587
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:49,679
so with cocoa you're better off getting

1588
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,280
a little bit of runoff with coco

1589
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:52,719
and with that as long as you're getting

1590
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,880
runoff you can

1591
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:56,318
feed pretty high you know i'm talking

1592
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,200
clones i'm not talking seed you know of

1593
00:53:56,318 --> 00:53:58,960
course seeds need

1594
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:00,719
less cc and you can eat them a lot less

1595
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,000
but i'm talking an old clone that's been

1596
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:03,759
around forever

1597
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,559
most all of them can take a really high

1598
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:09,359
ec you know a 3.0 ec in cocoa

1599
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,680
no issues whatsoever you know but if

1600
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:12,400
you're

1601
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:14,799
you're hitting a 3.0 in cocoa and you're

1602
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:15,838
letting your plants dry back a whole lot

1603
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,000
then you're going to have a bunch of

1604
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:19,759
issues

1605
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,599
it seems like cocoa holds on to a little

1606
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,359
bit more than the rock will

1607
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,119
sure yeah definitely that's why i'm

1608
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:26,719
saying make sure you have runoff if

1609
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:28,800
you're if you're playing with higher ec

1610
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:31,199
and coco

1611
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,039
i know it's a little early you know as

1612
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:36,318
far as the leds go

1613
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:37,759
um you know we've done a lot of testing

1614
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:39,599
on him but

1615
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,040
how are you feeling how you feeling

1616
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,838
about leds versus

1617
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:45,519
hps on that front you know i know it's

1618
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:46,880
kind of off the topic but i get i'm

1619
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:50,400
getting a lot of uh

1620
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:52,798
yeah i mean i'm stoked about the leds

1621
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,960
for the shorter plants

1622
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:57,039
you know so that those short to medium

1623
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,838
plants i'm super stoked about them i

1624
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:00,000
think they

1625
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:02,400
they they can they can hold their own

1626
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,920
you know the far bigger plants that

1627
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,200
stack all the way down and they grow

1628
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,039
bigger and they're

1629
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:08,399
i don't think the led is where it's out

1630
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:10,639
for us

1631
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,160
but if but we grow so many varieties

1632
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:14,558
that we could literally have varieties

1633
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:17,679
that we just grow under leds

1634
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:20,640
you know yeah so a lot of our shorter

1635
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:22,399
and medium-sized plants

1636
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:24,798
all those plants are going into our led

1637
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,920
rooms we just had we had a 77 light

1638
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:29,759
uh de luxe room at

1639
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,358
cudahy and we pulled those down we're

1640
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,880
putting up leds

1641
00:55:31,358 --> 00:55:34,400
because we were stoked with the results

1642
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,960
and we figured hey we can grow our

1643
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,039
shorter

1644
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,480
to medium plants here which we have a

1645
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:39,920
ton of you know

1646
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,760
and that's going to be the plan for our

1647
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,639
leds right now is we're going to focus

1648
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,119
on

1649
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:47,519
our uh our short and our medium plants

1650
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,640
will be growing under leds

1651
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:51,280
nice no it's good to know and what do

1652
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:53,279
you think

1653
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,319
we do get a lot of inbound about double

1654
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,040
stacking

1655
00:55:54,318 --> 00:55:59,838
on flour what is your opinion on the

1656
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:01,599
efficiencies of double stacked flour

1657
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:03,039
and would you guys ever think about

1658
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,519
doing a double stack flower

1659
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:06,318
and why oh we've thought about it for

1660
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:08,559
sure

1661
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:09,599
i mean there's been many times that i've

1662
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:11,280
walked in the room like

1663
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,440
we should double stack this room you

1664
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,640
know

1665
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,119
it just becomes it comes down to quality

1666
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,639
right

1667
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,318
when you start having things that aren't

1668
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:21,598
in front of your face every single day

1669
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:23,358
the things on the top kind of get

1670
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:24,960
forgotten about yeah

1671
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:26,480
you know it's not right in front of your

1672
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,159
face every single day so when you're

1673
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,920
doing it on such a large scale

1674
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:31,440
you know if you know i had a garage and

1675
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,798
i had you know eight lights and i was

1676
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,599
double stacking i'm there every single

1677
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:35,838
day i'm working

1678
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,760
sure you know but when you're on a large

1679
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:39,599
scale and things get put on top and

1680
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,359
they're not in front of your face

1681
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,640
a lot of times things get neglected you

1682
00:56:41,358 --> 00:56:45,199
know but

1683
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:46,400
if you're if you're if you're going watt

1684
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:48,798
for watt and you're growing

1685
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,400
a large plant and you're double stacking

1686
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:52,000
you're putting led and led but you could

1687
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,599
do the same thing with an hbs plant and

1688
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,199
grow a bigger plant and get

1689
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:56,798
you know i have to see the numbers i

1690
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:58,798
still haven't seen anything that fully

1691
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:00,400
convinces me quality wise that double

1692
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:02,400
stacking is where it's at

1693
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,559
quality and quantity wise you know but

1694
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,318
listen i'm i'm open to anything

1695
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:08,798
you know like i'm not gonna say i would

1696
00:57:06,318 --> 00:57:10,318
never do a double stack because

1697
00:57:08,798 --> 00:57:11,599
next week i'm gonna do a double stack

1698
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:12,239
you know i'm not saying that i am but i

1699
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,079

00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:16,078
you know but right now i haven't seen

1701
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:17,119
anything that says we need to go double

1702
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:18,559
stack

1703
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,559
yeah you know you need to have the

1704
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,599
facility for it too yeah you can't do a

1705
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,519
double stack in a
