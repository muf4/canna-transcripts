[Music]

2
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:13,410
so the first poll we had was do we think

3
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:15,388
that green houses are using less energy

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,969
than indoor cultivation facilities and

5
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:20,719
we see that a that's interesting is

6
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:23,009
about just slightly over half okay so

7
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:26,489
the next one that we're gonna have is

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:28,800
about light higher lighting watts per

9
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:32,308
square foot correlates to higher ppfd

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:38,239
higher light received by the the plant

11
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:45,869
canopy and the last one more light

12
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:48,238
equals more yield greater yield okay

13
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:51,750
about two-thirds disagree with that 100

14
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,399
70 70 percent okay thanks for coming and

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:01:01,198
I'm gonna let Nick introduce himself and

16
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:02,760
just take it away is that okay okay that

17
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,228
was quite the setup because it sounds

18
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,379
like I have all the answers which I do

19
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:09,599
not in these questions of course it's

20
00:01:07,379 --> 00:01:12,599
all it's all dependent right where are

21
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:15,929
these greenhouses etc etc so the data

22
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:17,989
I'm going to present is a set of data it

23
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,150
doesn't necessarily represent everything

24
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:23,759
but it is based off of a minimum of one

25
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:28,170
year's worth of 15-minute electrical

26
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,118
electric interval data monthly fossil

27
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,549
fuel consumption if they consume fossil

28
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:36,000
fuel and a year's worth of production

29
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,530
data in terms of dry usable product so

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,978
it's a decent data set I'll start with

31
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,170
that so how much energy is used in

32
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:45,899
cannabis cultivation facilities is the

33
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,349
first question I asked and so this is a

34
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:53,519
plot of what we have found in a recent

35
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:55,438
study so what do we see annual energy

36
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,959
consumption along the bottom the x-axis

37
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,609
and that's all fuels annual production

38
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,798
on the y-axis and then again that's dry

39
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:03,718
usable product and we see wow really

40
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,799
tight correlation here right our square

41
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:07,048
2.96

42
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,360
people familiar with our squared values

43
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,099
what that essentially means it basically

44
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,330
means that the

45
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,120
dependent variable how much production

46
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,170
you make is incredibly tied to how much

47
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,969
fuel you consume

48
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:20,619
so the 0.96 means that there's an

49
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:23,409
extremely strong correlation between

50
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,009
these two things so maybe that's not too

51
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:28,329
exciting or profound in and of itself

52
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:31,569
until you consider that this data set

53
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:34,840
includes indoor mixed light brand-new

54
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:36,849
construction retrofit a couple thousand

55
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,539
square feet up to over 30 thousand

56
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:40,469
square feet

57
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:43,569
fossil fuel heat electric heat and

58
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:45,759
vertical stacking so all of that is

59
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:47,439
represented in this data set and yet we

60
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,870
still have this incredibly tight

61
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,539
correlation between total energy

62
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,310
consumption and total facility

63
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:56,439
productivity that to me is is pretty

64
00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:00,280
interesting and not necessarily what we

65
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:04,659
expected going into this so what is

66
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,650
driving that energy use well we find

67
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:07,449
that there is a pretty strong

68
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,180
correlation between the lighting power

69
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:12,699
density and the total fuel consumption

70
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,580
on the y-axis so we go okay so lighting

71
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:18,009
power density is driving consumption of

72
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,650
energy to an extent at these facilities

73
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:22,539
all right well what's what's the deal

74
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:25,439
with lighting power density how does

75
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:28,689
that impact production well this is odd

76
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,639
why is our production going down as our

77
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:35,349
flower room lighting power density goes

78
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:37,059
up what we are finding here that is not

79
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:38,829
reflected but we know from the project

80
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,900
details is the facilities with higher

81
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,240
lighting power densities have the

82
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:45,550
fixtures mounted way up high so they had

83
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,080
to mount way more fixtures in order to

84
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,420
get the PP ft that they're looking for

85
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,510
at the canopy the the facilities with

86
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:54,339
the lower lighting power densities not

87
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:56,979
only did they have lower overall annual

88
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,259
energy use but they had better more

89
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:01,869
consistent ppfd I say better more

90
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:03,609
uniform PPF ppfd across the canopy so

91
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:07,599
again not something we would have

92
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:09,250
necessarily expected to see here but

93
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,530
lighting power density ppfd they're

94
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:15,069
related right I don't think so the poll

95
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,720
says now people didn't think so and that

96
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:19,120
is reflected in the data as well right

97
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,010
so lighting power density and ppfd not

98
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,959
related again why is that it's how

99
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:24,699
you're mounting these fixtures so right

100
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,459
away this tells me that we've got some

101
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:29,500
in terms of lighting design in these

102
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:31,060
facilities there's something we can do

103
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,189
right off the bat just by changing the

104
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,750
layout of the existing fixtures to

105
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,569
improve the light delivery in these

106
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,310
facilities

107
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:41,290
but ppfd in production those are related

108
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,750
right surely there's a correlation

109
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:47,530
between ppfd that everybody wants so

110
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:50,439
badly in production now there isn't what

111
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:52,809
the what's going on here so again you

112
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:55,660
can see that we've got ppfd values down

113
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,850
around 700 and those facilities are

114
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:59,439
still producing on the order of 350

115
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,810
grams per square foot of flowering

116
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,850
canopy then we have facilities all the

117
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,430
way out at what is that like 1,100 ppfd

118
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:08,950
that are making about half of that right

119
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,689
so what is this what do we learn here

120
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:14,589
what does this tell us does it mean that

121
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:16,269
ppfd is not important no it means that

122
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:19,049
it's not everything exactly right so

123
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:21,549
what remains if it's if it's not ppfd

124
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:22,660
what else is what remains what is what

125
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,810
is driving the production in these

126
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:29,370
facilities if I hear them yes we heard

127
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:34,509
co2 what else did you say Nadia co2

128
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:36,840
temperature yeah yeah genetics

129
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:40,180
yup how about just cultivators skill

130
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:42,879
right because we saw multiple facilities

131
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,459
in this data set that were all but

132
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,899
identical on paper HVAC systems

133
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:49,719
basically the same Lighting's basically

134
00:05:46,899 --> 00:05:51,729
the same P PFDs basically the same one

135
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,550
facilities literally producing double

136
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:56,920
the output of the other facility so to

137
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,480
me there's a lot to be learned in terms

138
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,230
of best practices cultivation techniques

139
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,350
and then what are those strains specific

140
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:07,090
impacts on energy and energy efficiency

141
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:08,800
so this is food for thought right this

142
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:09,969
doesn't necessarily give us all the

143
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,560
answers and it's definitely not

144
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,080
something that we could extrapolate out

145
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:16,930
nationally to every single facility but

146
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,909
this is a solid data set that we have

147
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,500
you know very carefully reviewed and

148
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,670
analyzed and there's not much to

149
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,350
interpret here you know this is not

150
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:25,840
based off of modeling this is just

151
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:29,950
straight up utility data and production

152
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:32,379
data so how is the energy used this

153
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:34,659
one's going to be fun I think indoor

154
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:36,490
what percent of indoor energy use do you

155
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,760
think is associated with lighting

156
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:42,079
horticultural lighting

157
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:49,550
just yell out some numbers I didn't hear

158
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:52,669
anyone heard 4060 alright what about

159
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,110
that that seems like a lot doesn't it we

160
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,850
were surprised by this this was more

161
00:06:54,110 --> 00:07:00,110
than we had anticipated for these

162
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:02,540
facilities natural gas use really quite

163
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,620
low that's a little bit influenced by

164
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,740
the fact that some of these facilities

165
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,840
are all electric heat but nonetheless

166
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,639
large component they're associated with

167
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:13,429
the lighting so again how can we ignore

168
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,469
lighting as an element of facility

169
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,540
efficiency when it's responsible for

170
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,790
around 70 percent of the total energy

171
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,780
consumption and this is one of the

172
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,760
things that we use we're talking to

173
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:26,089
cultivators to go look you may or may

174
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:28,939
not be into LED just yet but how can we

175
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:31,099
not at least have the conversation with

176
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:34,009
this sort of result what about green

177
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,420
house is anybody want to take some

178
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:37,990
guesses on what the split of energy

179
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:45,350
consumption in a green house might be

180
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:48,019
HVAC how about this so substantially

181
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,340
less energy use to lighting right

182
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:52,039
because we're supplementing natural

183
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:55,099
light and a heck of a lot more energy

184
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:56,660
use on the heating in the fuel side so

185
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,090
that first question that we asked which

186
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:00,740
was our greenhouse is substantially more

187
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:03,199
efficient or do they use substantially

188
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,850
less energy than indoor not in this data

189
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,789
set what we found in this data set was

190
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,680
when you consider all fuels they are

191
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:13,310
within about 10 percent of each other in

192
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,629
terms of total energy use and also

193
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,129
relative to production because we're

194
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:18,230
kind of looking at everything relative

195
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:21,889
to production as a metric to normalize

196
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:24,950
to so this does not necessarily agree

197
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:27,469
with a lot of the national literature on

198
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:29,779
the subject but again this is not

199
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,389
speculative this is very straightforward

200
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:35,269
simple data and analysis that we've done

201
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:36,740
here so this for this data set you know

202
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:39,289
we are extremely confident that these

203
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,240
are the numbers and again this helps us

204
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:42,709
focus on well what do we look at what

205
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:45,230
are we trying to do at a given facility

206
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,850
we trying to impact its carbon footprint

207
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,889
are we trying to reduce energy we're

208
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,120
trying to save energy costs because

209
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:51,409
while natural gas might be a big

210
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,860
percentage of your car

211
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:57,289
your consumption in this particular

212
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,669
location at least it's a fraction of

213
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:00,379
their operating costs they're still

214
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:03,439
spending way more on electricity than

215
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:08,120
they are on fuel so a little food for

216
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:10,490
thought as we proceed in terms of what

217
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,049
is the data actually showing us and how

218
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,089
do we improve our understanding of these

219
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:15,528
facilities and in my opinion it's

220
00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:17,089
through more data right we can't really

221
00:09:15,528 --> 00:09:19,009
figure out what's going on here until we

222
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,449
look more carefully until we get more

223
00:09:19,009 --> 00:09:23,240
data and as Derek said you know the

224
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:25,549
power score was extremely helpful as we

225
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,139
reviewed this data set and the more data

226
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:28,519
that we can get into power score the

227
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:30,589
more that people are publishing and

228
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,179
sharing this data we can really start to

229
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:33,709
understand what is going on these

230
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:36,258
facilities and how do we better optimize

231
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:40,188
these facilities and this is a picture

232
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:41,990
from my daughter's theater last year we

233
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:43,068
did Alice in Wonderland and I just

234
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:47,690
thought was a pretty picture to end with

235
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:51,658
so I'll leave it right there thank you

236
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,659
[Applause]

237
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,318
all right thanks Nick

238
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:04,100
so we're gonna have one more poll now

239
00:10:00,318 --> 00:10:06,528
for Brian's presentation but I was wrong

240
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,269
I thought that more light equals more

241
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:09,769
yield so if you were wrong about any of

242
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:11,810
those I would encourage you to stand up

243
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:13,669
come on please anybody I know that some

244
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:16,989
of you were wrong there we go come on

245
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:18,198
join join us you learned something yeah

246
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,860
okay

247
00:10:18,198 --> 00:10:23,599
all right this is the next poll so what

248
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,329
do you think is a bigger factor in the

249
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,449
climate impact of cultivation is it the

250
00:10:26,328 --> 00:10:31,309
amount of energy used in a cultivation

251
00:10:29,448 --> 00:10:33,859
facility or is it the electrical grid

252
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:40,208
mix and the fuels that they choose to

253
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:44,509
use on-site so it's looking at about

254
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:46,159
8020 so 80% of folks are choosing that

255
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:48,019
the grid mix and the fuels that you

256
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:50,328
choose are going to make a bigger impact

257
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:53,089
on your climate footprint of a facility

258
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:56,588
so with that I'm gonna have Brian join

259
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:56,589
us and have his presentation brought up

260
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:05,899
Thank You Gretchen Bryan Jungers senior

261
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,299
manager at esource which is a boulder

262
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:09,740
colorado company used to be part of

263
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:12,649
Rocky Mountain Institute back in the

264
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,959
1980s and 90s and then spun off and

265
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:17,958
we've been our own entity since then but

266
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:20,479
we really focus on utilities and their

267
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:22,729
customers and energy efficiency demand

268
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,220
side management renewables and

269
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:27,589
distribute energy resources so I'm gonna

270
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:31,339
quickly blaze through a little bit

271
00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:34,190
history on the data and the analysis of

272
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:36,470
energy and climate impacts some of the

273
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,750
backlash from that I talked about the

274
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,120
elephant in the room

275
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:44,120
Evan Mills as John Morris mentioned

276
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,220
earlier get into him a little bit and

277
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,629
then talk about on the aggregate what

278
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,579
what's going on in the public record

279
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:52,519
what do we know or think we kind of know

280
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:54,169
about the overall total impacts of this

281
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,649
industry and give you some key takeaways

282
00:11:54,169 --> 00:12:00,289
from my perspective so who red up in

283
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:03,919
smoke the 2012 study I'm back in the day

284
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:05,179
cool okay I get a number of people it

285
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:09,019
was really groundbreaking because there

286
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:11,989
wasn't anything in you know the the

287
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:14,240
intellectual literature on this industry

288
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:17,778
yet it had been behind closed doors

289
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,299
black market and Evan Mills and and

290
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:22,938
Scott Surabhi came out and did a

291
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:25,938
detailed careful analysis based on a

292
00:12:22,938 --> 00:12:29,389
very limited amount of actual monitored

293
00:12:25,938 --> 00:12:31,818
data from these residential grow

294
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:34,519
facilities in Mendocino County and they

295
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:36,588
came up with these numbers which there

296
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,269
was a lot of pushback from the regulated

297
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:41,600
industry saying these numbers are

298
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:43,818
inflated this is not representative but

299
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,670
the reality is that no one actually came

300
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:49,429
and replicated their study you know down

301
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:53,059
to the to the line item and so they were

302
00:12:49,429 --> 00:12:54,859
never really refuted and this it was

303
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:56,929
intended as a call to action to say hey

304
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,879
we need to regulate this industry we

305
00:12:56,929 --> 00:13:01,129
need to have policies in place so that

306
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,259
energy efficiency is incentivized we

307
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:07,129
need to help growers be as efficient as

308
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:09,620
possible so it was a fairly benign noble

309
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:11,809
intention to start but it led to

310
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:15,500
this really kind of crazy media frenzy

311
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:17,569
right did everybody see that three of

312
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,860
these these are real headline articles

313
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,320
and three of these are from the last six

314
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:23,509
months so this is a not by any means

315
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,170
over and almost every article that comes

316
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:29,299
out quote seven mills and his 2012 study

317
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:31,909
and they also often refer to the fact

318
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:34,069
that the city of Denver about three or

319
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:37,129
four percent of Denver's energy use is

320
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,629
for the cannabis industry and so I

321
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:41,419
wanted to dig into that a little bit but

322
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:45,559
first I wanted to let you all know Mills

323
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:49,729
is not done he recently sent out a draft

324
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:54,588
of a chapter that he intends to publish

325
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:58,519
in a book about policy or a collection

326
00:13:54,589 --> 00:14:00,350
of papers and I got news for you all

327
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:04,789
it's not any better than his 2012 study

328
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:07,790
in fact it's much worse he does not do

329
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:11,120
any new detailed engineering analysis or

330
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:14,269
energy analysis he points to other

331
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,690
analyses including one that I assisted

332
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:19,519
with from a new frontier data and Rai

333
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:23,480
saying that they're not rigorous enough

334
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:25,039
that they lack intellectual rigor he

335
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,039
essentially says that greenhouses are

336
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,870
just as bad as fully indoor grows and

337
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:31,939
and that all growing should be done

338
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,940
outdoors we are optimizing the

339
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,529
suboptimal and that it's it's outdoor

340
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,770
cultivation or bus nothing else is

341
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:41,809
really acceptable I have lots of issues

342
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:44,179
with this and I could talk for half the

343
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:48,949
day about every issue I have with this

344
00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:50,809
but essentially evan is is becoming

345
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:53,180
something of a sensationalist with with

346
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:56,599
this piece in particular he doesn't

347
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:58,939
really give any consideration of

348
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,790
industrial conventional agriculture as a

349
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,200
baseline he only compares to residential

350
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:04,939
and commercial building use not to

351
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,470
industrial which industrial and

352
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,440
conventional AG are much better

353
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:10,940
benchmarks and baselines to consider and

354
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,050
that's just the tip of the iceberg

355
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,750
there's there's a bunch more but I'm

356
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:16,639
gonna move on so yeah there's lots of

357
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,470
reasons why we're all doing this why

358
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,879
we're looking at indoor agriculture and

359
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,709
controlled environment agriculture and

360
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:22,990
why we care if if there weren't good

361
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,129
reasons to do it

362
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,810
there wouldn't be an industry and we

363
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:28,809
wouldn't be investing all these efforts

364
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:30,338
so it's kind of silly of him to do this

365
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:32,829
because he's not taking a lot of

366
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:35,130
feedback and and improving his analysis

367
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:38,350
he's just kind of doubling down on a

368
00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:39,519
somewhat limited perspective and I don't

369
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:42,879
think he knows very much about

370
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,189
agriculture unfortunately so let's look

371
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,830
at Denver so Denver three to four

372
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:49,750
percent of energy use in the city of

373
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:52,120
Denver is going to the cannabis industry

374
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:55,269
but this is the retail facilities this

375
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,310
is processing extraction like the whole

376
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:58,689
nine yards right and if you've been to

377
00:15:57,309 --> 00:16:00,429
Colorado if you live in Colorado you

378
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:02,200
know that it's not just Coloradans that

379
00:16:00,429 --> 00:16:04,659
are consuming cannabis in Colorado right

380
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,490
I mean when I've talked to folks there

381
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:07,629
something like half of the sales and

382
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,830
some of these facilities are for

383
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:11,860
out-of-state folks so it's a lot of

384
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:13,420
cannabis tourism and and as the United

385
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,220
States changes their their policies this

386
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:17,169
is probably going to change but they've

387
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,379
published a lot of their energy use data

388
00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:23,620
and also the production data and sales

389
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:26,200
data and so I went and compared Mills

390
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,299
efficiency production efficiency numbers

391
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:30,240
to what I think the production of

392
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:32,229
efficiencies actually are in Denver and

393
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,850
Mills would have said that you could

394
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,100
only produce about a hundred thousand

395
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:38,409
pounds in Denver based on how much

396
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,320
energy like the upper end energy use I

397
00:16:38,409 --> 00:16:43,120
have in that range but the actual sales

398
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,129
are like almost three times that so

399
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,320
people are obviously more efficient and

400
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:49,360
the data that Denver has shows that

401
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:53,260
growers are becoming more efficient over

402
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:56,019
time now if we drive up the road from

403
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:57,100
Denver to Boulder Nick would did a great

404
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:58,659
job but are you talking about this so

405
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,440
I'm not gonna belabor the point but I

406
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:04,000
mostly just wanted to look at the carbon

407
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,949
intensity of the growing happening there

408
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,429
so they report a little over a hundred

409
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:11,410
pounds co2 per square foot of cultivated

410
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:13,959
space at Boulder County so that is

411
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:16,600
largely because it is a lot of coal in

412
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:20,980
the grid mix there in Colorado right so

413
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:23,438
I was part of a study with ICF that we

414
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:28,029
did on behalf of the government in

415
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,990
British Columbia and we found numbers

416
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:32,319
were very different

417
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:33,910
Brad Queen did a DSM evaluation on

418
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,769
behalf of County of Boulder some folks

419
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,730
have probably seen this one of the I

420
00:17:35,769 --> 00:17:38,650
think the most interest

421
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:40,210
thing that came away from that study was

422
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:42,480
simply that a lot of growers are not

423
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:45,190
getting any sort of signal back from

424
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,048
their energy use because they are master

425
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,419
metered and they're not submitter so if

426
00:17:47,048 --> 00:17:50,558
you aren't measuring what you're doing

427
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:51,700
there's no way you're gonna be able to

428
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,160
really effectively and consistently

429
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,808
improve upon that so just getting folks

430
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,548
metered and having the energy use data

431
00:17:55,808 --> 00:18:01,149
coming back to them huge step in the

432
00:17:57,548 --> 00:18:03,519
right direction right but from the the

433
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:06,009
BC study that I was part of with ICF

434
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:08,319
what we found was really interesting is

435
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:11,259
that the Canadian cannabis growers were

436
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,668
less efficient whether it was warehouse

437
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:14,710
or greenhouse they were less efficient

438
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:18,070
than the US growers and we had data from

439
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:19,480
well over a dozen different data sets

440
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:21,609
and facilities from all over the world

441
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,250
we had data from Europe data from North

442
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:25,959
America US Canada so across the board on

443
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,779
average the US growers are more

444
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:32,380
efficient but the climate impacts were

445
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:34,359
much lower in BC and it's simply because

446
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:36,640
it's mostly hydro right so they don't

447
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:37,869
have any coal in their mix so even

448
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,470
though they're less energy efficient

449
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:43,569
their climate impact is lower so yeah if

450
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:45,850
you guess that you're the most the

451
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:47,289
amount of energy you use is has a bigger

452
00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:49,389
impact on your climate footprint then

453
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:52,450
where you're located largely that's not

454
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:55,690
the case and so we actually found that

455
00:18:52,450 --> 00:19:01,000
the greenhouses had higher co2 impact

456
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:02,950
than all indoor warehouses in BC so you

457
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,359
know in that climate and it's mostly

458
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,890
because the the climate impact is

459
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:07,808
natural gas driven right it's because

460
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,150
the heating from these greenhouses is

461
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:13,240
really making up a significant portion

462
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,350
of that of that climate impact so just

463
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,640
want to encourage everyone to go out and

464
00:19:14,349 --> 00:19:17,109
read the best practice guides if you

465
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,059
haven't already they're free they're

466
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:23,529
available on the website I participated

467
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:25,210
in the lighting technology but tack to

468
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:27,700
produce the lighting guide and it's

469
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:30,759
great and I hope that we can get out to

470
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:33,940
more growers in the future so a few

471
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:35,230
takeaways you know I think the only way

472
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:36,940
we're really going to build a fight

473
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,579
negative press like what came out

474
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,470
following MML study is to do our own

475
00:19:39,579 --> 00:19:42,849
very critical analysis and publish it

476
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,350
and get it out there

477
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,419
we can't just hope that it'll go away

478
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,159
because it hasn't gone away and I think

479
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:52,150
may yet actually even get worse over

480
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,980
time so yeah if anybody wants to publish

481
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:56,740
any studies with me let me know reach

482
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,220
out happy - yeah good AC Tripoli let's

483
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:07,390
do it

484
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:10,089
thank you so the 20% of the room that

485
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:11,650
guest energy consumption is a greater

486
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:14,949
contributor to climate impact please

487
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:16,810
stand dance no one's standing and

488
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,279
dancing it's like they want audience

489
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:21,250
participation but they don't want to

490
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:24,490
participate so all right this is our

491
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:27,819
next one six gallons of water per plant

492
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:31,690
per day is a good rule of thumb to run

493
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:34,809
with this is a number that's been said

494
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:35,850
to me in many places so just curious who

495
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:40,779
thinks it's good

496
00:20:35,849 --> 00:20:42,189
where did six come from okay fine

497
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:45,220
nobody's gonna have to dance with this

498
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:47,700
one all right I'm going to welcome Ted

499
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,700
to the podium

500
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:54,789
[Applause]

501
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:56,589
everyone my name is Ted Grantham I'm a

502
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:57,428
professor at UC Berkeley

503
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,168
coming from the Department of

504
00:20:57,429 --> 00:21:03,460
Environmental Sciences policy and

505
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:05,500
management I'm a bit of an outlier here

506
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,110
and that I don't work on energy I work

507
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:11,140
on water and to date I've mostly been

508
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:14,079
focused on outdoor not not indoor water

509
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:17,679
use but I'm super excited to be working

510
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:19,298
with new frontier and REI on a water

511
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,390
report that I think will address both

512
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:24,369
the indoor and outdoor aspects of

513
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,380
cannabis cultivation

514
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:28,418
I think another area that we have in

515
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,880
common is an awareness that the lack of

516
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:33,150
data and lack of good data has been a

517
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,860
enormous barrier to our understanding of

518
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:38,048
cannabis cultivation systems generally

519
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:39,939
and also a barrier to good policy and

520
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:42,039
that's really the approach that I'm

521
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:46,660
coming from as a research scientist at

522
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:48,399
UC Berkeley and I can share a little bit

523
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,870
about what we're doing at the UC

524
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,679
Berkeley cannabis Research Center and

525
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:54,849
then tell you a little bit about our

526
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:58,120
water work specifically so about two

527
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:59,379
years ago a group of faculty at on

528
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:01,689
campus

529
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,299
met who were interested in cannabis and

530
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:07,600
this included anthropologists and

531
00:22:04,298 --> 00:22:11,168
wildlife biologists hydrologists land

532
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:13,389
use scientists lawyers and we recognized

533
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:15,130
that there was a real need for better

534
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:19,750
peer-reviewed scholarship around

535
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:23,080
cannabis given the importance of this of

536
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:25,000
this crop to to the economy all of the

537
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:26,798
policy debates happening around cannabis

538
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,589
and to the potential environmental

539
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:31,418
impacts and so we realized that by

540
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:33,279
working together we could really help

541
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:36,700
advance some of the underlying science

542
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:39,129
to address these needs and our approach

543
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,980
really builds on not just you know pure

544
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:43,870
pure research but also as engagement so

545
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,150
we work through UCI's Cooperative

546
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:49,928
Extension network to work with farmers

547
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:52,419
policymakers regulators other academic

548
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:56,250
and identity is to really create a space

549
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:59,110
for dialogue among among growers among

550
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:03,039
industry and

551
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:04,928
and other other interest groups so our

552
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,339
our focus is quite a bit different I

553
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:07,809
think than some of the other UC research

554
00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:09,699
centers that have focused on cannabis

555
00:23:07,808 --> 00:23:11,558
and that we're really interested in

556
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:15,400
understanding and studying cannabis as

557
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:17,500
an agricultural system not as a drug or

558
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,660
a medicine so we don't focus on the

559
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,599
medical and public health aspects of

560
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:24,400
cannabis in California rather we focus

561
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:27,009
on things like agricultural production

562
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,830
practices environmental impacts the

563
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:32,650
policy setting and really the community

564
00:23:29,829 --> 00:23:35,139
level social impacts of cannabis

565
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:36,429
production which to date has largely

566
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,679
focused on the north coast but we've

567
00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:42,759
been expanding our footprint to other

568
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:44,080
parts of the state in terms of our water

569
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:46,210
work the story is actually a little bit

570
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,909
similar to the story that Brian

571
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:51,429
mentioned and that some of the concerns

572
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:53,320
over over water use have really been I

573
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,970
think sensationalized in the media and

574
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:58,599
there hasn't really been great science

575
00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:00,548
to support our understanding of how

576
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:01,869
water use by cannabis primarily outdoor

577
00:24:00,548 --> 00:24:05,079
cannabis growers could be affecting the

578
00:24:01,869 --> 00:24:07,569
environment there have been there's a

579
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:10,089
lot of anecdotal evidence from from

580
00:24:07,569 --> 00:24:11,470
raids on trespass grows or illegal grows

581
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:14,798
from different parts of the state of

582
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:17,140
poor water management practices here on

583
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:19,210
your left you see a kind of a pump

584
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,770
perched precariously over a over a

585
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:24,009
stream diverting water directly from a

586
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:25,869
stream the photo on your right shows a

587
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:28,359
stream that's been sort of dug out and

588
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:31,629
and kind of diverted into a into a large

589
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:33,939
pond that's supplying supplying a farm

590
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:37,030
and so when you know when enforcement

591
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:39,160
agencies and and in the media witnessed

592
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:41,889
practices like these it rightfully does

593
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:43,870
raise alarm bells but the question

594
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:46,600
remains how reflective are these

595
00:24:43,869 --> 00:24:47,918
practices of the broader broader grower

596
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:51,849
community and these really the questions

597
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,620
that we wanted to wanted to address and

598
00:24:51,849 --> 00:24:56,019
we have some really basic questions

599
00:24:53,619 --> 00:24:57,609
right and and it's pretty remarkable to

600
00:24:56,019 --> 00:24:58,990
us when we kind of looked at the

601
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:01,418
literature that these questions haven't

602
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:03,039
been answered you know where do cannabis

603
00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:08,970
growers get their water and how much

604
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:11,859
water are they using fortunately through

605
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,149
you know the passes of prop 64 and some

606
00:25:11,859 --> 00:25:15,278
of the regulatory Pro

607
00:25:13,148 --> 00:25:16,658
have been developed to develop a legal

608
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,690
cannabis market we're actually getting

609
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:21,219
new data from growers on their water use

610
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:24,759
and the results that I'll be showing

611
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:27,639
today are from a data set that was

612
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:30,519
developed through a regional regulatory

613
00:25:27,638 --> 00:25:33,158
program that started in in 2016 and it

614
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:35,409
basically reflects data from grower

615
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:39,190
community in this region in in the

616
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:41,619
twenty six seventeen year and these data

617
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:44,619
include information from about a

618
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:46,329
thousand farms it includes information

619
00:25:44,618 --> 00:25:48,009
like the size of the cultivation area

620
00:25:46,329 --> 00:25:51,489
the type of the cultivation area whether

621
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:56,169
that's fully outdoor mixed light or

622
00:25:51,489 --> 00:25:58,450
indoor and includes water sourcing input

623
00:25:56,169 --> 00:26:01,749
to storage and water applied applied to

624
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:04,798
plants so our first question where are

625
00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:07,899
cannabis farmers getting their water

626
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:11,079
they rely on a variety of sources

627
00:26:07,898 --> 00:26:14,678
including groundwater wells streams

628
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:17,348
Springs and and some rainwater catchment

629
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:20,679
and we look at the the relative

630
00:26:17,348 --> 00:26:24,368
proportion of of use we see that the

631
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:26,320
vast majority of farmers are relying on

632
00:26:24,368 --> 00:26:27,788
on wells and then we just kind of walk

633
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:31,028
you through focus on the gray lines

634
00:26:27,788 --> 00:26:32,648
first so this represents about 60% of

635
00:26:31,028 --> 00:26:37,329
all growers in the region are using

636
00:26:32,648 --> 00:26:39,308
wells in this dark line part of it means

637
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:41,138
that those those users are using more

638
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:43,690
than more than other other sources in

639
00:26:41,138 --> 00:26:45,699
addition in addition to well so a lot of

640
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:48,788
growers are only using wells as their as

641
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:51,639
their water supply we also have you know

642
00:26:48,788 --> 00:26:53,979
a fair number of farmers using surface

643
00:26:51,638 --> 00:26:56,348
water supplies like Springs or sorry

644
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:59,679
like rivers and streams to meet their

645
00:26:56,348 --> 00:27:02,528
needs fewer using rain catchments and

646
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,269
this off-site basically represents you

647
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:08,019
know things like water trucking or

648
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:11,108
municipal water supplies and so this was

649
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:13,088
a surprise to us I think there was an

650
00:27:11,108 --> 00:27:16,028
assumption certainly by the kind of

651
00:27:13,088 --> 00:27:17,338
regulator community that growers were

652
00:27:16,028 --> 00:27:19,929
primarily relying on surface water

653
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:21,969
diversions which is which is really a

654
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:24,190
huge concern and given that where these

655
00:27:21,969 --> 00:27:26,860
grows are they tend to be concentrated

656
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:29,620
in watersheds that support

657
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:31,000
of species like endangered salmon and so

658
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:33,009
that's really one of them the major

659
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,349
environmental concerns driving policy in

660
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:42,009
this region so the second question how

661
00:27:38,349 --> 00:27:43,298
much water is actually being used so

662
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:46,900
there's really only one other study

663
00:27:43,298 --> 00:27:48,519
that's been focused on outdoor cannabis

664
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:53,320
water use and this is a study by Scott

665
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:55,058
Bauer back in 20 2016 and yeah this was

666
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:58,119
absolutely I think a good faith effort

667
00:27:55,058 --> 00:28:00,160
to think about what cannabis water

668
00:27:58,119 --> 00:28:01,689
demands might mean in the context of

669
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:04,720
water availability and thinking about

670
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:06,789
potential impacts to streamflow in these

671
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,380
sensitive species that we that we care

672
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:12,720
about and they use this at you know at

673
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:15,490
the time this was well before

674
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,289
legalization getting oxidizes data was

675
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:18,910
very difficult and so they they did

676
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:21,099
communicate with some some farmer

677
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:22,419
associations to come up with some a

678
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:25,359
rough estimate of cannabis use and

679
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:28,270
that's where this six gallons per day

680
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,319
per plant estimate over over the hundred

681
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:33,089
and fifty days of the growing season

682
00:28:29,319 --> 00:28:36,069
came and so they basically use this this

683
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:37,959
this water use estimate applied it to

684
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:40,359
the number of plants they viewed on

685
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,298
through aerial imagery analysis and then

686
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:46,269
scaled that up to the watershed to

687
00:28:43,298 --> 00:28:48,220
estimate the total demand of cannabis in

688
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:50,048
a watershed relative to supplies and

689
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:54,120
they study these little watersheds here

690
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:54,119
in different parts of the of the state

691
00:28:54,419 --> 00:29:00,220
so through this analysis of of these

692
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:04,168
about a thousand reports we get a much

693
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:06,850
more nuanced picture of of water use

694
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:08,410
apologises a little bit difficult to see

695
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:10,689
but let's first start with water use

696
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:13,990
overall and first of all what we see is

697
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:17,200
there's a strong seasonal pattern in in

698
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:19,569
water demand and just if you're curious

699
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,269
these this shows liters of water this is

700
00:29:19,569 --> 00:29:24,548
basically scaled to the median farm size

701
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:26,740
which is about a quarter of an acre in

702
00:29:24,548 --> 00:29:28,000
in the region but the pattern is really

703
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,589
what I want to highlight here because

704
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,940
that initial estimate of cannabis water

705
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:36,009
use just rely basically estimated a

706
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,419
constant demand from the start of the

707
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:39,359
growing season to the end of the growing

708
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:42,900
season

709
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:44,490
the water extraction profile for users

710
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,670
that rely on perennial sources like

711
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:50,039
groundwater largely explains this this

712
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:52,140
this trend that we see here right so

713
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:54,059
these are the majority of users that are

714
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,980
using groundwater basically are pumping

715
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,399
water on demand to meet to meet their

716
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,980
needs

717
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,470
in contrast growers that rely on

718
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:03,329
seasonal sources like like Springs where

719
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:05,750
you know flows may either cease entirely

720
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:08,490
can become quite low or less reliable

721
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:11,849
they tend to be pumping water kind of

722
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:14,009
your year round and the reason they're

723
00:30:11,849 --> 00:30:15,439
pumping water in the winter is because

724
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:18,410
they're moving that water into storage

725
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,759
to use later in the growing season and

726
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:22,320
for those subset of growers that

727
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:24,240
actually had large water storage

728
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,549
capacities like ponds they had a

729
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,930
completely inverted pattern of water use

730
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:29,970
where they're basically getting all of

731
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:32,430
their water in the winter months filling

732
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:35,490
up those ponds and have very low demands

733
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:37,410
in in the growing season in the summer

734
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,269
now this has really important policy

735
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:41,580
implications because under the current

736
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:44,369
state water board regulations any

737
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:46,409
outdoor grower is actually prohibited

738
00:30:44,369 --> 00:30:48,299
from taking water from streams in the

739
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:50,279
summer months so if you're a grower who

740
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:53,669
relies on streams you're either going to

741
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:55,829
need a build storage to to meet your

742
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:58,259
growing season demands or put in a well

743
00:30:55,829 --> 00:31:01,049
and wells ground water generally not

744
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:04,589
regulated by by the war by the water

745
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:07,529
board and their cannabis policy so we

746
00:31:04,589 --> 00:31:09,000
ask the question do cannabis growers in

747
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:12,629
this data set at least have enough

748
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:14,130
storage on-site to meet their growing

749
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:15,420
season demands in other words can they

750
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,280
comply with these forbearance

751
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,990
requirements and what we see is that the

752
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,889
vast majority do not and so this

753
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:24,779
basically again shows that that for

754
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:26,640
these growers that have rely on seasonal

755
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:30,059
sources they're gonna they're going to

756
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,910
need a either build a pond which is can

757
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:34,019
be you know very cost prohibitive

758
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:35,790
they're gonna have to move on to

759
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:39,480
groundwater which has its own challenges

760
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:44,940
or they're gonna have to drop out of the

761
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:46,799
of the permit system so just to

762
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,230
summarize this is just really a brief

763
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:52,129
snapshot of some of our water research

764
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:54,079
and our research portfolio broadly but

765
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:56,150
through this work we found that wells

766
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,039
were the most common source of outdoor

767
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:01,340
for outdoor canon outdoor mix light

768
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:02,839
cannabis cultivation in the region the

769
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:04,730
amount and timing of water really

770
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:05,959
depends on your water source on the in

771
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:08,720
the amount of water storage capacity

772
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:11,808
available and that we found that most

773
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,100
farms had insufficient storage to meet

774
00:32:11,808 --> 00:32:14,808
state permitting requirements which

775
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:16,219
could be a really important barrier to

776
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:19,339
compliance for growers that are

777
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:22,370
attempting to enter the illegal the

778
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:23,779
legal system that's all I have today

779
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:25,789
next time I'll tell you about our

780
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:27,529
wildlife studies we're doing some

781
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:32,029
wildlife camera trapping and looking at

782
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:33,829
how a wildlife use basically acts use

783
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:35,210
use farms and round farms so this is a

784
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:46,279
cool photo that I'd like to share yeah

785
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:47,630
thank you okay so I'm just gonna do a

786
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:49,490
couple summary remarks and then we're

787
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:52,400
gonna open it up to Q&amp;A we learned about

788
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:55,730
energy we learned about carbon and we

789
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:57,290
learned a bit about water and all three

790
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:59,000
of those things are going to be better

791
00:32:57,289 --> 00:33:00,889
supported by the new developments that

792
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,380
we're doing for Power score so I just

793
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:05,300
wanted to remind folks from the speeches

794
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,490
we heard from Nick that power score was

795
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:11,960
used as a baseline for comparison for

796
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:14,058
his Boulder County assessment brian has

797
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:18,789
been involved in helping improve power

798
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:22,450
score and we really hope to see an

799
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:24,829
increased use of utility programming's

800
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:26,900
utility programs using Power score to

801
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:28,399
get the benefit while being able to

802
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:32,000
trust the data integrity and accuracy

803
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,540
and then Ted mentioned how the cannabis

804
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,220
water report is a collaboration between

805
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:38,690
Berkeley and our III and then also that

806
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,029
we are going to be using information

807
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:43,340
from these studies and the water related

808
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:45,500
information to be putting into power

809
00:33:43,339 --> 00:33:47,928
score as a baseline so that we can make

810
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,250
a baseline for water and then lastly as

811
00:33:47,929 --> 00:33:51,530
I mentioned yesterday we're gonna be

812
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:54,410
pulling in carbon shadowing for the

813
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:56,690
actual energy sources that people use to

814
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,920
the point that Brian made about mixes so

815
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:59,360
that we can actually understand what's

816
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:00,950
the carbon intensity of these different

817
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:02,509
facilities based off of the fuel sources

818
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,279
that they use the mix of their grid and

819
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:05,349
then the choices that they make inside

820
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:08,320
the facility

821
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:10,929
so I invite folks to pepper us with

822
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,300
questions I have some that I could ask

823
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:18,608
but I really prefer to get them started

824
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:25,510
out here don't all jump down at once I'm

825
00:34:18,608 --> 00:34:27,699
Corinne good morning thanks Nick for

826
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:30,190
that presentation that you showed on

827
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:32,858
energy I I wonder what the greenhouses

828
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:35,530
though in the data set that you had was

829
00:34:32,858 --> 00:34:38,230
that can you talk a little bit about the

830
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:40,179
geographical distribution of the data

831
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:45,039
set that you had was that all up in the

832
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:50,889
you know the north any in the south yes

833
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:55,509
so it was all climate zone 5b hey which

834
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:56,820
one's the dry one somebody knows you

835
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,230
that's not right you made that up

836
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:01,869
whichever the dry one is 5a I don't know

837
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:04,630
it was all 5a and an important thing I

838
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:06,070
did not I pointed out how there was a

839
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:08,079
lot of variety amongst those facilities

840
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:10,480
there was one commonality which is that

841
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,940
they were all HID lighting there was not

842
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,740
an LED amongst them that was a mix

843
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:17,190
between HPS and C mhm but that is a

844
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:19,949
important I think detail that I left out

845
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:22,090
also you are the first to see that data

846
00:35:19,949 --> 00:35:25,739
outside of the reviewers in Boulder

847
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:28,119
County so you're all very special

848
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:29,799
there's a follow-up question from the

849
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:31,480
slide oh how does energy compared

850
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:38,109
between sealed and ventilated

851
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:42,820
greenhouses so more we'd see more HVAC

852
00:35:38,108 --> 00:35:46,000
use in the sealed greenhouses you know

853
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:48,490
they have full-blown HVAC systems and

854
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,199
not only they're dealing with the loads

855
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:51,909
from the lighting but there's the you

856
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:53,639
know the solar radiation that's helping

857
00:35:51,909 --> 00:35:55,929
increase the heat in that space as well

858
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:58,809
so you know lighting loads are quite

859
00:35:55,929 --> 00:36:00,339
similar that they're both using within

860
00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:01,659
this sample all of the mixed light

861
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:03,789
facilities we're using some form

862
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:05,858
threshold control to turn the lights on

863
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:07,570
and off energy use is pretty similar on

864
00:36:05,858 --> 00:36:09,429
the lighting side HVAC use was

865
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:11,880
definitely higher for those sealed

866
00:36:09,429 --> 00:36:11,879
facilities

867
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:20,548
nineteen facilities yeah so I wanted to

868
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,440
ask about what you know as far as energy

869
00:36:20,548 --> 00:36:25,298
reporting and gathering data like what

870
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,710
are some of the challenges of scaling

871
00:36:25,298 --> 00:36:28,838
that up I know some of it's been

872
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:34,739
self-reported but you know how do we how

873
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:37,268
do we do that accurately at scale sure I

874
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:39,429
mean I think that's a lot of attention

875
00:36:37,268 --> 00:36:42,008
of the power score is for enough folks

876
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:45,759
to adopt it become a standard and then

877
00:36:42,009 --> 00:36:48,670
it helps to set the framework for how

878
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:50,230
energy is reported and you know and in

879
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:52,960
what format and so that we can compare

880
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,759
directly I don't know that there's any

881
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,639
other standard out there

882
00:36:54,759 --> 00:36:58,630
I mean individual utilities have a ami

883
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:02,318
data and they're collecting data

884
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:05,108
obviously but outside of that there's

885
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:07,329
not a lot of standardization the issue

886
00:37:05,108 --> 00:37:09,578
for me is the standardization in other

887
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:12,309
words you're you're tying it all back to

888
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:14,019
either high pressure sodium and you're

889
00:37:12,309 --> 00:37:16,989
not going back to what Mother Nature is

890
00:37:14,018 --> 00:37:18,758
doing outdoors it would seem to me you'd

891
00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:20,769
want to look at what the when you're

892
00:37:18,759 --> 00:37:23,498
comparing LEDs or anything else

893
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:25,598
what's outdoors what what is and it's

894
00:37:23,498 --> 00:37:28,748
not just ppfd in the power range that

895
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,298
plants are looking for and with regards

896
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:36,368
to standardization of using indoor

897
00:37:31,298 --> 00:37:38,920
agriculture as a way to then upscale

898
00:37:36,369 --> 00:37:41,650
cannabis when you look at the almond

899
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:44,528
that's using one pound of water per

900
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:47,829
almond so when you look at six pounds

901
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:51,068
per four-hour cannabis I mean six

902
00:37:47,829 --> 00:37:54,009
gallons per cannabis I think we we need

903
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:57,608
to also look at standardization of where

904
00:37:54,009 --> 00:38:00,099
we start to do the measurements and then

905
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:01,358
the slide with the regards to the amount

906
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:03,999
of yield going down

907
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:05,558
these are sation beings these plants

908
00:38:03,998 --> 00:38:08,230
shut down when they it's too much

909
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:10,390
they're so putting more light on it it's

910
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:14,528
not going to make it grow plus where do

911
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:15,759
you go 18 hours of light part of the

912
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:18,429
world I'm sorry do you have a question

913
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:21,190
yes the question is how do you determine

914
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:23,048
the standards from which you from which

915
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,940
you be able to make these measurements

916
00:38:23,048 --> 00:38:27,608
because they're all over the

917
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,619
place depending on who's presenting well

918
00:38:27,608 --> 00:38:33,039
a baseline has to be drawn somewhere I

919
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:34,450
think we can all agree there's baselines

920
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,009
that we need for outdoor growing there's

921
00:38:34,449 --> 00:38:37,149
baselines that we need for some of the

922
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,410
great awesome stuff that Ted was

923
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,510
presenting on how are people getting

924
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:42,549
water how are they storing it when are

925
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:44,980
they using it and those are folks that

926
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:47,530
are using a resource brought to us by

927
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:48,699
the earth how people choose to light is

928
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,050
not necessarily what I think we're

929
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:53,199
trying to talk about in this panel and

930
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:54,940
so I think what I'd love for anyone to

931
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:57,789
comment on is like how do you make a

932
00:38:54,940 --> 00:39:07,269
baseline for an industry that in some

933
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:08,829
opinions is unbeatable I've been asked

934
00:39:07,269 --> 00:39:13,539
this question many times over the years

935
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:15,369
and I think you simply start with what

936
00:39:13,539 --> 00:39:17,739
people are doing to the extent that

937
00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:19,510
folks are sharing and we have we can

938
00:39:17,739 --> 00:39:21,729
have some confidence in the data you see

939
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,530
what people are doing right now and then

940
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,440
you look at the range this is the low

941
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,910
end this is the high end you know set an

942
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:31,358
average and then start to try to ratchet

943
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:33,608
it down but the problem is so much data

944
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:36,309
wasn't collected for a very long time

945
00:39:33,608 --> 00:39:37,869
for legal reasons and then isn't

946
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:41,500
collected or reported now for

947
00:39:37,869 --> 00:39:43,900
proprietary reasons and so having faith

948
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,760
in the data that's available it really

949
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:50,010
limits our ability to set a baseline or

950
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,010
even talk about setting a baseline so

951
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:54,848
I'll jump in on that as well because

952
00:39:53,019 --> 00:39:57,068
we're doing a baseline study in

953
00:39:54,849 --> 00:39:58,150
Massachusetts right now Commissioner

954
00:39:57,068 --> 00:39:59,858
Doyle I need to catch up with you at

955
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:02,950
some point wherever you're hiding back

956
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:06,869
there yes and it's it's really

957
00:40:02,949 --> 00:40:10,000
challenging you know because there is so

958
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:12,369
no facility no to facilities I've ever

959
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,469
been in are alike they're all a little

960
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:16,480
bit different right so there's just a

961
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:18,009
lot of ways to skin the cat because I

962
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,309
like to say all that matters is there's

963
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:23,079
one more dead cat so it's it's very

964
00:40:21,309 --> 00:40:24,849
difficult to set baselines but within

965
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:26,589
that effort to try to figure out what

966
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:28,180
people are currently doing we are

967
00:40:26,588 --> 00:40:29,799
finding there are certain systems or

968
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:31,149
certain parts of the process that there

969
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,700
is a lot of consistency and it is

970
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:35,380
reasonably comfortable to say okay this

971
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:37,449
is standard practice for this technology

972
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:40,150
in this phase of cultivation

973
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:42,879
but like veg lighting mmm it's you know

974
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:44,829
is it t fives is it single-ended Mel how

975
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,480
wide is it LED and we see a wide variety

976
00:40:44,829 --> 00:40:48,220
of lighting technologies for that so

977
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,429
it's more difficult to say this is

978
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:52,959
standard practice thanks very much

979
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:55,899
um one question that came up when I

980
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,280
first started pouring into doing the

981
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,289
literature review of the available

982
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,750
studies and what is the baseline how

983
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:04,809
could you compare X to Y whether it's HP

984
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:06,159
s2 LED or something else and one of the

985
00:41:04,809 --> 00:41:09,159
things that I found with the first

986
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:12,489
studies was the SMUD studies done with

987
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:15,429
seven leaves and amplified farms I think

988
00:41:12,489 --> 00:41:17,078
and both of them the first one didn't

989
00:41:15,429 --> 00:41:19,690
control for strain and then the second

990
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:22,089
one tried to tried to at least sort of

991
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:24,309
correlate these ranges of energy and

992
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:25,568
production based off of strain type and

993
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:27,429
then I started learning more and

994
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:30,039
basically learned that even strain name

995
00:41:27,429 --> 00:41:32,259
doesn't really mean anything in genetics

996
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:33,759
and you could have green crack in one

997
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,140
place green crack in another they're

998
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,670
totally different plants too for

999
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:38,618
genetics so having it controlled by

1000
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,940
strain wouldn't be accurate so I just

1001
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:43,568
wanted to open that can of worms is

1002
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:44,920
there any way to control by plants so

1003
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:50,710
that you're actually comparing apples to

1004
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:52,630
apples we're just starting a study of

1005
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:55,900
that very thing with a cultivator who

1006
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:57,880
runs his facility like a lab and is one

1007
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,519
of the only may be the only cultivator

1008
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,530
I've run into that dedicates a room to a

1009
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:04,059
strain so everybody else I've ever been

1010
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:05,829
they have a mix of strains in a flower

1011
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:07,179
room and that pretty much precludes the

1012
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:10,780
ability to figure out how the strain

1013
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:11,649
might impact energy consumption I'll let

1014
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:15,280
you know when we're done if it worked or

1015
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:16,809
not yeah and I'll say exactly the same

1016
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,670
thing that the folks that are really

1017
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:21,039
really controlled facilities and they

1018
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:24,190
they're tracking very carefully genotype

1019
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:26,920
phenotype genotype and and they can

1020
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:30,010
report on all of that you know to a very

1021
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,349
precise ability that's when you can

1022
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:35,440
start to actually work back to a

1023
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:37,680
standardization I just want to make one

1024
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,179
when one comment on with respect to

1025
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:42,219
water and that and this is a Brawley

1026
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:44,588
with water and energy that it's

1027
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:45,969
incredibly it's still very difficult for

1028
00:42:44,588 --> 00:42:48,849
for the research community and

1029
00:42:45,969 --> 00:42:50,799
university researchers to actually do

1030
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:53,980
these types of studies where one might

1031
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,690
look at you know the various responses

1032
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:58,420
of particular strains or cultivation

1033
00:42:55,690 --> 00:43:00,309
strategies to variation in energy or

1034
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,960
water applications we're still

1035
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:03,730
prohibited from actually working with

1036
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:07,210
the plant it's still considered a

1037
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:10,179
federal one Schedule one drug and we

1038
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:11,829
risk our university funding if we even

1039
00:43:10,179 --> 00:43:13,179
come you know basically in contact with

1040
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:14,980
with the plant so I just wanted to

1041
00:43:13,179 --> 00:43:17,289
mention that we're still a long way away

1042
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:18,820
in the research community you know

1043
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:21,340
publicly funded research community from

1044
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:23,110
being able to ask these you know ask

1045
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:24,220
these relevant relevant questions so

1046
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:26,320
it's really going to depend I think on

1047
00:43:24,219 --> 00:43:29,109
partnerships with industry at least for

1048
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,519
the foreseeable future to to get these

1049
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:34,930
these data that are that are so

1050
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:38,409
important so this is a question directed

1051
00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:41,409
to you Ted I think that I heard you say

1052
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:44,529
that there's not regulation on wells for

1053
00:43:41,409 --> 00:43:46,269
farms and I'm just sort of surprised

1054
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:48,000
about that there's not a regulation on

1055
00:43:46,269 --> 00:43:49,780
the number of wells or how deep they go

1056
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,480
could you speak a little bit more to

1057
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:58,690
that if I'm yeah yeah so this is yeah

1058
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:01,360
one of the fascinating aspects of

1059
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:05,079
California water management and water

1060
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:07,480
law and that we have you know this this

1061
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:08,860
this strong distinction between the way

1062
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:13,360
that we regulate surface water and

1063
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:15,690
regulate groundwater and only surface

1064
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,860
water is really under the purview of

1065
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:20,950
regulation under this about the state by

1066
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:22,510
the state water board and you know

1067
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:26,559
groundwater historically has been

1068
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:29,230
entirely unregulated there has been some

1069
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:31,150
recent policy changes there's a law

1070
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:32,079
passed during that hide the last drought

1071
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:34,180
called the stand well groundwater

1072
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,029
management act that did bring some

1073
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:39,429
groundwater into into regulation in the

1074
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:44,320
in the water policy there there is a

1075
00:44:39,429 --> 00:44:46,659
provision that if it could if it can be

1076
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:49,300
shown that you know groundwater wells

1077
00:44:46,659 --> 00:44:53,079
are sort of hydrologically connected to

1078
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:54,820
surface water then they can be sort of

1079
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:56,679
considered to be under the authority or

1080
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,870
jurisdiction of the of the of the state

1081
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:00,419
but that generally you know there's not

1082
00:44:58,869 --> 00:45:03,219
only any evidence that the state is

1083
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,570
hungry to exercise that that

1084
00:45:03,219 --> 00:45:08,109
jurisdiction at this point

1085
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:14,590
there's really trying to to tackle the

1086
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:17,260
the the surface water issue so all right

1087
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:22,510
I think we're do you wanted one okay all

1088
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:25,030
right here I I've been a little bit

1089
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:27,970
concerned with the whole format of how

1090
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:32,019
this is being presented and let me give

1091
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:35,309
you an example the terminologies of

1092
00:45:32,019 --> 00:45:37,599
consumption or use of water seems to be

1093
00:45:35,309 --> 00:45:40,630
interchangeable as far as it's been used

1094
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,389
here and that's decidedly not the case

1095
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:47,110
now let me give you a very clear example

1096
00:45:43,389 --> 00:45:48,549
if you had an old time middle operation

1097
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:50,590
that had a water wheel and he's

1098
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:53,200
diverting a stream over his wheel and

1099
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:56,320
that's where he's getting his power - is

1100
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:59,559
he using water well I guess he is but

1101
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:04,000
he's not consuming water and I think

1102
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:06,940
generally the idea is is that if you are

1103
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,909
able to return the water in the same

1104
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:14,200
quality that you took it in then it's

1105
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:16,389
not consumed so the real question I

1106
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:17,919
think usually is how much what are you

1107
00:46:16,389 --> 00:46:21,190
consuming not how much water you're

1108
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:25,050
using now in plants the obvious thing is

1109
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:29,860
that they consume very little the the

1110
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:31,480
they use a lot for transpiration and the

1111
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:34,570
question is is what's the significance

1112
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:37,659
of that transpiration as far as water

1113
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:40,750
use versus water consumption and that

1114
00:46:37,659 --> 00:46:43,539
gets integrated back into your climate

1115
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:46,690
control your dehumidification whether

1116
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:49,150
your reutilizing that water whether it's

1117
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:51,599
in some way being contaminated or

1118
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:54,940
something like that and until we get

1119
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:57,489
more precise use of words and

1120
00:46:54,940 --> 00:47:03,280
definitions I think the data will not

1121
00:46:57,489 --> 00:47:04,959
have much significance that's a great

1122
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,790
point and I completely agree there's an

1123
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,039
important distinction between applied

1124
00:47:06,789 --> 00:47:11,380
water and consumptive use of plants I

1125
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,360
think in a lot of agricultural crops

1126
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:15,010
there is a substantial fraction of water

1127
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,690
that's applied to the crops that is not

1128
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:18,610
lost through about the transpiration and

1129
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:20,860
that could potentially return

1130
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:24,250
to the environment with respect to

1131
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:26,140
outdoor cannabis cultivation the the

1132
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:28,090
practices that we've seen has primarily

1133
00:47:26,139 --> 00:47:30,759
been very high efficiency drip

1134
00:47:28,090 --> 00:47:32,800
irrigation is sort of the is that is the

1135
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,740
standard where we don't really see any

1136
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:39,039
evidence of you know sort of substantial

1137
00:47:35,739 --> 00:47:41,469
return flows or you know not much of

1138
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:43,119
that water you know is is is ending up

1139
00:47:41,469 --> 00:47:46,659
back and back in the environment at

1140
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,679
least not to you know not in any way

1141
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:49,869
that we could actually measure and

1142
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:51,579
detect a response and say the stream

1143
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:53,619
from which these these waters are being

1144
00:47:51,579 --> 00:47:55,690
are being drawn so I totally agree there

1145
00:47:53,619 --> 00:47:57,639
is a need to get to bring sort of more

1146
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:59,559
refinement and nuance to our

1147
00:47:57,639 --> 00:48:03,339
understanding of crop water water

1148
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:05,049
consumptive use and those those dynamics

1149
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:07,900
we're not we're not there yet

1150
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:10,150
but I would say for cannabis at least

1151
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:13,630
from our experience and outdoor grows we

1152
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:16,300
have I think looking at applied water is

1153
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:19,869
