1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,140
and now just wanting to touch on ethics

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:13,798
of extraction and sitting right next to

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:15,539
me we have Gil and Brandon and Frenchie

4
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:18,600
yeah he'll be back he'll be back it's

5
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:22,500
okay I'm gonna pass over the microphone

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:27,210
to you here okay that's great and and

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:32,909
both of you all grow as well as do

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:34,890
extraction and and also are very active

9
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:38,099
in the regenerative community so can you

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:42,620
put those together to us why it's

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:48,570
important one with the other yeah

12
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:52,159
definitely for sure yeah we wanted to

13
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:56,698
talk about like how regenerative

14
00:00:52,159 --> 00:01:00,269
cannabis and farming ties into what hash

15
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:01,558
is all about and yes so we can kind of

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,760
like start it off maybe with like a

17
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:05,459
little bit of thinking how mother nature

18
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:07,500
kind of does it all without any of us

19
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,929
interrupting it and the plant falls

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,049
right back down to where it was once

21
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,570
grown right so I kind of always thought

22
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:19,110
that that's really important into

23
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:22,048
sustainability and creating a farm and

24
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:25,530
fertility and all this so when we farm

25
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,700
the hash that's what we're yeah that's

26
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,579
what we're farming so we're not really

27
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:32,790
farming for the flowers and that means

28
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:34,559
that as much as the biomass gets put

29
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,159
back down I mean it's it's amazing for

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,750
next year

31
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:44,430
so we put 99% of it back now and I think

32
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:46,349
that's a big part of the sustainability

33
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,090
in this small farm that can keep it

34
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:51,118
going type of thing because it's

35
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:55,490
definitely cost-effective and all those

36
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:59,629
things come into play and you know so

37
00:01:55,489 --> 00:02:03,269
tying that into kind of like the whole

38
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:06,640
thing is like

39
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:11,289
it just keeps the flow going I think for

40
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:13,270
a small farm you know it's hard to do

41
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:15,789
all these and with the regulations and

42
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,530
stuff so I don't know it doesn't really

43
00:02:15,789 --> 00:02:18,129
apply to everyone that they can really

44
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,469
do this

45
00:02:18,129 --> 00:02:22,240
I know but that's just how we do it and

46
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:24,699
and we this you know we have the love

47
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:27,750
for hash like that so we don't really do

48
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:33,280
much and so it's a small scale thing

49
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:35,020
right yeah for sure yeah sorry I'm

50
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,909
struggling with things to say after like

51
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,290
just all the real professional people

52
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:40,289
that have licked talk today you know

53
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:45,009
over there and all that so it's just I

54
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:47,739
don't know I'm just a kind of a simple

55
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:49,659
guy but I do work with canvas physically

56
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:52,930
like most days of the week that's for

57
00:02:49,659 --> 00:02:54,819
sure so uh but solving lists is really

58
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,709
popular right now I don't know if people

59
00:02:54,819 --> 00:03:00,729
know that but or what state you're in

60
00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:03,640
I'm in California and Trinity County and

61
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:06,340
I feel like California it's kind of

62
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:08,349
often said cannabis trends whether you

63
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,229
want to talk about legally or socially

64
00:03:08,349 --> 00:03:14,969
or whatever but people talk about

65
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:17,500
adaptability as important currently and

66
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:20,979
that's what led me to solve and this is

67
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:23,110
just following Gandhian

68
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:24,969
seeing where it took me and I was just

69
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,860
trying to see what I really enjoyed

70
00:03:24,969 --> 00:03:30,219
about it and what I didn't enjoy about

71
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:33,220
it and growing flower I'm sure you can

72
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:37,539
all understand like spend all this time

73
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:40,000
growing it and then drying it and

74
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:41,620
processing it as an art unto itself you

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,009
know just literally keeping that thing

76
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,989
so pristine I would lose sleep over it

77
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:50,439
you know what I mean making sure my dry

78
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:52,629
room was perfect and making sure my

79
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:56,549
trimmers weren't just like destroying

80
00:03:52,629 --> 00:03:56,549
the weed you know what I mean

81
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:01,500
feeling pressures to use trim machines

82
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,960
all that over the years you know I've

83
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,250
done I've worked for other people I

84
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,310
farmed I've done a lot of different

85
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,770
situations on small-scale large-scale

86
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,900
but uh yeah personally for me that was

87
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,659
just stressful dealing with the actual

88
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,298
flower the longevity of it you know

89
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:25,110
sometimes you're forced to hold on to

90
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:26,969
product rapidly and some strains you

91
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,639
know it happens faster than others and I

92
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,610
think that's hard to say whether or not

93
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:35,029
that's gonna happen to you know before

94
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,770
you grow it you don't know so I think

95
00:04:35,029 --> 00:04:40,459
totally all that that we preserve it

96
00:04:37,769 --> 00:04:42,449
yeah and kind of like isolate that and

97
00:04:40,459 --> 00:04:44,609
almost kind of think about it as like a

98
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:46,949
wine like we preserved it and aged that

99
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,810
year and it could even get better or

100
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:51,329
worse I mean it all depends but it's

101
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,780
definitely like capitalizing the year

102
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:57,870
and not letting it get worse innocence I

103
00:04:54,779 --> 00:05:00,239
don't know and then yeah like we appeal

104
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,730
to that market and that market like ask

105
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,129
for it so we kind of like adjusted I

106
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,470
feel like to that thing and it's uh

107
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:10,350
we're constantly teaching them I feel

108
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,850
like to like it's a it's a huge like why

109
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:17,400
you should be enjoying hash over

110
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:19,770
anything else and man that's a struggle

111
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:21,989
I feel like because so many people just

112
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:23,219
have you know they're all they know

113
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,960
everything everyone knows everything

114
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,400
already so it's kind of like you know

115
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:31,168
nobody wants to hear it

116
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,639
Davis some some people don't but yeah I

117
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:36,199
think that's a I think that's a big part

118
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:39,750
of why what we do what we do and you

119
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:41,509
know really push on to not ingesting

120
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,279
chemicals because we really just like

121
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:47,009
care a lot about everyone and that's

122
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:50,969
like why we do and make what we make it

123
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:52,740
push out for the next person to find the

124
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,229
health in the cannabis you know so we

125
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,569
really grow it healthy and then make it

126
00:05:55,228 --> 00:06:00,659
healthy and then it's like the highest

127
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:03,029
purity product that the plant can make I

128
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,199
feel like without any of the chemicals

129
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,638
of machinery

130
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,949
all the trades make sense just on

131
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,050
therapeutic level to me it's like you're

132
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:14,098
really meant like trying to use cannabis

133
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:16,468
or medicine to me sitting there and just

134
00:06:14,098 --> 00:06:17,998
smoking flour and flour flour flour it's

135
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:20,158
hard to medicate where someone could

136
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:21,749
just take a small concentrated dab you

137
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:24,060
know and I mean I think it will always

138
00:06:21,749 --> 00:06:27,028
go on value in a medical market where I

139
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,288
think that will inhaling for all the

140
00:06:27,028 --> 00:06:30,478
times that we do out there I mean it's

141
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:33,089
not gonna be that good for us I feel

142
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:36,810
like we all know that but vaporizing

143
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:39,448
oils is like tremendously better so you

144
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:43,019
know I think that's a big part of it to

145
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:44,639
which we still like have to all kind of

146
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:45,810
grasp and we all love smoking joints I

147
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,629
don't think we're gonna stop that right

148
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:53,939
that's not gonna happen so but then

149
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:55,560
there was I guess the other half was we

150
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:58,650
wanted to talk about kind of finding

151
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,449
these hash plants because not every

152
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:02,668
plant of the cannabis plant is the hash

153
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:05,189
plant and the word hash plant is kind of

154
00:07:02,668 --> 00:07:08,430
big I feel like so I kind of want to

155
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:13,229
like maybe touch on the word hash plant

156
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:16,228
and kind of put maybe it know do you

157
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:29,338
think it's I want to hear what you got

158
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:33,748
to say so I mean there is as much

159
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:37,740
difference in a cannabis regime as there

160
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:41,278
is in a flower the world plant adapt to

161
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:46,199
an abbot at but the wall plant adapt and

162
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:49,588
its defensive system even more so so if

163
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:54,749
you have a tropical plant with a lot of

164
00:07:49,588 --> 00:07:59,699
insect life super green it has to

165
00:07:54,749 --> 00:08:02,520
produce a resin that is really sticky

166
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:04,560
and protective if you take that plant

167
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:07,228
and you put it into the in Dooku's

168
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,959
mountain where it's there is no insect

169
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:13,800
life because life is only well there is

170
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:16,229
water it's super dusty that resin

171
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,889
which is Tiki is going to be covered in

172
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:22,740
dust and it's not gonna work anymore so

173
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:26,899
the more the plant created the moment

174
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:30,449
seeker to protect to to have less

175
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:33,809
excitation of of resin to protect itself

176
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:35,929
and you can recognize genetic just by

177
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:39,929
the regime I can even recognize

178
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:42,418
Parenthood like lining edge in the

179
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:46,639
breeding just by looking at the reason

180
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:50,899
it just because your culture is flower

181
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:54,149
my culture is a sheesh and

182
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:55,860
no you don't have the ice culture here

183
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:59,069
who I wanted to tell you you may have

184
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:03,840
you have the consulted killed you that

185
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:07,050
is copying the BHO industry it's vastly

186
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,720
different you know what I mean

187
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:12,089
well yeah yeah I do know you mean for

188
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,910
everyone to join it but I think it like

189
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:17,310
what I wanted to say and and touches so

190
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:18,990
like the texture of the resin like you

191
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:22,639
said you can't take an equator type of

192
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:25,589
plant and bring it to the mountains but

193
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,449
like we taught are we talking about the

194
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:29,550
mountain plants so they should we kind

195
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,920
of like fall into detail of what type of

196
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:34,409
resident are we talking because I feel

197
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,029
like there are residents that are closer

198
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:38,279
to the equator that fall into you know

199
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:40,019
you touch them they're oily right and I

200
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,360
think they fall into like the tincture

201
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,199
category what we make tinctures out of

202
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,649
the ones that are more like

203
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,000
water-soluble terpene like resident

204
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:50,600
plants do you find that it's like you

205
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,600
know what I'm talking about

206
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,940
that you are spraying your plant like

207
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:59,610
there is no tomorrow and wife the plant

208
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:03,930
can be nourished with the leaf it's not

209
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,820
made foods who the live and that you

210
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:08,789
play with your raised in a door so it's

211
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:12,030
like I don't know you go flower you

212
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:15,929
don't go hey Xion concentrate it's a new

213
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:20,309
game for you and it it has blown the

214
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:24,120
market away concentrate is the next big

215
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:26,289
seems in E and you see here in America

216
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,379
but you live in an island or

217
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:32,289
the rest of the world is smoking Ashish

218
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:35,139
is smoking solvent less and that your

219
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:39,668
market of tomorrow the market here in

220
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:43,209
America it's an extract market when when

221
00:10:39,668 --> 00:10:46,749
you do what I do I collect a raise in

222
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:48,969
IDI I crush it into a mass there is a

223
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:51,459
chemical reaction that I'd turn into

224
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:54,819
that mass and that mass when it's older

225
00:10:51,458 --> 00:11:03,159
it's greater than what the plant gave me

226
00:10:54,818 --> 00:11:06,009
I'm like a winemaker and that process in

227
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:09,578
the world alcohol and you see wine it's

228
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:11,829
unique because if you take the juice

229
00:11:09,578 --> 00:11:15,758
from the grape you can make many alcohol

230
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:18,488
SKU distillation but to make wine you

231
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,438
need everything harsh together to have

232
00:11:18,489 --> 00:11:22,959
that chemical reaction happening and

233
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:24,788
making that transformation so it's

234
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:27,458
something that is unique and cannot

235
00:11:24,788 --> 00:11:31,178
compete compared to any other extract

236
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:34,988
hear you use the word ash for everything

237
00:11:31,178 --> 00:11:37,028
that is a concentrate so already when

238
00:11:34,989 --> 00:11:39,548
you go in Europe and you save the world

239
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:42,038
ash and you mean an extract you're gonna

240
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:44,438
have to say American ash like you say

241
00:11:42,038 --> 00:11:48,009
for Amit for football because we don't

242
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:52,418
speak the same language ask for us it's

243
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:55,600
millinium of culture it's very very very

244
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:59,198
dear and you just cannot appropriate a

245
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,259
world and use it for amazing projects

246
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:05,128
but who have nothing to do with us you

247
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:05,129
know what I mean is I

248
00:12:13,778 --> 00:12:19,879
because because the world market is

249
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:22,520
coming and if we need if you want to

250
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:24,919
have an exchange between country we're

251
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:27,799
gonna need to speak the same language so

252
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:31,729
you cannot appropriate word that I've

253
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:36,459
millinium of culture - just because you

254
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:40,220
can yes you can but the value of it is

255
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:41,960
is what you know what I mean is like if

256
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,480
you really want to be all of that and

257
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:48,230
what other language that is meaningful

258
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:51,230
in a world trade well you need first to

259
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:54,159
respect tradition and an traditional

260
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:57,139
culture and then we need to be able to

261
00:12:54,159 --> 00:13:01,309
to describe the type and profile of the

262
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:04,159
of a flower of the us take personally I

263
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:07,939
need I would need a wine maker that is a

264
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:11,329
smoker to get deep enough into a tapping

265
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:13,910
profile to to describe it because I go

266
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:18,430
maybe two three four level but you can

267
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:21,620
go twelve fifteen so it's like that

268
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:24,799
wine became popular because it's

269
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:28,459
pleasurable well cannabis even more so

270
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:34,338
and this is where we can appeal to the

271
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:37,879
people it's who the palate and here

272
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:41,029
furthermore so the world extracts the

273
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:44,149
world as people the world everything

274
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:48,799
that come after you go the plant

275
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:52,039
it's an appropriation of your walk from

276
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:56,028
it's different because my my education

277
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:59,208
was going into a producing country going

278
00:13:56,028 --> 00:14:01,939
as far away deep into the producing

279
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:04,309
place to stay with the local to make my

280
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:09,430
own ass because I'm smoking only the

281
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:09,429
best and it's not for sale

282
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:18,440
when when you can when you can do that

283
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:25,049
there is so much you can do by yourself

284
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:28,230
when you create that entity in in those

285
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:31,588
places it has never been me making us

286
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:36,870
that makes us quality people wanted to

287
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:39,810
know where I want to to define the

288
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,649
quality I have so when I came here in

289
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:43,588
America

290
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:47,399
all those producing country the quality

291
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:50,820
of my ass was the lawn the climate and

292
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:53,100
the crucifer and it's long race when I

293
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:57,180
came here in the Emerald triangle

294
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:59,278
I had the lawn the climate the genetic

295
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:01,649
but behind the genetic that is afar

296
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,350
there is a breeder and then there is

297
00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:07,440
actually a farmer here in producing

298
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:11,540
don't even when it's cultivated it's not

299
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:15,089
farming it's just to achieve ated so i

300
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:17,879
became like a winemaker I worked with

301
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:22,320
specific cultivar that I liked specially

302
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:26,549
and I need Vani out to provide me with

303
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:30,620
what I need to show off on AG and it's

304
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:34,049
not only me it's every extractor

305
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:37,169
everybody's that touch your plant should

306
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:41,399
give you credit because everything I am

307
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:44,219
I owe it to what was given to me here

308
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:47,039
and the same when I was in producing

309
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:51,839
country the problem is like you sell

310
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:55,198
yourself cheap while the value of making

311
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,949
a project in a metal triangle give you a

312
00:15:55,198 --> 00:16:02,370
word opening because you recognized

313
00:15:58,948 --> 00:16:03,269
worldwide for your quality and I love

314
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,120
you to death

315
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:08,610
but if you didn't deliver what I can

316
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,370
receive here I'm not sure I would go

317
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:13,230
through the old shit I'm going trying to

318
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,198
work with big money people and shit like

319
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:19,019
that guys you know what I mean it's like

320
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:22,289
there is something that is so unique

321
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:23,789
that you could become the Bordeaux and

322
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:25,490
the phones of the cannabis

323
00:16:23,789 --> 00:16:29,009
because there is nowhere on the planet

324
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:31,230
where there is a generation of people

325
00:16:29,009 --> 00:16:34,019
that had been growing genetic and the

326
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:37,710
genetic adapted so well you have the

327
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:39,569
diversity and you have an Easter with it

328
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:43,460
and on top of it you have a lot of story

329
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:47,730
to make it palatable to a market where

330
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:50,730
it's nice now to have to deal with out

331
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:53,700
loud and and people like that but when

332
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:56,879
you go genetic you give me purple pants

333
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:59,940
guys it's like I can get purple punch

334
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,980
from anybody from you I want the stuff

335
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,680
from Covello I want the stuff that you

336
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,289
keep in your in your cupboard stuff that

337
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:11,220
I'm the only one to put on the market

338
00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:13,589
and you have the only one to go because

339
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,559
when you compete with the same genetic

340
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:19,049
with the indoor already your son gone

341
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,119
you have a handicap and then you're

342
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:24,089
walking with the same genetics and those

343
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:28,069
people it's like he doesn't even make

344
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:32,250
any sense you're following fashion and

345
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:34,829
when you follow a fashion you are behind

346
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:37,230
you need to bloody create the fashion

347
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:41,609
and you have a hell of a lot of genetic

348
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:44,160
to do it it's just like I don't know you

349
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:47,689
don't know your value it's crazy to see

350
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:52,410
everything you have and you don't use it

351
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:55,830
it's like you should own your genetic if

352
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:58,350
any extractor touch your stuff even if

353
00:17:55,829 --> 00:18:00,929
it goes in the web pan when you buy with

354
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:04,529
a pen and I know that the guy has been

355
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:07,560
hunting is genetic in in a mile triangle

356
00:18:04,529 --> 00:18:09,690
well I may look at it if I know that the

357
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:11,250
guy is doing the shit at in Salinas I

358
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:13,500
wouldn't be interested that we don't

359
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:16,019
even look at it it's like you have that

360
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,599
value but when you sell a product not

361
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:20,879
only it's under priced but on top of it

362
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:26,250
you don't get the credit for it it's

363
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:29,370
like yo you know what I mean is like we

364
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:32,700
owe you everything doesn't matter how

365
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:35,869
big I am I owe it to my farmer

366
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,798
it's like that quality that I get a

367
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:43,849
because you gave it to me and it's like

368
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:47,329
it's important to remember that and to

369
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:49,819
own it to own your name to own the

370
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:52,189
genetics that you breathe because that

371
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:54,859
what makes you so different and that

372
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:57,140
what you have a world reputation for

373
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:59,629
quality there is not that many place in

374
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,820
the world that have a world reputation

375
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:04,580
for quality I know another one

376
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:06,798
it's a remote valley in the mountain of

377
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:11,000
the Himalaya where I spent seven season

378
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:18,259
making chalice so if you don't use this

379
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:20,269
as a as a mean to create everything you

380
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:22,519
don't believe in yourself how can you

381
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:25,099
have people believing in you you don't

382
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:26,839
ask for shit you need vandalism

383
00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:31,219
they're not gonna give it to you I'm

384
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:33,829
special because of my education and how

385
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,899
I came into the business and and my

386
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:38,599
future is always the origin of the

387
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:40,579
products that really counts is like if

388
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:42,589
the least qualities because it come from

389
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:46,759
somewhere and that somewhere is very

390
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:49,879
special you have that very special place

391
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:52,460
and you this is a brand your brand is in

392
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:55,070
healthy angle because you'll known

393
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:57,019
worldwide sun-grown you have a lot of

394
00:19:55,069 --> 00:20:00,168
sanguine and I've said I've had someone

395
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:02,538
in many producing country well the

396
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:08,179
sanguinary multi-angle it's not quite

397
00:20:02,538 --> 00:20:11,240
the same than anywhere on the planet and

398
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:14,809
I was just thinking what ties into that

399
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:18,620
too is talking about extracting resin

400
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:22,730
from plant and in certain zones and

401
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:27,648
areas you know it's meaningful that that

402
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:30,500
resin is is telling a story of the area

403
00:20:27,648 --> 00:20:34,038
that it's grown in or maybe a story of

404
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:37,640
the environment or a story of of the

405
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:40,339
soil so you know that you all are

406
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:44,538
noticing a difference between indoor

407
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:47,808
resin and imaging is that vision Edie

408
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:49,400
it's a defensive system of the plant

409
00:20:47,808 --> 00:20:52,339
it's a BB

410
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,980
rafi of its life and its own villain

411
00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:57,559
Matt it's like the world story of the

412
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:59,839
plant is inside that resonate if you

413
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:02,779
know how to read it is that the

414
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:04,669
connection between the ash maker and the

415
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:06,889
thermal it's really important because I

416
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:10,630
can tell you stuff that you don't know

417
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:14,870
about when you've a breeder a summer and

418
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:18,290
ash maker like min Jean for example then

419
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:23,709
you have you have the knowledge of or

420
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:23,710
Zeus aspect of the of the plants and

421
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:33,139
maybe I was rescued Brandon and and you

422
00:21:30,349 --> 00:21:35,539
know when you're growing and how are you

423
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:38,960
how are you searching for plants you

424
00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:44,389
know we we appreciate you know that

425
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:47,029
knowledge the last couple years I've

426
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:48,830
been breeding for the certain type of

427
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:51,829
resin that is easier to work with with

428
00:21:48,829 --> 00:21:54,139
water ash for simpler reasons because we

429
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:57,829
all use water hash mostly here in

430
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:01,070
America right but that's kind of like

431
00:21:57,829 --> 00:22:03,319
what is that easier head and that's kind

432
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:07,460
of what I was going to say before was

433
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:09,230
this every plant has a different texture

434
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,490
to it you know a different Turkey and a

435
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:13,730
different smell and it carries a

436
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:17,750
different texture of that resin head of

437
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:20,569
that you know life so what heads what

438
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:22,700
plants are better to use than others

439
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:24,439
because I've had so many people call me

440
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:28,340
and tell me and cry to me that they're

441
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,990
losing yields or hash or plant they

442
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:32,209
could have just sold it as pounds but

443
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:33,940
they chose the fresh frozen and then

444
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:36,940
they get nothing in return

445
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,940
right

446
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:44,309
so that you use and the the world

447
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,430
environment you use it's like it's not

448
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:49,589
only he's a plant it's no precious make

449
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:51,840
sure but lets you get your environment

450
00:22:49,589 --> 00:22:52,859
right you get everything else right then

451
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,139
it's up to the plant

452
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:57,149
I've been I you know I've got it up on

453
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,820
my farm we're all we're dialed in up

454
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:01,620
there right we do it right and and I've

455
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:03,210
seen you know hundreds of different

456
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:07,109
residents passed by my I've been washing

457
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:09,509
hash for eight years and growing for

458
00:23:07,109 --> 00:23:12,240
fifteen almost so it's been a long

459
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:15,869
journey I think for my short life and

460
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,789
I've just been full-blown dedicated I've

461
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:19,469
got the blinders on I don't see anything

462
00:23:17,789 --> 00:23:21,529
else that's why I didn't go legal I

463
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:24,390
didn't do this or that I don't care to

464
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:27,029
even spread myself out thin too much to

465
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:31,410
try to help out it like I focused on

466
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:34,019
this exact purpose and you know what at

467
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:35,610
least what only I could see me I haven't

468
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:37,740
went to the other countries I haven't

469
00:23:35,609 --> 00:23:39,269
seen that type of resin of court I've

470
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,250
talked to some people we went to this

471
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:44,579
you know only to that extent of talking

472
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:47,279
but the hash that I'm looking for is

473
00:23:44,579 --> 00:23:49,470
what I guess what America now is aiming

474
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,480
as what they're calling water hash ice

475
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:55,470
water extraction right and all that side

476
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:57,839
of things so I respect the the the

477
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:00,870
culture and the tradition though so much

478
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:02,549
like you know like I mean I want to go

479
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:04,589
to Indy I want to go to all these other

480
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:07,289
places I want to go and give thanks and

481
00:24:04,589 --> 00:24:11,730
like just do whatever volunteer make a

482
00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:14,670
freakin kilos for them you know so I I

483
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:17,819
feel that but then you know here we are

484
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:20,070
modernized we're 2019 about to be 2020

485
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:22,740
catch up with times a little bit as much

486
00:24:20,069 --> 00:24:26,939
as I want to go backwards but here we

487
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:28,859
are and this ice water extraction when

488
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,090
you have everything dialed in or like

489
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:32,089
spice water separation

490
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:37,170
what is that head what is that resident

491
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:39,029
what is that texture so I've been down

492
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:40,620
the road I've seen the oily ones I like

493
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:41,910
to use those for tincture but we're not

494
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:44,689
here to talk about that as much as we

495
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:48,779
like to talk about the solvent less hash

496
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,769
so like I find it to be those fat but

497
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:52,200
like granule

498
00:24:49,769 --> 00:25:00,119
Sandee heads right okay so we can agree

499
00:24:52,200 --> 00:25:03,769
on it and that is right easy to do with

500
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:07,279
water right and I so is thank you so dry

501
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:11,670
you know try sieving as well it's nice

502
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:14,849
for me some you are you were born in

503
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:20,400
diversity guys I was born I had six

504
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:23,308
flavor okay so for me it's every plant

505
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,000
and more like a time every plant is

506
00:25:23,308 --> 00:25:27,690
precious

507
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,019
it doesn't filter or difficult now I

508
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:33,029
just want to talk about me easiest know

509
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:35,609
though for a lot of people in here like

510
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:37,170
I said I got you know messages of people

511
00:25:35,609 --> 00:25:39,329
crying and you know and I don't want to

512
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:41,308
be that guy always trying to explain I

513
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:43,799
you know here this is the time if you

514
00:25:41,308 --> 00:25:45,149
like to talk about the easiest one let's

515
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:47,220
talk about the easy that might even put

516
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:49,259
it on a whole tier level where these

517
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,700
terpenes and these hashes get sold at a

518
00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:53,369
lower price because they're you know

519
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,890
super freakin easy to make you know then

520
00:25:53,369 --> 00:26:08,909
there's these harder ones the lower yes

521
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:10,950
maybe and being relevant in the market

522
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:14,040
is having diversity and there's a huge

523
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:16,740
want for a specific kind of hash and

524
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:21,329
there's also like a really beautiful

525
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:24,240
niche market for you know hand-rolled

526
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:26,149
traditional hashish making and i think

527
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,150
that it's important that we talk about

528
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:31,200
both both entities and and that's sort

529
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:34,730
of what we're talking about here and

530
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,730
respect them both and that's great

531
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:43,410
everybody smoked ass guys you know you

532
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:48,449
live on an island like the rest of the

533
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:51,929
world we smoked us and as for flour we

534
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:55,529
have an edge we are making quality and I

535
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:58,129
can even make quality in quantity so

536
00:26:55,529 --> 00:27:02,069
it's like you have the gene

537
00:26:58,128 --> 00:27:04,319
we have the technology to make the best

538
00:27:02,069 --> 00:27:07,079
I fish in the world is like all the

539
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:10,528
people that teach me that I lived in the

540
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:14,128
found form for months years after year

541
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:18,720
they all drooling on my IGN asking me to

542
00:27:14,128 --> 00:27:28,798
go back what I did which I will so it's

543
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:32,429
like you decide to produce you will if

544
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:35,158
you decide to produce only quantity you

545
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:39,440
will not develop that in the next year's

546
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:42,509
when what trade is coming because the

547
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,700
producing country from the moment the

548
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:47,220
news I can sell anything on a market

549
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,620
it's illegal but they know what we are

550
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:52,019
doing and they really knows that the

551
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:54,479
next few the future of the market it's

552
00:27:52,019 --> 00:27:56,730
making quality that's why they want to

553
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:03,019
learn that why they want a new tool and

554
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:06,628
stuff like that and we should be is that

555
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:10,200
next you know valves that define

556
00:28:06,628 --> 00:28:13,138
qualities like there is completely world

557
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:19,230
country that could decide to produce

558
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:22,558
only quality for the LED is doing it is

559
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:26,360
I you can dedicate yourself only to

560
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:32,269
quality and have an edge because nobody

561
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:32,269
care enough to do it we do

562
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,060
the regenerative like the science of

563
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:42,209
organic regenerative conference up in BC

564
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:44,369
in January I think it was Marcus man who

565
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,950
you know at scale is do it and you know

566
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:48,329
yeah so he had a technique and I forget

567
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,650
if it was him or somebody else or if

568
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:50,970
y'all are in the audience that just

569
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:53,130
wanted to bring it up as its are all of

570
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,569
it feels like a field test for plants

571
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,180
where it was like hey I'm gonna put this

572
00:28:54,569 --> 00:28:59,939
in a jar with some I you know it anymore

573
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:01,110
like see ya kid what's that can you guys

574
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,910
share that because I think that's

575
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:08,699
relevant to a lot of what your tried to

576
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:10,380
share too and I get people kind of

577
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,450
crying I mean this is also that I want

578
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:15,780
to kind of like what you were finishing

579
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:20,130
saying no like I don't know it's it's

580
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:23,789
just pure level of like life with this

581
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:25,920
like hash is really meaningful I feel

582
00:29:23,789 --> 00:29:29,250
like we have to get that like statement

583
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:32,070
across but but anyway yeah the jar tech

584
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:35,009
sorry it's just like you throw some

585
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:36,299
fresh frozen your nugs in a jar and

586
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:40,099
shake it with ice water and it's pretty

587
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:43,079
much like an ice water you know little

588
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:45,629
mini wash yeah so you can kind of see

589
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:47,730
what sits at the bottom of the jar which

590
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:49,410
is like great for field tests yeah I

591
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:52,319
mean so you can know whether or not you

592
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:54,060
should freeze that plant or not because

593
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:55,799
a lot of people yeah kind of jumped the

594
00:29:54,059 --> 00:30:16,169
gun and totally shoot themselves in the

595
00:29:55,799 --> 00:30:21,740
foot and lose a lot of product because

596
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:24,630
you look there is in heed to judge the

597
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:26,880
flowering cycle of the plant the

598
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:30,030
flowering cycle of the plant is a main

599
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:33,720
metabolism of the plant so hazing a de

600
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:36,720
Segundo he metabolize the plant produces

601
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,329
to protect itself it has nothing to do

602
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,539
with the main metabolize of the plant

603
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:45,839
the amount of the ray of resin formed

604
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:48,450
inside the resonate is totally dependent

605
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,819
on the peak of the flowering cycle

606
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:53,308
but since you cannot look inside there

607
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:56,128
is in head to see how much reason there

608
00:30:53,308 --> 00:30:57,960
is it's not the color and it's not the

609
00:30:56,128 --> 00:31:01,439
size that gonna tell you if your flower

610
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:04,259
is is ripe or not it's you look at the

611
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,808
flower when you go tomato or any other

612
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:08,579
project you don't look at the secondary

613
00:31:06,808 --> 00:31:11,388
metabolites you don't you know what I

614
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:13,918
mean it's like you look at the flower so

615
00:31:11,388 --> 00:31:16,048
for me as a ash maker

616
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,919
I really need to observe a scene ed

617
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:22,470
bursting like food from a tree it has to

618
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:26,820
be really really full of jewels and

619
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:29,999
sugar and there is a CDS window for that

620
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:32,548
and there is not that many people who

621
00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:35,700
give me in that CDA's window when I walk

622
00:31:32,548 --> 00:31:37,589
with a greenhouse everybody telling me

623
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,558
oh yeah we are versed in time so many

624
00:31:37,589 --> 00:31:42,178
others do you do a year five six okay I

625
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:45,808
walk on it which people would you fall

626
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:49,038
because I cannot have a premature plant

627
00:31:45,808 --> 00:31:52,950
and that's something I need to ask you I

628
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:56,388
can I can literally tell you to the day

629
00:31:52,950 --> 00:32:01,169
how early or outlet you are obviously

630
00:31:56,388 --> 00:32:04,199
okay and two weeks early I cannot you

631
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:08,129
cannot flower that test that 28 books on

632
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:13,429
THC and I have added like the greater

633
00:32:08,128 --> 00:32:16,918
sugar trim from that I got a shitload of

634
00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:19,409
like on earth like on ground but it's so

635
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:22,288
light that you saw it in the air he

636
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:25,200
doesn't fall that means that you can

637
00:32:22,288 --> 00:32:28,230
have canopy no heed and there is no

638
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,830
reason that is still found inside the

639
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:34,649
resin head and the closer you come to

640
00:32:31,829 --> 00:32:39,449
that three days peak window the more

641
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:44,699
reason is inside that resonate and swash

642
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:47,399
who washing my plum 12 time it's like a

643
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:50,220
resonate his neck like a foot there is

644
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:51,959
an obsession under the ground and that

645
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:56,038
abscission becomes smaller and smaller

646
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:58,499
and smaller the riper the the IDI

647
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:01,558
is and then it just fall when it's

648
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:02,049
really high when I learned that my take

649
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:06,129
is

650
00:33:02,049 --> 00:33:08,649
to get the melt I need to shake the tree

651
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:11,140
just a tiny bit I have the high post and

652
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:13,840
then I shake a tiny bit more I have a

653
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:18,730
second dimension of ripeness and I shake

654
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:22,209
my t12 time if my first shake when I put

655
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:26,349
it on the resin edge there is no melt

656
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:31,329
whatsoever you are two weeks minimum too

657
00:33:26,349 --> 00:33:35,639
early if I can if I put that if I use it

658
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:39,369
to press and my first temple bar is like

659
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:43,180
it all together there is no real hug but

660
00:33:39,369 --> 00:33:47,529
like the reason is not using your seven

661
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:50,590
eight days too early and so on and so on

662
00:33:47,529 --> 00:33:53,799
until there is at CDs window where the

663
00:33:50,589 --> 00:34:00,129
twelve ball are just like bursting of

664
00:33:53,799 --> 00:34:02,200
raising the shining that you see on my

665
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:06,790
ig it's not me polishing the temple

666
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:10,179
Birla it's literally oozing from it and

667
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:12,460
then when you pass that window my first

668
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:14,500
or second temple bird egg on the price

669
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:17,710
they're gonna make a temple ball kind of

670
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:20,889
shiny but when you open it it doesn't

671
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:25,750
have that elasticity that straight she

672
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:27,699
takes to it as kind of moist eNOS to do

673
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:31,269
it I know that the plant has been

674
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:34,059
arrested - too late and the more temple

675
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:39,039
ball I have that has that sexier

676
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:41,980
the later you it has been arrested so my

677
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:45,369
question is how come how can you have

678
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:48,668
cannabinoid formed inside the ground

679
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:52,690
without having the reason that old it in

680
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:55,989
its body because that's a fact I have

681
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:59,980
seen I have not been wrong in the next

682
00:34:55,989 --> 00:35:01,989
five past five years on our earlier hour

683
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:05,860
later plant has been harvested so I'm

684
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:11,139
I'm quite sure that this is happening in

685
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:14,588
the raising long but I'm I I can't

686
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:16,598
complain it and III have

687
00:35:14,588 --> 00:35:24,818
time explaining to people that it's

688
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:26,410
happening in the first place I agree

689
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:29,650
with what you've described it's just

690
00:35:26,409 --> 00:35:31,808
kidnap acromion seems to be different in

691
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:36,460
the life cycle of the plant where there

692
00:35:31,809 --> 00:35:40,809
is CBC it seems to be have greater

693
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:44,469
production earlier on and for ecological

694
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:47,759
reasons that I can't explain it will

695
00:35:44,469 --> 00:35:52,690
shift to prefer other cannabinoids

696
00:35:47,759 --> 00:35:55,449
specifically CBD and THC but I mean this

697
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:57,969
is you know if we got a grad student out

698
00:35:55,449 --> 00:36:00,429
there that needs a project this is

699
00:35:57,969 --> 00:36:30,309
another one of those things that ought

700
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:34,440
to be investigated I need to work with

701
00:36:30,309 --> 00:36:40,479
somebody that is not on my literally

702
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:43,420
Green versa so I'm ready to work with

703
00:36:40,478 --> 00:36:47,018
people like that but as long as they

704
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:50,048
grow they play my game is like the

705
00:36:47,018 --> 00:36:52,618
relation I have with you it's pressures

706
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:56,920
at the personal level but at the

707
00:36:52,619 --> 00:37:00,869
business level and unload and one person

708
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:04,329
dependent on you so the trust I have

709
00:37:00,869 --> 00:37:07,420
from you the quality you're giving me

710
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:10,568
because it's me it's something that is

711
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:14,200
more precious than money it's out for me

712
00:37:10,568 --> 00:37:16,960
to work with an auntie Jean that is not

713
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:18,118
gonna support that because if they don't

714
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,849
unfucked

715
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:24,849
you know what I mean and it's very

716
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:27,030
difficult on top of that to be able to

717
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:31,380
support you I need to

718
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:35,690
I need to help you put your flower on

719
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:38,309
the market and I need to help you bond

720
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:40,349
more than your bond that people

721
00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:43,650
understand where it come from

722
00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:45,839
and first its origin it first it to em

723
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:47,820
right the anger and then there is a

724
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:52,410
conte and then there is the thumb into

725
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:55,530
it but if you don't have extract her

726
00:37:52,409 --> 00:38:00,029
with a brand name that use their brand

727
00:37:55,530 --> 00:38:01,290
to promote your farm and the genetic

728
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:03,990
where it comes from

729
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:08,639
it's not good enough literally because

730
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:11,369
we use that and it's not it's not

731
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:14,219
happening in America because it's not

732
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:18,599
part of your culture but it's something

733
00:38:14,219 --> 00:38:22,109
that you should ask for because it makes

734
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:25,739
extract we give more value to the end

735
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:28,579
product and co-promotion is always

736
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:32,729
better than single per single promotion

737
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:34,710
and because there is very few of you

738
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:37,019
that have a license on top of it you

739
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:39,900
have a pretty strong edge you have the

740
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:42,719
fire and there is not so many of you so

741
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:45,230
that's why there is not that many people

742
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:48,359
I can work with to make this and us and

743
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:51,420
in the extractor that is in my position

744
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:54,300
extractor or ash maker is in the same

745
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:58,289
position we are very dependent on you we

746
00:38:54,300 --> 00:39:01,440
all you credit and that credit should be

747
00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:03,539
shown on a fucking packaging not just

748
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,619
blah blah blah it should be on the

749
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:08,820
packaging on the front wizard-like

750
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:10,440
technically speaking my name shouldn't

751
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,650
fucking be on that clear on that box

752
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,389
because there is no winemaker that puts

753
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:17,579
his name on on a wine bottle

754
00:39:15,389 --> 00:39:20,129
they don't fucking care you know what I

755
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:23,190
mean the value of their project it's

756
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:26,010
where it comes from it's not who made

757
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:31,650
the stuff the guy who made the stuff as

758
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:33,810
a as a privileged to be the one that

759
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:36,960
fucking blow you away and that all we

760
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:39,179
technically need it's to to give that

761
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,110
pleasure

762
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:47,460
the emphasis that we put on brand like

763
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:51,210
you need to be able to to walk it to on

764
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:54,480
you oxide using the people that you are

765
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:58,110
buying from you and that need your staff

766
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,900
is like you want my stuff okay I want my

767
00:39:58,110 --> 00:41:05,519
name on your box otherwise you don't

768
00:40:00,900 --> 00:41:08,010
have it and if you and if you keep it

769
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:11,699
longer it will become along the ice it

770
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:14,930
like that plants become the place where

771
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:14,929
we go it becomes a

772
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,829
when they got it yeah and it was really

773
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,329
quick actually that they accept the

774
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:46,460
first fallen and they put it on the

775
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:48,349
first indicator pairs and that maybe

776
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,179
some earlier to see about the next year

777
00:41:48,349 --> 00:41:51,500
and they didn't first call in on the

778
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:53,629
fridge and then a couple generations

779
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:56,420
they had seized that will monetize and

780
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:57,829
grown mountains of Mendocino County so I

781
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:04,880
guess my question is how do we

782
00:41:57,829 --> 00:42:06,560
acknowledge the source but then you

783
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,170
start asking the question what is the

784
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,789
source I mean how far back do we go do

785
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,010
we go about five thousand years just

786
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:15,108
because that was when it was written

787
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:18,440
but because before that five thousand

788
00:42:15,108 --> 00:42:21,289
years nobody wrote you know so do we go

789
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:23,150
back yeah a couple billion years you

790
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:27,550
know that we'd be here now I just think

791
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:27,550
we'd be here now and appreciate you know

792
00:42:35,949 --> 00:42:43,129
because it gives alumnus of long days

793
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:46,068
and the value of this country because

794
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:50,450
for the moment we go in Columbia to go

795
00:42:46,068 --> 00:42:52,579
shit like Depp and stuff like that when

796
00:42:50,449 --> 00:42:55,068
nobody's trying to find out this

797
00:42:52,579 --> 00:42:57,859
phenotype and the beauty that there is

798
00:42:55,068 --> 00:43:00,108
in Colombia every country we grow will

799
00:42:57,858 --> 00:43:02,719
squatter you know man I mean it's like

800
00:43:00,108 --> 00:43:04,608
we do the same shit everywhere we go and

801
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:08,029
there is no respect for the long grass

802
00:43:04,608 --> 00:43:10,940
and agility at least here if we can show

803
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:14,420
that we created something and it became

804
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:17,389
local but there is a respectful for the

805
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:19,670
origin of the of the know it would be a

806
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:22,179
very good stuff because it's something

807
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:26,590
we really need

808
00:43:22,179 --> 00:43:31,119
and uses its beyond beyond being a

809
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:36,309
chicken this is the basic and knowledge

810
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:38,289
amount of of what you made with with

811
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:41,019
what you receive from this country

812
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:45,639
it doesn't change that you have created

813
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:47,829
like beyond dream but you if you give

814
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:50,109
the awareness to the people that

815
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:53,920
everything you created the source is

816
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:58,150
coming from those people then there is

817
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:00,250
not cultural and world understanding on

818
00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:03,670
actually how it all

819
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:05,619
antara look and how it all develop and

820
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:09,639
created what we have to offer now you

821
00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:11,170
know what I mean there is a legal regime

822
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:14,529
for what you're talking about though

823
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:17,409
something called the Nagoya protocol for

824
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:19,840
biodiversity and I don't remember the

825
00:44:17,409 --> 00:44:22,559
whole name for it but the goal was to

826
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:27,579
preserve biodiversity and also to give

827
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:28,869
credit to and even compensation to what

828
00:44:27,579 --> 00:44:31,569
could otherwise be seen as kind of a

829
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:33,069
misappropriation of indigenous plants

830
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:35,080
indigenous medicines and that kind of

831
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:37,510
thing of course it should come as no

832
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:40,239
surprise that the US has not signed on

833
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:42,310
to the Nevada part but in Europe it's a

834
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:44,559
really big deal you have to if you have

835
00:44:42,309 --> 00:44:46,869
a new drug they came from the Amazon

836
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:48,369
rainforest or if you have some folk

837
00:44:46,869 --> 00:44:51,489
medicine that you've adapted and

838
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:53,739
commercialized you have to say you have

839
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:57,299
to demonstrate basically that it's not a

840
00:44:53,739 --> 00:44:57,299
violation of the Nagoya protocol

841
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:12,759
everything look Rd we do a test IP

842
00:45:09,489 --> 00:45:14,589
ginkgo we have to give money back from

843
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:18,540
the profits of that test to China

844
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:21,680
because China is where ginkgo comes from

845
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:24,318
when you have a more cosmopolitan plant

846
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:26,179
canvas there is no one country ownership

847
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:27,949
and this happens with a lot of our

848
00:45:26,179 --> 00:45:29,299
really importantly this notes because

849
00:45:27,949 --> 00:45:32,299
what do you take with you when he moved

850
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:35,089
your food and your medicine and this has

851
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:36,670
happened forever I mean even roses paper

852
00:45:35,088 --> 00:45:39,549
on some of the evolutionary history of

853
00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:42,019
cannabis that we can extract from

854
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:44,210
archaeological thing and you see like

855
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:46,818
this is a plant that's moved rapidly

856
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:49,909
with us and has changed dramatically to

857
00:45:46,818 --> 00:45:51,800
its environment and then being a you

858
00:45:49,909 --> 00:45:53,838
know sitting in the lens of genetics so

859
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:57,950
many of our plants that we use are so

860
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:59,808
evolutionarily like admits that it would

861
00:45:57,949 --> 00:46:03,439
be hard to really place them in any one

862
00:45:59,809 --> 00:46:05,869
region right because we don't keep our

863
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:08,420
Mexican landrace breathing in one little

864
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:10,400
pocket in our plants right in northern

865
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:12,829
India in another pocket we introduce

866
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,680
those plants to each other so it becomes

867
00:46:12,829 --> 00:46:18,440
very different in this environment but

868
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:20,088
there is history there and the truth is

869
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,880
you don't have enough data to even

870
00:46:20,088 --> 00:46:26,568
understand that because we have we don't

871
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,640
have global populations that we can pull

872
00:46:26,568 --> 00:46:30,798
from and you know you need this original

873
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:34,719
global and you can still do that work

874
00:46:30,798 --> 00:46:34,719
but it's very difficult

875
00:46:39,389 --> 00:46:43,629
probably right but we don't have the

876
00:46:41,829 --> 00:46:46,509
resources to really even answer those

877
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:48,670
questions with the maps that we hear in

878
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:52,060
this culture interact with right because

879
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:54,700
we have to reference to something right

880
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:56,799
we have to go to the source and look at

881
00:46:54,699 --> 00:46:58,480
a lot of plants and the strength to

882
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,400
understand okay these are the allele

883
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,000
these are the versions of these genes

884
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:07,269
that come from this place relative to

885
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:09,789
you know this other place so it's a lot

886
00:47:07,269 --> 00:47:13,119
of let's figure it out you know you

887
00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:15,400
don't know we can go and really further

888
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,929
and I don't want to brush off basically

889
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:20,800
what Tina is saying because I think that

890
00:47:16,929 --> 00:47:23,469
it's a really important point and in a

891
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:26,920
decision on where we got it we where we

892
00:47:23,469 --> 00:47:28,899
want to go as far as ethics of breeding

893
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,970
and whether we're going to be public

894
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:34,420
domain or whether we're going to keep it

895
00:47:30,969 --> 00:47:38,459
to our own domain or or or what we're

896
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,460
going to do so you know on that level
