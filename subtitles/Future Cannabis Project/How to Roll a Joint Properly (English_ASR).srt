1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:12,979
[Music]

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:21,679
[Music]

3
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,829
I've rolled a few Jewett's

4
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:27,349
I know you've rolled many joints

5
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:29,899
I've never rolled a joint on board the

6
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:31,099
Queen Mary before I'm excited for that

7
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:33,710
Swami

8
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:37,600
you're a legend of cannabis cultivation

9
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:40,310
but you're also got a very specific

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,960
joint rolling technique do you think you

11
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,390
can share it with us yeah it's called a

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,759
Swami joint that we roll but first of

13
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,730
all like I never started be giving a

14
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:52,309
seminar and rolling a joint least of all

15
00:00:49,729 --> 00:00:53,839
on the Queen Mary but here we are so

16
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,399
anyway you need a certain number of

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,530
things that first of all the rolling

18
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:59,539
tray is nice and a nice nice piece of

19
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,880
wood is very good and to keep that and

20
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:03,409
then you I like to use a grinder some

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,390
people like scissors or something like

22
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:06,920
that but with you know really good flour

23
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,590
you need something to really break it up

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,498
because actually the quality of the

25
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,270
grind is also very much part of that the

26
00:01:12,498 --> 00:01:17,118
quality of the joint you roll right and

27
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:19,129
then I have a special tamper that I use

28
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:21,828
to tamp to join us I'll show you about

29
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:24,048
that later and then if I don't have this

30
00:01:21,828 --> 00:01:25,998
is my traveling tamper right so I don't

31
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:28,310
someone doesn't lift this one all right

32
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:30,528
so this is my it's just a golf pencil

33
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,359
right and of course the lighter and

34
00:01:30,528 --> 00:01:34,278
papers and the papers I do want to put

35
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:35,899
in a plug elements papers for as far as

36
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:38,060
I'm concerned are far and away the best

37
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:39,679
papers they're just beautiful papers

38
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:44,060
they hardly leave any ash and they're

39
00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:45,259
also very easy to work with so yeah so

40
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,028
then the first thing you want to do is

41
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:50,209
pick your flower and of course I would

42
00:01:47,028 --> 00:01:52,399
always suggest Swami select right and in

43
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:54,289
these jars these jars are special

44
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,849
ultraviolet jars that only let

45
00:01:54,289 --> 00:01:57,918
ultraviolet light in so it preserves

46
00:01:55,849 --> 00:02:00,349
your cannabis in a much better way than

47
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:01,069
it than anyone else right any other way

48
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:02,478
of doing it

49
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:05,899
then of course you have your tube to

50
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:08,239
carry once you got the pre-rolls so now

51
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:11,139
we're gonna break this up into little

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,400
little pieces to go into the grinder and

53
00:02:11,139 --> 00:02:15,049
this will take a little while and sort

54
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,909
of what I think I found is people kind

55
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,360
of lose patience watching me roll a

56
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:18,979
joint

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,130
you know if you really you're not

58
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:24,379
rolling your joint you're crafting a

59
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:25,789
smoking experience right and so the

60
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:27,280
whole thing about the smoking experience

61
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:32,179
we were talking about earlier right

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:35,060
about how the the joint is the most

63
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,480
efficient way to deliver everything that

64
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,520
the cannabis plant has because so say

65
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,159
for imagine for more of that but this is

66
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:46,490
your joint and later and the top of it

67
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:48,349
now has a cinder which is combusting but

68
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:50,750
before that it's actually you're getting

69
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:53,960
at room temperature what you just right

70
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:56,569
so as the combustion goes down what's

71
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:59,300
back here on your mouthpiece is rising

72
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:01,000
up one degree at a time one degree at a

73
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,620
time so every different cannabinoid

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,909
vaporizes at a different temperature so

75
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,590
when you smoke a joint

76
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:08,449
you start from room temperature and

77
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,459
eventually you get the combustion so

78
00:03:08,449 --> 00:03:13,579
everything in between is delivered to

79
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:15,620
you by smoking from a joint and I think

80
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,890
it's the only actual method that really

81
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:21,409
does that because vaporizers got one or

82
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:23,299
two temperature ranges only right even a

83
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:24,949
bowl you're flashing it with your life

84
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,290
yeah you hit it with that lighter and it

85
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:29,659
all goes at once but with with a joint

86
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:31,909
you get cannabis that's off gassing at

87
00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:34,280
room temperature and then all the way on

88
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:37,479
a continuous scale up to the combustion

89
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,860
so I think there's also like there's a

90
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:42,139
ritual to it that should be embrace

91
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,209
alright now we're getting the philosophy

92
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:46,129
things on a deeper level because what I

93
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,439
think about cannabis is that one of

94
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:51,199
these cannabis does is stimulate all

95
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:53,359
your sensory perceptions right heighten

96
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,310
them and make them deeper but the

97
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,019
rolling a joint itself is really

98
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:00,140
celebrating the cannabis cannabis

99
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:03,439
because you have the tactile right you

100
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:05,000
have the olfactory right and then when

101
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,509
you actually smoke it that's called the

102
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,949
gustatory right the the flavor right but

103
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:15,199
you also get the sound all right this is

104
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:17,089
the joint and to clean it out right in

105
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,858
the rinder to clean it out you have to

106
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:20,389
clap it and so that's like telling

107
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:22,219
everybody in the room that you're in the

108
00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:23,810
process of rolling a joint now that'll

109
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,340
bring people in from the hills yeah yeah

110
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,339
we call it the Mendocino matingcall

111
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:33,260
so that's to clean up the joint so and

112
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:35,629
so the whole idea now is you want to get

113
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:38,449
a good grind right now if you're making

114
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:40,850
coffee the best way to do it is grind it

115
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:44,029
just before and get exactly the grind

116
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:46,670
you want for weather using a filter or

117
00:04:44,029 --> 00:04:49,699
French press or so on so once again for

118
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:52,040
cannabis the grind is perhaps one of the

119
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:53,689
most important things about the quality

120
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,910
of the smoke that you're gonna get with

121
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:57,649
your joint right so I'm trying to hurry

122
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:05,360
up here because this takes it what

123
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:09,069
manufacturing is right now the other

124
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:15,080
thing about the joint is that the paper

125
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:16,909
to cannabis ratio wants to be favorable

126
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:18,829
to cannabis so exec you know the New

127
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,420
York pitter yeah you can pick your teeth

128
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:25,339
with the New York alright now I have a

129
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:27,170
good paper I will say however that to

130
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:29,239
really be able to grow a Swami joint you

131
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:31,400
almost have to be a grower because

132
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,810
they're gonna be almost innate right and

133
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:35,269
that's that could be a pretty expensive

134
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,649
joining right but we always share so

135
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:39,109
that's the thing we always share with

136
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:44,539
people and so it gets passed around so

137
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:52,699
on see that so now we're getting the you

138
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:56,960
do one smell that I do that's what we

139
00:05:52,699 --> 00:06:01,789
call pine angel yeah and that's a cross

140
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:06,589
of in the pines with I think it's a

141
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:09,379
turban and what's the consistency you're

142
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:13,879
looking for on the grind well actually

143
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:15,740
since every every kind of every cultivar

144
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:18,290
as we're saying these days not strain

145
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:20,720
every cultivar of cannabis has its own

146
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:23,720
kind of textural quality but also how is

147
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,870
it cured is it too dry is it too damp

148
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:29,330
and so on and so each one is a little

149
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,129
bit different and sometimes if it's

150
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:34,669
really kind of sticky and lumpy I'll

151
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:36,908
grind it twice to really get that proper

152
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,740
texture because

153
00:06:36,908 --> 00:06:41,319
and I said before it's a smoking

154
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,728
experience right it's not just you're

155
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:44,860
getting high you're gonna know you're

156
00:06:42,728 --> 00:06:47,978
engaging all your senses and then when

157
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,449
you do finally smoke it's really you

158
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:53,649
know you want to really smoke it like a

159
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:55,778
cigar you ever smoke cigars uh once or

160
00:06:53,649 --> 00:07:00,428
twice once or twice

161
00:06:55,778 --> 00:07:02,740
mostly I cut them open and III think

162
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:04,748
that coffee analogy is a really good one

163
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,990
yeah because when if you buy pre-ground

164
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:10,240
coffee yeah it just cannot be of the

165
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,908
same quality as crimes at yourself so

166
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,348
much is released in the first 30 seconds

167
00:07:12,908 --> 00:07:16,348
of the grind

168
00:07:16,718 --> 00:07:22,748
I don't allow more than 30 seconds maybe

169
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,939
45 seconds between grinding and pouring

170
00:07:22,749 --> 00:07:27,009
the water right and it's all those

171
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:29,169
volatile organic compounds again which

172
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:31,240
are vaporizing out just like cannabis

173
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:34,269
same thing if you want to get a really

174
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:38,050
good sense of the aroma of cannabis that

175
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:39,699
moment after you grind it is yes well

176
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,468
actually sometimes not always the best

177
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:44,228
it's curious and the cup we found I'll

178
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:46,180
break open a bud and I'll get a really

179
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:47,889
really wonderful thing but then when I

180
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,439
grind it somehow it doesn't mean

181
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:52,418
everything is unique in cannabis all

182
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:53,919
right it's not yeah it's always so

183
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:56,228
unique about now one of the little

184
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:57,908
tricks about rolling with the paper is I

185
00:07:56,228 --> 00:08:00,188
don't know if you can see that but the

186
00:07:57,908 --> 00:08:02,139
you don't roll a square you'd forget

187
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:04,629
about the line that they fold and make

188
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:07,028
your own fold slightly on an angle like

189
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:09,009
that so you get a little taper close to

190
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:12,129
the mouthpiece right and it kind of

191
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:13,929
holds it together just a little what do

192
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:16,979
they call those trade secret kind of

193
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:20,018
thing secrets out

194
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:22,240
oh another now about terpenes you were

195
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:26,079
exclaiming about the terpenes with the

196
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,429
flowers here and I was reading a a long

197
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,769
time ago I was reading one of Ed

198
00:08:27,428 --> 00:08:32,408
Rosenthal's books and he's got a little

199
00:08:29,769 --> 00:08:35,078
graph there that shows that the peak of

200
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:37,838
terpene saturation on this graph it goes

201
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:40,179
like this so just before dawn just

202
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:43,280
before first light terpene saturation is

203
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:46,309
maximum it's at its least at sunset

204
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,230
so at a certain point I said okay let's

205
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:50,149
harvest in the dark so that's when I

206
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,680
harvest the cannabis and I found out

207
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:53,569
that's what wine people do - you're

208
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,419
harvesting grapes because that's maximum

209
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,770
sugar and actually people going to

210
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:59,569
farmers market they're gonna harvest

211
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:00,980
their lettuce early in the morning

212
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,710
because that's when everything at its

213
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:06,230
peak so when I started harvesting my

214
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,970
cannabis in the dark in the morning my

215
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,430
terpene profile just went right through

216
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:14,149
the roof well nothing is about in the in

217
00:09:10,429 --> 00:09:16,939
wherever but yeah so that's a oh this is

218
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:19,189
a little sticky this stuff see there's

219
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,410
two kinds of sticky also they're sticky

220
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,100
because it's not dry enough that's gonna

221
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:28,100
you'll find some now in November October

222
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:31,279
and then they're sticky that this is

223
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:34,159
this is a year old this cannabis and

224
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:37,850
because it's been in those jars right it

225
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:46,969
still got that terpene saturation and so

226
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:48,889
on I'll get you all right so now people

227
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,500
think you're finished ah you're not

228
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:53,929
finished this is what you now you've

229
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,330
created your tube or your cylinder which

230
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:57,889
are gonna proceed to stuff full that's

231
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:04,730
why there's all this stuff left on the

232
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:06,319
tray your grower yeah some people have

233
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,210
complained I see when I said how come

234
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:13,760
there's got dirty fingernails Swamy well

235
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:18,110
there because I'm a farmer for a few

236
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:21,439
days but yeah so now this is what you do

237
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,759
carefully you tamp it in and then you

238
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,100
squeeze and this is what's great about

239
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:27,860
these elements papers as long as they're

240
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:30,710
dry you can really mistreat them right

241
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,570
you like this so I'm squeezing it down

242
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:35,540
to get all the air about go bubbles out

243
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:38,720
and so on do it from the other end nice

244
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:41,659
is gonna take a little while so and I'll

245
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,089
do it from this end right so okay now

246
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:46,309
this is what gets kind of tedious I'm

247
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:47,700
just putting this in so what else you

248
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:50,489
want to talk about while we're do

249
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,190
well how was how was the this year on

250
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:56,690
the farm well this year our our plants

251
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:58,740
are gorgeous they're really I've got

252
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,690
with the county and they're allowing us

253
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,570
to do a few more so I've got a few more

254
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,940
plans so I'm slowly expanding which is

255
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,720
difficult to scale up without well on it

256
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:11,370
right so yeah we've got our plants and

257
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,710
they're they're really gorgeous in green

258
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,840
and big and they're starting to put out

259
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:18,120
those fragrances and the aromas that

260
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:20,820
sort of just bring you into the garden

261
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,909
from a long way away yeah it's beautiful

262
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,580
and we're looking forward to a good good

263
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:28,829
harvest and then we're also looking

264
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,150
forward to the Emerald cup which is

265
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,800
happening this year and I'm you know

266
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:34,169
kind of a new context with the new

267
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:36,149
legalization so we're working out a lot

268
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:37,799
of the details for that but Nicky and I

269
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:39,840
are still be judging the flowers there

270
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:44,389
so anybody wants to enter the Emerald

271
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:47,670
cup please do so look that seems like a

272
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:50,399
peek joint rolling opportunity judging

273
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:52,019
the Emerald cup no see what I would do

274
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,590
for them are couples they give us a gram

275
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:57,840
in an unmarked jar just a number on it

276
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,370
so it's a totally blind contest it's the

277
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:01,259
only one that's really blind like that

278
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:05,730
and then we have a couple of weeks to

279
00:12:01,259 --> 00:12:09,090
test it usually and so we test it on we

280
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:12,870
test it on the look and the fragrance

281
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:16,440
aroma and the flavor and then finally

282
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:19,830
the the effects the effects get double

283
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,970
the points right so the look is ten

284
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:26,129
points maximum the Bliss of a grinntech

285
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:31,050
Samand flavor ten point maximum when

286
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:33,149
you're smoking and the effects gets 20s

287
00:12:31,049 --> 00:12:37,109
but one of the one of the results of

288
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:38,459
that kind of scoring is that the winner

289
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,669
of the Emerald cup has never had the

290
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:44,310
highest THC because the experience of

291
00:12:41,669 --> 00:12:46,250
looking at it and and smelling it and so

292
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:48,199
on summoning scores really high

293
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,809
and so we're looking at the total

294
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:53,360
experience of the cannabis as a smoking

295
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:55,519
event for the flowers right how does it

296
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,139
roll up you know it's it really dusty on

297
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,360
the tray or something like that while

298
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:01,549
you want you after you grind it up or is

299
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,680
it super sticky because it's not quite

300
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:06,349
dry yet because you know the contest is

301
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:08,329
in December and maybe they harvest in

302
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,399
November right so all those little

303
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:12,530
things so you know to be perfectly

304
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,610
honest we don't actually smoke all the

305
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:18,589
entries because not all of our smoking

306
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:20,090
right it's a shaggy trim it's really

307
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,460
scruffy or something like that that

308
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:25,700
can't be a winning but in the display

309
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:27,680
case okay it has no smell no terpenes

310
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,180
well I kind of missed something you know

311
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,059
it's like so I don't even smoke those

312
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:33,859
too right then I'll get one oh the

313
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:35,719
terpenes are good looks like a nice bud

314
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:38,419
it's got some crystal on it though the

315
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,790
the trichomes are kind of golden amber

316
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:42,860
and all those little signs right and so

317
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:44,389
you roll it up and then you smoke it and

318
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:50,120
then all of a sudden I look at Nicky and

319
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:52,699
I'll see and so you take two hits off

320
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,779
this thing and say okay that's it then

321
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:59,900
you get one that's really really really

322
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:01,639
good all right and you say yeah and then

323
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:03,439
the really good ones you smoke all the

324
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,289
way down to the bottom because that's

325
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,630
sometimes where the best hit yes because

326
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:10,610
it's kind of accumulation summation of

327
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:11,960
everything that's come before now see

328
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:13,399
we're almost there right we're almost

329
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,080
got it's got a little bit more at the

330
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:16,669
bottom right and it's still it's a

331
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,310
pretty solid joint see it's got that

332
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:21,919
taper a little bit all right helps it

333
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:23,439
together so now the other thing is

334
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,179
you'll notice I didn't put a filter in

335
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,250
all right now it's a lot of people

336
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:29,839
consider a filter necessary kind of a

337
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,970
courtesy or something like that because

338
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,500
the little bits of you know cannabis can

339
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:37,100
get in your mouth or what have you

340
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:40,519
so that's that can be an issue for

341
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:43,850
people but yours at the end woke up I

342
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,919
found I can taste the cardboard in the

343
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:49,730
filter and if I'm trying to judge

344
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:52,639
someone's cannabis purely for that it's

345
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:54,670
not fair to them right and so that's why

346
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,980
I never use a filter because I can I can

347
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:58,329
said even though unbleached filters and

348
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,820
so on even the white ones you can taste

349
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:07,629
the bleach excellent yeah so what I do

350
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:10,720
is I have a I have a roach clip and

351
00:15:07,629 --> 00:15:12,730
that's what I like to do at the end of

352
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,970
the joint is to put it on to the roach

353
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:18,220
clip you know about these right a little

354
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:20,139
alligator clip alright you can put a bow

355
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:23,649
a feather on the end of it if you want

356
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:25,360
or you know anything like that oh I have

357
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:27,990
to tell you a little story when I had

358
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,990
originally Alan

359
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,029
anyway the roach clip makes it easy to

360
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:39,460
pass and the joint doesn't fall apart

361
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:41,949
and so it's yeah I am until that story

362
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:45,519
years and years ago I had a roach clip

363
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:48,340
like this and I had a gold chain

364
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,610
attached to it and on the end of it I

365
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:53,350
put my Phi Beta Kappa key all right you

366
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:56,350
know what if I Beta Kappa key is well

367
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,460
tell me well you get its an award you

368
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:00,100
getting when you graduate from college

369
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:02,920
because you had I know straight A's or

370
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,950
something so I'm I have this roach clip

371
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:08,979
I'm a hippie in San Francisco and at a

372
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:11,590
certain point somebody steals it alright

373
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,860
so I just had to let it go right but it

374
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:18,430
was sort of something like well not just

375
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:21,340
stoners not just whatever that you know

376
00:16:18,429 --> 00:16:24,309
I got a Phi Beta Kappa key here and I'm

377
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,139
using it to pass you a roach and let's

378
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:32,349
share this and let's let's get down to

379
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:35,559
it right so anyway that's a I'll be on

380
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:37,269
the DVD extra alright so we're just

381
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:39,429
about done but apparently because of

382
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:41,590
various other situations we're not

383
00:16:39,429 --> 00:16:43,709
allowed to smoke it in here you know

384
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:47,620
there's still a stigma to cannabis and

385
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:49,120
the smell and so on people people don't

386
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,159
like that so we have to honor that

387
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,278
so on but we can't go outside and smoke

388
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:56,429
this so is there anything else we need

389
00:16:54,278 --> 00:17:00,850
to tell people because this is your

390
00:16:56,429 --> 00:17:03,938
Swami join um I think there's only one

391
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:07,360
thing left to do all right

392
00:17:03,938 --> 00:17:14,278
you read my mind let's go to the

393
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:14,278
starboard thanks for that

394
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:35,920
