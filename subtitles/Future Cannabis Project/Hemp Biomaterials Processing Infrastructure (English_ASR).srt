1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,019
it's been challenging in first and

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,490
foremost in the lack of infrastructure

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:10,980
and processing here in this country it's

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,900
the the industry is just kind of coming

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:18,890
out of it's shell so to speak so to

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:22,859
process the organic waste into a useful

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:25,080
reusable sustainable material within a

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,929
reasonable distance has been a challenge

9
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:31,759
so we're actually breaking ground on one

10
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:35,670
of the first bio refineries in the state

11
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:37,590
hopefully the end of this year to create

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,879
these regional circular economies the

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,600
infrastructure is not really there once

14
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:43,979
you travel more than 100 miles with it

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,270
could be the most sustainable material

16
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:52,948
on earth the it immediately degrades

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:55,020
that value so I think restock was a

18
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:57,659
little bit ahead of its time in the

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,550
sense that the industry wasn't producing

20
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:03,628
as much material and the infrastructure

21
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:05,399
wasn't really in place luckily now the

22
00:01:03,628 --> 00:01:07,289
demand is there and certainly the

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,130
industry is growing there and now last

24
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,680
piece of the puzzle is the

25
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:12,719
infrastructure in place to process all

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,970
these different inputs were primarily

27
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:17,158
focused on canvas and how mm-hmm so by

28
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:19,408
infrastructure you just mean the

29
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:24,060
processing like the bio refinery exactly

30
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:26,219
processing with a different with more

31
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,900
than one end result more than one

32
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:31,530
application whether it's textiles

33
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,228
whether it is paper-based packaging

34
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,189
whether it is bio plastics whether that

35
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:40,978
is some kind of alternative energy there

36
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:43,309
are a lot of different ways to do it and

37
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:46,140
people who are much smarter than me are

38
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,180
thankfully in charge of that we're just

39
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,640
really fortunate to have some partners

40
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,180
in that space who who've been the most

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,849
helpful allies for you the state has

42
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,969
been very encouraging I will say that

43
00:01:55,849 --> 00:02:02,099
despite we were talking earlier about

44
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:06,868
just you know the the back and forth

45
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:09,419
between regulators and the bureaucracy

46
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:10,840
red tape surrounding that has been has

47
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,750
been wild

48
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,580
but CalRecycle you know the governor's

49
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,439
office have have been very encouraging

50
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,300
they're just you know like I was saying

51
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,629
earlier you know they have their their

52
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,969
plates really full with with how much

53
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:27,159
they should be taxing giving out all

54
00:02:24,969 --> 00:02:30,580
these licenses how are they going to

55
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:33,430
deal with the the influx in cash all

56
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:37,060
these businesses so a lot of times waste

57
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:38,530
management and recycling is the basement

58
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,920
level of what they're trying to

59
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,650
accomplish so they've been very helpful

60
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:48,009
and and partners like circular systems

61
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,569
which are the manufacturing partners

62
00:02:48,009 --> 00:02:51,909
that were building this bio refinery

63
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:53,889
with have been tremendous and they're

64
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:57,219
focusing on textiles they're focusing on

65
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:59,529
textiles yeah we're you know developing

66
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:01,629
a couple cool projects with them they

67
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,449
were just awarded the HTM global agents

68
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:06,579
of change award for 2018 which is like

69
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:09,250
the Nobel Peace Prize for fashion which

70
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,620
was a very big deal for them they were

71
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,680
just voting with some money to you they

72
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:17,590
came with yeah some money as well they

73
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,519
were voted Time Magazine's top 10

74
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:23,079
smartest sustainable ideas of 2018 so

75
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,980
we're honored to be working so closely

76
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:29,439
with them but I think you know

77
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:31,568
innovation is is should be driving

78
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:35,489
regulation and that's a very slippery

79
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:37,599
slope especially given the way that the

80
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,509
exchange of information is so fast

81
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:42,879
nowadays it's very difficult to stay

82
00:03:40,509 --> 00:03:44,679
ahead of something like that but I think

83
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,239
California is doing a great job and

84
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,939
they're doing what they can to stay

85
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,859
ahead of that but the technology is here

86
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:52,889
and it's it's honestly a race against

87
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:52,889
time
