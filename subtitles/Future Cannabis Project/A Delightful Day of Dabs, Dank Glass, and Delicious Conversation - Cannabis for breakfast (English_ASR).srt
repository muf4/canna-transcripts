oh the the lps are super keen on this

131
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:13,279
machine so

132
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,120
i i've had the pleasure of working with

133
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,879
a few and they do what they call

134
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,918
business intelligence so like

135
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,279
r d on some other stores and stuff um

136
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:22,560
and then i come in and i run some

137
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,198
samples for them and then they get all

138
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,879
their data and away they go so cool man

139
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,079
it it

140
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,360
kills this

141
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:31,120
time you use it it just gives you a

142
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,160
marker so you really need like this

143
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,759
right news my friend has one at his uh

144
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,800
hemp farm in uh

145
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,680
in abbotsford oh super cool yeah bc hops

146
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,560
those guys oh cool like dwayne and tyler

147
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,720
mosher

148
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,079
they have this machine in there

149
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,120
i wonder if they said it was better for

150
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,918
thc than cbd though they said that cbd

151
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,680
it falled it fell a little short for thc

152
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,799
much better thc it's off by like point

153
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,400
zero four percent right uh with um

154
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,360
concentrates it's off by point three

155
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,439
five percent but with cdd i think it's

156
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,199
about one percent which is pretty which

157
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,639
is a little higher yeah especially when

158
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,120
they're dealing with like one and two

159
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,960
percent cbd's well and that's it right

160
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,280
like that doesn't even hit a little

161
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:15,598
canadian hemp does not have the highest

162
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:17,439
cbd content right it does do a

163
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,598
semi-quantitative terpene analysis here

164
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,519
we know so like low is from zero to one

165

ask for their money back recently

226
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,879

228
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,320

231
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,559
goes into a truck then it goes to a

232
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,078
facility then it goes to the province

233
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,958
then it goes to a store none of them are

234
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:18,559

00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,240
care of your state you're going to take

371
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,640
care of your county different stories

you know like those are different things

374
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:11,279

375
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,558
brother only yeah they are very critical

376
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,279
of the people who are trying to take oh

377
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,480
my god hundred percent listen 100 the

378

383
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,679
if you're growing your own weed and

384
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,480
smoking it you're growing the best weed

385
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,200
human relationship absolutely totally

expecting the highest return i'm going

454
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:12,399
to use a some of it's going to be a

455
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,599
little bit moisture based but um once we

456
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,200
press like we're probably going to take

457
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,439
this parchment and put it into the

458
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,159
fridge to cool it down simply because

459
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:24,159
it's fucking 30 degrees out here uh not

460
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:26,480
ideal pressing weather i could save it

461
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,080
it's going to be a 120 micron bag so

462
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,480
we'll see what we get out of it and then

463
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,960
we'll just do a fresh tab

464
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,960
hell yeah

465
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:36,639

on the way to the flour and he was

486
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,678
making he was just taking bubble and

487
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,000
just turning it into a sheet that he

488
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,159

489
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,679
bubble and he just randomly was like i'm

how you feel like the flower would have

499

502
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,679
source if one guy discovered this and

503
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,678
never shared it oh yeah it would none of

504
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,840
us would be doing this because

505
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,440
there really is a very small percentage

506
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:21,278
eventually innovators are like the 0.1

507
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,640
percent

508
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:26,720
and the rest are 99.9

509
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,559
that seems like a good idea i'll do that

510
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,880
yeah which is fine too right that's how

511
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:33,038
it spreads that's how like if one guy

512
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,400
both invents something exactly and he

513
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,480
doesn't have the distribution he doesn't

514
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,840
have the network to get it out

515
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,599
you know you need to get it to a guy

516
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,439
that maybe isn't the innovator but

517
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,918
totally has the distribution network

518
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,480
knows all the people can put it i mean

519
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,520
phil had put it on his instagram for

520
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,759
i think it had been out there for a

521
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,679
couple of weeks and it was spreading but

522
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,440
when he came on hash church

523
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,320
and he showed that process

524
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,960
there were machines a week later

525
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:01,038
there were rosin companies a month later

526
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,120
and then it was just like bag companies

527
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,839
like everything was just like

528
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,839
exponentially fast because i was like 30

529
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,720
or 40 000 people got exposed to it in

530
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,678
like

531
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,679
a two-hour period

532
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:16,240
over here so we're doing it uh

533
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,798
182.

534
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,720
that's a real press yeah it's a serious

535
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:24,440
old-school press

536
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,440
dude my press is

537
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,200
the people that are like

538
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,240
this is the other thing about the

539
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,000
instagram

540
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,000
kind of career where it's like i'm on

541
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
instagram

542
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,400
he's pressing at 180 right now yeah i

543
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,000
took that 180. yep and i pressed through

544
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,240
it too i'll be about my press yeah

545
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,240
probably increases yield by 30

546
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,240
characters

547
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,679
when you do two grades and you test them

548
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,839
both yeah they're a fraction of the

549
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,679
difference

550
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,519
oh yeah the color of them so what we

551
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,720
have over here was beer

552
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:24,798
moisture 22.2 percent

553
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,120
okay can you guys hear me now one point

554
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:29,119
two percent yes so depending on the

555
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,359
temperature might it depends on the

556
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:31,359
terps

557
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,520
mark

558
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,798
mark because terps only make up the

559
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,079
price your very results are up brother

560
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,079
yeah these are your numbers for your

561
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:45,720
vera

562
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,720
terpenes 21gs

563
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:53,918
can you write your email down here

564
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:56,240
brother i absolutely can i'm going to

565
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,000
email you the results oh great unless of

566
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,798
course if you want you can just scan

567
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,038
that qr code and then whoever wants to

568
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,038
see yeah

569
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:18,240
so everybody knows that that strain is

570
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,038
20 how many years old is that 20 years

571
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,880
old

572
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:23,519
is his mother's strain that he's passed

573
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,080
around for 20 years so it's it's an old

574
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,200
old plant that's pretty cool man

575
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,319
a lot of that

576
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,080
i've been wanting to grow something like

577
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,158
that old i've got stuff that's like five

578
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,319
six seven years but nothing in like the

579
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,039
double digits that's like an old clone

580
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,038
or just old flowers

581
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,398
i planted some 25 year old ones from

582
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,000
jamaica i had an old hash plant from

583
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,239
like back in the day

584
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,079
and it it it grew but it was a mutant

585
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,240
and it never i could never get it to

586
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:50,960
grow like what it was so i just let it

587
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,558
go

588
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,038
but i i i

589
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:57,038
popped a lamb lamb's bread from jamaica

590
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:02,439
dude that's one of my fucking favorites

591
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:02,439
as well

592
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,840
i can't even believe that that's so cool

593
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:07,839
i can't wait to get that email here

594
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:31,038
it was just and it obviously it was from

595
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,038
seed so it was obviously still

596
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:04,398
when you have a 400 500 banger

597
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:06,079
and you put flower rosin in it

598
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,158
it's really hard to clean

599
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,480
hash rosin just

600
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,799
cleans right out flower rosin does not

601
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,798
when you dunk the whole thing into the

602
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:17,038
alcohol and you pull it out you can

603
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,240
still see this yellow

604
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:19,038
which is uh

605
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,798
yeah

606
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,640
dude can we throw that in the interface

607
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:26,480
why potency-wise i don't mind at all i

608
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,480
just hate the idea of ruining my manga

609

that's

611
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:56,158
well i've got that for now i don't know

612
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:58,398
what happened to my jiffy marker but

613
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,000
here it is it's different

614
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:01,759
okay so it's very poor so what happens

615
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,558
is don't do it on top there dude to the

616
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,919
side

617
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,558
i don't want the ink to run through just

618
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,600
blowing

619
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:11,690
that's why

00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:40,639
yeah absolutely um

623
00:30:37,278 --> 00:30:40,640
and start testing it's no rush

624
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:44,319
i'm gonna test that too though i wanna i

625
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,840
wanna test that

626
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:47,119
so we can find out what it came out of

627
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:48,398
us i got some weed on me that i have

628
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:51,719
tested by pure love to see what this

629
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:51,719
says cheers

630
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:58,158
um i'll do a moisture analysis on it

631
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:04,479
a brand new one

632
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,480
i love that you're doing this

633

[Music]

635
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:35,359
and i've seen that over time and i've

636
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:37,200
squished that with my farm 58 we've been

637
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,599
here

638
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,519
she's saying this push rates yeah yeah

639
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:44,558
what's your favorite yeah me my favorite

640
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,440
180 an acre no i mean um

641
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,398
oh moisture level is probably like 62.

642
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,480
um

643
00:31:48,398 --> 00:31:52,239
yeah 62. but when i balance it like i'm

644
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,558
usually getting i'm doing like seven

645
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,159
percent eight percent moisture content

646
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,000
so when i use my balancer and it's

647
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,200
telling me it's like anywhere between

648
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,278
seven and

649
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,120
ten percent that's the best for like

650
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:04,159
actual moisture weight like moisture

651
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,359
content

652
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,679
for smoking

653
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:10,000
for smashing for squishings so what's

654
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,399
that moisture content at an aw level

655
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,038
let's work on these numbers

656
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:17,278
like dry as fuck

657
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:20,158
i use my balancer to tell me so all i

658
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:20,159
know is it tells me

659
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,720
yeah i seem to um

660
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:35,189

i ride ktms i got the uh

663
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,798
the fp350 okay i have the xexcfw

664
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:12,879
and the exc450

665
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:14,639
so i got a low ratio line

666
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,240
oh beautiful

667
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,440

we really wanted to give an opportunity

867
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:27,440
to get into this and try it so i've got

868
00:46:25,838 --> 00:46:30,000
some grease monkey

869
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,679
live resin here

870
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,920
beautiful trim dress impressive there

871
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,960
president it's just absolutely gorgeous

872

i'm gonna see if i can give you a good

873
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,440
view of the

874
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,039
just absolute gorgeous crazy on the

875
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,400
color i feel terrible holding it in the

876
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,358
sun right now i feel like it's the worst

877
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,358
thing you could ever do drug abuse

878
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:51,119
i love this you position your cup to

879
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:52,639
hide it i really gotta i'm gonna have a

880
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,280
go on this so i'm gonna try this hippo

881
00:46:52,639 --> 00:46:57,519
glass i'm super super pumped

882
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,200
all right go ahead and scoop your

883
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:00,480
preferred size of dab i'm just going to

884
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:02,399
heat this up again because there's a

885
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,280
little bit of wind

886
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,240
so hippo is a really nice guy he's got

887
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,680
an epic long beard too and he's uh you

888
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:11,919
know one of the coolest glass blowers

889
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:14,399
he's been doing it for over 25 years now

890
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,400
so really high quality um glass coming

891
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,039
from him he uses a lot of gold and

892
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,119
silver so as you can see there's quite

893
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:22,800
an interesting technique used with this

894
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,039
uh with this piece maybe you can get a

895
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:27,039
close-up later on but there's uh it's

896
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:28,960
like beautiful like feathering and it's

897
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:30,800
all done with gold and silver infused

898
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,760
into clear glass and then the middle

899
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,079
part is uh gold and silver over like a

900
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:39,040
jet black color so you can get different

901
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:41,680
color uh schemes out of it and so i'm

902
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:44,960
just going to cap this really quick

903
00:47:41,679 --> 00:47:47,279
and then you can uh

904
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,280
yeah

905
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:52,838
oh yeah

906
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,679
that's awesome

907
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:01,118
nice

908
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,559
yeah so he was close to sun peaks right

909
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,318
now um

910
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,559
so we we actually went and visited him

911
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:08,000
in april and uh you know i'm super

912
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,079
jealous that he lives at the base of sun

913
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,838
peaks now because you know

914
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,000
a few minutes to get to the mountain and

915
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:16,480
uh snowboard you know that's the life

916
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,039
but uh

917
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,039
how was that dab

918
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:28,079
a little bit bigger full send

919
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:29,279
full ascendant to the stratosphere

920
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,960
london

921
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,200
london just got carried out in the first

922
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,199
half

923
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:37,598

927
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:45,039
next here just uh clear that real quick

928
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:46,838
and then uh

929
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,119

00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,720
the other day but those are the wheezies

943
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,720
dude

944
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,800
i've got the ceo way for that too i'm

945
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,640
pretty sure that wasn't enough

946
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,359
we have our our team of color

947
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:31,799
commentators we have

948
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:31,799
the snack king chris guerrero

949
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:36,640
we have the

950
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:38,400
pert plus spokesperson chad westport

951
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:40,480
yolo having some technical difficulties

952
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,559
here

953
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,719
that looks a little bit different

954
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:48,079
then peter the man behind the curtain

955
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:51,118
the wizard of oz himself

956
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,119
peter longpipes

957
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,359
we're all just staring at this like is

958
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:02,318
it working

959
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:02,318
look at those wings

960
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:11,639
this neighborhood probably smells

961
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:11,639
delicious

962
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:20,159
a lot of bare feet

963
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:22,318
a lot of pale canadians barefoot

964
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:24,199
i heard you're not allowed to smoke pot

965
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:27,849
if you're not barefoot

966
00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:27,849
[Laughter]

967
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:31,759
there we go yeah

968
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,480
look at that

969
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,800
amazing yes now we can see what's going

970
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:38,559
on it was good to meet you at the

971
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,559
conference on the island it was a great

972
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,559
time

973
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:49,679
ultimately i created the business

974
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:52,159
completely out of my own self-interest

975
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,519
like i just kind of wanted to know about

976
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:54,639
like how good my weed was that i was

977
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:56,480
growing at home i don't think it was

978
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:57,679
just okay so like trimming wasn't an

979
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,800
option for me so i got some like

980
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:03,199
mechanical trimmers and stuff like that

981
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:06,000
and then uh i had to turn on the mic so

982
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:08,318
then i got myself smasher which um the

983
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,079
lug smasher which is the press over

984
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:11,679
there which is great so i'm more

985
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,519
interested in the machine the testing

986
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:15,358
because the potency analyzer is amazing

987
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:17,119
it's the light lab 3 cannabis analyzer

988
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:18,159
that's cool um a little bit different

989
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,838
from the

990
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:23,358
though i had an sri 810 6c

991
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:24,719
that was another testing machine that we

992
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:26,639
talked about that was pretty cool but i

993
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:28,480
mean this is like mine was not you

994
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,159
needed a full like guide this thing is

995
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,880
like a suitcase that's what i like about

996
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:32,639
this

997
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,640
suitcase it's actually used by a few of

998
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:38,159
the federal uh wings in the united

999
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:39,679
states like um like yeah i'm not i'm not

1000
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:41,199
like police agencies that go to the hemp

1001
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:43,118
farms to test that there's not a higher

1002
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:45,358
thc or whatever right they've been it's

1003
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,280
been vetted so it's actually they're

1004
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:49,358
using it in the government facilities so

1005
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:50,800
that's giving you some pretty good on

1006
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:53,279
the road i like that they put it up

1007
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:55,280
against 250 brick order labs down in the

1008
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,040
states and uh that we're using like a

1009
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,119
hundred thousand dollar hplc machines

1010
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:02,159
like that's a pretty serious unit but

1011
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:05,039
not not that price and uh it finished in

1012
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:06,159
the top uh like 25 so it blew most of

1013
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:07,679
the brick and mortar labs like

1014
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:09,759
completely out

1015
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:11,679
disgusting he's going in first first up

1016
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,520
i thought i was getting lucky here but i

1017
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:15,440
don't know

1018
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:17,039
no you're not stealing no thunder at all

1019
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,400
right there

1020
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:19,838
you know what's great about this is he's

1021
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,680
talking about the hplc and that's

1022
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:23,759
something that i worked on with dr paul

1023
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:26,159
hornby rest in peace paul was just an

1024
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,559
awesome man gentleman who uh who uh

1025
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:30,558
gracefully passed away um and his

1026
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,640
bedside his wife and family were around

1027
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,559
when uh you actually

1028
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,159
lost with pneumonia like a lot of people

1029
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,920
do in their ages and when they're when

1030
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:41,440
they're sick it's unfortunate

1031
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:43,039
very unfortunate but you know

1032
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,318
he's like he's got a great dab going on

1033
00:52:43,039 --> 00:52:46,318
here and i can see right now

1034
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,680
so it's nice to see where we've evolved

1035
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,519
because we went from from an hplc then

1036
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:57,199
we went to the the mass back well

1037
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:59,440
there's a mass spec then it had a gc

1038
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:01,519
which is gas chromatographer and now you

1039
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,679
have this beautiful little piece here

1040
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:05,280
that comes in a pelican case yep that

1041
00:53:03,679 --> 00:53:06,799
you can carry around and instead of

1042
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,559
hauling around like we were hauling

1043
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,400
around gases because we needed gases i

1044
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,240
had to have the tanks yeah all this

1045
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,920
stuff so it was a lot it was it was it

1046
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:15,439
was kind of hard to actually take

1047
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,358
testing on the road

1048
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,880
and it was nice to see as a gentleman

1049
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:20,239
named chuck came in the plane he started

1050
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,800
driving around and he was doing some

1051
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:25,199
testing back in the day since about 2013

1052
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,920
2014.

1053
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:30,000
i love it dude i find that it's bridging

1054
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,358
the intuition with knowledge no but

1055
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,679
here's what i'm saying like we got to

1056
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:35,279
keep evolving and showing and people are

1057
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:36,960
able to now they're looking for those

1058
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,240
percentages they want to know more but

1059
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,318
back in the days i think we were just a

1060
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:43,358
little bit before our time yeah oh my

1061
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:44,800
god absolutely 100 like i when i opened

1062
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:46,480
this business it was in january of this

1063
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,880
year at the end of january and my

1064
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,838
primary market was supposed to be ac mpr

1065
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,838
and it was supposed to be like the

1066
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:54,159
smaller like client the home grower like

1067
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:55,599
yeah the homegrown wants to know and

1068
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:57,118
that's that's sort of why i built the

1069
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,559
business but then it turned out that the

1070
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,400
lps and the micros had a serious

1071
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,519
interest in it too so now i get to go

1072
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,880
out and like provide business

1073
00:54:01,519 --> 00:54:05,599
intelligence and

1074
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,119
um there was one lp that was out in the

1075
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,200
valley there and they were running like

1076
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,519
eight different new r d strains and i

1077
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:12,960
got to go in and sort of test them every

1078
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:15,199
other week and sort of give them like

1079
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,800
potency tracking there you go and that's

1080
00:54:15,199 --> 00:54:19,358
a great way of stacking up against what

1081
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,960
their actual like mainstay was right and

1082
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:22,558
it turns out that they ended up dropping

1083
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,559
the majority of the r d strains because

1084
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,319
it wasn't coming close to what their

1085
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:29,119
bread and butter was so

1086
00:54:26,318 --> 00:54:31,039
um they didn't have to put in a bunch of

1087
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,559
like dollars and cents to find out that

1088
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:33,838
it wasn't gonna pan out for them in

1089
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,319
today's market where they're trying to

1090
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:37,920
sell things for high thc like did they

1091
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:39,759
look great yeah did they smell great

1092
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,880
sure we're gonna we're gonna probably

1093
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,640
we're gonna get into one thing here

1094
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,640
right now so they did not legalize

1095
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:46,239
cannabis they legalized t they they

1096
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:47,440
taxed thc

1097
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:48,318
yeah because that's what we're seeing

1098
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,519
and what we're talking about they're

1099
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:51,358
dumping the strains and a lot of these

1100
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,639
lower thc strains with the terpenoids

1101
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:53,838
and flavonoids that we're looking at

1102
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:55,838
it's always about saving the chirps and

1103
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:57,358
we're looking at that so it's really

1104
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:58,880
it's the education that we've got to get

1105
00:54:57,358 --> 00:55:01,119
back in because we know the thai t c

1106
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:02,960
levels you're seeing this because i saw

1107
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,559
it for the last decade working with paul

1108
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,000
doing exactly doing in a different scale

1109
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:07,680
i love what you're doing like i mean i

1110
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,199
command john taking it to the lps and

1111
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:11,039
doing that because when i was around

1112
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:12,798
there was no lps we were we were doing

1113
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:14,000
it and like we're like dude i'm standing

1114
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:14,960
on the shoulders of people that got me

1115
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,960
here are you kidding me you know what

1116
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:18,400
like it's a beautiful thing to see that

1117
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,079
we're getting to these levels that we

1118
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,079
can do this legally you got a job doing

1119
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,160
this oh my god we can legally test

1120
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:25,760
cannabis

1121
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,679
and have a job and do this the best part

1122
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,960
is i get to go to everyone's place you

1123
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:31,759
know what come on

1124
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,480
be your like yeah

1125
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,160
dude

1126
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,519
man let's do it like that would be

1127
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:36,960
awesome yeah we're going to these places

1128
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:38,480
to see and look at that research because

1129
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,760
we've done so much of over time and

1130
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,440
seeing what businesses are doing what

1131
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:44,000
they're going today and what you're able

1132
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,760
to do at home because this man here has

1133
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,599
the ability to test and track things so

1134
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:49,200
you can see how things are developing

1135
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,760
and we're looking at soil growth right

1136
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:53,039
now it's oh man we we tested some lights

1137
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,040
the other day i was at

1138
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:57,440
a micro there's five micros operating on

1139
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:58,960
the same plot of land and one guy's got

1140
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,559
double ended bulbs and other guys

1141
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,000
running leds but they have the same

1142
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,519
strain flipped on the same day and

1143
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,639
everything and you know the results

1144
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:06,159
right there and now because we all know

1145
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:07,519
the leds are killing it gives you you

1146
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:09,279
get a result in 12 and a half minutes

1147
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:11,519
you get a printed coa or you get it

1148
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:13,200
emailed to you which is amazing but uh

1149
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:14,960
these guys here their

1150
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:17,519
difference between percentages was seven

1151
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,760
percent the led strain was absolutely

1152
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:21,519
fucking killing it and it's like

1153
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,040
dude well maybe the terps were low no

1154
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:24,318
the terps were actually higher too it

1155
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:26,480
was crazy i can tell you the difference

1156
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:27,759
between wattages of leds and thc levels

1157
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,358
i've really gone down the rabbit hole

1158
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,280
that's why you and me are gonna have a

1159
00:56:29,358 --> 00:56:32,960
lot of fun because i connect the ability

1160
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,920
to do some information that i have in

1161
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,440
this

1162
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,119
little brain of mine that you can now

1163
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,200
look at we connected about it and on

1164
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:40,798
over on the island and now you're here

1165
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:42,719
well i'm also with the unicorn cup which

1166
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:44,239
is dope too you're you are as well i'm

1167
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:45,919
actually trim test impressions i guess

1168
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:47,598
we're getting together it looks like

1169
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,280
things might be going down okay i'm

1170
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:51,359
gonna go over there and run another test

1171
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:55,640
um but uh

1172
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:55,639
i thought that was great we're back

1173
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:00,960
get over here justin

1174
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:04,318
talk to me

1175
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:11,679
so that was david roberts that was just

1176
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:13,279
speaking there guys just so you let uh

1177

let you know if you can hear my mic you

1178
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,240
need a microphone

1179
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:19,598
this is justin

1180
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:21,919
justin hi guys what's up jeff

1181
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,920
great

1182
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:27,838
i was hoping for a reheat i uh i'm i'm

1183
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:29,679
on a bit of a hiatus and i know that

1184
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:31,838
everybody's been like oh no

1185
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:34,000
lame

1186
00:57:31,838 --> 00:57:35,119
talking mike yeah he knows this too

1187
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
there we go

1188
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,559
so

1189
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,559
not my first

1190
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,280
yeah

1191
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:44,719
oh that smells nice that's really

1192
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,319
really floral

1193
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:48,480
i've got lavender what is that what is

1194
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:48,480
this

1195
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:54,960
this is a grease monkey

1196
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:57,439
this is really pretty

1197
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,280
fresh frozen tasty very derpy this is

1198
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,639
like a trip sauce

1199
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,480
it is a turtle sauce so it's probably

1200
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:03,838
heated crushed probably a low temp what

1201
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,280
did you

1202
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:07,838
super nice

1203
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,960
really floral

1204
00:58:07,838 --> 00:58:13,358
okay we just got well i did i got high

1205
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:15,358
was kind of nice you got high i did i

1206
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:16,239
enjoyed it you know paul i was just

1207
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:17,679
sitting here everywhere we were talking

1208
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:19,279
about the testing and you work with dr

1209
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:20,558
hornby you were really behind him we did

1210
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:22,000
a lot of stuff with matty one yeah

1211
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:23,599
you're looking at those terpenes that

1212
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,838
were the organic line we're looking at

1213
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:27,359
tc levels back in the days when you talk

1214
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:28,480
about testing you've gone through a lot

1215
00:58:27,358 --> 00:58:30,000
of these testing you've seen a lot of

1216
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,838
these results and what do you see in the

1217
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,079
industry today when we compare to the

1218
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:36,159
old see hps metal highlights going

1219
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,440
towards leds

1220
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:38,798
like what we were saying two years ago

1221
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:40,400
and what happened in the list in the

1222
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:42,079
last six months and where things i mean

1223
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,760
ten years ago we were testing leds and

1224
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:44,960
it was just this dude i was testing them

1225
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,480
for you you were banging your head

1226
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:48,000
against the wall dude you gave me my

1227
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,599
first spectrum king led you game this

1228
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,280
guy gave me a lot of the lights in the

1229
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,880
beginning and you know what we were

1230
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,640
looking at leds i remember all the stuff

1231
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,079
that was coming in a green planet coming

1232
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:57,759
into pnw

1233
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,680
all the different lights that we've seen

1234
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,200
over time like you've actually got the

1235
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:02,399
one thing i loved about being able to be

1236
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:04,318
a part of the team and part of the

1237
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,358
family yeah is being able to see every

1238
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:06,880
light that comes everybody's going to

1239
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:08,318
see the back of dave's head

1240
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,358
back of the head back of the head for

1241
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:11,920
dave

1242
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:11,920
back of the head

1243
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:17,440
so yeah no honestly but like led is

1244
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:20,239
finally hit finally haley we we bitched

1245
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,920
about it 2015 2016. it's finally covered

1246
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:24,798
some of those lights

1247
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:27,039
oh can i can i not like the purples the

1248
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:29,759
that's what i mean the microphone

1249
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:31,279
the uh the non-stop uh

1250
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,119
i know just nonstop banging your head

1251
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,040
against the wall right until we knew the

1252
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,960
tech was there we knew one day it would

1253
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:38,558
be amazing

1254
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,559
and now you can't even give a cmh away

1255
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:42,559
or you can't even give an hbs light away

1256
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:45,839
that's awesome the market has completely

1257
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:47,680
changed and now it's growing under a led

1258
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:48,798
and learning about the growing future

1259
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:51,039
learning about you know more

1260
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:52,798
dehumidification there's a lot of things

1261
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:54,079
you need to learn along the way but so

1262
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:56,000
you know what you got to understand your

1263
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:57,440
vapor pressure deficit absolutely it's

1264
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,960
most the key is thing that we never

1265
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,318
really learned about growing with hps

1266
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,760
metal highlights all you all growers out

1267
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:03,679
there you're fucked

1268
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,520
like i know i've seen all you guys

1269
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:07,598
change and everything yeah you're

1270
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:09,358
awesome mark like doing the i figured

1271
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:10,400
you would yeah it's you know so much you

1272
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:12,480
know one thing that i really noticed

1273
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,720
honestly is like we used to guess

1274
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,559
tell us uh sorry to interject here but

1275
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:18,798
tell us for those that don't know what

1276
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:20,160
is vapor pressure deficit in in the

1277
01:00:18,798 --> 01:00:21,599
layman's terms

1278
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:22,558
it's the amount of pressure that's put

1279
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,318
on the leaf and the amount of pressure

1280
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:27,359
that's coming off the leaf that control

1281
01:00:24,318 --> 01:00:28,880
the amount of the plant is absorbing

1282
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:30,239
nutrients and everything so there's an

1283
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:31,200
amount of pressure that's hitting the

1284
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:32,399
leaf and there's amount of pressure

1285
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:33,679
that's going off for the leaf and you

1286
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,838
want to maintain a certain amount of

1287
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:37,598
pressure the vapor pressure deficit

1288
01:00:35,838 --> 01:00:38,960
so it's really key important when you

1289
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,480
take a look at how much pressure is on

1290
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:42,480
that leaf and how it's growing and we

1291
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,159
used to take we take a lot of pressure a

1292
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,079
lot of stress on that leaf by lowering

1293
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:47,598
the the vapor pressure inside of the

1294
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,359
room by lowering its humidity that

1295
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:51,119
humidity the plant was not off castings

1296
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:53,679
it was starving itself and we've seen

1297
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:56,000
this over time we cause diseases we all

1298
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:57,838
these problems do into not really

1299
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,599
properly controlling the humidity inside

1300
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:01,759
the room it's kind of when we look at

1301
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:05,519
ourselves and everything like we we as

1302
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:07,599
humans are 75 water the earth is 71

1303
01:01:05,519 --> 01:01:08,960
water your plants are water why are we

1304
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,119
trying to pull all the moisture out of

1305
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:13,119
the room they're not growing the jungle

1306
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,400
boys key example

1307
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:15,760
they started killing when they started

1308
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,838
doing everything with high humidity

1309
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,680
growing and stuff

1310
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:21,358
with within reason within reason

1311
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:24,159
understanding vapor pressure

1312
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:27,119
understanding vpd is is paramount the

1313
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:29,440
next part is like we never

1314
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,838
as growers we never

1315
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:33,440
measured light no not at all right it

1316
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:35,358
wasn't until wait a second here quantum

1317
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,519
sensors we had we had those parameters

1318
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:39,358
that i was using about 2015 from down we

1319
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:40,719
were looking at i did he gave me those

1320
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:42,078
lights i was doing that stuff but

1321
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:44,798
growers for the most part don't measure

1322
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:46,079
light like it's like 740 650 it just

1323
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:47,920
gave us something we've never ever gone

1324
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:50,400
to nanometers we never got into nothing

1325
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:52,000
like that we never got a ppfd now with

1326
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,599
technology like troll master we can

1327
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,000
actually measure light we didn't

1328
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:57,359
understand dli daily integrals and how

1329
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,719
much that plant was willing it's no

1330
01:01:57,358 --> 01:02:00,159
different than measuring food in your

1331
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:02,399
reservoir

1332
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:04,838
it's food in the air

1333
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:08,240
and the fact that you can actually hone

1334
01:02:04,838 --> 01:02:09,119
in um dpd

1335
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:10,239
and

1336
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:13,280
uh

1337
01:02:10,239 --> 01:02:15,439
ppfd dli all these things using troll

1338
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,280
master that's really been a revolution

1339
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,400
in the industry it has changed it i've

1340
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,119
actually seen quite a good thing because

1341
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:23,200
the troll master actually controls your

1342
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,400
your well it doesn't control your dli i

1343
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:25,519
don't know if the new light sensor

1344
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,000
haven't used them so let me rephrase

1345
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:29,920
that yeah so i mean i look at ppd levels

1346
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,079
and i'm able to actually mimic the sun

1347
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,920
sets on right spectrum

1348
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:35,119
i'm able to mimic in the room that if

1349
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,039
i'm actually doing like if there's

1350
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,960
clouds like there is outside so i take a

1351
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:40,640
look at where the now i'm one kind of

1352
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,318
curious right now is i know the

1353
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:44,159
difference between see at 10 a.m in the

1354
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:45,920
morning with using my spectrum meter and

1355
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:47,920
taking what it is in the summertime in

1356
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:49,440
the fall and i see higher levels so now

1357
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,639
controlling those levels that i see

1358
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,838
outside on the inside with the troll

1359
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:53,440
master is going to be my next step of

1360
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:55,038
talking to you we're trying to literally

1361
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,798
mimic mother nature my nature had it

1362
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:57,920
figured out they've well you know what

1363
01:02:56,798 --> 01:02:59,440
they've got more they figured out

1364
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,960
they've worked on the soils and the root

1365
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,639
balancer take a look at

1366
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,159
that whole thing we're looking at is

1367
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:06,078
looking at those organic soils and

1368
01:03:04,159 --> 01:03:08,000
looking at the microbes and

1369
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:09,440
far red's huge at first and right now

1370
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,880
we're actually testing some stuff right

1371
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,720
now i'm gonna be taking a look at far

1372
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,559
red pass at 7 30 and we started pushing

1373
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:16,318
some stuff past 780 was the first lights

1374
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:18,160
that i started testing right now well

1375
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:19,440
now for the last little bit and we

1376
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:20,879
started i started seeing a difference

1377
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,639
underneath my grapes because my grapes

1378
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:24,559
was all red so i started seeing the

1379
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:25,920
difference with these light recipes by

1380
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:26,960
looking at the light that was going

1381
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,159
through the leaf and what's going

1382
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,358
underneath the leaves underneath the

1383
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:31,199
plants outside of my yard and other

1384
01:03:29,358 --> 01:03:33,038
people's places and by seeing these

1385
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:34,639
spectrums you're able to start advancing

1386
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,720
more in technology to take a look at

1387
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:38,318
what we're seeing because now we have

1388
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:39,519
the technology to measure light

1389
01:03:38,318 --> 01:03:41,519
everywhere

1390
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:43,440
absolutely it's awesome oh yeah and we

1391
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:45,679
never looked at it until now as as in

1392
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,760
growers as in i don't even know any

1393
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:49,118
farmers that do this like i i know they

1394
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,720
do in greenhouses but why aren't we

1395
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:52,240
looking at the outside and how we're

1396
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:53,118
able to shade these plants and stuff

1397
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:54,879
like that and where they're getting

1398
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:56,240
their best expressions

1399
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,559
there's lots of different plants to do

1400
01:03:56,239 --> 01:04:00,000
different things the cannabis people

1401
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:02,400
have to understand

1402
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,519
i keep preaching this cannabis is not

1403
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:05,519
about

1404
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:08,000
color or blood structure

1405
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:10,159
it all comes down to the trichome

1406
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,079
and the effect that that has on your own

1407
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:13,598
condition

1408
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:15,359
that's it

1409
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:16,960
your international capability system

1410
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:19,440
specifically

1411
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,119
that's what's going to determine uh

1412
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,880
the best nugget

1413
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:24,160
this kind of tastes good too though see

1414
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,680
you know what mark just keeps coming

1415
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:28,239
with new i know why you just sit down

1416
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:29,679
come back here with all that stuff

1417
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:31,519

1418
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:32,558
these i mean everybody you see running

1419
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:34,639
around with everything is because of

1420
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:36,000
that guy yeah yeah i carry stuff around

1421
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:37,759
with him on planes and everywhere and it

1422
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,358
was just like he took shit everywhere

1423
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,440
and you know what because we needed a

1424
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:43,838
dub no matter where we were

1425
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,559
at the airport at the hotel inside the

1426
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:47,279
room

1427
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:48,559
by the way the uh no thc sticker that's

1428
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:51,519
very

1429
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:53,359
apparent well what come on

1430
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:54,960
it's very canadian

1431

hey

1432
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,000
we are on the us channel right now which

1433
01:04:56,719 --> 01:04:59,679
is awesome you guys got to come up here

1434
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,480
and take a look at this beautiful view

1435
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:03,598
and as you can see i can't believe it

1436
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,519
wow

1437
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:08,000
so yeah you've got

1438
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:09,519
as you got into it like dr hornby um you

1439
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,358
know we've lost

1440
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:14,798
some serious pioneers within the space

1441
01:05:11,358 --> 01:05:17,759
french cannoli jason wilcox horatio

1442
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:19,599
delbert honestly randy kane these guys

1443
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,839
are like there's so many people that

1444
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:23,039
have us there's bert and there's yeah

1445
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:25,440
there's tracy

1446
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:26,960
there's the whole thing is is is these

1447
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,400
people left something behind for us to

1448
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,838
evolve from so they gave us the

1449
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,000
knowledge to move forward and we take

1450
01:05:29,838 --> 01:05:33,838
that knowledge we keep pushing it so we

1451
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,280
blessed with what they've done in our

1452
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:36,480
lives and we've taken that knowledge and

1453
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,240
pushed it forward from people like

1454
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,838
horatio from people like dr horan and

1455
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:41,439
you've got to pay homage to all those

1456
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:43,519
you know pioneers and they literally are

1457
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,960
pioneers in the space yeah

1458
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:46,400
the last growing expos that we did we

1459
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:48,079
actually uh

1460
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,559
dedicated to jason wilcox that's a

1461
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:52,640
beautiful thing i know we got going i

1462
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,480
dedicated in my book is adult dedication

1463
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:57,118
horatio and jason wilcox so it's in the

1464
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:59,280
first opening pages of the book and i

1465
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:01,039
mean jason was a pioneer in the industry

1466
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:02,480
who fought for legalization in the

1467
01:06:01,039 --> 01:06:03,920
courts for his daughters to be able to

1468
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,199
race to grow his own while he was able

1469
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,880
to raise his daughter through the court

1470
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:08,480
system so a lot of people don't know i

1471
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,079
sat years and years with jason he's a

1472
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,000
very good friend of mine yeah you know

1473
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:13,839
he's blessed me with his presence and be

1474
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,519
a part of his daughter's life and be

1475
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:17,119
able to see how we were able to change

1476
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:18,880
as a group and as a community really

1477
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:20,880
evolve and change the plan and how it's

1478
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,798
being i mean today presented to the

1479
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,280
world because canada really was able to

1480
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:26,960
change that demographics and now people

1481
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,400
have been looking at canada they say we

1482
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,480
screwed it up but no we didn't we

1483
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,160
started it so how

1484
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,679
it's legal

1485
01:06:32,159 --> 01:06:35,279
i think governments screw it up by

1486
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:37,038
getting greedy and thinking there's

1487
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,880
unlimited funds in it

1488
01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,799
the whole thing is is right now it's i

1489
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,400
mean it comes down to and i always say

1490
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:43,920
this and also keep saying until the day

1491
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,440
is i mean it's around the world it's the

1492
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,639
green way it's growing your own if you

1493
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,079
can't grow we can now obtain it

1494
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:49,920
somewhere else which is fantastic that's

1495
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:51,440
all i fought for all we ever said is

1496
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:53,680
what everybody was evolved everybody

1497
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,599
fought for the same thing access yeah it

1498
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:57,358
wasn't important it was about access

1499
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:00,500
depending on what access that you want

1500
01:06:57,358 --> 01:07:02,719
is where the key by itself is

1501
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:04,880
[Music]

1502
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:06,159
it helps you grow you see something

1503
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,440
different canadians are all about to

1504
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:09,358
grow four plants

1505
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,880
why aren't they all not growing for

1506
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:11,920
plants i give plants away like crazy

1507
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,599
well this year i couldn't because it

1508
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:15,200
just i wasn't able to do a lot of stuff

1509
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:17,280
i don't understand why home growers are

1510
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:19,279
not a bigger segment in the market

1511
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,119
i'm dumbfounded i'm dumbfounded people

1512
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,960
are still lazy you live in like north

1513
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:25,280
vancouver you have it's kind of still a

1514
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,760
hippie community my friends and family

1515
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:29,440
are interested they're still weary you

1516
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,039
know a lot of the people that are well

1517
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,639
here's the whole thing so buyers are

1518
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:33,920
ones that are walking into your muse

1519
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:36,480
that are walking into your local

1520
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,240
dispensaries those new initial buyers

1521
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:40,240
are still running through stigmatisms in

1522
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:42,078
their mind and we're growing the plant

1523
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:44,959
but once we can get there you know what

1524
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:46,960
i mean we you open so many other avenues

1525
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,960
cannabis is cool because it could pull

1526
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,920
people through in that method also the

1527
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,079
next thing you know you're growing your

1528
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,960
own food you're growing your own crops

1529
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:54,240
well this is the whole thing we're

1530
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,159
getting into that's what we're talking

1531
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:57,679
about right now and i'm using the 104

1532
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:59,519
gallon bins i was getting the next one

1533
01:07:57,679 --> 01:08:01,279
with peppers and tomatoes with the

1534
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:02,719
organics and stuff like that moving soil

1535
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:05,680
we just did regenerative gardening the

1536
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:07,838
uh on on uh you know one episode

1537
01:08:05,679 --> 01:08:11,038
i i've probably clicked on it

1538
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:13,358
called growing exposed i know

1539
01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:15,280
you know you know what um

1540
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:17,600
go ahead no no straight goods like full

1541
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:19,838
regenerative growth changes yeah

1542
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,960
absolutely phenomenal like we're pumped

1543
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:22,880
we're going to be doing the live

1544
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,079
coverage of the unit well i mean they're

1545
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:25,679
a little bit out of the booth so we

1546
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:27,278
won't be able to get live

1547
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:28,399
are you you're going to unicorn income

1548
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:31,040
uh there's a good chance yeah there's a

1549
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:32,479
good chance you're taking a helicopter

1550
01:08:31,039 --> 01:08:36,079
this industry is soft right now dude

1551

the the main festival is right on the

1607
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:31,919
lake and i mean the most pristine it it

1608
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,440

1609
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,440

it's it honestly and

1612
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:41,599
you know we need to be looking at

1613
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:43,120
regenerative gardening as a real serious

1614
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,400
well we're here talking about absolutely

1615
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:45,599
and we're pushing it on all these

1616
01:10:44,399 --> 01:10:46,559
channels and everything we're talking

1617
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,079
about

1618
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:50,400
we're bringing it in the house we got to

1619
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:52,319
bring it into the house yeah experiment

1620
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:54,399
nothing new about it it's teaching the

1621
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:56,960
kids for some people

1622
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:59,439
i grow a lot i grow cover crop in three

1623
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,279
gallon pots and after you harvest your

1624
01:10:59,439 --> 01:11:03,439
flour you can pick carrots out of it

1625
01:11:01,279 --> 01:11:05,119
absolutely three gallon pot i'm using

1626
01:11:03,439 --> 01:11:07,439
i'm using green planet nutrients which

1627
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:09,599
is your dual fuel

1628
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:11,839
yeah um and

1629
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,280
you know but i use regenerative practice

1630
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:14,480
i've been using the same cocoa for now

1631
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:16,399
three and a half years oh it doesn't

1632
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:19,119
break down decrease the nutrient intake

1633
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:20,399
that that cut that comes into them i do

1634
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:22,079
like because they're just staining three

1635
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:25,359
gallons what ppm are you running i love

1636
01:11:22,079 --> 01:11:27,439
low ppm yeah honestly you don't want

1637
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:30,719
people to crush

1638
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:32,479
tds in my opinion or ec you're just

1639
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:33,840
the plant as it dries out you're

1640
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:34,559
struggling easy goes up regardless

1641
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,000
you're stressing the roots you're

1642
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,920
damaging the plant potential so i mean

1643
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,520
that'll bring more teeth here yeah

1644
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,199
people go oh you have so much life there

1645
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:43,440
how do you get the water in and it's

1646
01:11:41,198 --> 01:11:45,919
like it glides it's like it just moves

1647
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:47,519
directly into the soil with zero effort

1648
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,440
or anything yeah you know i put down

1649
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,440
some predator insects i haven't sprayed

1650
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:53,359
anything i haven't had to put anything

1651
01:11:51,439 --> 01:11:54,960
down and i do a little indoor grow

1652
01:11:53,359 --> 01:11:56,880
that's half outdoor

1653
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:58,880
and it just works and it's like i've

1654
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,039
been able to stop i mean you have to go

1655
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,560
through some pains in the process sure

1656
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:04,560
and you have to come to an understanding

1657
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:06,000
with yourself yeah that's like that's a

1658
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,360
lot about like what you do with grow and

1659
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,039
expose and what you do

1660
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:11,439
so london i'll ask you a question what

1661
01:12:09,039 --> 01:12:13,359
what do we do to break the stigma

1662
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:16,079
what do we do to get that grandma to be

1663
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:17,279
like i'm doing my own veggies already

1664
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:20,238
i'm going to throw a couple pot plants

1665
01:12:17,279 --> 01:12:21,119
in there we're going to we're doing this

1666
01:12:20,238 --> 01:12:22,959
yeah

1667
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:24,319
you get into every garden works and you

1668
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,000
tour around the country and you hit

1669
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:28,000
every garden works and you do uh you do

1670
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,760
a pairing i mean they're head offices

1671
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,279
sure it's right now but you go hey

1672
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,960
absolutely we're gonna we're gonna go

1673
01:12:31,279 --> 01:12:34,880
around and we're gonna teach people

1674
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,480
about it and how to do it properly and

1675
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:38,239
most of all how to do it safely and then

1676
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:40,238
yeah then you then safely you're gonna

1677
01:12:38,238 --> 01:12:41,678
teach people about the safeness behind

1678
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:43,119
the plant and how they can integrate it

1679
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,719
into their garden you're already allowed

1680
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:46,158
to use four plants legally for fuck's

1681
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:47,760
sake yeah but we gotta understand i mean

1682
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:48,960
the whole thing is as we keep talking

1683
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,159
about but you can't see the reason and

1684
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,520
everybody think it's a drug so you got

1685
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:52,960
to put the medical behind it and they're

1686
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,000
saying we can't talk about medical and

1687
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:56,079
this is where the health canada thing

1688
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,520
comes into play so it's really is how we

1689
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:59,198
present this to the people and how they

1690
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:00,880
need to be growing this and i know ken's

1691
01:12:59,198 --> 01:13:02,799
talking about driving across canada

1692
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,800
doing these little regenerative little

1693
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:06,239
uh bus tours and trying to get people

1694
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,600
those like we did with

1695
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:09,279
back in the days

1696
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,120
we can talk recreationally we can talk

1697
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:12,238
medical we can talk anyway we want yeah

1698
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:13,920
you're legally a lot of people that's

1699
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:15,039
what i mean we can talk all about it

1700
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,960
stop

1701
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:19,600
like there's no stigma to break it's

1702
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:22,079
legal the biggest the biggest challenge

1703
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:24,000
that i see in the market right now is

1704
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:26,880
the lack of genetics that are actually

1705
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,560
honest yeah um there's a there's a lot

1706
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:30,800
of seed there's not a lot of good

1707
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:32,239
product coming out yeah um and and the

1708
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,320
problem is is that there's a lot of

1709
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:35,759
disgenuous people providing things that

1710
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:37,198
are brand absolutely indoor environment

1711
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,440
and giving the old ladies that are going

1712
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:41,678
to grow outside yeah and this these

1713
01:13:39,439 --> 01:13:43,198
things are are are like when the first

1714
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:45,119
time you ever grow and the first time

1715
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:46,799
you ever get that experience even if you

1716
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:49,119
fail you get

1717
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:51,199
some reward out of it but when you

1718
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:54,399
when you get obliterated when things go

1719
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:56,238
just horrendously bad um i mean there's

1720
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:57,920
auto flowers too right like you can get

1721
01:13:56,238 --> 01:14:00,919
seeds you can go eat

1722
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,920
dispensers

1723
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:05,920
that's been breeding in alberta outdoor

1724
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:07,519
light depth yeah i mean breeding alberta

1725
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,840
outdoor light depth like i mean

1726
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:11,679
difficult the the baffling is he has

1727
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,719
auto autoflowers he's super auto so

1728
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:17,600
they're like 110 115 days but the

1729
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:19,279
they're bred to be done out here and

1730
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,560
take all these seeded varieties that

1731
01:14:19,279 --> 01:14:23,279
people are breeding indoors and then

1732
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:25,120
throw them into bc yeah alberta yeah

1733
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:27,039
like ontario there's no way you're not

1734
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:28,800
going to have success yeah and and

1735
01:14:27,039 --> 01:14:30,719
that's where people get stopped and i

1736
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:33,039
think also the price of the market is a

1737
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:35,920
little bit ridiculous um when you look

1738
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:37,840
at yield per square foot yeah um when it

1739
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:40,158
comes to seed prod when it comes to any

1740
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,600
sort of seed crop cannabis is is a grain

1741
01:14:40,158 --> 01:14:43,198
when it comes down to it so if you look

1742
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,120
at the volume that you can get per plant

1743
01:14:43,198 --> 01:14:46,719
if you're seeding properly

1744
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:48,640
there shouldn't be five six hundred

1745
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:50,079
dollar packs of seeds for ten you know i

1746
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,719
get there's a there's these new

1747
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:54,000
hotnesses but that's that's not they

1748
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:57,359
shouldn't be that expensive absolutely

1749
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:59,119
not seeds are seeds are very inexpensive

1750
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:01,359
or at least a bigger pack than 10. you

1751
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:02,399
know like give them give them a 25 pack

1752
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:03,439
at least sometimes

1753
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:05,198
i'll do a plug for a friend of mine's

1754
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:07,759
company propagation station they're

1755
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:08,839
based in salmon arm

1756
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:12,079
these

1757
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:14,719
guys are giving very clean genetics

1758
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:16,079
they they if you've got an mma or a npr

1759
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:18,079
you can buy

1760
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:21,279
cuts through them

1761
01:15:18,079 --> 01:15:22,238
and uh jeff's a very dear friend of mine

1762
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:24,800
and

1763
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:27,119
access for the legal market and for end

1764
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,239
users is quite easy

1765
01:15:27,119 --> 01:15:29,359
um

1766
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:31,319
so

1767
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:33,279
if you've got an mma or a

1768
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:34,799
macm pr

1769
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:36,479
you can access

1770
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,840
and then if you can't and you don't have

1771
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:39,678
that you're joe blow and you want to

1772
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,520
grow four plants go buy some seeds from

1773
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:43,199
most dispensaries most dispensaries have

1774
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,159
seeds and they don't go to the one that

1775
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:45,678
does

1776
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:47,439
and ask for them because you ask for

1777
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,960
them and then ask for other products i

1778
01:15:47,439 --> 01:15:50,479
mean we did plug shea earlier and we

1779
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:52,399
should we should remind people that he's

1780
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:55,198
got product coming on on

1781
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:57,679
on legal in ocs yeah ontario market and

1782
01:15:55,198 --> 01:15:58,960
in bc that sarah secrets was really

1783
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:01,119
really nice

1784
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:03,119
if it's not in your dispensary ask for

1785
01:16:01,119 --> 01:16:04,640
it you know like in the next call like

1786
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:05,679
be there requesting it because these are

1787
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,679
the type if you want to support

1788
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:09,520
regenerative farming i mean are they you

1789
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:11,119
would you two would know better like do

1790
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,560
you know anyone else doing regenerative

1791
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:14,319
farming on a

1792
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,320
on a scale

1793
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:21,000
like an lp i mean there's there's true

1794
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:21,000
living soil guys and indoors

1795
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,920
a few of them that are actually doing

1796
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:37,359
like uh we're not regenerative but

1797
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:39,600
they're doing the the aquaponics and

1798
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:41,119
stuff that like caviar aquaponics i mean

1799
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:43,120
and we've seen that we've seen a few

1800
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:44,719
things but you know like even even there

1801
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:47,039
everybody's having some problems and

1802
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:48,480
it's difficult right like it's difficult

1803
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:49,920
it's even difficult one of the

1804
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:51,359
discussions we had with che was you know

1805
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:52,319
it's difficult to give the plant exactly

1806
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:54,158
what it wants

1807
01:16:52,319 --> 01:16:55,840
in regenerative gardening

1808
01:16:54,158 --> 01:16:58,000
it's difficult to change your formula

1809
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:59,840
it's also difficult to flush

1810
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,439
like regenerative gardening is fantastic

1811
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,880
in my opinion

1812
01:17:01,439 --> 01:17:04,000
for extract

1813
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:05,279
all day long if you're harvesting

1814
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,198
trichomes

1815
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:09,039
regenerative is the only way to go you

1816
01:17:07,198 --> 01:17:10,399
get such great flavors i'm about the

1817
01:17:09,039 --> 01:17:11,840
hash though honestly you're about the

1818
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:13,759
hash you're about trichomes you're

1819
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:15,039
harvesting trichomes you should be

1820
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,320
growing degeneratively well that's why

1821
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:17,760
i'm just getting it and actually makes

1822
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:19,519
it a lot easier because that's growing

1823
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,600
over the last few decades and stuff like

1824
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,440
that we go back into the late 80s or i

1825
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,120
mean late 90s early 2000s that's all

1826
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:26,559
we've grown yeah i mean that's it's kind

1827
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:28,158
of like but you're gonna go you're gonna

1828
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,280
diminish yield

1829
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:30,319
yeah i'm not concerned with you're not

1830
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:31,439
concerned about yielding exactly that's

1831
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:33,039
what i'm saying if you're not

1832
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:33,759
considerable yield you're not commercial

1833
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:34,960
yeah

1834
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,480
you definitely should be growing well

1835
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,920
the whole thing is is now we got to take

1836
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:39,919
a look at those two and more importantly

1837
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:43,039
it's very mentally friendly

1838
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:45,600
your your your quality is incredible you

1839
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:48,238
can incorporate the practices in you

1840
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:50,880
know using a mulch you know it's just

1841
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:51,839
stopping with the sprains absolutely you

1842
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,480
know

1843
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:56,159
there's there's sprays who sprays

1844
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:57,919
pesticides these days

1845
01:17:56,158 --> 01:17:59,599
a lot of people they shouldn't be and i

1846
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:01,920
don't know many at all they also

1847
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,760
everybody's doing biological things

1848
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:05,600
right now old school dude

1849
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,440
every year i get the smell bottom of it

1850
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:09,199
sephora alex you know the product

1851
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:10,639
what do you think of that product

1852
01:18:09,198 --> 01:18:12,559
you know what i i don't really want to

1853
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:14,480
give my opinion on if i love it or if i

1854
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:15,679
don't love it um i'm just curious

1855
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:17,678
because i picked it up and i know it's

1856
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:19,600
it's it's a it's a health canada proof

1857
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:22,000
product yeah right and i know it's

1858
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:23,520
basically a form of a neem oil yeah i'm

1859
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,640
understanding so i know we have to talk

1860
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,719
about other things but i mean it's a

1861
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:28,000
product that it's

1862
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:30,000
they can't even work great for powdered

1863
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
milk i'll give you my theory on this

1864
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,479
every time okay there's a couple things

1865
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,719
in no other crop production in the world

1866
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:39,198
do we accept powdery mildew in this

1867
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:41,679
methodology on commercial scale

1868
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:43,759
right so if you have powdery mildew

1869
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:45,199
genetics i mean there's probably a

1870
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:46,640
there's a shit ton of other stuff out

1871
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:47,678
there to find something that doesn't

1872
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:48,800
absolutely

1873
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:50,480
there's a tree

1874
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,920
right now maple tree attempted if you've

1875
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:53,519
got one this is what you're going to do

1876
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,480
you're going to penetrate it into this

1877
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,080
absolutely right you create an

1878
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:56,879
expectation for these products and then

1879
01:18:56,079 --> 01:18:59,359
you have to grow them in those

1880
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:00,640
particular places and every time you see

1881
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:03,119
you cut down powder you'll do you

1882
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:04,640
restrict yeah you have to every time you

1883
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:07,279
take something away it comes back to

1884
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:09,039
full i said i cut down bugs and i went

1885
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:10,719
for

1886
01:19:09,039 --> 01:19:12,000
life change i had to go for surgery

1887
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:13,359
stuff happens i tried to grow a crop of

1888
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,560
weed it wasn't going to happen and i was

1889
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:15,679
like okay you know what i don't have

1890
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,960
time to deal with this so it was just

1891
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:18,399
easier to cut it down and get it right

1892
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,679
down get rid of it because it creates a

1893
01:19:18,399 --> 01:19:21,198
headache i think that video did well for

1894
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:24,640
you didn't it did it went and it was the

1895
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:24,639
two million mark they took it down

1896
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,039
and you know it was even like uh

1897
01:19:27,119 --> 01:19:31,198
growing from seed you know that was a

1898
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:32,800
5.5 million views and and the whole

1899
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:34,399
thing is is when they're able to get to

1900
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:36,400
that reach and be able to teach people

1901
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:38,238
about taxi this is what you should do

1902
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:39,759
i just don't seem to like that but i

1903
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:41,678
mean we're here we're discussing these

1904
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,280
same things and what you need to do like

1905
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:44,800
you're getting these problems you need

1906
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:46,319
to get rid of order you need to find out

1907
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:48,560
where the problem is coming from and how

1908
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:50,158
you can adapt to it and then find the

1909
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,600
pattern that's causing it and if you can

1910
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:52,960
find a genetic that doesn't have the

1911
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,560
problems to begin with you've

1912
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,920
circumvented the issue that's fine so

1913
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:58,159
say you've had a genetic

1914
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:00,000
problems over the last 15 or 20 years

1915
01:19:58,158 --> 01:20:01,519
take it back to take it back to culture

1916
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,039
so you take it past the petri culture so

1917
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:04,400
what i like doing is i like cutting just

1918
01:20:03,039 --> 01:20:05,600
going in the flower week or two in the

1919
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:07,519
flower taking that cutting when that

1920
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,280
roots take another cutting yeah right

1921
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,880
away so i'll flip this a couple times

1922
01:20:09,279 --> 01:20:12,000
with the strain in order to ensure

1923
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:14,000
something because i'm just taking care

1924
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,600
of this one thing i mean people have to

1925
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,840
understand it because people don't have

1926
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:19,600
tissue cultures

1927
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:21,520
viruses viruses and pathogens can't keep

1928
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:22,239
up with the growth of a plant

1929
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:24,320
so

1930
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:25,759
if you grab off the apical meristem but

1931
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:27,119
if you're i mean honestly that's why you

1932
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:29,119
should go to a cellular level on the

1933
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:30,880
very very top of the plant and what a

1934
01:20:29,119 --> 01:20:32,880
cells need

1935
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,319
pardon oh i'm on the cell thing cells

1936
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:36,079
need oxygen and water because they're

1937
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:37,198
just going in the microbiology of the

1938
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:39,119
plants and stuff like that and i'm

1939
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:41,198
talking about our human cells and cells

1940
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:43,039
need oxygen and water to survive and get

1941
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:44,238
through things so we've got to start

1942
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:45,439
yeah it's

1943
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:47,119
but they need more than that they need

1944
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:48,719
laughter they need humor they need they

1945
01:20:47,119 --> 01:20:50,559
need good food they need the right

1946
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:52,000
environment i mean we're no different

1947
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,520
than plants

1948
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,119
right if you want to thrive and you want

1949
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,400
plant that thrives you got to thrive

1950
01:20:55,119 --> 01:20:58,479
honestly we go back to our original

1951
01:20:56,399 --> 01:21:00,638
roots of how we lived exactly like we're

1952
01:20:58,479 --> 01:21:02,559
so disconnected as a people thank you

1953
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:04,719
very much for that because we are as in

1954
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:06,320
all uh as a whole as well

1955
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:08,319
on a different tangent but so here

1956
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:09,759
here's a question that that i have

1957
01:21:08,319 --> 01:21:10,639
because you're feeling my energy and you

1958
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,719
know we're gonna get into this

1959
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:14,719
conversation maybe marcus can i get you

1960
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:16,319
in on this one too come on over i got i

1961
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:18,319
got a good question for you guys that i

1962
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:20,639
would i would like to ask you guys as a

1963
01:21:18,319 --> 01:21:22,799
group if you don't mind yeah you do yeah

1964
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:25,359
you kind of have to hold the microphone

1965
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,800
here take my mic

1966
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:29,039
no here i'll step out you guys you guys

1967
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,440
are cooler than me anyway you're behind

1968
01:21:29,039 --> 01:21:33,600
i need to shuffle away um but anyway and

1969
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:35,599
make sure i got a bread thing i got like

1970
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:36,719
this beautiful giant cinnamon dough

1971
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,920
thing it's going to blow your mind and i

1972
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:39,039
got to chat with nicole because we're

1973
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,920
going to have some snacks coming up here

1974
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:41,600
in a little bit we'll take a little

1975
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:43,279
break and do a little bit of a giveaways

1976
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,120
but one question that i'd love to ask

1977
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:47,519
you guys before we step away from this

1978
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:49,679
is like how do we support the smaller

1979
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:52,719
market and how do we develop the places

1980
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:54,239
like uh rosebud farms as a community and

1981
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:55,119
as as a way we want to see it move

1982
01:21:54,238 --> 01:21:56,559
forward because that's a lot of what

1983
01:21:55,119 --> 01:22:00,319
we're touching on is the health of the

1984
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:00,320
planet how do we deal with we

1985
01:22:00,560 --> 01:22:03,039
you have to support these farmers by

1986
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,399
supporting them by getting their

1987
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:06,079
information out there and making sure

1988
01:22:04,399 --> 01:22:07,439
people know that they're around because

1989
01:22:06,079 --> 01:22:08,719
we have to get them to the community and

1990
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:10,479
people have to have access and they're

1991
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:12,239
not knowing that they're around so as in

1992
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:14,000
we as a whole like we did as activists

1993
01:22:12,238 --> 01:22:15,198
we got to keep pushing these united

1994
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,399
farmers that's where you got to get it

1995
01:22:15,198 --> 01:22:18,000
from these are the companies you should

1996
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:19,679
be dealing with and the more that we do

1997
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,960
that for that individual companies in a

1998
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:22,480
time the nice thing about the craft

1999
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,679
market right like the craft market's got

2000
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:24,559
to be pushed and we got to push these

2001
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:26,079
people

2002
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,600
what craft is on the market where are

2003
01:22:26,079 --> 01:22:29,198
you buying a craft well this company

2004
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,520
here grows up to whoever is doing it

2005
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:32,638
whatever companies whoever's got that

2006
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,880
craft then we got to push those

2007
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:36,719
companies i like supporting like

2008
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,639
small boutique vineyards i like

2009
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:42,319
supporting the small guy i mean i'd way

2010
01:22:38,639 --> 01:22:43,600
rather have something that's unique

2011
01:22:42,319 --> 01:22:45,439
it's kind of like anything it's amazing

2012
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,480
genuinely had love put into it you know

2013
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:49,439
it's not

2014
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:51,039
see for me i like supporting

2015
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:52,638
whoever's putting love and creating

2016
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:55,198
great products whether they be big

2017
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:57,440
medium or small yeah i support them if

2018
01:22:55,198 --> 01:22:59,198
you're making great product i support

2019
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:00,559
you yeah and that's that's just the way

2020
01:22:59,198 --> 01:23:01,919
it's got to be and you know we've

2021
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:03,440
already seen the pattern of the large

2022
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:06,000
companies coming in and putting a lot of

2023
01:23:03,439 --> 01:23:08,079
kind of mediocre low-quality flower out

2024
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,840
and you know that's i mean i noticed

2025
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:11,600
today i think it was

2026
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,840
texo

2027
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:17,840
it was tilray and it was another big

2028
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:17,840
company weeds whoever's the weed

2029
01:23:18,479 --> 01:23:23,198
they were down like 34 14

2030
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:26,719
and 23

2031
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:29,519
each of them in sales in market position

2032
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:31,520
and that was noticeably from smaller

2033
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:32,880
craft companies that are coming in

2034
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,239
they're not grabbing all of that but

2035
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,679
they're grabbing like two percent and

2036
01:23:34,238 --> 01:23:37,678
another one's grabbing one point five

2037
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:38,960
and another one's grabbing four once you

2038
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:41,199
add up enough

2039
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:43,600
you know people like i mean chase shay

2040

believes what he's doing he believes in

2045
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:57,119
what he's doing and and i i cannot

2046
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,400
believe that when you talk to him when

2047
01:23:57,119 --> 01:23:59,920
you hang out with him yeah exactly he's

2048
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:02,319
definitely not just you know talking

2049
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:04,000
shit like he's you feel the authenticity

2050
01:24:02,319 --> 01:24:05,840
when you talk to him and the sort of

2051
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:07,279
passion in his voice

2052
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:09,360
it's one of the reasons why i'm excited

2053
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:11,920
to go to the unicorn cup and you know i

2054
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:14,238
think he's on the right path with you

2055
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:16,000
know yes dude you know he's in the legal

2056
01:24:14,238 --> 01:24:18,000
a lot of a lot of people who are

2057
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,760
regenerative and in the sustainable side

2058
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,600
have really stayed

2059
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,280
in the gray market they haven't been

2060
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,719
able to flip especially when if you

2061
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:27,119
think of dragonfly earth medicine they

2062
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:29,439
have this certification that you can't

2063
01:24:27,119 --> 01:24:31,439
even get in the lp market yeah so as

2064
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:34,000
much as you want to be regenerative you

2065
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:35,198
can only be so regenerative in the lp

2066
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,198
mark you're not allowed to have goats

2067
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:39,439
and cows and chickens on your on your

2068
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:41,119
cannabis farm like interacting with your

2069
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:43,678
of course your soil it's it's going

2070
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:45,599
towards you know it's it's you it's

2071
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:47,760
but it could be how do you buy that weed

2072
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:49,760
man so would i and i have bought it in

2073
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,440
the past and it's uh it's a wonderful

2074
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:53,360
thing at the same time

2075
01:24:51,439 --> 01:24:55,519
you know i see people doing things

2076
01:24:53,359 --> 01:24:58,479
outside of the box i see people

2077
01:24:55,520 --> 01:25:00,719
i've seen people grow exceptional flour

2078
01:24:58,479 --> 01:25:02,479
which makes exceptional hash

2079
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:05,520
in almost every way that you can grow

2080
01:25:02,479 --> 01:25:08,718
cannabis with salts organically

2081
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:11,280
hydroponically aquaponically in earth in

2082
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:13,279
soilless i mean i've just seen six star

2083
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:15,920
resin come out of all of those things so

2084
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:16,960
at that point it becomes semantics

2085
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,480
of

2086
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:19,920
you know what do you want to support

2087
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:22,000
which which one of those because they'll

2088
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:23,199
all produce incredible product if you

2089
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,399
have the right people and the right

2090
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:27,039
genetics

2091
01:25:24,399 --> 01:25:27,039
the right people

2092
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:33,759
you know there's a lot of guys that just

2093
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:36,399
walk into this

2094
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:38,639
that kill it their first second third

2095
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:39,679
crop you normally do one there are blank

2096
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,880
slates so they've not learned a whole

2097
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:43,039
bunch of bad

2098
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:45,440
that can be huge in our industry a whole

2099
01:25:43,039 --> 01:25:46,719
bunch of bad information

2100
01:25:45,439 --> 01:25:48,238
uh two

2101
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:49,840
they've got a willingness

2102
01:25:48,238 --> 01:25:52,000
so i'm really

2103
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,039
you know i i get excited

2104
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,039
to see

2105
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:58,079
the next what's coming up around the

2106
01:25:55,039 --> 01:26:00,479
corner me too don't lock yourself in

2107
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:02,319
keep it open and allow for anything to

2108
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:03,359
move in and surprise you absolutely you

2109
01:26:02,319 --> 01:26:04,880
know and that's why when you guys were

2110
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:06,880
saying oh i would support the little guy

2111
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,719
it's like i'll support anyone if they're

2112
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,800
doing everything right absolutely you

2113
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:12,319
know that's who deserves to be surprised

2114
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:14,639
let's be honest like

2115
01:26:12,319 --> 01:26:16,479
craft is amazing but we are going to

2116
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:17,600
need to get to a place

2117
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:20,479
where

2118
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:22,719
some groups of people can produce enough

2119
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:25,279
for the country absolutely not for the

2120
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:26,719
neighborhood not for the you know the

2121
01:26:25,279 --> 01:26:28,880
county or the

2122
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:30,079
village or the for the you know

2123
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:32,319
for the two people

2124
01:26:30,079 --> 01:26:33,439
exactly and it's not there yet but it's

2125
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:35,279
definitely

2126
01:26:33,439 --> 01:26:37,759
and five ten years ago i don't think any

2127
01:26:35,279 --> 01:26:39,439
of us would have been able to imagine

2128

01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,560
like we talked about marketing it was a

2159
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:55,039
nice 80s

2160
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:58,800
is uh the

2161
01:27:55,039 --> 01:28:02,880
the way things are evolving and

2162
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:06,239

know i'm trying to think of that well i

2170
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:20,639
was kind of talking about the um how

2171
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:22,639
everyone wants their hash to be like the

2172
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:24,480
lightest color oh yeah and sort of it

2173
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:26,239
was kind of like this instagram thing of

2174
01:28:24,479 --> 01:28:28,319
like

2175
01:28:26,238 --> 01:28:30,479
well it reminds me of los angeles where

2176
01:28:28,319 --> 01:28:32,399
back in the 90s you know los angeles

2177
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:34,319
just wanted this flower that was the

2178
01:28:32,399 --> 01:28:37,519
equivalent of like a blond-haired

2179
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:39,840
blue-eyed fake boobs hash racist as you

2180
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:42,159

2181
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,440
the color is awesome there's good

2182
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:45,439
there's some like the some of the best

2183
01:28:43,439 --> 01:28:46,079
hash i've ever made in my life has been

2184
01:28:45,439 --> 01:28:47,359
in

2185
01:28:46,079 --> 01:28:49,840
barcelona

2186
01:28:47,359 --> 01:28:52,639
jamaica these countries do not produce

2187
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:55,960
white hash they produce ambers and it's

2188
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:55,960
all colors

2189
01:28:56,158 --> 01:28:59,359
exist because they're aging it because

2190
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:02,319
they want more cbn well that's it you

2191
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:05,039
know so i'm not i'm i'm a fan of like

2192
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:06,960
once again i'll support hash

2193
01:29:05,039 --> 01:29:08,319
that is and i see people doing this for

2194
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:10,079
this advantage of like well i'm just

2195
01:29:08,319 --> 01:29:11,840
trying to get it sold and if it's too

2196
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:14,000
dark it won't sell it's like that's a

2197
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:15,520
bullshit concept

2198
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,719
how about we educate people that the

2199
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,480
color

2200
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:20,239
is just showing you that

2201
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:22,079
this particular group of volatile

2202
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:23,519
organic compounds along with these

2203
01:29:22,079 --> 01:29:25,760
cannabinoids

2204
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,440
and the oxidization it's it needs to

2205
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,639
change a little bit stronger

2206
01:29:27,439 --> 01:29:30,960
numbers you know the same way on

2207
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:33,520
instagram everything you know and i tell

2208
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:35,600
my wife this and my daughter like

2209
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:36,639
i saw one the other day that it was like

2210
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,880
basically

2211
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:41,119
it was a woman showing her body in a

2212
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:42,639
bikini and then next to it was her as

2213
01:29:41,119 --> 01:29:43,920
well but she was photoshopping it she

2214
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:45,679
was like this is

2215
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,279
what everything is on instagram and it

2216
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:48,560
wasn't her

2217
01:29:47,279 --> 01:29:50,399
her waist was super tight and her

2218
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:52,960
breasts were way bigger and her legs

2219
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:54,960
were all like she just did all these key

2220
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:57,119
things to make it so she was saying

2221
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:59,279
don't believe anything you see on

2222
01:29:57,119 --> 01:30:01,119
instagram i think the cannabis community

2223
01:29:59,279 --> 01:30:03,840
could do better i think we could show

2224
01:30:01,119 --> 01:30:06,238
the truth and show that there's value in

2225
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:07,119
all of these different ages and colors

2226
01:30:06,238 --> 01:30:08,638
and

2227
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:11,359
aspects of

2228
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:13,600
variables of hash just smell it

2229
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:15,759
like it's so floral

2230
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:18,320
i need to do a dab yeah right that is

2231
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:18,320
very floral

2232
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:21,920
and it's and it's got color yeah

2233
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:23,199
you know it's gonna probably give you a

2234
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,880
yellow orange

2235
01:30:23,198 --> 01:30:26,879
it's gonna give you an effect

2236
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:28,639
right and if that effect works with your

2237
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:31,520
own in the cannabinoid system

2238
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:32,960
and it really you know gives you that

2239
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:34,960
wow yeah

2240
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,399
that's good that's good

2241
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,760
that's it that's what matters that's it

2242
01:30:36,399 --> 01:30:40,079
it's it's this

2243
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:41,039
sort of foam mentality everyone wants

2244
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:43,198
something they can't get that they're

2245
01:30:41,039 --> 01:30:44,639
seeing on instagram and

2246
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:46,719
then when they get it it's like well was

2247
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:48,159
it even

2248
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:49,920
honest i've smoked a lot of instagram

2249
01:30:48,158 --> 01:30:51,920
hash from famous

2250
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:53,359
makers some of it is blowing my mind and

2251
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:55,119
some of it

2252
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:57,279
just didn't impress me at all it was

2253
01:30:55,119 --> 01:31:01,158
just like it was like

2254
01:30:57,279 --> 01:31:01,158
something so you know what this is

2255
01:31:03,279 --> 01:31:07,840
get away from this bullshit um

2256
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,840
you know

2257
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:14,159
i love natural

2258
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:14,159
i don't want my wife to have

2259
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:16,960
i normally

2260
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:31,920
and that shines through everything yeah

2261
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:33,359
and you can't you can't fake that you

2262
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:35,039
can't fake it and

2263
01:31:33,359 --> 01:31:37,920
honestly

2264
01:31:35,039 --> 01:31:38,880
she's aesthetically very pretty

2265
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:41,119
and

2266
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:42,000
other women can be a bit like oh she's

2267
01:31:41,119 --> 01:31:43,920
no

2268
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,600
the moment they talk to her they're like

2269
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:46,960
holy shit

2270
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,960
she's as real as it gets you know

2271
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:51,039
breeder steve said it best

2272
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:53,520
variety is the spice of life yeah and

2273
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:55,279
that that was his company spice of life

2274
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,239
seed yes yeah it's like let's create

2275
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:57,679
things

2276
01:31:56,238 --> 01:31:59,759
that are different totally you know

2277
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:02,239
there's always going to be that popular

2278
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:03,440
like oh okay we all want this extremely

2279
01:32:02,238 --> 01:32:04,799
premature

2280
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:06,238
freeze-dried

2281
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:08,079
white hash

2282
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:10,319
then there's always a real appreciation

2283
01:32:08,079 --> 01:32:12,719
for the actual color that's going

2284
01:32:10,319 --> 01:32:14,799
absolutely i have probably 12 or 15

2285
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:16,719
different hashes here and they all have

2286
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:18,400
different colors and different smells

2287
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:19,359
you know different effects yeah i love

2288
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:21,839
them all

2289
01:32:19,359 --> 01:32:23,839
you know for different times totally

2290
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:27,600
so i could have seen in my house there's

2291
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:29,600
like 15 different kinds in front of me

2292
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:31,199
that's if you get the the flavors and

2293
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:33,360
the different terpenes and the different

2294
01:32:31,198 --> 01:32:35,198
times when you need it so each different

2295
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:36,719
strains affecting you in different ways

2296
01:32:35,198 --> 01:32:39,759
but you haven't heard of us

2297
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:42,000
i want a 35 thc no but it's not about

2298
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:44,079
the thc which sometimes it is because i

2299
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,920
like a heavy hit i like that hot dab

2300
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:47,760
because i need that effect but it's

2301
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:50,399
understanding these profiles and these

2302
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:53,840
strains all those cabinets work together

2303
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:55,519
and we really have no understanding no

2304
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:57,360
we still think all the volatiles are

2305
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:58,800
terpenes yeah you know everyone's

2306
01:32:57,359 --> 01:33:00,238
talking about terpenes but no one's

2307
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:02,400
talking about all these other organic

2308
01:33:00,238 --> 01:33:04,638
compounds that are also volatile that

2309
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:06,719
also shift the profile of flavor and

2310
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:08,800
taste and modulation

2311
01:33:06,719 --> 01:33:10,960
in the plants yeah and there's a lot of

2312
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,480
them yeah you know i mean my my a good

2313
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,639
friend of mine nick ziegler who worked

2314
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:17,039
at yakima chief hops for years and years

2315
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:21,359
developing different hops

2316
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:24,000
he found 1440 thials in hops like

2317
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:25,198
hundred and forty they think there's 180

2318
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,719
terpenes

2319
01:33:25,198 --> 01:33:28,399
present in cannabis he's thinking

2320
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:31,600
there's probably at least a thousand

2321
01:33:28,399 --> 01:33:33,599
present in cannabis as well of files

2322
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:34,960
that is an enormous amount and that if

2323
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:37,920
you think of that as a little kind of

2324
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:40,639
pebble that the that the profile sits on

2325
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:42,319
like an upside down pyramid sure

2326
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:44,400
the point of the pyramid is sitting on

2327
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:46,399
these very small

2328
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:48,158
you know profile of volatile organic

2329
01:33:46,399 --> 01:33:49,119
compounds but depending on how that

2330
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:51,839
shifts

2331
01:33:49,119 --> 01:33:54,319
it can shift that triangle to the left

2332
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:56,639
or to the right in a very profound way

2333
01:33:54,319 --> 01:33:58,238
yeah and we're just we're just literally

2334
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:01,039
learning about that now which is why

2335
01:33:58,238 --> 01:34:02,319
every single crop of the same strain

2336
01:34:01,039 --> 01:34:04,399
is different it's different that's

2337
01:34:02,319 --> 01:34:06,399
exactly that's why trying to create a

2338
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:08,319
medicine with cannabis that it leads

2339
01:34:06,399 --> 01:34:09,759
actually beautifully into

2340
01:34:08,319 --> 01:34:11,840
you know a lot of people from where we

2341
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:13,119
come from the sort of heady aspect of

2342
01:34:11,840 --> 01:34:15,279
cannabis

2343
01:34:13,119 --> 01:34:17,599
a lot of the people they'll say it's all

2344
01:34:15,279 --> 01:34:20,399
about full spectrum not about

2345
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:22,159
mono-molecular isolates but when you

2346
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:23,839
understand what you just said is a

2347
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:25,839
universal truth that you'll never get

2348
01:34:23,840 --> 01:34:27,440
the same thing twice

2349
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:28,719
then you understand that when you find

2350
01:34:27,439 --> 01:34:31,279
something that works for a group of

2351
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:33,119
people you need to take it apart

2352
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:34,319
figure out everything that's there which

2353
01:34:33,119 --> 01:34:36,559
we haven't been able to do because we

2354
01:34:34,319 --> 01:34:38,079
don't count test for thials and thia

2355
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:40,080
weights

2356
01:34:38,079 --> 01:34:42,319
but being able to get that broken down

2357
01:34:40,079 --> 01:34:44,880
to exactly what it is and then recreate

2358
01:34:42,319 --> 01:34:47,039
it with mono molecular isolates would be

2359
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:48,319
profound for medical patients well this

2360
01:34:47,039 --> 01:34:49,600
is what i've always said you know that's

2361
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:51,279
that is the future of cannabis by the

2362
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,560
way yeah for for patients it is

2363
01:34:51,279 --> 01:34:55,118
absolutely it is because medicine you

2364
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:56,560
know like how about your standardizing

2365
01:34:55,118 --> 01:34:58,079
haley's trying to use the haley's

2366
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:00,000
comment and her mom's calling me all the

2367
01:34:58,079 --> 01:35:01,439
time going this time it doesn't work i

2368
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,800
know it worked last time it doesn't work

2369
01:35:01,439 --> 01:35:04,879
this time it's crazy i have a

2370
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:06,400
catastrophically ill child and be

2371
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,319
dealing with a medicine that just stops

2372
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:10,638
working that's it you have to figure out

2373
01:35:08,319 --> 01:35:12,960
exactly what it is recreate it

2374
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:15,199
and then and then have that be that

2375
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:17,359
thing so but it's not only it's not only

2376
01:35:15,198 --> 01:35:18,158
the cannabinoids to be given off the

2377
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:19,759
same

2378
01:35:18,158 --> 01:35:21,519
it's everything that's in there it's

2379
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:23,679
everything that's in there to get all

2380
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:26,000
those ratios correct is gonna take i

2381
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:27,600
always thought of this picture a box

2382
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,000
right a picture a big box and it's got

2383
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,440
little vials in it and you've got all

2384
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,600
the different cannabinoids and you've

2385
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:35,839
got all sorts of terpenes and files and

2386
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:37,920
thy weights and imagine that they sit

2387
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:39,760
upside down like the same way you could

2388
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:41,760
poke in with a syringe and pull out

2389
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,520
material they sit in this box and you've

2390
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:46,400
got the box and you're dialing in the

2391
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:48,239
profile of the herb you like the best

2392
01:35:46,399 --> 01:35:50,319
maybe you've got another box that tests

2393
01:35:48,238 --> 01:35:52,238
the herb to give you the readouts that

2394
01:35:50,319 --> 01:35:54,719
allow you to recreate the readouts with

2395
01:35:52,238 --> 01:35:57,519
this box and see how close you can get

2396
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:59,359
your your dab or your hit yeah to

2397
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:01,040
directly the medicinal components that

2398
01:35:59,359 --> 01:36:02,960
you require and then the next part of it

2399
01:36:01,039 --> 01:36:05,519
is dude that's that's that is the future

2400
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:06,560
by the way the next part of it is

2401
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:08,080
being able to

2402
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:10,800
dial in your own endocrine abdominal

2403
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:13,279
system and say this is you exactly

2404
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:14,480
and this is exactly what you need yeah

2405
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:16,319
and these are going to be all the

2406
01:36:14,479 --> 01:36:17,839
triggers that fire off all those

2407
01:36:16,319 --> 01:36:19,679
different endocrine bodies in your head

2408
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:20,400
well that's pretty amazing

2409
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:22,000
that's

2410
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:24,719
that is the future we're a long way off

2411
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,840
i think yeah i think so too no like

2412
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:27,920
we're coming up

2413
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:30,480
well you know what don't get me wrong ai

2414
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:32,239
nothing happens ai could occur

2415
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:34,638
and if ai occurred

2416
01:36:32,238 --> 01:36:36,839
and we were able to ask ai how do we do

2417
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:38,800
this it would be answered very quickly

2418
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,840
yeah think ai is going to i think ai's

2419
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,279
there's gonna come a point where ai

2420
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:43,440
looks at us and goes

2421
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:45,679
you're not relevant anymore so fuck off

2422
01:36:43,439 --> 01:36:47,439
it's possible but we unless we're

2423
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:49,520
delusional yeah

2424
01:36:47,439 --> 01:36:51,439
of how relevant we are

2425
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:53,119
because we are unique there's no denying

2426
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:54,719
it it's like we're used to ourselves and

2427
01:36:53,118 --> 01:36:56,639
we look at ourselves as parasites and we

2428
01:36:54,719 --> 01:36:59,039
make all sorts of mistakes but there's

2429
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:00,960
nothing else on this planet like us

2430
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:02,719
that's thinking and sentient and

2431
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:04,000
creating and manufacturing and

2432
01:37:02,719 --> 01:37:06,719
processing

2433
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,560
yeah it's it's so crazy that i can't

2434
01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:10,960
imagine a.i

2435
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,080
coming up with oh let's just get rid of

2436
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:14,158
them over

2437
01:37:12,079 --> 01:37:16,880
wow there's a huge value here in the

2438
01:37:14,158 --> 01:37:19,359
human race and and this is this is where

2439
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:22,159
it lies and then projecting out just you

2440
01:37:19,359 --> 01:37:24,799
know i i had a uh very interesting

2441
01:37:22,158 --> 01:37:25,839
evening once at a

2442
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:27,920
uh

2443
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:30,319
owner's meeting

2444
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:32,079
for pnw in whistler

2445
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:33,439
yeah and mark you might want to hear

2446
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:34,639
this because this is

2447
01:37:33,439 --> 01:37:36,479
he can hear you i ended up watching the

2448
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:38,639
joe rogan uh

2449
01:37:36,479 --> 01:37:40,879
and uh elon musk podcast they got into

2450
01:37:38,639 --> 01:37:43,760
ai yeah and i was already very

2451
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:45,600
heightened i was already very lifted

2452
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:46,880
borderline mangled

2453
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,480
and

2454
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:50,560
it was profound

2455
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:52,799
it was profound to me and i was like

2456
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:55,039
when when a guy like elon musk is

2457
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:56,239
talking about ai and going

2458
01:37:55,039 --> 01:37:57,600
it's tipped

2459
01:37:56,238 --> 01:38:00,839
it's tipped

2460
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:03,280
and it's not able to be controlled i was

2461
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:05,760
just you know

2462
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:08,238
it won't be able to be controlled so

2463
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:10,639
i hope ai looks at us as relevant and

2464
01:38:08,238 --> 01:38:10,638
important

2465
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:15,439
there's a really great book

2466
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:17,440
from 1988 called engines of creation and

2467
01:38:15,439 --> 01:38:19,919
it's by eric k drexler

2468
01:38:17,439 --> 01:38:22,319
and he coined the term nanotechnology

2469
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:24,960
and so in that book he goes through all

2470
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:26,719
sorts of cool concepts of nanotechnology

2471
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:28,800
and he talks about how nanotechnology

2472
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:30,639
won't be created by humans but it'll be

2473
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:32,880
created by a.i

2474
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:35,039
uh he wrote a new book like 25 years

2475
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,639
later called radical abundance and if

2476
01:38:35,039 --> 01:38:38,079
you really want to open your mind like

2477
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:40,880
check out both of those books i should

2478
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:44,198
avoid both engines of creation

2479
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:44,199
no it's amazing

2480
01:38:45,750 --> 01:38:48,960
[Laughter]

2481
01:38:57,279 --> 01:39:02,479
i i understand the excitement

2482
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:02,480
and the potential of

2483
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:05,520
because it's the next evolution of

2484
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,359
humanity

2485
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:09,760
i just hope that the humanity stays part

2486
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:11,519
of it forthcoming gotta read this book

2487

so it's uh we kind of got the whole

3470
02:23:34,799 --> 02:23:39,679
process down to a science and a lot of

3471
02:23:37,680 --> 02:23:41,760
canadian glass been sold over the years

3472
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:42,880
a lot of events and showcases we've done

3473
02:23:41,760 --> 02:23:44,719
and uh

3474
02:23:42,879 --> 02:23:46,318
yeah it's been a fun ride and it's

3475
02:23:44,719 --> 02:23:47,920
really fun being kind of the niche that

3476
02:23:46,318 --> 02:23:50,478
we do as well and

3477
02:23:47,920 --> 02:23:52,159
kind of setting ourselves apart and uh

3478
02:23:50,478 --> 02:23:54,719
we were the first in canada to do it

3479
02:23:52,159 --> 02:23:56,239
like 100 canadian as well so yeah so

3480
02:23:54,719 --> 02:23:58,398
you're you're promoting having a good

3481
02:23:56,239 --> 02:24:02,000
time exactly right now what is the best

3482
02:23:58,398 --> 02:24:04,239
way to take a dab so uh we have the you

3483
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:05,760
get your piece with the with a quartz

3484
02:24:04,239 --> 02:24:07,840
banger on it we've got nine different

3485
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:08,880
ones some true courts to choose from and

3486
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:10,719
uh

3487
02:24:08,879 --> 02:24:13,119
basically you heat it up with a torch

3488
02:24:10,719 --> 02:24:14,959
and then you have a sensor like the dab

3489
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:16,560
right that's on the table there and

3490
02:24:14,959 --> 02:24:18,318
it'll be able to measure the perfect

3491
02:24:16,559 --> 02:24:19,760
temperature for your dab it's called a

3492
02:24:18,318 --> 02:24:21,760
dab right because after you use it

3493
02:24:19,760 --> 02:24:23,840
you'll never dab wrong again

3494
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:26,398
until the sensor clogs yeah but that's

3495
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:28,880
but that's user maintenance you know you

3496
02:24:26,398 --> 02:24:30,799
got to keep up on that we're always

3497
02:24:28,879 --> 02:24:33,358
learning

3498
02:24:30,799 --> 02:24:35,840
yeah so um it's yeah that's the way to

3499
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:37,760
take a dab and then you cap the top on

3500
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:39,520
one of these slurpers and feed your dab

3501
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:42,639
through the bottom and uh

3502
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:45,439
yeah and uh on to the next

3503

has always come from

3520
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:20,639
little

3521
02:25:17,280 --> 02:25:23,600
backwoods places and and

3522
02:25:20,639 --> 02:25:26,239
from people that are you know

3523
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:28,479
kind of uh paved the way of a lot of

3524
02:25:26,239 --> 02:25:30,719
movements like maybe even organic food

3525
02:25:28,478 --> 02:25:33,840
and stuff is kind of influenced by

3526
02:25:30,719 --> 02:25:35,920
people from weed so to kind of

3527
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:38,159
embrace what the island has always been

3528
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:40,000

3529
02:25:38,159 --> 02:25:41,760
in especially in canada

3530
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,959
known vancouver island

celebrate that and i started with uh

3535
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:53,920
doing seed swaps because i thought well

3536
02:25:51,600 --> 02:25:55,760
that's a way to for us as small growers

3537
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:59,120
to get to know each other and

3538

i'm uh jonathan with uh green amber

3560
02:26:40,239 --> 02:26:44,478
canada we're based out of the okanagan

3561
02:26:42,478 --> 02:26:46,719
in british columbia

3562
02:26:44,478 --> 02:26:48,639
we've been

3563
02:26:46,719 --> 02:26:50,000
been growing pretty good weed for the

3564
02:26:48,639 --> 02:26:52,000
past few years

3565
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:53,680
um and that's the respect to british

3566
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:55,439
columbians and the hard work that

3567
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:56,720
they've put in all the many years that

3568
02:26:55,439 --> 02:26:59,520
they've been growing marijuana and i've

3569
02:26:56,719 --> 02:27:01,599
recognized that myself being part of the

3570
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:02,800
part of the uh the industry for a very

3571
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:06,079
long time

3572
02:27:02,799 --> 02:27:07,759
so we grow good weed and uh we we do so

3573
02:27:06,079 --> 02:27:09,920
through our lighting um so we develop

3574
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:12,478
some lighting that is helpful for not

3575
02:27:09,920 --> 02:27:14,079
only you know the the home grower but

3576
02:27:12,478 --> 02:27:15,519
definitely the commercial grower you

3577
02:27:14,079 --> 02:27:17,439
designed your own lights yeah right

3578
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:19,280
we've designed our own lights and uh we

3579
02:27:17,439 --> 02:27:21,280
tested them out in the okanagan for

3580
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:24,000
about two years in different

3581
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:25,280
uh environments and uh over that time

3582
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:27,120
period we saw

3583
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:28,880
trends that we've recognized that we've

3584
02:27:27,120 --> 02:27:31,200
now have and we use that in the

3585
02:27:28,879 --> 02:27:32,159
algorithms in our lighting that can help

3586
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:33,840
you grow

3587
02:27:32,159 --> 02:27:35,920
but at the same time if you are a

3588
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:38,000
smaller grower you are more of a craft

3589
02:27:35,920 --> 02:27:40,559
grower that really likes the art

3590
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:42,079
of growing marijuana then these lights

3591
02:27:40,559 --> 02:27:45,359
give you those bells and muscles that

3592
02:27:42,079 --> 02:27:46,719
help you do that and that's what i've

3593
02:27:45,359 --> 02:27:49,280
been doing for the last little while

3594
02:27:46,719 --> 02:27:51,119
while we're building out our facility um

3595
02:27:49,280 --> 02:27:53,439
but uh it does

3596
02:27:51,120 --> 02:27:56,079
help the average grower

3597
02:27:53,439 --> 02:27:58,000
know a little bit of how say the sun

3598
02:27:56,079 --> 02:28:00,639
travels through the sky traditionally

3599
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:02,318
for cannabis yeah

3600
02:28:00,639 --> 02:28:04,239
so what is special about your lights

3601
02:28:02,318 --> 02:28:04,739
that is different from others

3602
02:28:04,239 --> 02:28:05,920
the

3603
02:28:04,739 --> 02:28:08,398
[Music]

3604
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:10,000
ability to change the spectrum blues and

3605
02:28:08,398 --> 02:28:12,318
reds

3606
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:14,478
yeah so you can get your own spectrum uh

3607
02:28:12,318 --> 02:28:16,478
and you can try and see how how intense

3608
02:28:14,478 --> 02:28:19,760
that spectrum is too you can dial that

3609
02:28:16,478 --> 02:28:22,079
in at any time uh given given 24 hours a

3610
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:24,559
day right so you can program that in up

02:28:26,559 --> 02:28:29,760

yeah here we go this is gonna be fun so

3632
02:29:06,318 --> 02:29:08,799
so jeff you're gonna run us through the

3633
02:29:07,439 --> 02:29:10,639
process

3634
02:29:08,799 --> 02:29:12,079
awesome i'm just doing a quick clean

3635
02:29:10,639 --> 02:29:13,519
real quick okay before we do that why

3636
02:29:12,079 --> 02:29:15,520
don't you do a clean video let's do this

3637
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:16,560
clean video here

3638
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:18,720
yeah

3639
02:29:16,559 --> 02:29:20,239
i need to know too so you get a dabber

3640
02:29:18,719 --> 02:29:24,478
you heat it up a little bit and then you

3641
02:29:20,239 --> 02:29:26,318
have an alcohol wipe like a swab and so

3642
02:29:24,478 --> 02:29:28,159
this you just it'll it's like a magnet

3643
02:29:26,318 --> 02:29:30,000
for all the resin so check this out i'm

3644
02:29:28,159 --> 02:29:33,398
just going to put it in there with the

3645
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:33,398
dabber now

3646
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:43,040
pressure's on

3647
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:43,040
oh nice nice

3648
02:29:43,120 --> 02:29:48,960
that is that is very good

3649
02:29:46,079 --> 02:29:51,600
as you can see it's picked up all

3650
02:29:48,959 --> 02:29:53,358
the leftover resin and he's and he's got

3651
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:54,800
it out if you can get a close-up of that

3652
02:29:53,359 --> 02:29:58,399
you can totally see that look at that

3653
02:29:54,799 --> 02:29:58,398
looks a little easier than a q-tip

3654
02:30:00,879 --> 02:30:04,438
alcohol in there

3655
02:30:08,870 --> 02:30:13,299

3656
02:30:15,280 --> 02:30:21,359
four guys cleaning one ribs and knocking

3657
02:30:18,478 --> 02:30:22,639
shit over on the table just kind of i i

3658
02:30:21,359 --> 02:30:23,850
kind of knew this banger would get

3659
02:30:22,639 --> 02:30:26,869
hosted today

[Music]

3661
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:33,840
yeah it's a it's a commune

3662
02:30:34,398 --> 02:30:37,920
thank you

3663
02:30:36,159 --> 02:30:40,159
i i think the guy on the left

3664
02:30:37,920 --> 02:30:42,318
accidentally turned his mic off ken

3665
02:30:40,159 --> 02:30:43,760
ken's not really listening

3666
02:30:42,318 --> 02:30:45,920
ken i think the guy on the left turned

3667
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:48,159
to that i think that mic is off right

3668
02:30:45,920 --> 02:30:48,159
now

3669
02:30:51,520 --> 02:30:54,880
generally you want to

3670
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:57,680
take the

3671
02:30:54,879 --> 02:30:59,599
residue out of it before you take a dab

3672
02:30:57,680 --> 02:31:01,439
because anything that's kind of baked on

3673
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:03,120
isn't really going to taste too good

3674
02:31:01,439 --> 02:31:04,960
because i mean you're torching it

3675
02:31:03,120 --> 02:31:07,600
kind of burning it off

3676
02:31:04,959 --> 02:31:09,759
it's like a burnt dab taste kind of

3677
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:10,720
jeff how hot could one of those get

3678
02:31:09,760 --> 02:31:13,840
those

3679
02:31:10,719 --> 02:31:15,199
those nails so butane burns at about i

3680
02:31:13,840 --> 02:31:17,600
want to say

3681
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:19,680
close to a thousand fahrenheit so it

3682
02:31:17,600 --> 02:31:22,640
generally when you take the torch off of

3683
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:24,639
it it's about 900 fahrenheit wow um you

3684
02:31:22,639 --> 02:31:25,439
want to take a dab kind of closer to

3685
02:31:24,639 --> 02:31:29,439
like

3686
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:32,720
under 550 550 yeah

3687
02:31:29,439 --> 02:31:34,000
why is 550 the ideal number

3688
02:31:32,719 --> 02:31:36,478
you get the perfect balance of

3689
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:38,799
vaporizing the thc to vaporizing the

3690
02:31:36,478 --> 02:31:40,639
terpenes without compromising the flavor

3691
02:31:38,799 --> 02:31:42,000
but then also you get enough that you're

3692
02:31:40,639 --> 02:31:43,680
actually going gonna get stoned rather

3693
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:45,920
than you know having to go in for a

3694
02:31:43,680 --> 02:31:48,318
reheat

3695
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:51,359
almost as hot as your deck i'm a big fan

3696
02:31:48,318 --> 02:31:53,840
of cold dabs that i'm thinking right now

3697
02:31:51,359 --> 02:31:57,120
like i i like taking the terps for for

3698
02:31:53,840 --> 02:31:58,559
somewhere at 450 even

3699
02:31:57,120 --> 02:32:00,479
yeah but it's a bit heavier on your

3700
02:31:58,559 --> 02:32:01,840
lungs though right like i find with when

3701
02:32:00,478 --> 02:32:04,559
you when you get those terps and you're

3702
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:06,398
burning them that that at that rate they

3703
02:32:04,559 --> 02:32:08,559
kind of just hang around but it's a

3704
02:32:06,398 --> 02:32:10,318
lower temp yeah it's a lower temp but

3705
02:32:08,559 --> 02:32:11,840
this is like the perfect temp where

3706
02:32:10,318 --> 02:32:14,000
everything vaporizes and you get the

3707
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:16,478
most out of everything as good as that

3708
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:18,719
press was you get the most out of that

3709
02:32:16,478 --> 02:32:20,959
press at 550. it's also important to

3710
02:32:18,719 --> 02:32:24,079
note though that different rosins yes

3711
02:32:20,959 --> 02:32:26,159
for sure different strains uh different

3712
02:32:24,079 --> 02:32:28,639
um

3713
02:32:26,159 --> 02:32:30,639
uh screen sizes

3714
02:32:28,639 --> 02:32:32,639
will make a difference very much

3715
02:32:30,639 --> 02:32:34,159
consistency of rosin which then your

3716
02:32:32,639 --> 02:32:36,398
turn needs a different temperature to

3717
02:32:34,159 --> 02:32:39,039
enjoy it okay so this is rosin right

3718
02:32:36,398 --> 02:32:39,039
applied so

3719
02:32:47,520 --> 02:32:51,520
65

3720
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:53,920
and there's at least i would say still

3721
02:32:51,520 --> 02:32:55,520
about eight or nine percent terps

3722
02:32:53,920 --> 02:32:57,120
left in this

3723
02:32:55,520 --> 02:32:59,840
um

3724
02:32:57,120 --> 02:33:01,760
but it leaves a lot of crap on your bank

3725
02:32:59,840 --> 02:33:03,680
for example right because it comes from

3726
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:05,920
flowers it comes from flowers and not

3727
02:33:03,680 --> 02:33:07,439
right so the difference in rosin like

3728
02:33:05,920 --> 02:33:10,639
look you could put this in a cart for

3729
02:33:07,439 --> 02:33:13,520
example right versus say

3730
02:33:10,639 --> 02:33:17,599
we're looking at um the big bag

3731
02:33:13,520 --> 02:33:17,600
uh from lost boys in victoria

3732
02:33:18,079 --> 02:33:22,200
and the big bag is a 73 to 159

3733
02:33:21,200 --> 02:33:24,560
micron

3734
02:33:22,200 --> 02:33:27,840
[Music]

3735
02:33:24,559 --> 02:33:32,000
right it's a it's a the big bag is 73 to

3736
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:34,000
159 micron so that's that's the

3737
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:35,439
the screen level that material that we

3738
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,398
used to press this

3739
02:33:35,439 --> 02:33:39,760
right

3740
02:33:36,398 --> 02:33:41,279
came out of so 73 to 159 micron and this

3741
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:42,639
is what he pulled and this is what it's

3742
02:33:41,280 --> 02:33:45,880
why it smells

3743
02:33:42,639 --> 02:33:45,879
way it smells

3744
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:54,000
how does it smell extremely earthy

3745
02:33:50,959 --> 02:33:55,599
big bag number five

3746
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:57,760
there's citrus there's

3747
02:33:55,600 --> 02:33:58,479
woodsy yeah a little bit of pine in

3748
02:33:57,760 --> 02:34:00,000
there

3749
02:33:58,478 --> 02:34:01,279
terpene for sure

3750
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:03,280
yeah there's definitely some pine in

3751
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:05,040
there yeah what's the effect on the big

3752
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:06,800
bag how would you

3753
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:08,430
it's an upper it's definitely an up oh

3754
02:34:06,799 --> 02:34:09,920
this is an upper yeah

3755
02:34:08,430 --> 02:34:11,439
[Music]

3756
02:34:09,920 --> 02:34:14,000
that's a nice color

3757
02:34:11,439 --> 02:34:16,398
jessie at uh lost place once again uh

3758
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:18,000
from victoria does some good work all

3759
02:34:16,398 --> 02:34:19,519
right lost boys rosin that's what i'm

3760
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,639
looking at

3761
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:22,720
these guys

3762
02:34:20,639 --> 02:34:24,879
it's firework it's fire

3763
02:34:22,719 --> 02:34:26,879
and uh the color on here is like nice

3764
02:34:24,879 --> 02:34:29,119
light that's that wasn't even fresh when

3765
02:34:26,879 --> 02:34:30,559
i got it fresh it was like it's been

3766
02:34:29,120 --> 02:34:32,160
opened a few times so this is the type

3767
02:34:30,559 --> 02:34:34,159
of rosin that when i look at it it makes

3768
02:34:32,159 --> 02:34:36,079
my mouth water yeah

3769
02:34:34,159 --> 02:34:37,920
just because i know that the

3770
02:34:36,079 --> 02:34:40,159
the purity in here this the effect that

3771
02:34:37,920 --> 02:34:42,559
you get from this is

3772
02:34:40,159 --> 02:34:44,719
is exactly what i want the body wants it

3773
02:34:42,559 --> 02:34:44,719
all

3774
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:52,640
that was very very nice thank you very

3775
02:34:50,879 --> 02:34:55,119
much that's all i can say

3776
02:34:52,639 --> 02:34:58,519
i want to try some of this over here

3777
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:58,520
see how it tastes

3778
02:34:58,559 --> 02:35:03,359
now we were talking um

3779
02:35:00,799 --> 02:35:04,159
about rosin cartridges on the drive up

3780
02:35:03,359 --> 02:35:07,680
here

3781
02:35:04,159 --> 02:35:10,559
uh what do you think about rosin in

3782
02:35:07,680 --> 02:35:14,479
cart form compared to the flavor and

3783
02:35:10,559 --> 02:35:14,478
enjoyment that you get from a banger

3784
02:35:14,559 --> 02:35:18,559
honestly i quite like it depends on the

3785
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:20,319
cartridge though some of them are really

3786
02:35:18,559 --> 02:35:22,559
high quality some of them

3787
02:35:20,318 --> 02:35:25,119
are kind of not so high quality in the

3788
02:35:22,559 --> 02:35:26,879
cartridge department so

3789
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:28,160
the best way to represent that kind of

3790
02:35:26,879 --> 02:35:31,279
flavor

3791
02:35:28,159 --> 02:35:32,639
is uh to have it um you know in a high

3792
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:34,479
quality cartridge now if you have that

3793
02:35:32,639 --> 02:35:36,079
high quality cartridge that's meant for

3794
02:35:34,478 --> 02:35:37,920
the viscosity of the solvent-less

3795
02:35:36,079 --> 02:35:39,600
product oh my god you can get a really

3796
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:41,840
good good result out of it you can get a

3797
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:43,840
flavor that's similar to taking a hoot

3798
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:45,200
off of a banger for example

3799
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:47,280
um

3800
02:35:45,200 --> 02:35:49,120
so you're right there

3801
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:50,399
he's okay he's good yeah

3802
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:52,079
oh okay

3803
02:35:50,398 --> 02:35:52,799
sorry i just i just wanted to make sure

3804
02:35:52,079 --> 02:35:54,799
i

3805
02:35:52,799 --> 02:35:56,959
don't need my help or anything you know

3806
02:35:54,799 --> 02:35:58,799
are you worried i'm ready to help if you

3807
02:35:56,959 --> 02:36:00,398
need it because

3808
02:35:58,799 --> 02:36:02,879
those uh those slippers can be kind of

3809
02:36:00,398 --> 02:36:05,920
tough to clean with a q-tip so

3810
02:36:02,879 --> 02:36:06,959
i definitely know it's uh it's a process

3811
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:09,760
but um

3812
02:36:06,959 --> 02:36:10,879
yeah as for rosin cartridges they just

3813
02:36:09,760 --> 02:36:12,559
have to make sure that they're also

3814
02:36:10,879 --> 02:36:14,879
separated properly

3815
02:36:12,559 --> 02:36:16,799
um sometimes you know rosin can be

3816
02:36:14,879 --> 02:36:18,719
extremely viscous

3817
02:36:16,799 --> 02:36:20,639
but uh if they you know leave like a

3818
02:36:18,719 --> 02:36:23,358
really high terpene profile and you

3819
02:36:20,639 --> 02:36:25,920
crash out the crystals and uh you know

3820
02:36:23,359 --> 02:36:28,079
make sure that it's separated properly

3821
02:36:25,920 --> 02:36:29,920
then uh i mean it's it's pretty easy to

3822
02:36:28,079 --> 02:36:30,879
do but there's some strains that just

3823
02:36:29,920 --> 02:36:32,079
don't

3824
02:36:30,879 --> 02:36:34,639
they don't

3825
02:36:32,079 --> 02:36:36,559
like warm cure the same way no they

3826
02:36:34,639 --> 02:36:39,119
don't they clearly don't right so

3827
02:36:36,559 --> 02:36:41,600
everything is different so when you

3828
02:36:39,120 --> 02:36:44,479
pheno hunt for example right you're

3829
02:36:41,600 --> 02:36:46,880
looking for aspects that you can say hey

3830
02:36:44,478 --> 02:36:48,639
when i take this and i wash it right and

3831
02:36:46,879 --> 02:36:50,799
i watch this and this and this in this

3832
02:36:48,639 --> 02:36:52,719
level what is it going to smell like

3833
02:36:50,799 --> 02:36:55,039
right what can i press it into at the

3834
02:36:52,719 --> 02:36:57,599
end of the day so it doesn't just start

3835
02:36:55,040 --> 02:37:00,399
as as a process like uh processing is an

3836
02:36:57,600 --> 02:37:02,559
art but you also have to then final hunt

3837
02:37:00,398 --> 02:37:04,478
the exact kind of smells

3838
02:37:02,559 --> 02:37:05,760
and and the yield because

3839
02:37:04,478 --> 02:37:08,478
even if you can get it to smell if you

3840
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:10,478
can't get that plant to yield right it's

3841
02:37:08,478 --> 02:37:12,000
it's tough it's tough to then make up

3842
02:37:10,478 --> 02:37:13,599
factors yeah

3843
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:16,079
yeah because it's uh you know they

3844
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:18,720
describe it to me like um

3845
02:37:16,079 --> 02:37:21,520
you know you have um the pheno hunting

3846
02:37:18,719 --> 02:37:23,039
is in itself an art and then you have um

3847
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:24,640
you know making sure you're breeding for

3848
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:29,000
a certain uh

3849
02:37:24,639 --> 02:37:29,000
a certain like trichome type

3850
02:37:32,318 --> 02:37:35,760
um but yeah so it's

3851
02:37:34,159 --> 02:37:37,600
there's so many factors that go into it

3852
02:37:35,760 --> 02:37:39,280
like you know there's like almost like

3853
02:37:37,600 --> 02:37:40,720
10 different points that they have to be

3854
02:37:39,280 --> 02:37:42,880
watching out for

3855
02:37:40,719 --> 02:37:45,119
from uh you know making sure like the

3856
02:37:42,879 --> 02:37:46,799
glands aren't uh too greasy you know

3857
02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:48,640
making sure that the glands are going to

3858
02:37:46,799 --> 02:37:50,719
fall off making sure the terpene profile

3859
02:37:48,639 --> 02:37:52,079
is proper for hash making sure

3860
02:37:50,719 --> 02:37:53,840
you know there's so many different

3861
02:37:52,079 --> 02:37:55,680
factors it's uh

3862
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:57,760
it's really uh here let me help you with

3863
02:37:55,680 --> 02:37:59,359
that yeah throw it on top

3864
02:37:57,760 --> 02:38:02,239
there you go

3865
02:37:59,359 --> 02:38:02,239
no you keep hitting it

3866
02:38:04,559 --> 02:38:07,840
inside

3867
02:38:05,439 --> 02:38:07,840
inside

3868
02:38:09,040 --> 02:38:12,560
yeah but see but the readers now it's

3869
02:38:10,639 --> 02:38:14,959
like now we've got degraded thc and

3870
02:38:12,559 --> 02:38:16,478
terps now right it smells good so i

3871
02:38:14,959 --> 02:38:17,839
don't even you don't even know it does

3872
02:38:16,478 --> 02:38:20,318
smell good

3873
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:22,880
yeah but now it's a a second

3874
02:38:20,318 --> 02:38:24,879
a second heat get it from the side walls

3875
02:38:22,879 --> 02:38:26,079
yeah yeah yeah there you go don't inhale

3876
02:38:24,879 --> 02:38:27,438
while you're while you're torching it

3877
02:38:26,079 --> 02:38:29,359
though yeah because you might get some

3878
02:38:27,439 --> 02:38:31,439
of the butane in there i never really

3879
02:38:29,359 --> 02:38:33,600
think too many of these these types of

3880
02:38:31,439 --> 02:38:36,079
things oh i think i you know i don't

3881
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:37,680
know the effects of doing like flowers

3882
02:38:36,079 --> 02:38:38,639
years but i've done stuff like this for

3883
02:38:37,680 --> 02:38:42,120
years

3884
02:38:38,639 --> 02:38:42,119
me too yeah

3885
02:38:42,239 --> 02:38:46,318
well no like because like so i

3886
02:38:44,799 --> 02:38:49,279
what i wanted to get sorry the one i

3887
02:38:46,318 --> 02:38:51,199
wanted to get across was the fact that

3888
02:38:49,280 --> 02:38:53,200
once you reheat it and it's still there

3889
02:38:51,200 --> 02:38:54,399
and it's caked on and you keep heating

3890
02:38:53,200 --> 02:38:55,439
and you keep heating and you keep

3891
02:38:54,398 --> 02:38:57,439
heating then you're just taking more

3892
02:38:55,439 --> 02:38:58,960
degraded material into your lungs

3893
02:38:57,439 --> 02:39:00,559
so sometimes you have like keeping it

3894
02:38:58,959 --> 02:39:03,759
clean all the time is probably the best

3895
02:39:00,559 --> 02:39:06,398
way to do it right yeah exactly

3896
02:39:03,760 --> 02:39:09,090
right because like yeah

3897
02:39:06,398 --> 02:39:14,079
i'm just saying

3898
02:39:09,090 --> 02:39:16,318
[Music]

3899
02:39:14,079 --> 02:39:18,079
so what i was thinking we could do is

3900
02:39:16,318 --> 02:39:19,840
well while we have you here and we have

3901
02:39:18,079 --> 02:39:21,680

3902
02:39:19,840 --> 02:39:24,000
let me know ken peter we're going to try

3903
02:39:21,680 --> 02:39:25,760
and do a giveaway from two quarts and

3904
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,680
sessions while we have the guys that are

3905
02:39:25,760 --> 02:39:29,280
up here to do the giveaway so see if he

3906
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:30,800
can get ready to do that one but what

3907
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:34,159
have you guys been smoking on what's

3908

yeah so

3933
02:40:29,359 --> 02:40:33,760
we visit a lot of different uh producers

3934
02:40:32,239 --> 02:40:36,398
in a lot of different facilities in the

3935
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:38,478
legal side of things and

legal and

3967
02:41:49,760 --> 02:41:54,880
they buy product from um micro growers

3968
02:41:53,040 --> 02:41:55,840
that have transferred from the legacy

3969
02:41:54,879 --> 02:41:58,799
side

3970
02:41:55,840 --> 02:42:00,639
into the legal side that know how to

3971
02:41:58,799 --> 02:42:02,879
produce great cannabis and have the

3972
02:42:00,639 --> 02:42:05,039
reputation from for producing it for

3973
02:42:02,879 --> 02:42:07,519
years and years and so

3974
02:42:05,040 --> 02:42:09,359
we started working with them to promote

3975
02:42:07,520 --> 02:42:11,520
those people promote that weed because

3976
02:42:09,359 --> 02:42:14,079
it's weed that i would smoke myself

3977
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:16,640
and uh yeah it was a huge project it was

3978
02:42:14,079 --> 02:42:19,520
a large project four sessions it was our

3979
02:42:16,639 --> 02:42:20,879
first one as a as a group and uh it went

3980
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:22,960
well it went great

3981
02:42:20,879 --> 02:42:24,879

out there too so yeah um the industry

3998
02:42:54,239 --> 02:42:58,799
has changed quite a bit over the last

3999
02:42:56,000 --> 02:43:00,398
three years you know where we started

4000
02:42:58,799 --> 02:43:01,759
can't say the same thing that's what i'm

4001
02:43:00,398 --> 02:43:04,239
saying right now right it was a

4002
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:06,159
different story yeah well these people

4003
02:43:04,239 --> 02:43:07,760
are transferring into the legal space

4004
02:43:06,159 --> 02:43:09,680
and now producing and providing that

4005
02:43:07,760 --> 02:43:12,159

02:43:15,120 --> 02:43:19,359
and uh i would track it back about 20

4009
02:43:17,359 --> 02:43:20,880
years from like when we got it it

4010
02:43:19,359 --> 02:43:22,880
doesn't i don't know what it is but i

4011
02:43:20,879 --> 02:43:25,358
got tested today it's never been tested

4012
02:43:22,879 --> 02:43:26,559
ever right what is it it's uh it's just

4013
02:43:25,359 --> 02:43:29,760

02:43:32,318 --> 02:43:36,639
she came out at like what

4017
02:43:35,040 --> 02:43:38,800
this is the man right here that we

4018
02:43:36,639 --> 02:43:40,559
should introduce him the trim and test

4019
02:43:38,799 --> 02:43:42,799
and press because this guy is awesome

4020
02:43:40,559 --> 02:43:44,239

4021
02:43:42,799 --> 02:43:46,478

4022
02:43:44,239 --> 02:43:47,520

4023
02:43:46,478 --> 02:43:50,000
come on

4024
02:43:47,520 --> 02:43:52,399
this is really what like i got vira

4025
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:54,478
tested and i got lindsey og tested and i

4026
02:43:52,398 --> 02:43:56,000
did really well like

4027
02:43:54,478 --> 02:43:57,920
being a homegrower but what is the link

4028
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:59,600
you wonder what you can actually

4029
02:43:57,920 --> 02:44:02,000
like if you can compete

4030
02:43:59,600 --> 02:44:03,600
or whatever and i think that the home

4031
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:06,478
grow is fire

4032
02:44:03,600 --> 02:44:08,239
yeah i i've done over like 300 flower

4033
02:44:06,478 --> 02:44:10,478
samples by now and i'll tell you like

4034
02:44:08,239 --> 02:44:12,799
working with micros and lps and

4035
02:44:10,478 --> 02:44:14,318
homegrowers the average is like 17 and a

4036
02:44:12,799 --> 02:44:15,920
half percent yeah that's good so when

4037
02:44:14,318 --> 02:44:17,600
you get a homegrower that's in the 20s

4038
02:44:15,920 --> 02:44:19,600
it's great yeah i know a lot of people

4039
02:44:17,600 --> 02:44:22,079
slag some lps but i work for some and

4040
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:23,760
they're putting out 27 32 percent and

4041
02:44:22,079 --> 02:44:25,359
it's fucking fire so

4042
02:44:23,760 --> 02:44:27,040
whoever said earlier like i support

4043
02:44:25,359 --> 02:44:29,439
however i put the like whoever puts the

4044
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:32,880
love in like that's oh yeah totally yes

4045
02:44:29,439 --> 02:44:35,040
right like that's a true

4046
02:44:32,879 --> 02:44:36,079
island one and it was seventy six point

4047
02:44:35,040 --> 02:44:37,840
eight percent

4048
02:44:36,079 --> 02:44:39,600
pretty fucking strong pretty fucking

4049
02:44:37,840 --> 02:44:41,520
strong right so big up the jet once

4050
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:43,200
again jesse came through right

4051
02:44:41,520 --> 02:44:44,640
but someone was talking about pistol in

4052
02:44:43,200 --> 02:44:46,000
paris earlier there's a grower that

4053
02:44:44,639 --> 02:44:48,639
works for them because as they move into

4054
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:50,239
the legal market his name is alex and bc

4055
02:44:48,639 --> 02:44:52,000
greenhouse shout out to them their store

4056
02:44:50,239 --> 02:44:53,520
in maple ridge

4057
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:55,600
put me in contact with alex and i got to

4058
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:57,600
test some of his dbx the other day and

4059
02:44:55,600 --> 02:44:59,920
that was 32.6

4060
02:44:57,600 --> 02:45:01,520
so when that comes to fucking market

4061
02:44:59,920 --> 02:45:03,520
okay what was the moisture content well

4062
02:45:01,520 --> 02:45:05,120
we talked about this earlier today right

4063
02:45:03,520 --> 02:45:06,079
now what is the moisture what's the

4064
02:45:05,120 --> 02:45:08,079
moisture

4065
02:45:06,079 --> 02:45:10,159
if you're if you're putting him in on tv

4066
02:45:08,079 --> 02:45:12,478
now we have to know the moisture content

4067
02:45:10,159 --> 02:45:14,478
it's really fun because that guy loves

4068
02:45:12,478 --> 02:45:15,438
what he does and he's gotten so much

4069
02:45:14,478 --> 02:45:17,679
better

4070
02:45:15,439 --> 02:45:19,200
uh and made like minor adjustments so

4071
02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:20,800
he's had a few tests and he's been able

4072
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:22,800
to look at it and make some adjustments

4073
02:45:20,799 --> 02:45:24,559
and now like

4074
02:45:22,799 --> 02:45:26,398
i don't know out of 300 plus samples

4075
02:45:24,559 --> 02:45:29,519
there's maybe five or six that are 30

4076
02:45:26,398 --> 02:45:31,439
plus right it's not very common so he's

4077
02:45:29,520 --> 02:45:34,159
absolutely killing it but he's really

4078
02:45:31,439 --> 02:45:36,398
taking the data and branding it

4079
02:45:34,159 --> 02:45:38,799
the plan is basically hung over dripping

4080
02:45:36,398 --> 02:45:40,318
with thc right pretty much it was well

4081
02:45:38,799 --> 02:45:42,000
he brings me dry he brings me dried

4082
02:45:40,318 --> 02:45:44,000
samples so like all i need is a gram and

4083
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:45,520
a half sample and i can i'll take half a

4084
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:46,959
gram and run it through let's let's look

4085
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:48,640
at the moisture content once again

4086
02:45:46,959 --> 02:45:49,839
before we okay

4087
02:45:48,639 --> 02:45:51,199
not to say that we

4088
02:45:49,840 --> 02:45:52,559
don't have any good results here because

4089
02:45:51,200 --> 02:45:55,040
i believe in 32

4090
02:45:52,559 --> 02:45:56,398
i believe it's an nbc too so

4091
02:45:55,040 --> 02:45:58,160
don't get me wrong right like you're not

4092
02:45:56,398 --> 02:45:59,840
going to find it in ontario you might

4093
02:45:58,159 --> 02:46:01,680
find it in quebec but you're not going

4094
02:45:59,840 --> 02:46:04,559
to find it in ontario unless they're

4095
02:46:01,680 --> 02:46:06,479
spraying it with a lot of spray he he

4096
02:46:04,559 --> 02:46:08,159
was really like he's really dialing it

4097
02:46:06,478 --> 02:46:09,679
in though like on the he took samples

4098
02:46:08,159 --> 02:46:10,879
from the inside of his room like in the

4099
02:46:09,680 --> 02:46:12,880
middle of the room and from the outside

4100
02:46:10,879 --> 02:46:14,318
of his room the variance was huge like

4101
02:46:12,879 --> 02:46:15,920
outside of the room from the perimeter

4102
02:46:14,318 --> 02:46:17,680
where there wasn't as much fan action

4103
02:46:15,920 --> 02:46:19,439
and there wasn't such like

4104
02:46:17,680 --> 02:46:21,200
great environment he was down to about

4105
02:46:19,439 --> 02:46:23,120
17 and a half percent yeah where

4106
02:46:21,200 --> 02:46:25,600
everything was dialed in like he was

4107
02:46:23,120 --> 02:46:26,880
pushing 32 so like now he knows what

4108
02:46:25,600 --> 02:46:28,640
sample to send

4109
02:46:26,879 --> 02:46:29,920
well even like when you use our lights

4110
02:46:28,639 --> 02:46:31,358
everybody that uses our lights say the

4111
02:46:29,920 --> 02:46:32,398
same thing so we've so we've ran through

4112
02:46:31,359 --> 02:46:34,159
these lights for about two years gave

4113
02:46:32,398 --> 02:46:36,879
them to a lot of people let them test

4114
02:46:34,159 --> 02:46:38,318
them out and the data we generally get

4115
02:46:36,879 --> 02:46:40,000
when you follow like a sun cycle

4116
02:46:38,318 --> 02:46:42,639
typically if you can do that with your

4117
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:45,439
lighting um oh is it your lights yeah so

4118
02:46:42,639 --> 02:46:47,920
yeah so when you do that um you can

4119
02:46:45,439 --> 02:46:49,520
basically maybe increase yield thc like

4120
02:46:47,920 --> 02:46:52,719
two percent so if you're like 25 you can

4121
02:46:49,520 --> 02:46:54,880
hit 27 maybe right so if you can then

4122
02:46:52,719 --> 02:46:56,559
control the other factors that you grow

4123
02:46:54,879 --> 02:46:59,199
with right yeah so if you grow

4124
02:46:56,559 --> 02:47:02,000
organically like we do um well maybe not

4125
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:04,399
like you but well yeah well

4126
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:06,239
yeah we uh we try to

4127
02:47:04,398 --> 02:47:07,840
manage our inputs by what we put there

4128
02:47:06,239 --> 02:47:09,760
and how it breaks down over a period of

4129
02:47:07,840 --> 02:47:10,880
time right yeah yeah

4130
02:47:09,760 --> 02:47:12,960
that's cool

4131
02:47:10,879 --> 02:47:14,639
that's it yeah

4132
02:47:12,959 --> 02:47:16,559
i was over here because someone had like

4133

4134
02:47:16,559 --> 02:47:20,959

4135
02:47:18,318 --> 02:47:20,959
well that was good

4136
02:47:39,120 --> 02:47:41,680
she does help me in the garden she calls

4137
02:47:40,398 --> 02:47:43,680

4150
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:35,120

4221
02:51:23,478 --> 02:51:29,199
sessions the the the company is based in

4222
02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:31,600
kelowna but

4223
02:51:29,200 --> 02:51:33,520
we are moving the entire studio and

4224
02:51:31,600 --> 02:51:34,880
office to the island

4225
02:51:33,520 --> 02:51:38,479
so that's what's happening in the next

4226
02:51:34,879 --> 02:51:41,438
few months we're looking for a space for

4227
02:51:38,478 --> 02:51:43,840
a new studio but also event space too

4228
02:51:41,439 --> 02:51:47,520
i'd love to have a cannabis lounge right

4229
02:51:43,840 --> 02:51:50,559
now uh legislation is being written

4230
02:51:47,520 --> 02:51:51,600
for bc to start incorporating cannabis

4231
02:51:50,559 --> 02:51:54,079
lounges

4232
02:51:51,600 --> 02:51:55,040
into the framework and i want to have

4233
02:51:54,079 --> 02:51:57,600
one

4234
02:51:55,040 --> 02:51:59,040
we'll have it connected to the studio

4235
02:51:57,600 --> 02:52:01,760
and

4236
02:51:59,040 --> 02:52:03,920
once that's going i mean i hope to see a

4237
02:52:01,760 --> 02:52:06,159
lot of them but i hope to have multiple

4238
02:52:03,920 --> 02:52:07,920
across canada as well

4239
02:52:06,159 --> 02:52:09,439
that sounds happy i can't wait for there

4240
02:52:07,920 --> 02:52:11,359
to be a lot more indoor consumption but

4241
02:52:09,439 --> 02:52:13,120
we could go to a shop and do this

4242
02:52:11,359 --> 02:52:16,318
instead and then get really comfortable

4243
02:52:13,120 --> 02:52:16,319

4330
02:55:45,920 --> 02:55:50,239
can you tell me what makes them so

4331
02:55:47,279 --> 02:55:51,920
special and why you guys are who you are

4332
02:55:50,239 --> 02:55:54,159
so um

4333
02:55:51,920 --> 02:55:56,799
basically there are a lot of different

4334
02:55:54,159 --> 02:55:59,520
grades of course out there and us being

4335
02:55:56,799 --> 02:56:02,079
like connoisseur you know hash smokers

4336
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:03,680
ourselves and using these we wanted we

4337
02:56:02,079 --> 02:56:06,239
didn't want to spend a few hundred

4338
02:56:03,680 --> 02:56:08,398
dollars on you know an american

4339
02:56:06,239 --> 02:56:09,119
uh made or canadian made banger because

4340
02:56:08,398 --> 02:56:11,278
it's

4341
02:56:09,120 --> 02:56:12,880
it gets really pricey if people like i'm

4342
02:56:11,279 --> 02:56:15,279
sure there's people out here watching

4343
02:56:12,879 --> 02:56:18,879
this that know that you know bangers can

4344
02:56:15,279 --> 02:56:20,399
go over like 500 us dollars each and uh

4345
02:56:18,879 --> 02:56:22,398
not a lot of people want to spend that

4346
02:56:20,398 --> 02:56:24,318
much on a quartz banger so does it

4347
02:56:22,398 --> 02:56:26,799
actually make a dab better

4348
02:56:24,318 --> 02:56:29,680
um so this one here

4349
02:56:26,799 --> 02:56:31,759
so i mean i love the that one um there's

4350
02:56:29,680 --> 02:56:33,920
nine different designs so the sorry the

4351
02:56:31,760 --> 02:56:36,478
main thing being with that one is it has

4352
02:56:33,920 --> 02:56:37,920
a very big thick bottom

4353
02:56:36,478 --> 02:56:39,438
you know

4354
02:56:37,920 --> 02:56:42,559
everyone likes a big thick bottom

4355
02:56:39,439 --> 02:56:44,559
anyways it retains heat so especially on

4356
02:56:42,559 --> 02:56:47,840
a quartz banger so it

4357
02:56:44,559 --> 02:56:48,959
so it retains it retains heat uh really

4358
02:56:47,840 --> 02:56:51,279
nicely

4359
02:56:48,959 --> 02:56:54,159
um you know it's just more mass to hold

4360
02:56:51,279 --> 02:56:56,720
on to the heat that you torch it with um

4361
02:56:54,159 --> 02:56:59,279
and uh yeah so it it kind of radiates

4362
02:56:56,719 --> 02:56:59,278
evenly too

4363
02:56:59,439 --> 02:57:03,840
yeah so you plug the top

4364
02:57:01,279 --> 02:57:06,479
there's slits in uh at the bottom of the

4365
02:57:03,840 --> 02:57:08,000
little small tube on the the slurp area

4366
02:57:06,478 --> 02:57:09,278
if you want to just hold that up there

4367
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:11,279
there's a

4368
02:57:09,279 --> 02:57:13,279
the smaller tube and then the larger

4369
02:57:11,279 --> 02:57:15,279
dish on the bottom there slits

4370
02:57:13,279 --> 02:57:16,399
right here and then when you plug the

4371
02:57:15,279 --> 02:57:18,560
top

4372
02:57:16,398 --> 02:57:20,879
the oil gets sucked into those slits and

4373
02:57:18,559 --> 02:57:22,398
it creates like a vortex for us as well

4374
02:57:20,879 --> 02:57:24,000
and it really like vaporizes it and

4375
02:57:22,398 --> 02:57:26,398
creates a lot of good surface area for

4376
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:28,879
you to like you know completely vaporize

4377
02:57:26,398 --> 02:57:30,799
your dab at a lower temperature and uh

4378
02:57:28,879 --> 02:57:32,879
it just works really nicely

4379
02:57:30,799 --> 02:57:34,799
um

4380
02:57:32,879 --> 02:57:37,199
so the main thing about these bangers is

4381
02:57:34,799 --> 02:57:39,438
that they use equivalent material that

4382
02:57:37,200 --> 02:57:41,120
those north american bangers use but

4383
02:57:39,439 --> 02:57:43,279
because there's so many different grades

4384
02:57:41,120 --> 02:57:47,040
that uh different manufacturers are

4385
02:57:43,279 --> 02:57:47,920
using out there um that it it creates um

4386
02:57:47,040 --> 02:57:49,760
you know

4387
02:57:47,920 --> 02:57:51,680
like something that you don't want to

4388
02:57:49,760 --> 02:57:53,520
guess about what you're dabbing off of

4389
02:57:51,680 --> 02:57:55,439
and nobody wants impurities and things

4390
02:57:53,520 --> 02:57:57,600
that they're smoking off of especially

4391
02:57:55,439 --> 02:57:59,600
you know the surface so it's just kind

4392
02:57:57,600 --> 02:58:01,200
of guaranteeing that these are made with

4393
02:57:59,600 --> 02:58:04,720
the highest quality material that's

4394
02:58:01,200 --> 02:58:06,720
available to the manufacturer um they're

4395
02:58:04,719 --> 02:58:09,278
you know a little bit more expensive

4396
02:58:06,719 --> 02:58:11,920
than your 40 dollar no-name banger

4397
02:58:09,279 --> 02:58:14,960
but they um you know they come with

4398
02:58:11,920 --> 02:58:17,040
rubies they they hold heat better they

4399
02:58:14,959 --> 02:58:18,318
they're a lot more pure um

4400
02:58:17,040 --> 02:58:19,920
this is the one we're giving away here

4401
02:58:18,318 --> 02:58:23,199
it's a regular style

4402
02:58:19,920 --> 02:58:23,200
they last longer than glass

4403
02:58:25,520 --> 02:58:28,960
hold on everyone has the shape stuff on

4404
02:58:27,520 --> 02:58:32,159
the other side that's that one's like

4405
02:58:28,959 --> 02:58:33,839
it's not true let me start over skinny

4406
02:58:32,159 --> 02:58:35,680
and this one's sort of fat what do you

4407
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:37,520
like better

4408
02:58:35,680 --> 02:58:39,040
honestly there's nine different designs

4409
02:58:37,520 --> 02:58:42,079
and they're all kind of like my children

4410
02:58:39,040 --> 02:58:42,080
i like them all equally

4411
02:58:43,359 --> 02:58:47,920
there's gotta be one that sits in the

4412
02:58:45,840 --> 02:58:49,840
honestly i love the auto spinner because

4413
02:58:47,920 --> 02:58:52,000
it's so it's like this bucket here

4414
02:58:49,840 --> 02:58:53,760
except it has two angular holes drilled

4415
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:55,520
through it so when you plug the top like

4416
02:58:53,760 --> 02:58:57,520
you do with the slurper the little

4417
02:58:55,520 --> 02:58:59,760
rubies that come with it will spin like

4418
02:58:57,520 --> 02:59:01,760
crazy um so

4419
02:58:59,760 --> 02:59:03,040
that's my favorite this is the regular

4420
02:59:01,760 --> 02:59:04,960
one that we're giving away it's the

4421
02:59:03,040 --> 02:59:06,960
tried and true it's the most common

4422
02:59:04,959 --> 02:59:07,759
design that everybody tends to use as

4423
02:59:06,959 --> 02:59:09,839
well

4424
02:59:07,760 --> 02:59:11,359
just plop a bubble cap on top of that

4425
02:59:09,840 --> 02:59:12,960
and you're good to go

4426
02:59:11,359 --> 02:59:15,040
but that's yeah the vast majority of

4427
02:59:12,959 --> 02:59:16,959
people like this style the most

4428
02:59:15,040 --> 02:59:19,600
just because

4429
02:59:16,959 --> 02:59:21,679
so it seems easier to clean so again

4430
02:59:19,600 --> 02:59:23,840
this is a lot easier to clean enter in

4431
02:59:21,680 --> 02:59:26,318
now yeah i want to see a few people go

4432
02:59:23,840 --> 02:59:27,520
on to to what do you want burrow or true

4433
02:59:26,318 --> 02:59:29,840
course

4434
02:59:27,520 --> 02:59:29,840
building

4435
02:59:37,120 --> 02:59:40,319
and instagram and try and give them a

4436
02:59:38,639 --> 02:59:42,559
like and when i see a few follows and

4437
02:59:40,318 --> 02:59:45,519
likes in the instagram thing

4438
02:59:42,559 --> 02:59:46,959
i will i will finish the draw so not

4439
02:59:45,520 --> 02:59:48,640
only will you speed up the draw

4440
02:59:46,959 --> 02:59:50,879
increasing your chances to win by

4441
02:59:48,639 --> 02:59:52,719
following them but on top of that

4442
02:59:50,879 --> 02:59:54,559
you will get more chances of winning so

4443
02:59:52,719 --> 02:59:57,278
draw like help help out the community

4444
02:59:54,559 --> 02:59:59,119
it's a 300 it's a 300 banger right no

4445
02:59:57,279 --> 03:00:01,760
it's not actually it's not this is the

4446
02:59:59,120 --> 03:00:04,640
equivalent mr t put a hashtag in front

4447
03:00:01,760 --> 03:00:08,079
of that 300 banger but for 70.

4448
03:00:04,639 --> 03:00:11,318
70 dollar bank john lose the e so it's a

4449
03:00:08,079 --> 03:00:11,318
it's a really

4450
03:00:21,600 --> 03:00:27,520
and stuff like that you do want

4451
03:00:24,799 --> 03:00:28,959
a banger that doesn't have impurities in

4452
03:00:27,520 --> 03:00:30,560
it that would ruin

4453
03:00:28,959 --> 03:00:32,239
what you're putting in you don't want to

4454
03:00:30,559 --> 03:00:35,600
disrespect you don't care

4455
03:00:32,239 --> 03:00:37,439
then you don't care but people that do

4456
03:00:35,600 --> 03:00:38,960
it's important now that

4457
03:00:37,439 --> 03:00:40,159
what are some of the impurities that you

4458
03:00:38,959 --> 03:00:42,079
would find in glass i mean i've heard of

4459
03:00:40,159 --> 03:00:43,039
this but i actually don't know

4460
03:00:42,079 --> 03:00:44,719
what it is

4461
03:00:43,040 --> 03:00:47,760
trace metals

4462
03:00:44,719 --> 03:00:50,478
um and minerals also there's uh

4463
03:00:47,760 --> 03:00:52,880
like um

4464
03:00:50,478 --> 03:00:54,719
i think that's like a peroxide radical

4465
03:00:52,879 --> 03:00:56,639
or something it just ends up degrading a

4466
03:00:54,719 --> 03:00:58,959
little bit quicker when it's exposed to

4467
03:00:56,639 --> 03:01:02,079
heat and it's just kind of in kind of in

4468
03:00:58,959 --> 03:01:04,398
the crystal matrix as well

4469
03:01:02,079 --> 03:01:07,279
those impurities like uh some of them

4470
03:01:04,398 --> 03:01:08,879
are a little bit more um benign than

4471
03:01:07,279 --> 03:01:10,720
others like you know it might degrade a

4472
03:01:08,879 --> 03:01:13,199
little bit quicker but um for the

4473
03:01:10,719 --> 03:01:14,639
peroxide type of thing but it's uh when

4474
03:01:13,200 --> 03:01:17,840
it comes to like trace metals you

4475
03:01:14,639 --> 03:01:19,119
definitely don't want that in your cords

4476
03:01:17,840 --> 03:01:20,559
so that's

4477
03:01:19,120 --> 03:01:23,359
that's something that's really important

4478
03:01:20,559 --> 03:01:25,278
is making sure it's super pure

4479
03:01:23,359 --> 03:01:27,680
and uh you know got to respect those

4480
03:01:25,279 --> 03:01:30,640
terps with a good surface to vaporize

4481
03:01:27,680 --> 03:01:30,639
off of i'd agree

4482
03:01:32,159 --> 03:01:36,959
does anybody have anything to do

4483
03:01:35,359 --> 03:01:39,520
shall we do the draw

4484
03:01:36,959 --> 03:01:42,318
go ahead peter do the draw

4485
03:01:39,520 --> 03:01:43,760

to that address

4535
03:04:17,359 --> 03:04:22,559
curious

4536
03:04:19,760 --> 03:04:24,880
and that will connect you with london

4537
03:04:22,559 --> 03:04:26,719
is that like an electric airplane

4538
03:04:24,879 --> 03:04:28,159
i see the first you want to fly in one

4539
03:04:26,719 --> 03:04:29,760
of those

4540
03:04:28,159 --> 03:04:33,039
speaking of viewing though i saw the

4541
03:04:29,760 --> 03:04:34,398
dopest epmd times patrick ewing shoes

4542
03:04:33,040 --> 03:04:37,200
the other day

4543
03:04:34,398 --> 03:04:40,719
they're high tops they're like black

4544
03:04:37,200 --> 03:04:42,560
with some fluorescent accents but uh

4545
03:04:40,719 --> 03:04:44,799
no those are dope though it looks like

4546
03:04:42,559 --> 03:04:47,199
it came out in the 90s pump era though

4547
03:04:44,799 --> 03:04:50,959
but seriously the yeah patrick ewing's

4548
03:04:47,200 --> 03:04:50,960
got his own shoes man hey he had an

4549
03:04:53,359 --> 03:04:58,559
his name is not e-wing

4550
03:04:55,680 --> 03:05:02,398
sorry power do you you gotta change it

4551
03:04:58,559 --> 03:05:05,680
he's connected e-wing you're an airplane

4552
03:05:02,398 --> 03:05:06,879
electric airplane

4553
03:05:05,680 --> 03:05:10,318
okay

4554
03:05:06,879 --> 03:05:12,879
so where where are they yeah

4555
03:05:10,318 --> 03:05:15,840
we're behind in the show

4556
03:05:12,879 --> 03:05:17,759
alton's just uh just unsure yeah

4557
03:05:15,840 --> 03:05:21,120
like five minutes behind although uh

4558
03:05:17,760 --> 03:05:22,398
what part of uh canadia are they in uh

4559
03:05:21,120 --> 03:05:24,560
vancouver

4560
03:05:22,398 --> 03:05:27,519
oh nice which part is that

4561
03:05:24,559 --> 03:05:28,959
so west coast go to the border travel

4562
03:05:27,520 --> 03:05:31,600
another 45 minutes and you're in

4563
03:05:28,959 --> 03:05:34,079
downtown vancouver okay so it's the west

4564
03:05:31,600 --> 03:05:35,840
coast part of canada it's a good part

4565
03:05:34,079 --> 03:05:37,920
yeah you didn't you didn't have any

4566
03:05:35,840 --> 03:05:39,439
rains how many raves have you been to in

4567
03:05:37,920 --> 03:05:40,318
vancouver

4568
03:05:39,439 --> 03:05:42,398
man

4569
03:05:40,318 --> 03:05:44,079
a lot yes

4570
03:05:42,398 --> 03:05:47,599
to me all their cities are like right

4571
03:05:44,079 --> 03:05:49,600
next to each other like in canada

4572
03:05:47,600 --> 03:05:50,960
it's like that's odd

4573
03:05:49,600 --> 03:05:52,159
they're right next to each other you

4574
03:05:50,959 --> 03:05:54,159
know what i mean

4575
03:05:52,159 --> 03:05:56,239
i don't know where they're at explain it

4576
03:05:54,159 --> 03:05:58,879
chris please explain that i don't know

4577
03:05:56,239 --> 03:06:01,119
they're driving distance right

4578
03:05:58,879 --> 03:06:03,039
everything's driving distance man

4579
03:06:01,120 --> 03:06:05,279
there's nobody

4580
03:06:03,040 --> 03:06:07,680
there's nobody's water separating them i

4581
03:06:05,279 --> 03:06:09,200
don't know man

4582
03:06:07,680 --> 03:06:10,559
i don't know i don't know how like

4583
03:06:09,200 --> 03:06:14,960
seriously they don't allow me up there

4584
03:06:10,559 --> 03:06:14,959
while i give it shit what they're

4585

4616
03:07:43,359 --> 03:07:47,760
canada not mexico right yes okay that's

4617

[Music]

4621
03:08:04,879 --> 03:08:08,959
okay sweet okay

4622
03:08:07,200 --> 03:08:11,200

cool and one even told me what he won

4624
03:08:11,200 --> 03:08:15,600

4831
03:15:45,760 --> 03:15:48,159
so

4832
03:15:46,478 --> 03:15:50,079
i service the entire legal market

4833
03:15:48,159 --> 03:15:52,719
whether it's the ac mpr home grower

4834
03:15:50,079 --> 03:15:55,439
micros or even the lps

4835
03:15:52,719 --> 03:15:56,959
and i provide either mobile dry trimming

4836
03:15:55,439 --> 03:15:59,040
mobile wet trimming i've got a couple of

4837
03:15:56,959 --> 03:16:00,079
different machines one for each and then

4838
03:15:59,040 --> 03:16:02,239
also

4839
03:16:00,079 --> 03:16:04,478
my light lab 3 cannabis analyzer from

4840
03:16:02,238 --> 03:16:05,760
orange photonics so i do potency

4841
03:16:04,478 --> 03:16:07,760
tracking so

4842
03:16:05,760 --> 03:16:09,680
i can come to your facility and

4843
03:16:07,760 --> 03:16:12,238
literally take buds off of your plant

4844
03:16:09,680 --> 03:16:14,318
and help you identify where it is and

4845
03:16:12,238 --> 03:16:16,159
what week and so on and so forth

4846
03:16:14,318 --> 03:16:17,359
which can actually be incredibly helpful

4847
03:16:16,159 --> 03:16:19,680
especially if you've never grown that

4848
03:16:17,359 --> 03:16:22,238
strain before you can start to identify

4849
03:16:19,680 --> 03:16:24,159
when the harvest days are or even start

4850
03:16:22,238 --> 03:16:25,520
breeding depending on what cannabinoid

4851
03:16:24,159 --> 03:16:27,760
you want to sell and so on and so forth

4852
03:16:25,520 --> 03:16:29,120
so what started is like i'm a home

4853
03:16:27,760 --> 03:16:31,200
grower

4854
03:16:29,120 --> 03:16:32,880
i have two dislocated wrists i can't

4855
03:16:31,200 --> 03:16:34,079
trim so i'm like i'll buy the machine so

4856
03:16:32,879 --> 03:16:36,318
i got the machines and i was like i

4857
03:16:34,079 --> 03:16:37,520
wonder how good my weed is

4858
03:16:36,318 --> 03:16:39,119
so then i looked up a whole bunch of

4859
03:16:37,520 --> 03:16:40,720
potency machines and i didn't find

4860
03:16:39,120 --> 03:16:42,160
anything that was sort of

4861
03:16:40,719 --> 03:16:44,799
in the genre that i was looking for

4862
03:16:42,159 --> 03:16:47,600
until i came across that unit which is a

4863
03:16:44,799 --> 03:16:49,119
serious piece of business and then

4864
03:16:47,600 --> 03:16:51,680
i thought okay if i can turn this into a

4865
03:16:49,120 --> 03:16:53,600
business it has to be quantifiable data

4866
03:16:51,680 --> 03:16:54,960
and people are going to rely on it and

4867
03:16:53,600 --> 03:16:57,600
they're going to make business decisions

4868
03:16:54,959 --> 03:16:59,278
on it so i got the best one that i think

4869
03:16:57,600 --> 03:17:01,279
and it's portable which is really the

4870
03:16:59,279 --> 03:17:02,960
crux of the business best portable unit

4871
03:17:01,279 --> 03:17:05,840
and we were we were talking about these

4872
03:17:02,959 --> 03:17:07,679
units last week um on the dank hour with

4873
03:17:05,840 --> 03:17:09,200
kyle boyer on on testing because we

4874
03:17:07,680 --> 03:17:10,880
really dug into that subject deep so i

4875
03:17:09,200 --> 03:17:12,159
would encourage everybody to go in and

4876
03:17:10,879 --> 03:17:14,799
check that episode because there are a

4877
03:17:12,159 --> 03:17:17,200
lot of interesting um aspects when it

4878
03:17:14,799 --> 03:17:18,398
comes to tools that for testing um and

4879
03:17:17,200 --> 03:17:19,920
there's a lot of like there's a lot of

4880
03:17:18,398 --> 03:17:21,439
different methodologies and we kind of

4881
03:17:19,920 --> 03:17:23,439
get get to break into that and we really

4882
03:17:21,439 --> 03:17:25,600
talk about how this variability this

4883
03:17:23,439 --> 03:17:28,000
method is probably the most ideal and

4884
03:17:25,600 --> 03:17:29,279
accurate and consistent when it comes to

4885
03:17:28,000 --> 03:17:32,238
what you're what you're looking for to

4886
03:17:29,279 --> 03:17:33,120
do it is well essentially that's how you

4887
03:17:32,238 --> 03:17:34,000
can

4888
03:17:33,120 --> 03:17:35,680
like

4889
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:37,279
build the gap between your intuition and

4890
03:17:35,680 --> 03:17:38,559
the data is if you know what it is that

4891
03:17:37,279 --> 03:17:40,159
you're doing and i'm able to provide you

4892
03:17:38,559 --> 03:17:41,359
that data you're able to use that and

4893
03:17:40,159 --> 03:17:42,719
move forward

4894
03:17:41,359 --> 03:17:44,159
i think the results for your flower

4895
03:17:42,719 --> 03:17:46,478
actually just beeped so it just came up

4896
03:17:44,159 --> 03:17:48,238
so each test takes 12 and a half minutes

4897
03:17:46,478 --> 03:17:50,559
from start to finish but i include the

4898
03:17:48,238 --> 03:17:52,159
moisture balancing so that it adds a few

4899
03:17:50,559 --> 03:17:55,439
more minutes but it's important because

4900
03:17:52,159 --> 03:17:57,119
you want to know what the weight exactly

4901
03:17:55,439 --> 03:17:58,398
so because

4902
03:17:57,120 --> 03:18:00,800
when you got to know you got to know

4903
03:17:58,398 --> 03:18:02,478
right so he knows the guy right so

4904
03:18:00,799 --> 03:18:04,478
that's one of the things i do and then

4905
03:18:02,478 --> 03:18:05,920
the pressing i love concentrates but to

4906
03:18:04,478 --> 03:18:07,920
be completely honest with you like the

4907
03:18:05,920 --> 03:18:09,439
glass scares the shit out of me so i'm

4908
03:18:07,920 --> 03:18:11,600
really into like this is my rig here

4909
03:18:09,439 --> 03:18:14,479
it's an electric one it's super fucking

4910
03:18:11,600 --> 03:18:17,279
easy it is my it is like my hourly

4911

to the mic there's more different uh

4920
03:18:35,040 --> 03:18:37,920
test settings and i usually like to

4921
03:18:36,559 --> 03:18:39,359
start it off on green and then move up

4922
03:18:37,920 --> 03:18:40,799

03:20:39,359 --> 03:20:43,200
bit about what you do and how we can

03:20:40,478 --> 03:20:46,000
support you my name is leah and i'm the

4985
03:20:43,200 --> 03:20:48,479
president of quad ag so we

4986
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:51,439
provide humates for plants animals and

4987
03:20:48,478 --> 03:20:53,840
humans predominantly in our agricultural

4988
03:20:51,439 --> 03:20:56,398
space we focus on

4989
03:20:53,840 --> 03:20:59,359
the biostimulants of humic and fulvic

4990
03:20:56,398 --> 03:21:01,760
acid as a adjunct to any nutrient

4991
03:20:59,359 --> 03:21:04,000
program and we fit into any grow system

4992
03:21:01,760 --> 03:21:04,960
so if you are growing in living soil

4993
03:21:04,000 --> 03:21:07,200
beds

4994
03:21:04,959 --> 03:21:09,039
either as a home grower or commercially

4995
03:21:07,200 --> 03:21:11,520
all the way through to aeroponics you

4996
03:21:09,040 --> 03:21:13,840
can safely fog our products and we focus

4997
03:21:11,520 --> 03:21:16,560
on root zone development and nutritional

4998
03:21:13,840 --> 03:21:18,000
uptake through plant tissues so

4999
03:21:16,559 --> 03:21:21,760
we're super

5000
03:21:18,000 --> 03:21:23,520
adaptive and help basically your plants

5001
03:21:21,760 --> 03:21:26,050
create better roots better shoots and

5002
03:21:23,520 --> 03:21:31,360
better fruits

5003
03:21:26,049 --> 03:21:31,359
[Laughter]

5004
03:21:34,559 --> 03:21:38,559
so how do people support us well

5005
03:21:37,680 --> 03:21:41,040
we

5006
03:21:38,559 --> 03:21:43,119
we love um

5007
03:21:41,040 --> 03:21:44,319
well we just basically help everybody in

5008
03:21:43,120 --> 03:21:47,279
their grow whether you're growing

5009
03:21:44,318 --> 03:21:50,478
cannabis or vegetables in your garden we

5010
03:21:47,279 --> 03:21:53,120
look to improve the soil and improve

5011
03:21:50,478 --> 03:21:55,199
the ecosystems and so we're seeing a lot

5012
03:21:53,120 --> 03:21:57,680
more conversation around regenerative

5013
03:21:55,200 --> 03:21:59,760
practices and

5014
03:21:57,680 --> 03:22:02,238
regenerative knowledge base and soil

5015
03:21:59,760 --> 03:22:04,398
ecology and bringing that knowledge into

5016
03:22:02,238 --> 03:22:06,879
commercial systems but that

5017
03:22:04,398 --> 03:22:08,238
those lessons learned also help

5018
03:22:06,879 --> 03:22:10,318
homegrowers that are looking to do

5019
03:22:08,238 --> 03:22:12,159
somewhat hydroponic or hybrid hydroponic

5020
03:22:10,318 --> 03:22:15,199
systems at home as well

5021
03:22:12,159 --> 03:22:18,000
so we are very knowledge based very

5022
03:22:15,200 --> 03:22:19,279
consultative based we sell a product but

5023
03:22:18,000 --> 03:22:21,760
we really believe in supporting the

5024
03:22:19,279 --> 03:22:24,399
communities that we service so

5025
03:22:21,760 --> 03:22:26,478
a way to support us is uh you know ask

5026
03:22:24,398 --> 03:22:28,879
your local hydroponics store if they

5027
03:22:26,478 --> 03:22:30,639
carry quad and if they do not

5028
03:22:28,879 --> 03:22:34,959
encourage them to so that we can support

5029
03:22:30,639 --> 03:22:37,039
more people that's a big thing for us

5030
03:22:34,959 --> 03:22:39,679
and then how people support you

5031
03:22:37,040 --> 03:22:41,520
oh geez um yeah

5032
03:22:39,680 --> 03:22:42,479
just give me a call let's work together

5033
03:22:41,520 --> 03:22:44,800
uh

5034
03:22:42,478 --> 03:22:46,000
so yeah i would like to get this guy

5035
03:22:44,799 --> 03:22:48,398
over

5036
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:51,040
invite this guy over and you will be so

5037
03:22:48,398 --> 03:22:52,799
ripped so that like it's like i also

5038
03:22:51,040 --> 03:22:54,800
have a lead on some pretty cool testing

5039
03:22:52,799 --> 03:22:56,559
as well for like hot slaytons and other

5040
03:22:54,799 --> 03:22:57,519
things like that roll into what you're

5041
03:22:56,559 --> 03:22:59,278
doing

5042
03:22:57,520 --> 03:23:00,800
oh we need to talk i actually have a lot

5043
03:22:59,279 --> 03:23:02,960
of people that are i've heard that a lot

5044
03:23:00,799 --> 03:23:04,478
today um we need to talk yeah we should

5045
03:23:02,959 --> 03:23:05,679
talk yeah we should

5046
03:23:04,478 --> 03:23:07,760
that's the beauty about these kind of

5047
03:23:05,680 --> 03:23:09,600
events is we have opportunities to find

5048
03:23:07,760 --> 03:23:11,040
those collaborative opportunities right

5049
03:23:09,600 --> 03:23:12,479
absolutely like

5050
03:23:11,040 --> 03:23:14,080
um that's what it's all built out of

5051
03:23:12,478 --> 03:23:15,358
it's just sort of like grassroots

5052
03:23:14,079 --> 03:23:16,799
community and then if it grows from

5053
03:23:15,359 --> 03:23:19,120
there it grows from there but i think

5054
03:23:16,799 --> 03:23:21,119
that's the best way to sort of like grow

5055
03:23:19,120 --> 03:23:22,880
as well and it's a new industry and i

5056
03:23:21,120 --> 03:23:24,160
may have been a daily consumer for 30

5057
03:23:22,879 --> 03:23:25,839
years but

5058
03:23:24,159 --> 03:23:27,920
it's new to all of us in the legal front

5059
03:23:25,840 --> 03:23:31,279
and so it's nice to like

5060
03:23:27,920 --> 03:23:33,680
make legal mistakes

5061
03:23:31,279 --> 03:23:36,800
right it's kind of nice

5062
03:23:33,680 --> 03:23:38,079
but no the way to support me like

5063
03:23:36,799 --> 03:23:40,719
i do work with a lot of hydroponic

5064
03:23:38,079 --> 03:23:42,959
stores and all the way from the pnw

5065
03:23:40,719 --> 03:23:46,079
squamish first off pnw is amazing the

5066

5067
03:23:46,079 --> 03:23:49,920
