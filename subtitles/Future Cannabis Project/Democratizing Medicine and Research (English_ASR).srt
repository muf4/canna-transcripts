1
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,870
Thank You Ariel thank you for inviting

2
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,609
me to participate and thank you for this

3
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:18,579
wonderful conference it's really

4
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:21,609
fantastic what you guys have done

5
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:25,269
I think I'll speak first to what I mean

6
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:27,579
when I say democratizing medicine when I

7
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:30,429
first said that I said people think that

8
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:33,189
we're trying to develop evidence-based

9
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:34,420
medicine from cannabis yes we're doing

10
00:00:33,189 --> 00:00:36,219
that because you want to put

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,070
evidence-based medicine in the hands of

12
00:00:36,219 --> 00:00:43,149
patients but more broadly what we're

13
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:46,289
trying to do is democratize medicine and

14
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:52,109
then she said what's that mean I said uh

15
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:56,409
the answer is healing is a noble art

16
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:58,929
there are many modalities of healing the

17
00:00:56,409 --> 00:01:02,558
one we popularly called medicine has its

18
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:05,049
rules its standards of care etc there

19
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,459
are also other forms of healing and and

20
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:09,670
you're going to be talking about some of

21
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:11,770
them later today I'm sure but the

22
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:17,469
purpose of healing the purpose of

23
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:22,118
medicine is to serve humanity to serve

24
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:24,908
people not profits profits may be a

25
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:27,599
consequence of our actions but we make

26
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:33,009
profits the reason we're doing something

27
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:36,759
we lose our first principle we have to

28
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:39,069
help people and by democratizing it

29
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:43,319
means any human being on the planet that

30
00:01:39,069 --> 00:01:47,310
is suffering needs to have must have

31
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:51,459
access to appropriate modalities that

32
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:55,859
relieve that suffering democratizing

33
00:01:51,459 --> 00:02:00,219
medicine is primarily about access and

34
00:01:55,858 --> 00:02:04,078
affordability - so that's what I mean

35
00:02:00,218 --> 00:02:07,478
when I talk about democratizing medicine

36
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:10,688
I'm here mainly I mean yes I have a

37
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:12,188
title as something at a company but I'm

38
00:02:10,688 --> 00:02:14,229
mainly here as a patient

39
00:02:12,188 --> 00:02:17,378
I'm a 19 year

40
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:20,109
answer survivor I still have cancer

41
00:02:17,378 --> 00:02:22,628
I took a drug every day that's oral

42
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:26,280
cancer medication it saved my life I was

43
00:02:22,628 --> 00:02:30,060
three weeks away from dying 19 years ago

44
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,799
unfortunately that same healing medicine

45
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:40,299
has had Dilla tereus effects on my

46
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:42,099
kidneys my lungs and my heart so I spent

47
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:45,390
a lot of quality time with medical

48
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:48,878
professionals and I've become a bit of a

49
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:54,098
professional patient and that the thing

50
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:58,780
that I find is that patients need good

51
00:02:54,098 --> 00:03:01,810
information and good alternatives and

52
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,848
we're often prescribed medicine that

53
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,039
creates more problems than it solves

54
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:08,048
you know I'm four I took good good trade

55
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:12,689
off for me I got to live for 19 years

56
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:16,659
but now I'm fighting heart kidneys lungs

57
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:20,049
but it was worth it but but the point is

58
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:22,810
I had to fight to get on the clinical

59
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:24,219
trial for the drug to start with it

60
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:27,848
wasn't easy

61
00:03:24,219 --> 00:03:29,709
so I want to help people that's it I

62
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:33,009
want to put medicine in the hands of

63
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:37,530
patients and I want they'd help do what

64
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:37,530
we can to reduce human suffering

65
00:03:38,229 --> 00:03:48,299

career in intellectual property of a

00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:00,960
nationally recognized IP boutique and

00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,109
she's worked with clients in many

74
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,629
different industries such as biotech

75
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,630

of strong science and IP experience with

80
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,200
a solid understanding of her clients

81
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,839
business needs rather than tackling

82
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,610
client IP objectives in a vacuum she

83
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,349
uses her client business objectives and

84
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,509
considerations to guide her I clean

85
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:36,330

amazing woman and her bio

89
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:47,019
but I just would rather everyone here

90
00:04:44,060 --> 00:05:10,490
speak because she's doing really amazing

91
00:04:47,019 --> 00:05:12,229
creative things Thank You Ariel and

92
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,269
thank you for inviting me as well and

93
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,980
I'm glad to hear that you had the same

94
00:05:14,269 --> 00:05:18,379
question when Ariel first mentioned to

95
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,180
me that it was democratizing medicine my

96
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:22,969
first question was what does that mean

97
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,980
to you and so after we talked about it

98
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:27,410
more it made a lot of sense for me even

99
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:30,560
as a patent attorney to be on a panel

100
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:33,200
like this and so Ariel mentioned that I

101
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,589
did recently provide comments to the FDA

102
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,719
and I did that largely based not on my

103
00:05:36,589 --> 00:05:40,789
experience with what the efficacy or

104
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,830
safety data is because I felt like that

105
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,689
was really well covered by a lot of the

106
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:47,539
public I went I did listen to the

107
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:49,430
hearing I also went through as many of

108
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:51,710
the comments as I as I reasonably could

109
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:55,400
they received I believe well over 4,000

110
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:58,639
comments and so looking at that and

111
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:00,319
based on my experience with the clients

112
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,259
that I've helped in this you know

113
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,930
process and and well I'm not an FDA

114
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:08,209
attorney most of my clients do deal with

115
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,579
the FDA and I I do witness what they go

116
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:12,169
through and do help them and then on the

117
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:16,250
flip side of that I've also helped

118
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:19,189
generic drug manufacturers deal with the

119
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,740
FDA in terms of looking through the

120
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:23,959
orange book and in validating patents so

121
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,600
that they can enter the market early and

122
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,029
have some exclusivity for doing that and

123
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,730
as I was thinking about what my

124
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:32,569
experience was and what I could bring to

125
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:34,310
democratizing medicine because the one

126
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:36,469
thing that I realized about the FDA is

127
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,920
if they try to regulate all of cannabis

128
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:42,020
like a drug as they've defined it it

129
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,360
would just you know completely destroy

130
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:46,129
the industry and I think you know one of

131
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,259
the aspects too is that a lot of the

132
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:50,899
pioneers in the industry who've really

133
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:52,610
risked so much of you know their there's

134
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:54,620
you know

135
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,788
they've made so many sacrifices and also

136
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,180
professionally they've you know

137
00:06:55,788 --> 00:07:00,829
sacrificed as well that it could really

138
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,959
destroy them and those wouldn't be the

139
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:06,050
people who benefit from you know an

140
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:10,250
onerous FDA regulation to come out of

141
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:13,340
that so my comment to the FDA was that

142
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:16,279
there needed to be at least two tiers of

143
00:07:13,339 --> 00:07:18,948
regulation one based on a generic drug

144
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:22,369
model which I've had experience with and

145
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:24,228
that being that when you enter a generic

146
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,509
drug are you when you apply to the FDA

147
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:28,610
to have a generic drug into the market

148
00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:31,340
you don't you aren't put through the

149
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:34,098
complete process of you know providing

150
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:36,769
your you know extensive animal testing

151
00:07:34,098 --> 00:07:39,110
clinical trial all the data that you go

152
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:40,459
through for a new drug application

153
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,710
you're actually gone through an

154
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:45,258
abbreviated drug new drug application

155
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:48,258
and in that process it's more focused on

156
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:51,259
the chemistry the testing your

157
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:53,538
laboratory and bioequivalence and so for

158
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:56,718
something where they have so much safety

159
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:58,250
data I felt that that was you know a

160
00:07:56,718 --> 00:08:01,038
middle ground that could be applied at

161
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,449
least to start and then to encourage you

162
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:05,060
know because right now what I'm seeing

163
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:07,788
is a lot of patents being filed a lot of

164
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,240
what I call land grabs where I'm seeing

165
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:13,370
you know these very broad patents

166
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,870
covering you know much more than than

167
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,610
what they're deserving of or you know

168
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,168
covering what's in the prior art because

169
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,150
we don't know what's in the prior art

170
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:22,278
there wasn't a lot of publications going

171
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:26,478
on during prohibition so we have no idea

172
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:28,399
what research was being done and so you

173
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:31,098
know providing a model similar to the

174
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,809
generic drugs where you encourage you

175
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:35,958
encourage other companies to invalidate

176
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:38,718
these overly broad patents and enjoy

177
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:40,518
some period of exclusivity once they're

178
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,680
invalidated and then let everybody come

179
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:44,778
to the market after that because one of

180
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:48,559
the things that I believe in terms of

181
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:50,570
access is that you know really promoting

182
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,639
price competition having more brands

183
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,670
more you know and that's really what the

184
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:58,669
generic drug Act was about was this idea

185
00:08:55,669 --> 00:09:00,198
of you know you still want to encourage

186
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:02,809
innovation and there's a place for

187
00:09:00,198 --> 00:09:05,689
patents and innovation but you also want

188
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:06,109
to encourage more competition in the

189
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:10,090
market

190
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,090
so that it can become more affordable

191
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,860
[Music]

192
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:41,029
his TV is actually 43 he has served as

193
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,250
the director seat of the super Sayan a

194
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:52,240
publication by part of myalgia rehab

195
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:52,240
program and actor scientific advisory of

196
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:52,689
yeah I'm happy to answer that but I'd

197
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:53,889
like to elaborate a little bit on what

198
00:10:52,688 --> 00:10:56,259
John said because I think there's

199
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:58,678
another part democratising to run a

200
00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:02,139
democracy you need educated voters yeah

201
00:10:58,678 --> 00:11:04,269
so the question I got is education first

202
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:06,149
you know there's and I think I need to

203
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:10,360
bring that to the table Arielle first

204
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:13,119
recent ACR studies showed 90% of bar of

205
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:17,169
bud tenders across the country have had

206
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:20,379
no formal education so we're talking

207
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:21,878
here about other than the pockets like

208
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:24,188
Pennsylvania where there's actually an

209
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:26,860
embedded pharmacist generally the

210
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:29,259
patient who's going to a dispensary

211
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,480
doesn't really get good information they

212
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:34,659
don't have any easy access right now to

213
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,670
no warnings drug interactions if they're

214
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:38,769
on a blood thinner if they're on insulin

215
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:41,110
all those things are tentacle nergic

216
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:42,629
sudol interacts that's one the second

217
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:46,899
problem with this source of information

218
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:50,438
actually relates to physicians as well

219
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:53,350
and that is I think that I tell two

220
00:11:50,438 --> 00:11:54,998
stories there's there's the when my

221
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,528
patients tell me they go to a doctor

222
00:11:54,999 --> 00:12:00,100
before they see me I'm out of this

223
00:11:56,528 --> 00:12:03,278
picture one person sees a doctor and the

224
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:05,798
doctor says okay so that's the end of

225
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,149
that discussion that's about 10 to 20

226
00:12:05,798 --> 00:12:09,159
percent of physicians and Ashley right

227
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:11,619
now at least but by our early surveys

228
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:12,100
the next group is a much larger group

229
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:15,279
which is

230
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,970
that's cool I support it and the

231
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,149
discussion tell me how what happened

232
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:21,370
okay

233
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:23,889
there is a very small minority of

234
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:26,289
physicians you know in the country who

235
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:28,449
are willing to take the time to talk

236
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:30,519
with the patients about interactions we

237
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:33,100
heard a lot today here about titration

238
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,379
i'ma I do kind of like another approach

239
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,659
which is micro dosing so I'll start a

240
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:39,279
one drop increase to three by every two

241
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:41,139
to three days although really that's the

242
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,419
same thing I do agree we need to

243
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:45,610
individualize therapies the third

244
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:47,529
problem is the problem I get is when I

245
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,210
make a recommendation let's say for

246
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:51,459
cancer news news of nausea vomiting or

247
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:55,660
any or pain is when the patient goes to

248
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:57,879
the dispensary they get overwhelmed that

249
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:59,740
is really one we do not have we've been

250
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:02,139
hearing a lot about terpenes today in

251
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:03,730
California we have no requirement

252
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:06,460
because of the regulatory issues for

253
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,350
terpenes so I get patients who you know

254
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,180
I just lifted my fibromyalgia experience

255
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,710
I know I can do a better job but it's

256
00:13:10,179 --> 00:13:13,750
only about 50 60 percent of my patients

257
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:16,330
respond sometimes it's because

258
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,649
quote-unquote it stops working oh it

259
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,490
stopped working or I went to a different

260
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:21,370
dispensary

261
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:23,560
and I got the exact same strain so the

262
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:25,330
issue is because we got the labeling

263
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,069
here I mean the good news is as you know

264
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:29,230
since this year we have toxicology

265
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:32,430
labeling and you know prior to that many

266
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:35,289
of the grows in in were actually had

267
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:37,569
mycotoxins and alike and we're there but

268
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:39,789
we're not quite where Colorado is where

269
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:42,310
which requires at least the major

270
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:44,079
terpene has to be declared so you know I

271
00:13:42,309 --> 00:13:45,729
think it's really confusing my patients

272
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,530
say well you know I got this one here I

273
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:49,240
got it out of Colorado this high-end

274
00:13:47,529 --> 00:13:52,990
link lie Molina and helped my brain fog

275
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,210
for my fibro we again information we've

276
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:57,879
got to make educated voters back to your

277
00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:00,580
question cancer it's a touchy issue

278
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:02,830
there is that we don't really have any

279
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:05,740
specific data that I can say from our

280
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:07,840
CTS that says it helps cancer the

281
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,269
general rule is actually one is that

282
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,060
helps the symptoms related to cancer so

283
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:15,610
cancer douche nausea and vomiting our

284
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:17,739
classic ones that clearly cannabis does

285
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,560
help their several moderate Evans their

286
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:22,389
there is some case series there's a

287
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,169
local physician here in the community

288
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:26,059
you may know Bonnie Goldstein who is

289
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:28,219
some gliomas and children with some

290
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:29,328
success in case series but we don't

291
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,700
really have the data

292
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:34,939
the bigger challenge at the moment for

293
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:37,129
us as physicians at the moment is you

294
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,889
know a lot of the my patient symptoms

295
00:14:37,129 --> 00:14:41,778
the lack of sleep the anxiety the nausea

296
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:43,698
really would be helped by cannabis but

297
00:14:41,778 --> 00:14:45,230
I'm giving them chemotherapy with taxol

298
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:49,129
I'm giving chemotherapy with all kinds

299
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:51,860
of drugs you know cannabis and we said

300
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:53,419
is an immunomodulator are we doing a

301
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,570
good thing when we're mixing cannabis

302
00:14:53,419 --> 00:14:58,729
and chemotherapy nude occasions are we

303
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,500
are we actually inhibiting the effect of

304
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,269
the chemotherapeutic agent maybe we're

305
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,730
even making it better no really good

306
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,500
data the preliminary data with a couple

307
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,509
of the chemotherapeutic agents suggests

308
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,720
we're not doing any harm and we probably

309
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:13,549
could combine but we need more studies

310
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,709
again this is a area of sparse data

311
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:17,179
unfortunately and but it's something

312
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:21,739
that we're all trying to face now in the

313
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:23,599
field yeah so I'm just saying if

314
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,329
anything I suspect it's gonna be adjunct

315
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,278
'iv not a it's not going to be a primary

316
00:15:26,328 --> 00:15:29,929
agent for a given cancer you're not

317
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:33,070
going to give a cannabis compound you

318
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,069
use it in combination with

319
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,649
[Music]

320
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:58,279
yeah I want to point out for physicians

321
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,519
if they're interested that's a problem

322
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:03,319
actually UCLA we have a physicians our

323
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,000
website the cannabis research initiative

324
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:08,620
also through LA County Department of

325
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,169
Health actually have a a a list of

326
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:15,590
recommendations and rules and stuff a

327
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:17,209
the physician handbook for for

328
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:19,670
physicians are willing to consider

329
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:21,470
recommending cannabis so there's a start

330
00:16:19,669 --> 00:16:22,849
but there's I don't know but we need to

331
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:25,509
work on butter's but tender

332
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,509

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,660
Wow

339
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:05,079
do you want to take that one I'm gonna

340
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:06,700
alright so it's the health care system

341
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:08,740
and medical cannabis the two questions

342
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,019
at the health care system right now has

343
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:13,089
a we're going through growing pains our

344
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:14,379
pharmaceutical as we're recognizing we

345
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:16,480
have some problems in our pharmaceutical

346
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,010
industries that that there's gonna be

347
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,240
some realigning that's going to take

348
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:24,430
place we're now understanding that

349
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,950
companies that have produced these

350
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:28,630
opioids are losing market share and

351
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:30,039
that's gonna there's going to be some

352
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:32,950
shifts are gonna take place and we might

353
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:35,139
get control over this over this disaster

354
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:38,049
there's no way to explain it it was a

355
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,550
failure on every single level that helps

356
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:41,769
democratization of medicine because

357
00:18:39,549 --> 00:18:43,450
people are saying we cannot we're not

358
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:45,339
sure about those that healthcare

359
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,289
industry anymore we're gonna go try

360
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:49,539
things our own way and that's where

361
00:18:47,289 --> 00:18:51,909
medical cannabis comes into play and so

362
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:54,670
I think that's sort of the where we're

363
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:56,110
at right now we do have to get control

364
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:59,650
of our ship we have to get control of

365
00:18:56,109 --> 00:19:01,719
our our healthcare ecosystem we spend a

366
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,519
tremendous amount of my of our resources

367
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,900
are put directly into taking care of

368
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,900
patients but we're not naturally getting

369
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,160
particularly better so that's in

370
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:11,440
comparison to other industrialized

371
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,540
nations so there's some issues that

372
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,350
which goes back to what John was saying

373
00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:20,680
about where we're in the original

374
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:22,449
thinking of healthcare was people going

375
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,370
after something difficult people

376
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:25,930
suffering and going after and doing

377
00:19:24,369 --> 00:19:28,359
anything they can possibly can to

378
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:30,340
alleviate that suffering that created

379
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:32,159
our healthcare industry it created our

380
00:19:30,339 --> 00:19:35,279
pharmaceutical companies

381
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,710
and it was just things were a little bit

382
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:40,109
simpler a hundred years ago and they did

383
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,059
rely on plants for a number of

384
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:44,429
treatments it was a it was an accepted

385
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:45,960
thing now we're now we've become now

386
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:48,120
we've got all these great assets and all

387
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,160
these great tools they now need to be

388
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:52,409
applied to this this new industry

389
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,440
there's there's no there's no way to go

390
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:57,300
do this parallel route hopefully we'll

391
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,730
be able to cult you know there'll be

392
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:02,009
some culling in the healthcare sector I

393
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:03,360
think directly related to cannabis and

394
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:07,049
directly related to how it's going to be

395
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:08,669
used as a common you know whether it's

396
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:09,779
immunomodulator or whether it's immune

397
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,519
system function whether it's pain

398
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:12,690
whether it's cancer these are these are

399
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,569
number of different diseases that we

400
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,460
just don't have good drugs to for so so

401
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:19,950
that's gonna be a natural phenomenon

402
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,289
so our health care system can kind of

403
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,029
prove it's going to take active voters

404
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:28,079
and like Jack Harris had two things we

405
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:30,000
vote and run for office do that if you

406
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:32,669
wanted to market eyes medicine you now

407
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,579
have you now take take you know take the

408
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:37,050
he'll do it I tried I ran for Congress

409
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:39,960
this year and I ran on a medical

410
00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:41,759
cannabis platform and and it was

411
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,829
something because I was a scientist I

412
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,089
was like I can help here I know this

413
00:20:43,829 --> 00:20:47,099
thing I develop I'm a pharmacologist

414
00:20:45,089 --> 00:20:49,709
others there's ways to there's ways that

415
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:51,240
we can do great things if we just tweak

416
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,519
what we're doing and I think now we're

417
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,700
realizing the the institutions are there

418
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:58,619
the there's a there's a new breed of a

419
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,420
whole new style of companies that are

420
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:02,399
now coming in to fulfill healthcare

421
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:03,360
response you know to fulfill things that

422
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,490
we weren't able to we have to educate

423
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:10,589
our tenders and our and our businesses

424
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:12,180
need to need to up their game doctors

425
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:14,069
are ready you know the doctors are ready

426
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,140
we're reaching the point where we're no

427
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:17,339
longer early adopters this is now going

428
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,920
to be a part of our health care system

429
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:21,389
but as an industry we have to up our

430
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,160
game so that the patient feels

431
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:25,640
comfortable the doctors feel comfortable

432
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:29,950
and that everybody's together on this

433
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:32,500
did I answer is there anything

434
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:35,380
quite ready but the point is as someone

435
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:38,339
who also does clinical research well

436
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:41,440
it's a real there out there and I think

437
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:42,939
yeah the point I got when I put the

438
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,160
institutional review boards are

439
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,960
generally very antagonistic right now

440
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,810
they're about trying to do anything

441
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,730
related to cannabis there are you know

442
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:54,009
institutional boards are have been very

443
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:55,990
resistant I've had long discussions I

444
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:58,420
even had a simple survey took three

445
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,160
months to get approval but the point is

446
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,080
generally what would generally what

447
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,580
they're asking that any kind of cannabis

448
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,949
even hemp has to be kept in a locked

449
00:22:03,579 --> 00:22:07,929
storeroom somewhere on the institution

450
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,890
you know or it has to is we heard all

451
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:11,799
the problems they're getting it from

452
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:13,870
Mississippi you know generally there it

453
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:16,000
is really very difficult to this point

454
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:18,429
to do a randomized clinical trial it's

455
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,960
almost impossible at the moment and that

456
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,850
point is if we're gonna get the

457
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,890
information we need we're gonna have to

458
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:26,740
reduce some of these barriers I'm hoping

459
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:28,810
now that the December 2018 farm bill

460
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:31,180
will allow us to look at hemp derived

461
00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:33,220
products emptor i've terpenes that will

462
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,930
open up a whole new thing but the IRB

463
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,930
czar just a couple months off they

464
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:39,310
haven't quite heard the message yet yeah

465
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:41,080
I mean real medicine is always gonna be

466
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:43,899
a little bit slow it's that that's the

467
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:45,669
the the medicine doesn't come easy when

468
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,940
you can say like listen this works it

469
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:51,160
it's you know natural beings human

470
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:54,009
beings and plants were all they're

471
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:56,259
really complicated organisms and and so

472
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:57,910
that will you know that like we there's

473
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:59,950
some patients but now we can't we you

474
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,330
know there's but at the same time we're

475
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:04,870
all impatient because we have a we have

476
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:08,679
a field that needs to be built i the

477
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:11,409
clinical trial aspects are very in some

478
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,330
ways take away the democratization of

479
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:14,890
medicine and we now know this we know

480
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:16,990
our clinical trials are ridiculously

481
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,460
expensive and they're time consuming and

482
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:19,779
they're not getting the outcomes that we

483
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,670
should be getting and I think that

484
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:24,039
presents opportunities in this industry

485
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:27,190
to take to take some of what our

486
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:30,159
infrastructure is in the industry and be

487
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:32,740
able to do that type of you know we have

488
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,330
we have phenomenal testing labs that are

489
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,130
showing up that are that are complying

490
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,869
to regulations that are really

491
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,760
sophisticated like we're saying we need

492
00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:41,289
to understand these these the terpenes

493
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:42,410
and cannabinoids and they do have an

494
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:44,509
impact on

495
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:48,440
on very important conditions we have and

496
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:50,660
and goes back to raising you know we

497
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:52,190
have to we are game has to get up in

498
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:54,259
order to be able to go to the

499
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:55,610
institutions and and and be able to say

500
00:23:54,259 --> 00:23:57,170
hey listen how are we going to do this

501
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:59,689
how are we going to get that there's a

502
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:02,210
couple of the the federal government is

503
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,980
just starting to fund pain research

504
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,240
grants that's gonna be an ass that's

505
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,589
gonna be a real asset to get the

506
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,390
institutions on board

507
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:10,250
California has a hundred million dollars

508
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,020
that's over the next five years it's

509
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,940
going to go once the taxes are paid and

510
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:15,889
there's revenue coming in that are going

511
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:17,840
to go towards medical research and I

512
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,190
think those things will will will help

513
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,349
the cause

514
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:24,559
but yeah the clinical the clinical trial

515
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:27,079
aspects is a is a even even for a normal

516
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,210
drug there there it's it's it's brain

517
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:31,879
damage so we have improvements that are

518
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:33,769
being made you know hopefully faster

519
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,980
than you know sooner than later at this

520
00:24:33,769 --> 00:24:35,980
point

521
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,028
[Music]

522
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:11,429
right so I I did that for a it's a

523
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:13,980
company here in well not any longer but

524
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:16,350
in Southern California and we started

525
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,089
from just one patent application it was

526
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:22,319
some research done at the University

527
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:26,069
that then was taken out and researched

528
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:28,619
further privately and we built the

529
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:30,480
portfolio and they were getting very

530
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:33,659
exciting results of course this is lab

531
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,370
results and then we moved to animal

532
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:39,330
models and they were still getting very

533
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:41,159
good results and in that process of

534
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:43,740
going through that you know I was very

535
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,990
we had built this from one single patent

536
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,549
application to probably hundreds of

537
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:49,620
applications that we were prosecuting

538
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:52,049
all around the world and I wasn't

539
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:53,639
overseeing all of that and that was

540
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:57,539
because they were getting such exciting

541
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,250
results and you know up next would have

542
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:01,500
been FDA you know they started their

543
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:03,809
clinical trials you know early clinical

544
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:08,940
trials to evaluate evaluate safety and

545
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:10,829
efficacy and and and how that informed

546
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,480
me was you know one of the and this is

547
00:26:10,829 --> 00:26:15,299
why I became so passionate about what

548
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,370
the FDA is doing is because you know I

549
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:19,529
was I was I was very involved in that

550
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:22,229
work and very committed to what what

551
00:26:19,529 --> 00:26:24,269
they were doing but then they had

552
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:27,029
another division of their company that

553
00:26:24,269 --> 00:26:29,819
was also had an inhaled insulin product

554
00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:32,399
that you know really looked promising in

555
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:34,649
terms of patient compliance where you're

556
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,850
inhaling insulin versus injecting

557
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:41,340
insulin and the the FDA process for them

558
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:43,500
nearly sunk them completely and it

559
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:45,809
certainly killed off their entire cancer

560
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:49,349
research division and that was so

561
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:50,789
disheartening for me to go through to

562
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:52,629
you know because that was all of my work

563
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:54,789
yet they just slowly abandoned you

564
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,230
one patent family here or another patent

565
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:59,109
family here until just the entire

566
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:02,200
portfolio and the unfortunate thing with

567
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:05,289
you know if you don't have patents

568
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,660
really are a tool it's about investment

569
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:10,119
it's about getting investors to put

570
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:13,960
money in and have a way for them to see

571
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:15,879
a you know have a the patents what they

572
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,769
do is provide them away so that they can

573
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,780
see how they're going to recoup their

574
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:23,019
money the exclusivity is what's going to

575
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:25,899
allow them to recoup their money and you

576
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:27,339
know to see when things are not patented

577
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,320
or something like this where all their

578
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:31,269
patents went abandoned you really don't

579
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:33,639
see any research done on them after that

580
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:35,980
because once it goes abandoned it's in

581
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,690
the public domain nobody's gonna want to

582
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,099
spend any more money on it because they

583
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:42,610
can't see a way to recoup their

584
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:44,079
investment and so that's one of the ways

585
00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:46,719
you know that's one of the reasons that

586
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,639
I got very involved in in thinking

587
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,970
through you know a couple different

588
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,640
models for the FDA and it also helps now

589
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:56,250
because what I see right now in terms of

590
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,930
the work that's being done is

591
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:00,460
interestingly most of the patent

592
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:03,220
applications that are being filed right

593
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:06,039
now are not being filed by a big pharma

594
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:08,950
I don't know they're filing in Canada

595
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:11,289
but not in the US I don't know if that

596
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,850
is you know political reasons or they

597
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:15,220
just can't because it's federally

598
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:19,079
illegal they don't want to to do that

599
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:21,789
yet but I see right now a window where

600
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:24,039
people who are in this the pioneers in

601
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:25,899
this doing the research getting the data

602
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:28,259
you know if there's this window for them

603
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:30,430
to file for patent protection and

604
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:32,680
because we know what big farm is going

605
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:35,049
to do once it's federally legalized it's

606
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,600
gonna be all about an IP game they know

607
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:41,409
how to play that game and if you don't

608
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:43,089
have a way to either negotiate what

609
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:45,970
they're asking you to pay in a royalty

610
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:48,730
by well let me offer you what I have

611
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:51,490
patented or to defend against a lawsuit

612
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:54,819
then you're really just a sitting duck

613
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:57,549
and just waiting to pay royalties to Big

614
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:59,679
Pharma so in terms of the patent game

615
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:02,139
that I that I've seen the cancer

616
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,989
industry go through and and just biotech

617
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,759
and pharma

618
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:09,460
when it came to cannabis that was what

619
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:11,259
really motivated me to get involved and

620
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,899
to speak out and to try to do more to

621
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:16,118
educate all of these researchers and

622
00:29:13,898 --> 00:29:18,098
companies and everyone who's who's

623
00:29:16,118 --> 00:29:20,439
putting all of this work into it you

624
00:29:18,098 --> 00:30:07,449
know find a way to make sure that you

625
00:29:20,440 --> 00:30:11,409
have a post legalization strategy well

626
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:14,109
that's really pretty easy us the policy

627
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:15,789
US policy towards cannabis research and

628
00:30:14,108 --> 00:30:19,388
drug development is boneheaded

629
00:30:15,788 --> 00:30:23,499
approaching criminal and there's no

630
00:30:19,388 --> 00:30:25,658
other way to describe it we it pretty

631
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:27,629
much forced us out of the United States

632
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:30,669
we have two divisions one division

633
00:30:27,628 --> 00:30:33,519
cultivates extract sells products in

634
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:35,528
Nevada and we work with the in Louisiana

635
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:39,479
to with LSU for the patience of

636
00:30:35,528 --> 00:30:43,118
Louisiana but a research side we we were

637
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:45,338
stymied over and over again when we

638
00:30:43,118 --> 00:30:48,728
tried to move towards animal studies for

639
00:30:45,338 --> 00:30:50,918
example so we finally threw up our hands

640
00:30:48,729 --> 00:30:54,219
and we created a new company that's a

641
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:57,278
subsidiary of g/b Sciences it has the

642
00:30:54,219 --> 00:31:01,389
very unpretentious name of GBS global

643
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:03,878
biopharma and and I didn't think of the

644
00:31:01,388 --> 00:31:07,449
name but that's alright they convinced

645
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:09,398
me and we was and and we moved it up

646
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:13,629
there and created the company and now

647
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:15,079
and draya's doing our animal studies

648
00:31:13,628 --> 00:31:18,648
with the National

649
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:20,960
search Council of Canada not only were

650
00:31:18,648 --> 00:31:23,629
we able to do the research they opened

651
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:26,990
us with enthusiastically with welcomed

652
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:30,320
arms when we first approached them they

653
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:33,409
said well there's 25 or 30 companies

654
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:36,678
ahead of you in line and so we might be

655
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:41,360
able to get to to you next year year

656
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:45,528
after that didn't work very well for us

657
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:49,038
so I sent andreas small dr. andreas

658
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:51,440
small Howard our resident assassin who

659
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:54,440
went who went up there and showed them

660
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,630
our data and made a presentation on what

661
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:00,130
we were trying to do in our research and

662
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:06,889
they moved us to the front of the line

663
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:09,409
now that wouldn't happen in the US okay

664
00:32:06,888 --> 00:32:13,579
I think the situation is more favorable

665
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:15,860
in virtually any country Europe most of

666
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:19,308
Europe not all but most of Europe

667
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:21,199
Australia we've had some pretty heard

668
00:32:19,308 --> 00:32:23,599
some pretty good pitches about coming

669
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,460
down there and doing trials and and

670
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:27,678
there's a more important aspect to it I

671
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:30,169
want to speak to is that you know in the

672
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:34,700
US if you if you have a canvas compound

673
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:38,500
you do a an hour B test and you get F

674
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:41,720
results in efficacy and safety etc

675
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:44,089
you're almost you're bound to go to the

676
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,798
FDA approach pretty much if you ever

677
00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:48,349
want to open your mouth about the

678
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:50,269
results from your your pilot study or

679
00:32:48,349 --> 00:32:54,439
trial you got to go through the full

680
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:59,359
10-year billion-dollar often death March

681
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:01,399
as you experience to to getting it to

682
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:02,148
the patients that's ten years a billion

683
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:05,558
dollars later

684
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:08,268
that's why drugs cost so much right so

685
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:10,428
in Canada they do have a couple

686
00:33:08,269 --> 00:33:13,190
alternative paths they're not

687
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:16,610
necessarily shorter they're not

688
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:19,669
necessarily they're not that they

689
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:21,558
require evidence-based medicine but you

690
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:23,870
have an alternative you can go what's

691
00:33:21,558 --> 00:33:26,539
called the medical supplements at

692
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:29,419
route or the cannabis supplements route

693
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:32,450
which is new category and you can do

694
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:36,640
your trials publish your results make

695
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:41,299
claims and start selling it to patients

696
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:44,059
and that takes a matter of one or two

697
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:46,700
years as opposed to 10 it's a matter of

698
00:33:44,058 --> 00:33:50,389
a million dollars maybe instead of a

699
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:53,330
billion that's Canada they're trying to

700
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:54,860
figure things out and help patients the

701
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:57,769
US FDA

702
00:33:54,859 --> 00:34:00,609
50% of their operating cost are funded

703
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:03,650
by the pharmaceutical industry right

704
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:07,509
there they're in business to perpetuate

705
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:10,369
a system that profits the farm industry

706
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:12,760
earlier Michael said that you know the

707
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:15,769
farm industry like every industry talked

708
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:19,070
started talking about talking about

709
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:20,949
healing but that's just like politicians

710
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:24,230
starting out talking about doing good

711
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:28,339
pretty soon they get co-opted by the

712
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:34,990
system the money overtakes their sins

713
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:37,340
and and if anyway so if we could

714
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:40,638
reorient the pharmaceutical industry in

715
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:44,269
the u.s. open up research then maybe we

716
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:53,480
got a chance but right now patients in

717
00:34:44,269 --> 00:34:55,840
the US are getting a bad deal we

718
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,949
actually got some very good

719
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,559
graft-versus-host which could save

720
00:34:57,949 --> 00:35:02,960
children's lives could not do the study

721
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:05,269
we did the Phase two in Israel and in

722
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,920
about doing Phase three and the FDA is

723
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:10,309
aware of it but we wouldn't let us do it

724
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:12,760
here they have deaf ears right I mean

725
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:15,719
and here's plugged up with money

726
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,780
[Applause]

727
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:18,779
[Music]

728
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,140
one thing and then I want to interesting

729
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:35,019
you know there's there's marketing push

730
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:37,049
and there's demand pull if you if you're

731
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:40,090
a marketing guy you either

732
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:42,430
convince them to buy it or the demand

733
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:44,950
pulls it to the market the way we're

734
00:35:42,429 --> 00:35:48,639
going to here's our strategy we're gonna

735
00:35:44,949 --> 00:35:50,589
take these compounds to Canada we're

736
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:52,569
gonna develop it on a fast path as

737
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,980
medical supplements we're gonna get them

738
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:55,960
in the hands of patients one of our

739
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:59,260
compound is a Parkinson's two compound

740
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:59,800
all right let's hope it works knock on

741
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:02,740
wood

742
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,710
assuming they say it's efficacious we're

743
00:36:02,739 --> 00:36:09,129
gonna start selling it in Europe and in

744
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:10,990
in Canada as a medical supplement or a

745
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:13,539
cannabis supplement based on the new

746
00:36:10,989 --> 00:36:16,449
category we're not going to charge an

747
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:20,259
arm and a leg for it right and we're

748
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:22,149
gonna let and I I have just

749
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:25,030
gastrointestinal stromal tumors to

750
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:27,099
cancer after 19 years we 19 years ago a

751
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:29,109
group of us formed a non-profit called a

752
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:31,089
life raft group and it's to help

753
00:36:29,108 --> 00:36:32,889
patients and font sponsor Research

754
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:35,980
Center what we were one of the first

755
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:38,289
online viral communities of patients we

756
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:40,420
got written up case studies and stuff

757
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:42,789
but anyway the point is right now every

758
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:46,329
disease state in the planet on the

759
00:36:42,789 --> 00:36:49,000
planet has a viral support group so if

760
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:52,119
you go to Canada and have a put my drug

761
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:59,130
a compound that helps Parkinson's

762
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:59,130
patients every Parkinson page holy hell

763
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,970
raise holy hell nicely because some of

764
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,860
it so there's a there's a lot of us in

765
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:16,109
it you know we've gotta I mean it goes

766
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:18,090
back to this is we're improving our

767
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,620
industry and when our in when the

768
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:21,630
standards of our industry improve and

769
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:23,489
our businesses improve we're going to

770
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:27,059
start to get the attempt you know not we

771
00:37:23,489 --> 00:37:30,689
we are getting the attention as a health

772
00:37:27,059 --> 00:37:33,210
care as a treatment as a preventative

773
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:38,849
there these are words that get used by

774
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:40,800
the FDA as being as as as rejecting the

775
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:42,329
new medicines coming in saying you can't

776
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,950
do this you can't do that because the

777
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:46,230
thing is what hurts this business is

778
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:47,579
when somebody doesn't somebody in our in

779
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,320
our industry doesn't do what they're

780
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:51,809
supposed to be doing and then the FDA

781
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,519
says you're selling this product as a

782
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:56,190
treatment it doesn't even have what

783
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:57,570
you're saying on the bottle these are

784
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:00,360
the kinds of things that don't help any

785
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:01,950
us this is the rise of you know these

786
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:06,000
are the things that are easily remedied

787
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:07,679
if you just you know improve improve you

788
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,650
know there's there's a desire to improve

789
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:12,419
this industry can self-regulate and do

790
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:14,130
and provide good products then you're

791
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,809
going then then we have an opportunity

792
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:18,240
to do this in the United States and and

793
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:19,320
and you know we are we do already we

794
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:22,439
already have the opportunity in the

795
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:26,220
United States to do it the businesses

796
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,329
aren't are on the radar of the companies

797
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:28,169
that want to do the right thing I mean

798
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:30,480
I'm a farm

799
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:32,730
I'm a pharmacologist so I was trained to

800
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,349
go develop drugs this happens to be a

801
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:36,269
broad-spectrum compound that has a lot

802
00:38:34,349 --> 00:38:37,739
of use we're still trying to figure out

803
00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:39,269
those exact uses and how it should be

804
00:38:37,739 --> 00:38:40,889
used and let's you've self titrate it

805
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:43,139
and think that but that's another goes

806
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:44,849
back to the demo democratization folks

807
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:46,139
are trying to figure out what works and

808
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:47,579
if they find something reliable

809
00:38:46,139 --> 00:38:49,710
that's a patient that's always going to

810
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:51,389
come back and and be used and they're

811
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:54,059
gonna find the relief that they have in

812
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:55,529
some cases we are already doing this we

813
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:57,269
have an opioid epidemic it has to be

814
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:59,490
fixed some of the data on that's coming

815
00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:01,170
out from from folks who study the opioid

816
00:38:59,489 --> 00:39:02,309
epidemic is that cannabis is one of the

817
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:05,670
things that's relieving the opioid

818
00:39:02,309 --> 00:39:07,559
epidemic that is happening irrespective

819
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:09,300
of Pharma it's happening irrespective of

820
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:11,849
FDA and it's happening irrespective of

821
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:14,850
of a congress that is still trying to

822
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,719
get a handle on on moving these things

823
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:19,980
forward

824
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:21,618
so the solution is have a good business

825
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:25,289
do good work

826
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:27,269
help people you'll get your you'll the

827
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:29,429
root the rewards will start to come and

828
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:32,429
it'll hopefully change our culture a

829
00:39:29,429 --> 00:39:33,358
little bit because I know the my folks

830
00:39:32,429 --> 00:39:35,579
that are in the pharmaceutical industry

831
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:37,230
they're not happy pushing a drug that

832
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:38,639
they got it created because you know a

833
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,690
ten billion dollar market because it

834
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:41,339
took a billion dollars to develop

835
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:43,320
they're not happy with that they're

836
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:45,000
trying to find and their question

837
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,130
they're starting to you know make phone

838
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,269
calls and and and and start to take the

839
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:51,180
conversations it's like well what are

840
00:39:48,269 --> 00:39:53,849
you guys doing over there how do you

841
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:56,179
know we know we know we can help we just

842
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:58,830
have to find the aim and so in some ways

843
00:39:56,179 --> 00:40:00,389
like I said be nice raise help would be

844
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:02,400
nice because there's some really good

845
00:40:00,389 --> 00:40:03,690
people that are in these companies that

846
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,490
are trying to get their companies

847
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:07,170
changed and get them on a track that can

848
00:40:05,489 --> 00:40:09,629
be providing better health care that's

849
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:11,039
cheaper and and and it's it's start it's

850
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:17,220
all the way up to the boardrooms right

851
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:19,440
down to the the mom-and-pop shop and any

852
00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:21,480
many everyone I've ever encountered in

853
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,849
healthcare and all of my trials

854
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:27,030
tribulations really cared really wanted

855
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:29,700
to help it's the system that constrains

856
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:31,140
them and their ability to do so well the

857
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:36,779
systems suck I want to tell you right

858
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:38,730
now the institutions are they there in a

859
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,440
they they're going through some some

860
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:42,480
pains the government's going through

861
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:44,909
some pains the the industries are going

862
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:49,789
through some pains these are actually

863
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:52,108
the right conditions for opportunity

864
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:54,119
might and it just happened you know it

865
00:40:52,108 --> 00:40:56,250
falls upon a lot of different things

866
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:58,230
happen to get us into a situation where

867
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:59,369
we're taking too many drugs we're not

868
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:02,219
getting help that we're paying a fortune

869
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:04,559
forum we've got crisis ease out of that

870
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:07,079
are that are that are not are being

871
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:10,949
managed by individuals and we're

872
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:15,179
managing the crisis so so that is an

873
00:41:10,949 --> 00:41:18,210
indication that I mean like there's if

874
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:21,118
there's a thing about I don't you know I

875
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:24,480
don't want to make bad drugs I know the

876
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:28,890
drugs to treat cancer are very expensive

877
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,429
to develop but cannabinoids seem to do

878
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:31,949
the exact

879
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:34,379
same thing as those drugs that are

880
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:37,618
really hard to develop from a lab

881
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:39,329
perspective so I have great I have great

882
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:40,829
faith that we're gonna self right and

883
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:41,789
get this right and the right people will

884
00:41:40,829 --> 00:41:43,318
be there and the right you'll have

885
00:41:41,789 --> 00:41:44,670
you'll have your right attorneys that

886
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:46,019
are that are fighting for you and you'll

887
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,460
have your right business people that are

888
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:48,869
saying hey listen just keep on going

889
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,730
takes keep taking care of people and

890
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:51,900
we'll figure out all the financing to

891
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:53,550
make sure that you're stable and

892
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:55,889
sustainable in the industry we're gonna

893
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,480
have doctors that are better everybody's

894
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:59,429
you know everybody's fighting a battle

895
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:03,838
somewhere in their institution or their

896
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:05,969
industry or their government to get to

897
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:07,500
move these things on and and that's what

898
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:09,058
I would you know the profound statement

899
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,858
of democratizing medicine is that you're

900
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:12,800
all involved in this you know we just

901
00:42:10,858 --> 00:42:16,318
have to be up here because like we've

902
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,630
that's who they said hey you know

903
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:19,829
something come on out you know but you

904
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,510
know that's how it happens you know you

905
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:22,980
go you know something you have some idea

906
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:24,690
you can lend some insight to this here

907
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,159
come up on stage you know but these

908
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:27,630
these are these are great these are the

909
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:29,039
events the microscopes and machines

910
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:31,980
these are the events that are that are

911
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:36,000
that are enabling everyone to get on the

912
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:39,329
same page and become a unified network

913
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,369
to be able to handle some big boy big

914
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:42,960
pants like I described in in a

915
00:42:41,369 --> 00:42:44,430
conversation to the health insurance

916
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,230
industry it was like it's grown-up pants

917
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:48,298
put on the grown-up pants and

918
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,740
everything's going to be great but we

919
00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:51,690
gotta we have to we have to get there

920
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:52,739
and and these are the events that are

921
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,940
gonna bring us together and you're gonna

922
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:56,519
find your network and you'll be like

923
00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:00,059
okay there's there this is a very very

924
00:42:56,519 --> 00:43:02,670
very long the supply chains in this

925
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:05,519
industry are just as complicated as Big

926
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:06,990
Pharma so if if you're if we already

927
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:08,940
have really complicated supply chains

928
00:43:06,989 --> 00:43:13,469
and we're resolving those complicated

929
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:16,880
supply chains then you're a boutique

930
00:43:13,469 --> 00:43:18,779
pharmaceutical company at this point I

931
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:20,460
whether you want to call it yourself

932
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,599
that and you know some people are scared

933
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,099
of that you know they don't want to use

934
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,859
the term pharmaceuticals oh my god

935
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:28,140
that's horrible but you know might the

936
00:43:25,858 --> 00:43:31,259
definition of my job is pharmacologist I

937
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:33,960
can't take my training and say that's

938
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:36,390
not important anymore because it's out

939
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,809
of fashion what I'm saying is as a

940
00:43:36,389 --> 00:43:41,608
pharmacologist go do your jobs go do

941
00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:42,750
your jobs and and medicine will be

942
00:43:41,608 --> 00:43:44,940
democratized

943
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:47,039
and let's create a new let's create an

944
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:50,090
industry that is better than the one

945
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:50,090
that we were handed

946
00:44:36,539 --> 00:44:42,610
I'm gonna - I'm going to chime in here

947
00:44:40,059 --> 00:44:44,619
because the the term that that it was

948
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:48,250
actually UCLA professors brought up was

949
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:49,750
clinical observations study where the

950
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:51,940
medical community does everything that

951
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:56,650
they need to do in terms of monitoring

952
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:58,420
care and if it with a with a reliable it

953
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:00,639
can't you know the conflicts of

954
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:02,860
interests removed and support of a

955
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:04,449
particular you know oh my I have the

956
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:09,130
ratio the miracle ratio that's going to

957
00:45:04,449 --> 00:45:10,839
change everything then then that's a you

958
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:11,920
know that's a vehicle that's and it's

959
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:14,230
going to take a little bit to really

960
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,630
probably you know get that reliably but

961
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:17,949
you know the oncologists need people to

962
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,960
roof they need they need to you know

963
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:21,750
their college osorno and and pain

964
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:25,329
management specialists are in a pinch

965
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:27,929
because they need to find a reliable

966
00:45:25,329 --> 00:45:32,500
business that they can refer patients to

967
00:45:27,929 --> 00:45:34,719
now and and so so we are gonna figure

968
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:36,579
out some study things there's also in in

969
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:38,619
with regards to how we're going to

970
00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:40,029
redesign clinical trials because not

971
00:45:38,619 --> 00:45:41,920
only in the cannabis industry has

972
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:43,230
problems with clinical trials the entire

973
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,539
pharmaceutical industry is having

974
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:49,150
immense problems with their own clinical

975
00:45:46,539 --> 00:45:50,110
trials so new tools are having to be

976
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:52,480
developed using

977
00:45:50,110 --> 00:45:54,220
better sources of data better data

978
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,710
collections how do you recruit properly

979
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:59,199
how do you retain properly using social

980
00:45:56,710 --> 00:46:00,909
media for good those peer groups that

981
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:02,799
John mentioned about the fact that those

982
00:46:00,909 --> 00:46:04,269
peer groups help people get on clinical

983
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,100
trials and help them stay on clinical

984
00:46:04,269 --> 00:46:07,989
trials and if we have to if we have to

985
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:09,849
if we have to design a clinical

986
00:46:07,989 --> 00:46:13,619
observation study with an institution

987
00:46:09,849 --> 00:46:16,329
that can monitor affairs and you have

988
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:18,298
reliable small business that is scalable

989
00:46:16,329 --> 00:46:20,458
and can do it everything right

990
00:46:18,298 --> 00:46:22,679
has the right tools that's a that's a

991
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:24,118
real honest-to-goodness thing that like

992
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:26,639
I said if you have the data and your

993
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:28,769
duty of doing your data right and and

994
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:31,078
you are perhaps making use of some new

995
00:46:28,768 --> 00:46:33,358
ways to do clinical trials then that's a

996
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:36,059
model that can be that can be presented

997
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:37,708
to regulators and and and let the

998
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:39,420
barrier of entry go down to say you know

999
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:41,098
listen we got to go move and then that

1000
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:42,778
lets the FDA and the powers that be that

1001
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:44,699
everything's sort of shifts and

1002
00:46:42,778 --> 00:46:46,199
hopefully we'll have some you know a new

1003
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:48,239
way to do clinical research because

1004
00:46:46,199 --> 00:46:50,159
we're there no I think it's great

1005
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:52,739
promise but the problem I have is that

1006
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,958
the whether it's doable to do clinical

1007
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:56,969
observational studies and registries we

1008
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:59,248
discussed it several times this meeting

1009
00:46:56,969 --> 00:47:01,949
but the problem is again educated

1010
00:46:59,248 --> 00:47:03,748
consumer my clip you know I'm used to

1011
00:47:01,949 --> 00:47:05,999
the big data we get by looking at large

1012
00:47:03,748 --> 00:47:07,828
databases but the variables aren't there

1013
00:47:05,998 --> 00:47:09,629
it doesn't really help me know about

1014
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:10,709
pain management if the patient writes

1015
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:12,619
down yes

1016
00:47:10,708 --> 00:47:16,018
cannabis helped me and it was Blue Dream

1017
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:18,179
which Blue Dream which terpene which

1018
00:47:16,018 --> 00:47:19,558
ratio I mean that's the problem we have

1019
00:47:18,179 --> 00:47:21,749
we in order for the the clinical

1020
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:23,640
observational stuff to really be give us

1021
00:47:21,748 --> 00:47:25,379
information we need we're gonna need to

1022
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:27,199
have the consumer more knowledgeable

1023
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:30,239
about what they're putting in their body

1024
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:32,639
we are a big believers in patient

1025
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:35,249
reported outcomes there's a the NIH has

1026
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:38,068
promulgated standards for participation

1027
00:47:35,248 --> 00:47:39,379
reported outcome and how it can be used

1028
00:47:38,068 --> 00:47:42,748
in clinical research

1029
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:45,420
there's even implicit compliant versions

1030
00:47:42,748 --> 00:47:47,669
of patient reported outcomes so what

1031
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,979
patient reported outcome does is

1032
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:53,818
leverages what you're talking about to

1033
00:47:49,978 --> 00:47:55,858
get larger datasets but the the key in a

1034
00:47:53,818 --> 00:47:59,400
PR Oh a patient reported outcome system

1035
00:47:55,858 --> 00:48:01,228
is the questions you ask right and their

1036
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,389
own knowledge of what they actually were

1037
00:48:01,228 --> 00:48:07,438
dosing with but I think that's an area

1038
00:48:03,389 --> 00:48:09,328
that's very ripe for for development and

1039
00:48:07,438 --> 00:48:11,159
will become a bigger and bigger factor

1040
00:48:09,329 --> 00:48:14,239
in drug development and we're gonna be

1041
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:14,239
be users of it

1042
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:54,030
yeah we got to do a better job of PR in

1043
00:48:51,449 --> 00:48:55,439
our our first initial efforts and dejan

1044
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,849
Evans who walked away from the tables

1045
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,559
actually somebody who's had some

1046
00:48:56,849 --> 00:49:00,450
interest for example in the community

1047
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,130
college course so there's a whole bunch

1048
00:49:00,449 --> 00:49:04,199
of initiatives that are just starting

1049
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:07,140
with yes we're much more aware now we

1050
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:09,029
need to educate but tenders and doctors

1051
00:49:07,139 --> 00:49:10,949
and patients and I think we need a

1052
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:12,599
concerted effort the problem is who's

1053
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:15,419
gonna actually pay for that doesn't

1054
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:17,099
necessarily benefit any given one so you

1055
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:25,108
know a lot of its grassroots at this

1056
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:27,000
point yes we're trying yeah I mean I

1057
00:49:25,108 --> 00:49:28,250
think I think what I think we need to do

1058
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,900
actually I'm horrible to say but

1059
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:33,389
dispensary people if you can if you're

1060
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:36,030
about a budtender you should be required

1061
00:49:33,389 --> 00:49:38,039
I believe to have minimum certification

1062
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:39,450
to no side effects ask people of all

1063
00:49:38,039 --> 00:49:42,029
want to make head medications are on

1064
00:49:39,449 --> 00:49:43,949
there should be minimal knowledge maybe

1065
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:45,630
not the highest knowledge but minimal

1066
00:49:43,949 --> 00:49:47,848
and I think with that debt just like

1067
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:49,170
we're doing toxicology but tenders need

1068
00:49:47,849 --> 00:49:51,059
to be both better certified and

1069
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:53,338
physicians we're gonna start out trying

1070
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:54,750
to offer CME credit which drives things

1071
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:56,759
that we can make it see it right now

1072
00:49:54,750 --> 00:50:00,110
it's not seeing me we can make it see me

1073
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:02,210
yeah position

1074
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:03,910
we have to work through our medical

1075
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:06,559
local medical societies we're trying

1076
00:50:03,909 --> 00:50:08,960
that's I think you're right about

1077
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,509
writing letters and and using your voice

1078
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:13,309
and never under estimating what your

1079
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:14,600
unique experience and I think that's one

1080
00:50:13,309 --> 00:50:15,799
thing I love about this industry is

1081
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:17,360
everybody comes from a different

1082
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,970
background and has a very unique

1083
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:21,500
perspective I'm not an FDA attorney I've

1084
00:50:19,969 --> 00:50:23,689
just you know close enough to the

1085
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:26,480
process that I I've never written an FDA

1086
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:28,250
comment before but you know you when I

1087
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,139
started writing it I realized I've got

1088
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:33,139
this very unique perspective on

1089
00:50:30,139 --> 00:50:35,150
something and it's useful still so don't

1090
00:50:33,139 --> 00:50:36,559
underestimate what your perspective is

1091
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:37,849
and the power of your voice and I think

1092
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,820
it's gonna be a lot of letter writing

1093
00:50:37,849 --> 00:50:44,000
and a lot of you know urging Congress to

1094
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:46,070
you know force the FDA force the FDA's

1095
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,349
hand and I think that dr. Chad mentioned

1096
00:50:46,070 --> 00:50:50,360
about you know let's start regulating

1097
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:52,789
some of these these terms that we're

1098
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:55,550
using either with certification marks or

1099
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:57,230
you know some there has to be a starting

1100
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:59,690
point for that but I think it's all

1101
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:01,099
gonna be about your voice and using you

1102
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:04,550
know the unique perspective that you

1103
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:06,799
bring to this industry yes on that on

1104
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:10,039
this on this what what you can do to

1105
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,090
help these things happen are well the

1106
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:15,050
president of University of California

1107
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:16,579
you can find her email she she happened

1108
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:18,160
to be in charge of our Homeland Security

1109
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:21,710
I believe under the Obama administration

1110
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:23,929
there's there it is it's it's it is this

1111
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:27,230
kind of act it's an it's it's it's an

1112
00:51:23,929 --> 00:51:29,480
advocacy that that does that that go to

1113
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:31,039
the top people and go to the find the

1114
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,750
list of Chancellor's and the deans at

1115
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:35,659
all of them University of California and

1116
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:37,670
say listen can you know what is the you

1117
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:40,789
know what's your plan here let them

1118
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:42,200
engage them and sense of you know what's

1119
00:51:40,789 --> 00:51:43,489
your plan here because this is happening

1120
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:45,649
and I know there's a whole bunch of

1121
00:51:43,489 --> 00:51:47,659
there's there's a whole lot of folks

1122
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:50,480
that could really could really use some

1123
00:51:47,659 --> 00:51:52,369
guidance on this and and show the human

1124
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,750
eye you know show that there's that that

1125
00:51:52,369 --> 00:51:55,130
what they did the decisions that they

1126
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:56,300
made at the University of California or

1127
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:59,210
any other university system for that

1128
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:02,240
matter cannon can help our communities

1129
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:04,070
and with this you know with these with

1130
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:06,409
this with this research that needs to be

1131
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:07,730
done the medical boards when I was

1132
00:52:06,409 --> 00:52:09,139
lobbying and trying to get funding and

1133
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:10,429
all the other things one of the things

1134
00:52:09,139 --> 00:52:12,199
that I said it was like the University

1135
00:52:10,429 --> 00:52:12,828
of California and the state of

1136
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:14,899
California

1137
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:16,369
can actually go to the medical boards in

1138
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:19,700
California and say you need to give us a

1139
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:22,608
plan you need to have a plan to to

1140
00:52:19,699 --> 00:52:24,318
educate your doctors on this and we're

1141
00:52:22,608 --> 00:52:26,568
gonna do our part by putting together

1142
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:28,458
some curriculum for med school med

1143
00:52:26,568 --> 00:52:29,900
schools Hardman there's a lot of stuff

1144
00:52:28,458 --> 00:52:31,728
these guys to have to learn to fit into

1145
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:34,099
one you know a couple of years worth of

1146
00:52:31,728 --> 00:52:35,718
worth of time but it is kind of they

1147
00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:37,400
have to sort of adjust like how are what

1148
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:39,318
what course has to get pushed out of the

1149
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,700
way but at the same time we also know

1150
00:52:39,318 --> 00:52:42,798
all the med students want to be trained

1151
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:45,768
in this the scientists are looking for

1152
00:52:42,798 --> 00:52:47,778
jobs in this industry and you know it

1153
00:52:45,768 --> 00:52:50,508
just happens to be that you know the I

1154
00:52:47,778 --> 00:52:52,039
have know where my old alma mater UCLA

1155
00:52:50,509 --> 00:52:54,978
invited me back to go talk to graduate

1156
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:56,269
students and I you know most of us when

1157
00:52:54,978 --> 00:52:57,169
we leave campus were like we're out of

1158
00:52:56,268 --> 00:52:59,449
here thank you

1159
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:00,409
time to go and and and so these are

1160
00:52:59,449 --> 00:53:01,699
kinds of things that are going to be

1161
00:53:00,409 --> 00:53:03,618
there happening in real time and I think

1162
00:53:01,699 --> 00:53:04,909
maybe next year when we have this and we

1163
00:53:03,619 --> 00:53:06,259
have this conversation again you'll say

1164
00:53:04,909 --> 00:53:07,699
well we might be that much more the

1165
00:53:06,259 --> 00:53:09,498
further apart because some high level

1166
00:53:07,699 --> 00:53:10,848
people might've said yeah this is we

1167
00:53:09,498 --> 00:53:12,468
need to be we need to be doing what

1168
00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:13,609
we're supposed to be doing so I have a

1169
00:53:12,469 --> 00:53:15,229
lot of faith in the fact that the med

1170
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:17,869
schools are gonna come around this is a

1171
00:53:15,228 --> 00:53:19,489
hero right here because he has to fight

1172
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:27,140
yeah give them it give a round of

1173
00:53:19,489 --> 00:53:28,969
applause anyone any institutional

1174
00:53:27,139 --> 00:53:31,940
medical school professor that is trying

1175
00:53:28,969 --> 00:53:34,670
to make this happen is the tip of the

1176
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:37,009
spear and all of this and they they they

1177
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:40,489
have to work day in and day out to

1178
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:42,469
convince a very large very difficult

1179
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:44,449
institutions to deal with to change how

1180
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:47,559
they go about doing it and they're doing

1181
00:53:44,449 --> 00:53:49,880
it one time one doctor at a time one

1182
00:53:47,559 --> 00:53:52,579
Chancellor at a time when Dean at a time

1183
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,930
and and and and that that really is a

1184
00:53:52,579 --> 00:53:55,009
democratization and I'm going to leave

1185
00:53:53,929 --> 00:53:55,710
this to Ariel because now I'm talking

1186
00:53:55,009 --> 00:54:03,969
too much

1187
00:53:55,710 --> 00:54:03,969
[Music]

1188
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:10,099
[Music]

1189
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,630
I'm part of the faculty advisory board

1190
00:54:15,739 --> 00:54:20,449
for the UCLA canvass research initiative

1191
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:22,700
which includes professors from multiple

1192
00:54:20,449 --> 00:54:25,098
departments whether it be social equity

1193
00:54:22,699 --> 00:54:27,949
justice legal because we're working on

1194
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:30,410
issues of social equity for dispensary

1195
00:54:27,949 --> 00:54:32,960
distribution for expungement of felons

1196
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:34,129
etc this is a long long list and we're

1197
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,079
looking at it from multiple perspectives

1198
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:38,269
so it's important that we don't focus on

1199
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:40,160
just a medical aspect you got to have a

1200
00:54:38,269 --> 00:54:42,650
university which can look at all the

1201
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:44,299
aspects of going around and what is the

1202
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:45,380
impact on our communities we're trying

1203
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,539
to communicate with the city of Los

1204
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:49,519
Angeles to say what are the positive

1205
00:54:47,539 --> 00:54:50,900
benefits and also try to buy social

1206
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,699
equity ensure there's appropriate

1207
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:56,079
geographical representation in

1208
00:54:52,699 --> 00:54:56,078
communities have been underserved
