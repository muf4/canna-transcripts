1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:15,298
[Music]

2
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:19,079
yeah it sounds to me like there's been a

3
00:00:15,298 --> 00:00:21,329
lot of this kind of like top-down this

4
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:23,729
is an assessment of how things are this

5
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:27,299
what needs to happen and I kind of take

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:32,429
things with a different approach which

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,710
is like how can we design a project we

8
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:36,960
usually call them businesses that do

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:41,850
something to create some value that

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:45,750
people find compelling and so they you

11
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:50,129
know having a new having a new something

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,840
service a product usually that changes

13
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:54,210
people's behavior is something that I

14
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,460
mean it's one of the few things that I

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,378
can say capitalism has going for it

16
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,270
right but this is a model that we see

17
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:04,438
happening all the time wait you know we

18
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:06,150
stopped using our dis man when we

19
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,269
started using our iPod you know it means

20
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,728
something that we do all the time so

21
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:14,129
then the question is like how do you

22
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:16,650
design how do you design this project in

23
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:18,569
a way so that it's compelling you know

24
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,118
we've talked a lot about technology here

25
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:25,079
but what I've not heard is like they

26
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:27,750
speed the market people people you know

27
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:30,030
meet stuff and some of them want to do

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,790
things in a better way some people want

29
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,129
to do things that weren't sense way some

30
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,070
people want to do both anytime that

31
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:40,048
someone has asked shall we do like so we

32
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:42,179
have a law passed or should we change

33
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,920
some regulation I kind of heard some

34
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,350
reticence about that was I think is this

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,420
wise because at least in the culture of

36
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:50,399
this country people a lot of times don't

37
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,009
like being told what to do now on the

38
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,049
other hand in California we kind of we I

39
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,319
think I think what's going on is that we

40
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,900
hold we do hold the environment in such

41
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:02,179
you know regardless of kind of like

42
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,070
political persuasion that we realized

43
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,380
that like tourism is important we like

44
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:09,169
to breathe clean air some of us have

45
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:11,180
seen the environment you know we're here

46
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,619
at times maybe we've seen the

47
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,510
environment worse than other places we

48
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,159
see what's going on news so really

49
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:18,289
excited that we have this place where we

50
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,329
care about the environment and we're

51
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:23,359
kind of willing it's not the same

52
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,820
everywhere it we're willing to say okay

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,860
yeah you know what I'm gonna be willing

54
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:30,829
to pay five cents for a plastic bag I'm

55
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,300
not gonna revolt this time but other

56
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,520
places you know people don't like being

57
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,510
told oh how do we either align

58
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:40,100
enough people to do what we need to do

59
00:02:37,509 --> 00:02:44,899
which is when I say what we need to do

60
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:47,239
is accelerate the industrialization of

61
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,760
our economy it's cool to think about

62
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,709
cool little technologies but I'm here to

63
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,899
tell you that most of the technologies

64
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:56,390
that are going to save us are probably

65
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,189
pretty old we've understood from Milan

66
00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:00,679
and it's yeah everyone so why don't we

67
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:03,109
get a new when you get a new cool trick

68
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,420
you know we did a combustion engine we

69
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,040
did nuclear power you know sometimes we

70
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,839
figure out good things to do with these

71
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,629
things and sometimes we kind of fumble

72
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,629
around a little while fossil fuels you

73
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:16,039
know this time place for certain aspects

74
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,599
of fossil fuels there's lots of other

75
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:21,590
alternatives there's questions of

76
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:24,949
Technology questions of product you know

77
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,840
how do we how we put together a value

78
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:29,629
offering but typically you take in lower

79
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,069
value feedstocks and you try to find the

80
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:35,299
highest value purpose for those

81
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:37,430
feedstocks a lot of business plans that

82
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:41,000
people talk about in this space and the

83
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:44,300
NSA sustainability if you just kind of

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,680
like do that dot to dot it's like people

85
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,320
are trying to take something high-value

86
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,610
and make something low value out of that

87
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,620
that's backwards so it's not how you

88
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:55,340
make business let's not have any money

89
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,439
you know and so then there come some

90
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,450
situations where it's kind of really

91
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,759
hard just fine how to make a business

92
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:01,469
and

93
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,798
were you know regulation may come in

94
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:08,039
where we say maybe we need a carbon tax

95
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,379
maybe we need different ways of managing

96
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:12,150
fuel credits and you know things like

97
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:13,828
this the people in this room really need

98
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,840
to get tight with their language because

99
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:18,299
it really is important to be able to

100
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,038
explain to people what organic is the

101
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:24,060
agriculture versus what we're ganna is

102
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:29,189
to a chemist and what bio-based can mean

103
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:32,819
and you know talking about hydrogen and

104
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:34,079
some of the energy stuff it's like you

105
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:35,009
know I really appreciate the people are

106
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,439
coming from a lot of different

107
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:40,800
perspectives but there there are some

108
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:43,439
key words that all this kind of you get

109
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,550
on the same page with you know so that

110
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:55,529
we can we can be good a be that there's

111
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:57,150
a hand raised in the back yeah this is

112
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:59,879
in created thousand a lake everyone

113
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:02,668
stand up work here come I called me she

114
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:04,978
runs it it's sort of a friendship of our

115
00:05:02,668 --> 00:05:05,430
city so they're in line is on their very

116
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:07,649
first

117
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,478
it's an ileostomy equity program yeah it

118
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:12,899
sounds like mentors and you should do

119
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:15,469
events every future so with other be

120
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:15,469
seasoned

121
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:25,759
critic grid what would I read once and

122
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:25,760
that work actually have a happy hour RT

123
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:39,899
but I want to give respect to to the

124
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,379
information and what you have brought

125
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:45,929
out you know and I agree with you and

126
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:48,300
the language is so difficult to because

127
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,850
I work in education and outreach when it

128
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,980
comes to my my job and so I have to find

129
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,110
the language that people understand when

130
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:58,650
it just comes to waste and so even just

131
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,120
on the organic thing I pushed my company

132
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:02,399
and I keep pushing them on like always

133
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,259
put an s on the end of organics because

134
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:07,289
I'm not gonna say this is organic waste

135
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:10,139
these are organics and that's because in

136
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:12,270
our industry we refer to it as organics

137
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:14,189
and we're not that language in our

138
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:16,680
industry it's not it's not an industry

139
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:19,259
term that I can change but I can I can

140
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,720
at least try to manipulate it in a way

141
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:24,089
that is not going to hopefully have

142
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,030
another layer of confusion added to it

143
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:29,969
for the consumer but you're completely

144
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:33,269
right when it comes to language and and

145
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:34,890
us share a my and my best friend his

146
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:36,389
husband as a pharmacist and she's a

147
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,759
nurse and so we always get in these

148
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:41,759
conversations especially about organic

149
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,550
and other terminology because we come

150
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,480
from different worlds and and and I and

151
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,370
that I think is a solid point a solid

152
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:53,759
issue that you brought up you also

153
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:56,160
talked about demand a product demand or

154
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,599
the demand of the individual and you

155
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,010
made a comment if I can even if I

156
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,150
remember it correctly it's like some

157
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:01,170
people want to do the right thing and

158
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:03,120
then some people wanted you the bad

159
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:06,750
thing most people not the bad thing

160
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,879
sorry sorry that was my brain going but

161
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,350
but some people want to do maybe for the

162
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,120
environment other people that's just not

163
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,500
where they're thinking that's not what's

164
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,509
they're trying to put food on their

165
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,040
table they're trying to get through

166
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:18,389
their daily life they're trying to do

167
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,460
their two jobs they're trying to maybe

168
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:22,889
just come home and relax you know that

169
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:24,449
the concept of making sure that I buy

170
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:26,009
the one product that's made out of this

171
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:28,079
with this and it's going to go here is

172
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:30,418
not the thing there

173
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,459
thinking about and so when we create

174
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:35,339
product if I'm getting this right and

175
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:37,079
how I took it

176
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:40,529
is that when we when we're looking at

177
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:42,269
creating a product in order to meet the

178
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:44,698
demand of what is out there in the

179
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:47,878
communities people want better options

180
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:52,319
for water bottles or getting their water

181
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:53,810
I I think there's a level two things I

182
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,060
wanted to say I think there's a level of

183
00:07:53,810 --> 00:08:00,329
demand that we have control over as as

184
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,788
businesses as entrepreneurs that we can

185
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:04,378
that I see happening to where it's like

186
00:08:02,788 --> 00:08:05,818
here's this product I think you should

187
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:08,218
use this product I think we should be

188
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,169
using products that do X Y &amp; Z and I

189
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:11,908
think sometimes we can we can change

190
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:13,740
that to man because that demand is put

191
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,629
on us anyways by the corporations that

192
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,030
demand is put on us by commercials and

193
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:19,770
what we see out in the and and I'm just

194
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:21,750
talking about like just you know our

195
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:24,149
chips and our you know pizzas and

196
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,769
everything else but those that's a

197
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:27,269
demand we think we see this product we

198
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:29,788
say that I want that product I want

199
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:32,009
something like that and so I think we

200
00:08:29,788 --> 00:08:36,769
have control in changing that narrative

201
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:39,360
as well but then also for me personally

202
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:40,740
we're talking about like and I didn't

203
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,288
say it earlier but we're talking about

204
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,539
oh there's these little you know things

205
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:47,009
that you can use for water you know my

206
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:49,620
first thing came to my mind it's like

207
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:54,088
that that's a cool idea but why is it

208
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:56,190
that why is the demand not on water

209
00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:57,839
scarcity and why is the demand why we

210
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:00,329
have water issues to begin with why is

211
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,680
it that we still have issues in Flint

212
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:03,659
Michigan why is it that we still have

213
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,370
you know we had water issues in

214
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:06,689
Willowbrook and Compton where they

215
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,970
couldn't even drink their water why is

216
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,519
why do they have to buy these little

217
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,959
pods in the first place in order to be

218
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,629
able to meet the demand that they need

219
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:18,659
why is it that we have to have a demand

220
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:20,519
for water bottles period because it's

221
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:22,559
been sold to us that our water is not

222
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,820
drinkable why is it that our if our

223
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:25,859
water is not drinkable why is it not

224
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,680
drinkable if our water is not accessible

225
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:30,649
why don't we have a drinkable accessible

226
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:33,318
water fountains to throughout

227
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:34,999
and I think the solutions I mean answers

228
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:36,679
to all the rhetorical questions that

229
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:39,920
you're presenting and they have like

230
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:44,088
concrete answers that we could put up on

231
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:50,868
a like work right now so she's point to

232
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:57,800
our whiteboard so it's like people so

233
00:09:50,869 --> 00:10:02,920
I'm saying take an empirical approach

234
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:07,669
and say okay people do like convenient

235
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:11,269
single use or you know maybe low repeat

236
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:13,610
reuse containers that are low-cost maybe

237
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:15,019
what we want to consider having a

238
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,459
conversation about this like change

239
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:18,678
management and thinking about the

240
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:22,578
psychology of change because I think

241
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:24,470
that it's like you know I sound like

242
00:10:22,578 --> 00:10:27,078
someone was aligning by a lethal

243
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,629
you know back when we were focused on my

244
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:34,428
easel we were really excited that there

245
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:37,670
was this possibility that we could take

246
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:39,919
some of the output of farmers and offset

247
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:42,469
some of our petroleum fuel use and then

248
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,990
wanted to turn out the way that result

249
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:48,559
is you might wonder where did all of the

250
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:50,419
biodiesel activists go well because the

251
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:52,969
state California and a few other states

252
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:55,099
said you know what instead of like you

253
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,350
want us to use 100% biodiesel you want

254
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,860
us to use 20% you know what we're just

255
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:03,829
gonna make everybody put like 5% and all

256
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,419
of the diesel supply so we got our you

257
00:11:03,828 --> 00:11:07,938
know free to fight the same fight of

258
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:10,188
diesel in California and you know you

259
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:12,860
might say well it's not 20% that's that

260
00:11:10,188 --> 00:11:15,349
sounds like it really sucks but for the

261
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,120
amount of emissions decreases that you

262
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:19,548
get proportionally for each percentage

263
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,828
of that biodiesel when you only put you

264
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:23,749
know three to five percent biodiesel in

265
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:24,859
the petroleum fuel supply you get this

266
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:28,040
really awesome

267
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:29,659
reduction in particular manner and so

268
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:31,548
it's kind of a success it's you know

269
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:33,469
maybe we can say it's not perfect but

270
00:11:31,548 --> 00:11:34,120
it's like on the way anyway so once we

271
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,379
sort of knew

272
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,519
and I'd like to hear what you have to

273
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:40,088
say about buying pieces but the only

274
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:43,559
reason what I pick it up is that we

275
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:45,279
moved on into realizing table actually

276
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,869
chemicals might be more of an

277
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,009
opportunity and that's a lot of what

278
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,440
we're talking about today is bio

279
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:52,210
chemicals you know how to take different

280
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,580
deep socks can birth them into something

281
00:11:52,210 --> 00:12:00,490
valuable now I'm kind of thinking well

282
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:01,990
you know technology the technology is

283
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,629
probably not gonna change all that much

284
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:06,549
but people's minds are what we really

285
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:08,379
need to be thinking about changing I'm

286
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:10,899
not a marketer I'm actually an introvert

287
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:16,179
I don't love being in a windowless place

288
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:17,919
but you know it's kind of it kind of

289
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:19,539
sounds like you're you know talking

290
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,649
about the economic and there's a lot to

291
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:24,549
unpack there I'm gonna do my best

292
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:27,309
the the the economics of being a

293
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:29,169
sustainable business aren't all that

294
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:31,269
attractive a lot of the time to be

295
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:33,669
completely honest it's really not you

296
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:37,240
really have to drill down there's a lot

297
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:39,429
of regulation the the the amount of

298
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,240
material that you need and the minimums

299
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:46,079
that a lot of these manufacturers need

300
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:51,750
are its daunting it's very daunting

301
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:54,520
honestly it's a long road and I think

302
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:56,080
coupled with the economic discussion

303
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:59,708
you're talking about a cultural and a

304
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:01,900
social impact as well so doing those two

305
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:04,088
things in concert hopefully you'll have

306
00:13:01,899 --> 00:13:07,929
a successful business there's no

307
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:11,080
guarantees but at the end of the day I

308
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:13,359
think there is a growing demand for

309
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,610
consumers as a consumer I should say

310
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,220
that they're demanding that these things

311
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:20,190
change and the economics of a

312
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:23,500
sustainable business is what's driving

313
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:26,200
these huge brands like the loop play and

314
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,350
things like that that unfortunately in

315
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:32,080
H&amp;M and that unfortunately is what a lot

316
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:35,459
of drives a lot of the social currency

317
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:38,830
and a lot of the the cultural aspects of

318
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:40,719
the world we live in so I think you

319
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,680
can't ignore one without the other if

320
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,420
you're trying to be a sustainable

321
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,789
business without looking at the

322
00:13:43,419 --> 00:13:48,219
economics like okay cool I'll see you

323
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:49,449
when you're you know getting collecting

324
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,589
your welfare check in a year you know

325
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,379
you're not you're not going to do well

326
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:55,270
if you are just worried about the

327
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:58,450
cultural aspect of it without the

328
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:59,919
economics same same same scenario just

329
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,839
the environmental or just you know yeah

330
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:05,439
and that's why it's a trifecta and they

331
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,750
all it's not - it's like three it's you

332
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,350
know social equity economics and

333
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:13,629
environment or profits people plan it

334
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,940
and he it's helpful to come back to that

335
00:14:13,629 --> 00:14:17,950
light it's just simple and I reduce

336
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,240
reuse recycle you know it just becomes a

337
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:21,310
quick mantra that you can just catch

338
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,610
yourself is what I'm doing profitable

339
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:27,669
potentially is it good for people is it

340
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:29,560
good for the planet if those things you

341
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:31,000
know yes yes yes and maybe there's a

342
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:35,500
business kernel in there that you can

343
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,179
deal with so I was a gapper if you know

344
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,278
that is a chief lighting technician

345
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:42,489
before that electrician and then I was a

346
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:46,360
DP so so yeah so I spent 30 years behind

347
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:50,320
the camera and the last you know a bit

348
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:53,230
of it in the early 2000s I was uh we

349
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,930
would demand you know biodiesel in our

350
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:58,329
generators you know in Hollywood so I

351
00:14:55,929 --> 00:15:00,729
wouldn't get it in in Tennessee but I

352
00:14:58,328 --> 00:15:02,469
would get it here in California we you

353
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,269
know but it took a little while we had

354
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:06,579
to do his red dye and we had to like you

355
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:09,639
know can we had to convince the the

356
00:15:06,578 --> 00:15:12,129
generator operators to go to their

357
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:14,319
insurance agents and say yes you can do

358
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:15,578
this it will not break your warranty so

359
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,100
you may have been part of that policy

360
00:15:15,578 --> 00:15:20,500
but in California it was very clear it

361
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,060
will not break the warranties and so it

362
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,089
took a year or two and it took basically

363
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:27,250
getting you know celebrities whoever was

364
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:29,890
the most you know prominent producer

365
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:32,559
actor on the set to throw a hissy fit -

366
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:35,049
you know you know we have to use

367
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:38,049
biodiesel on these shoots and so but we

368
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:40,659
got it and basically 90% of the industry

369
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:43,000
of the you know generators in Hollywood

370
00:15:40,659 --> 00:15:44,528
and today sometimes I don't know I've

371
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,929
been bent out of her for a few years

372
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:51,220
since I shifted over from film tech to

373
00:15:46,929 --> 00:15:52,448
clean tech right so and I drove about

374
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,990
days over like 10 years and I drove

375
00:15:52,448 --> 00:15:58,659
biodiesel 100 99.9 you know all over

376
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,549
California and it didn't change it the

377
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:04,299
reason it changed was because of the

378
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:08,229
by of a diesel leak an underground leak

379
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:10,419
in Northern California it the diesel

380
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,800
leaked from a regular petroleum diesel

381
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:15,069
leaked into the ground from an

382
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:17,708
underground tank the lobbyist that wrote

383
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:20,079
the rules to address that made it so

384
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:23,379
that biodiesel could not be stored

385
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:25,689
underground and so therefore I used to

386
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:27,759
drive around and go to my b99 stations

387
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:30,339
and get biodiesel all over Southern

388
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,799
California you know eight places now I

389
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:34,360
had to shift and go only where they

390
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,578
could have above-ground storage tanks

391
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,959
and that's not in the city so I'd have

392
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,309
to drive out to Sun Valley get my

393
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:43,419
biodiesel and then come back to

394
00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:45,338
Hollywood and you know yeah I could go

395
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,078
to all but I can I can go up and down my

396
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:50,190
neighbour's alleyway and I could get

397
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:52,599
biodiesel hey you got to biodiesel yeah

398
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,370
my boyfriend's actually on that board

399
00:16:52,600 --> 00:17:01,060
for the biodiesel co-op for Los Angeles

400
00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:02,919
I saw hey Jack ight yeah oh yeah they

401
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:04,599
again they have had these issues I mean

402
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:07,529
we're not gonna go and buy this I guess

403
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:10,509
but but but they made it they

404
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:11,980
financially regulated them out of the

405
00:17:10,509 --> 00:17:13,689
market like oh you have to have a

406
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,740
specific handle and the handle cost this

407
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:16,179
much you know you have to have the

408
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:18,068
locking system like this and this cost

409
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:19,600
as much and they would they would meet

410
00:17:18,068 --> 00:17:20,859
the regulations and then there'd be

411
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,568
another regulation and another

412
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:27,369
regulation and another regulation which

413
00:17:22,568 --> 00:17:29,289
was making it well but there's a

414
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:31,750
different outcome the outcome is that we

415
00:17:29,289 --> 00:17:33,399
got we got shut down because of the way

416
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,349
the lobbyists wrote the rules in

417
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,200
Sacramento and we didn't have a strong

418
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:40,209
enough team up there to rewrite those

419
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:46,900
rules to allow underground storage of

420
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:48,519
biodiesel that was I market creation

421
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:50,019
right and so that's what I'm talking

422
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:50,599
about in terms of length to make think

423
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:52,940
about the

424
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:54,558
that you brought up like the influencer

425
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,649
you're like yeah we can make cool

426
00:17:54,558 --> 00:18:01,158
happen if Leland Leonardo DiCaprio says

427
00:17:57,648 --> 00:18:02,928
like yeah we have to and and I saw Cyril

428
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:04,250
from Pilate for the oceans

429
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:06,769
I'm very familiar with that with that

430
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:10,638
company they're the ones that created

431
00:18:06,769 --> 00:18:11,929
the thread from ocean plastic for adidas

432
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:15,859
for their shoes

433
00:18:11,929 --> 00:18:17,269
that was the parlays first product we

434
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:19,219
think they're going further now and

435
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:23,720
they're really focusing on kind of

436
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:25,399
creating a culture P AR l ey and their

437
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,100
their next step is really focusing on

438
00:18:25,398 --> 00:18:29,689
like creating a movement but one thing

439
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:31,490
that the founder said recently was that

440
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,940
I think it's very catchy and I love it

441
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:38,990
that purpose is the new luxury and that

442
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:40,610
once these influencers start start doing

443
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:43,399
this and like that Pina text little bag

444
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:45,678
I gave you is like $250 or something and

445
00:18:43,398 --> 00:18:48,339
it's like this stuff does cost more

446
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:52,629
money a lot of times because it's in R&amp;D

447
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:55,668
mm-hmm and so if we if these like

448
00:18:52,628 --> 00:18:57,500
influencers of all different sorts can

449
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:59,659
show off how great these products are

450
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,339
that they are cool and that there should

451
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:03,649
be a demand for this stuff then I think

452
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:06,819
it's a very beneficial way to be helping

453
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:06,819
new products

454
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:25,960
you can say they're doing something cool

455
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:29,379
and innovative than interesting and

456
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:31,450
here's what it is I would say that most

457
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,940
of them have little cool things that

458
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:35,710
they're trying to do from time to time

459
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:37,630
so I mean you know one of the things

460
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:41,909
that has been kind of interesting is

461
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:45,340
plant bottle from from coke so you know

462
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:48,880
this is an example where they use one of

463
00:19:45,339 --> 00:19:51,398
the ingredients to make pet peepee

464
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,679
it's it's more affordable to make it

465
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:57,969
from a bio-based source so ethylene

466
00:19:53,679 --> 00:20:00,100
glycol that's 30% of PEP bottles so they

467
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,079
looked at the math and then they hired

468
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:03,759
they teamed up with some other startups

469
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,418
and they said well can we make a hundred

470
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:10,240
percent and so startup that I worked for

471
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:12,538
per few years eventually their

472
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,769
collaboration with coke on plant bottle

473
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:16,808
and a couple other companies they said

474
00:20:14,769 --> 00:20:20,769
yeah we wanted to we could make a 100

475
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:24,308
percent bio-based PT polyethylene

476
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:27,668
terephthalate by the economics don't

477
00:20:24,308 --> 00:20:29,740
work so our plant bottle that we that we

478
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:32,350
use now or that we see in the market now

479
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:36,579
that's 30 percent bio-based this is

480
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:39,699
plant bob one most you do in fact I

481
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:41,439
think all of them to do so you get a

482
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,710
little bit of 30 percent you get to slap

483
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,090
flat bottle the logo on it and there's

484
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,950
definitely they'd get a marketing with

485
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:50,500
because people are like well this is I

486
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:53,230
don't have to feel as evil about you

487
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,759
know having my sugar fix here so so

488
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,349
that's an example where you know but

489
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:58,298
it's like you can find almost every

490
00:20:56,349 --> 00:21:00,158
brand owner you can find is doing you

491
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:01,690
know has done they have one press

492
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,000
release at least that they're doing

493
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:06,669
something cool yeah but the question is

494
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,558
is this enough and the answer is no it's

495
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:11,649
no no well no I think that is an example

496
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:15,369
of that not being enough this CNA which

497
00:21:11,648 --> 00:21:18,219
is a large fashion company in Europe

498
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:21,699
they I think last year released the

499
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:26,798
first completely certified Cradle to

500
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:30,149
Cradle t-shirt for like five dollars or

501
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:33,278
something like really really cheap and

502
00:21:30,148 --> 00:21:34,089
that sounds like a great thing I think I

503
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:35,230
was when I

504
00:21:34,089 --> 00:21:38,949
learned about this I was sitting next to

505
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:41,079
a small small fashion company owner and

506
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:43,900
she's like how like thinking of like

507
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:46,750
this pina text cost this peanut X bag is

508
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:49,570
$280 she's like how can I compete she's

509
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:52,359
like if if this shirts $5.00 and it's

510
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:53,589
awesome and they're you know subsidizing

511
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:55,719
it with all kinds of other sales of

512
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:57,939
stuff like how can a small sustainable

513
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,620
business compete with that and I think

514
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,019
it's a good question but it's still

515
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:03,189
they're competing right now yeah they're

516
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:06,250
competing with fast fashion

517
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:12,009
yeah there's $5 shirts all over the

518
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:13,659
place yeah all yours but it's still a $5

519
00:22:12,009 --> 00:22:15,190
shirt because most people aren't gonna

520
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:18,340
go into a store and be like oh it's a

521
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:21,340
cradle-to-cradle certified by that you

522
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:23,109
and I might but they still have the they

523
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:24,308
still have the competition if the

524
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,479
competition's there no matter what

525
00:22:24,308 --> 00:22:27,730
yeah it's not based on the

526
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:31,710
sustainability I don't think yeah it's

527
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,710
based on price based on market demand

528
00:22:43,589 --> 00:22:48,908
terminology misery waste is a broad

529
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:51,308
terminology so city of Los Angeles Falls

530
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:54,909
state regulation so you're going to be

531
00:22:51,308 --> 00:22:56,589
seeing organics recycling at most of the

532
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:58,000
because we're talking about what's the

533
00:22:56,589 --> 00:22:59,678
largest piece of material going to a

534
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,509
landfill was the largest piece of

535
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,980
material causing methane gas out of a

536
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:04,148
landfill that's gonna be organics and

537
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,640
truly that's what you need to target

538
00:23:04,148 --> 00:23:07,808
hardcore but that's already regulated at

539
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,600
the state level and that the

540
00:23:07,808 --> 00:23:11,288
jurisdictions start to and that's part

541
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:13,028
of their waste

542
00:23:11,288 --> 00:23:14,679
I think we've gotten this really weird

543
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:16,329
skewed idea of what zero waste is

544
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:19,809
because of social media and people with

545
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:22,240
their jars of trash I so zero weight and

546
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:22,569
so it's a lot more carbon under than

547
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,460
that

548
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:28,178
so the organics recycling you're gonna

549
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:30,970
be seeing across Los Angeles Southern

550
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:33,250
California all of that the city of Los

551
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:36,519
Angeles passed a franchise agreement

552
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:38,308
that says one there's eleven zones and

553
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:42,069
each zone can only be serviced by one

554
00:23:38,308 --> 00:23:43,359
hauler by one trash company for the

555
00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:44,889
businesses and the multi-family

556
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,519
residential of four or more units or

557
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:50,420
five more units sorry

558
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:52,039
and they have to work with the city in

559
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,320
order to make sure that they're meeting

560
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:56,480
the state goals and those diversion

561
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,069
goals the the regulations on organics

562
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,480
and things of that nature there's gonna

563
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:01,609
be a lot more education and outreach

564
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:03,410
there's a information that's gonna be

565
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:05,959
able to be provided to the businesses

566
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:08,360
that they didn't have before because

567
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:10,610
that was not regulated because the

568
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:12,740
hollers didn't have to provide that all

569
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:15,829
of the businesses are getting one on one

570
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:18,170
communication with their recycling

571
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:20,359
coordinators in order to be able to help

572
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:22,100
them through the process and help them

573
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:23,419
reduce their waste this is a ten-year

574
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:26,269
plan so it's not gonna happen overnight

575
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:38,330
so the city of Los Angeles definitely

576
00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:42,430
passed that the city has their city they

577
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:56,169
they have their la plant their plan plan

578
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:56,170
PLA the city

579
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:12,949
yes so the city has a it's called the

580
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:14,809
plan P la in yeah that's theirs that's

581
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:16,970
their sustainability plan zero waste as

582
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:19,309
part of that element but they have to

583
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:21,650
work on the different elements on how to

584
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:23,059
get there so there it's not everything's

585
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,440
not written into that plan like we have

586
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:26,240
to have all white roofs and we have to

587
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,070
make sure that we have more green space

588
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,660
and then we have to it's the the

589
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:31,490
franchise the the concept of the

590
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,050
franchise is part of that plan so

591
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,150
there's different elements that they're

592
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:36,769
doing in order to get there when you

593
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,940
talk about zero waste them I'm kind of

594
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:40,639
assuming that maybe you're talking about

595
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:43,490
waste in general like plastics or foam

596
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,250
or something in that nature that that's

597
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:48,799
not part of that plant it anything that

598
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:51,559
comes anything that they they push

599
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,539
forward on is going to come from from

600
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:55,279
within that plan like they're gonna look

601
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:57,769
back into the plan and say we want to

602
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,960
push on this piece of regulation because

603
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:03,079
it meets the needs of this plan

604
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:06,289
you're not gonna probably at this moment

605
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:08,029
see a foam ban in the city of Los

606
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:09,589
Angeles because I know personally

607
00:26:08,029 --> 00:26:11,720
because I'm I'm sort of working in that

608
00:26:09,589 --> 00:26:13,659
circle I'm not sort of I am working in

609
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:17,390
that circle that they're looking at a

610
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:23,330
larger more comprehensive look about how

611
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:24,830
we manage and and and use our waste or

612
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:27,139
the products that we're putting out

613
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:29,119
there and that conversation has not all

614
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:38,690
fully been laid out but it is one that

615
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:40,699
is happening start from is a brand if

616
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:42,799
we're gonna talk about chemistry it'd be

617
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,470
polystyrene expanded polystyrene but

618
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:48,109
polystyrene is without the without it

619
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:52,069
being expanded in the foam since that we

620
00:26:48,109 --> 00:26:54,259
know it huh or what

621
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:56,240
yeah extruded but the thing is that you

622
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:59,000
can here's the hair little tidbit you

623
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,130
can make any plastic in the foam because

624
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,109
all you have to do is just extrude it in

625
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:08,630
the specific manner to where it I was

626
00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:11,209
gonna add that so this city so basically

627
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:13,340
you know from the city plan the city the

628
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:14,370
Department of Public Works LA Department

629
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:17,609
of Public Works

630
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:21,779
as their La sanitation department inside

631
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:23,669
of that and they have policies and in

632
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:26,639
and that's an interesting space to be in

633
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:30,630
and that sanitation is municipal solid

634
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:33,870
waste and sewage treatment ations not

635
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:36,120
going to be pushing on those regulations

636
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:38,549
that look at like they're more of a

637
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:39,899
product exactly yeah and the city and

638
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:42,480
then there and then the county actually

639
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:46,400
does a lot more in that direction than

640
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,870
the city does so it's really the county

641
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,570
the county one's not out yet

642
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:53,969
so the county one they're just doing the

643
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:55,379
community meetings on and pulling in

644
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,579
people from different industries to have

645
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,740
a conversation on the county's

646
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:00,149
sustainability plan so you won't find

647
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:12,569
that one online but you will find the

648
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:16,290
the city of La plan online oh that's

649
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:18,389
great so the zero waste yeah so so Pam

650
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:23,009
like the there's the zero waste cut the

651
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:25,170
definition that you gave is like is is

652
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:27,480
the right definition but then there's

653
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:32,820
sort of the generic don't put anything

654
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:35,190
in the landfill so there is no away

655
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:37,349
right and so we can't throw things away

656
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:38,700
any more how do we you know live our

657
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:41,609
lives if you can't throw things away

658
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,529
okay so that's I think you know going

659
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:45,659
back to like the personal story part the

660
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:47,399
personal journey you know how do you do

661
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,620
that with your family how do you how do

662
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:53,910
you do that you know it's like it's very

663
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:58,589
it's not easy and so what is you know

664
00:28:53,910 --> 00:29:01,980
that yeah and so so from this other huge

665
00:28:58,589 --> 00:29:04,889
other layer is look at like yeah but but

666
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:08,069
but from the corporate level you look at

667
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:11,100
like Walmart Walmart by definition they

668
00:29:08,069 --> 00:29:15,178
they they zero wasted their corporation

669
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:18,269
between like 2003 and 2008 they they

670
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:21,150
reduced by 90% what they used to throw

671
00:29:18,269 --> 00:29:23,450
away but they don't threw out their

672
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:26,700
check there their whole supply chain

673
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:30,240
yeah but they don't contain

674
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:33,090
organics organics boy I'm sorry but but

675
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,179
a lot a lot of what was left in that not

676
00:29:33,089 --> 00:29:37,528
that last 10% was organics because

677
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,298
that's the messy part that's hard to

678
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:41,759
that's the hardest part they were just

679
00:29:39,298 --> 00:29:43,440
simply they used to just you know use

680
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,808
their crates once and throw them away

681
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,490
boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes

682
00:29:45,808 --> 00:29:49,819
inside of boxes for what's gonna the

683
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:53,130
consumer is gonna use and then they just

684
00:29:49,819 --> 00:29:56,278
designed better systems to use less

685
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:59,039
weight throughout from China from India

686
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:01,339
to the store they just they cut that by

687
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:04,200
90% what used to get thrown away

688
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:07,619
well well also know that zero waste has

689
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,880
to do with when when companies say that

690
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:10,558
there's zero waste but they're not

691
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,330
certified zero waste like through true

692
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,940
which is the zero waste certification

693
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:17,788
that same thing as us GBC LEED

694
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,320
certification but for zero waste that

695
00:30:17,788 --> 00:30:20,490
that certification only looks at the

696
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:22,079
building it looks at the brick and

697
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,429
mortar it doesn't look at the the

698
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,949
supplies that are coming in unless

699
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:28,140
they're toxic and how that impact was

700
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:30,298
upstream and if they're what this is the

701
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:32,730
way situation was up there and with the

702
00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:33,929
health and community situation social

703
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:35,460
situation was up there and they don't

704
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:37,320
look at how it is on the back end either

705
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,058
how what happens to it when it leaves if

706
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:40,710
it is actually recyclable if it's

707
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:42,210
reusable if it's durable they don't look

708
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,980
at that they're just they're looking at

709
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:46,620
the brick and mortar and and then you

710
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:48,269
have companies maybe like Walmart and a

711
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:50,819
few others they have a my name in my

712
00:30:48,269 --> 00:30:52,470
head then that name um that will say

713
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:54,359
we're zero waste companies because

714
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:56,100
they've defined what zero waste means

715
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:59,759
they've defined what recyclable is

716
00:30:56,099 --> 00:31:02,278
they've defined that if we burn 60% of

717
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,109
the materials no no no no I'm sorry so

718
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:05,548
is the definition of ninety percent

719
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:08,729
reduction to landfill without

720
00:31:05,548 --> 00:31:11,730
incineration okay so that was you know

721
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:13,259
there's many companies that burn their

722
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,460
their stuff and call it zero waste

723
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:18,658
yeah there's countries that do the same

724
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:22,579
thing Sweden yeah yeah exactly and

725
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:22,580
gasification is burning

726
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:33,349
I don't know you define organics even

727
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:36,889
once tonight oh it's to me no anybody

728
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:40,519
has any one organic what has organic yes

729
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:49,610
oh so as opposed to this which we would

730
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:51,259
not would not be organic yeah I can

731
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:52,879
define up for the waste industry so the

732
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:54,319
waste industry when we say organics

733
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,180
matter and what like when the waste

734
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:58,549
characterization comes out by the state

735
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,630
or even by the EPA and they have the pie

736
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,609
chart and they say what's in our

737
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:03,440
landfill and they'll say what's the

738
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:05,629
recycle ball so what was the organics

739
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,200
and what was the landfill in there

740
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:11,450
though today all of them ok by sandy as

741
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,430
well but they but they then pie chart it

742
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:16,910
out and they'll say this percentage in

743
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:17,630
the landfill er or the overall municipal

744
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:20,360
solid waste

745
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:22,040
I was X you know these are the pie

746
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:23,569
charts when it says organics what

747
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:28,129
they're talking about what falls under

748
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:31,429
that is yard trimmings plant matter food

749
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:33,290
scraps wood and then it does get sticky

750
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,430
for us too because sometimes depending

751
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:37,309
on the study

752
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:40,549
they'll also throw the paper and the

753
00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:42,829
cardboard in there as well so did that

754
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:45,259
you know as you could be composted in it

755
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:47,000
pretty much so for the waste industry

756
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:48,650
that's what it means and I I completely

757
00:32:47,000 --> 00:33:05,480
understand from a science and chemistry

758
00:32:48,650 --> 00:33:15,560
background that there's another time I'm

759
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:16,910
just trying to I have the same issue I

760
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:18,379
have the same issue because I have to

761
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,950
define it to when I go out and do

762
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,950
education

763
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:27,960
and burning so burning is bringing in

764
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:30,059
oxygen so that you have you know this

765
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,000
complete combustion as possible so

766
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:35,759
basically you're turning solid things in

767
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,500
carbon atoms into carbon dioxide right

768
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:40,039
and then gasification is where you do

769
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:43,410
that in a much more controlled way and

770
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:44,730
you are introducing oxygen into into

771
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,019
this you're kind of like partially

772
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,960
burning things but you're not burning

773
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:52,740
everything up - gasps oh yeah it's dead

774
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,450
you're ending up with well in some cases

775
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,940
you are anything above that sometimes

776
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:59,850
you're ending up with gas and some some

777
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:04,289
materials some solid materials they come

778
00:33:59,849 --> 00:34:06,329
in from if if polymers are gasified for

779
00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:14,840
instance you might end up with some

780
00:34:06,329 --> 00:34:17,400
stuff that you can make yeah

781
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,430
thank you guys so much I want to make

782
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,430
sure

783
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,159
but I'm super glad I think that we were

784
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:28,710
able to have a discussion you're super

785
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,710
welcome to stay and chat
