all right

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:10,160
this is the connoisseur kit

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,240
here it is this is the silver dragon

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,359
connoisseur kit this is a half

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,759
ounce i'm also going to have ounce

7
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:20,000
kits available in the future but this is

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,000
the half ounce kit size

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,240
but what you want to do if you want to

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,278
reuse this package

11
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,678
is you want to take a razor blade and

12
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:31,679
or an exacto knife you can actually peel

13
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:34,719
these off if you wanted to

14
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:39,359
actually save this or you can cut it

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:42,840
and then it's permanently opened and cut

16
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:44,159
inside your kit you will find your cola

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,520
jar

18
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:50,878
and you will see your

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,719
14 grams your half ounce of

20
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:58,159
bud in there on the stick this is how

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,520
a grower and all

22
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,319
the highest quality producers of

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,198
cannabis

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,599
of all time have really kept their weed

25
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,158
most

26
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:09,039
growers will keep their herb on the

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,600
stick

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,400
and with all the with many of the leaves

29
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,519
intact

30
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,040
because those leaves are going to uh

31
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:21,519
provide protection for the trichomes and

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,320
and hairs pistols and they're also going

33
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,158
to

34
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:29,039
provide a little bit of the moisture

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,118
reservoir in the environment around the

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,159
bud so that the bud itself doesn't dry

37
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:34,879
out too much

38
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,799
this little bit of extra water retention

39
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:40,719
is like having a boveda pack

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,720
or a boost pack inside of your jar

41
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,959
it will release that moisture over time

42
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,679
and make your bud stay fresher for much

43
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,000
longer

44
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,280
your bud can stay fresh on a stick like

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,840
this with the leaves

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,599
in a cool dark place for up to a year so

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,478
you'll see our lab tests here and you'll

48
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,158
see our

49
00:01:54,478 --> 00:02:02,000
identifying functions on here

50
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,479
and we'll open this jar up

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,118
here child resistant child proof so you

52
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,318
have to push

53
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:11,680
and turn to open it and as you do so

54
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:14,159
you will then be opening the seal

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,599
uh sometimes the seal doesn't open by

56
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,120
taking the lid off you just peel the

57
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:17,679
seal off as you would with the vitamin

58
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,599
jar

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,840
this is the airtight seal keeping your

60
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:25,839
bud 100 percent airtight fresh in here

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,680
um for as long as it's on the shelf so

62
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,080
you know your product your if you buy

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,760
your

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,719
cannabis from us it'll be fresh

and you get to pull out your nice cola

66
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:37,840

it's gorgeous check it out see what it

68
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,598
really is

69
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:46,719
so you can trim them off the stick as

70
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:48,878
you need them

71
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,080
and leave them where they'll stay moist

72
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,439
and fresh

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,080
longer for longer if you choose to

74
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,079
and you can observe just the beauty the

75
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,360
raw natural beauty of the plant

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,840
itself this here is a calyx it's a

77
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,840
swollen

78
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:09,920
gland swollen sac

79
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:13,598
of the flower that contains

80
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:17,039
cannabinoids and terpenes

81
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:20,000
the bulk of the flowers medicine is

82
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:21,280
contained within calyxes the bud itself

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,959
is

84
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,280
dozens or hundreds even of

85
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,560
individual calyxes they're all next to

86
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,519
each other and each

87
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,039
calyx one of these calyxes has a hair

88
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,719
coming out of the top

89
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,318
that's all those hairs that you see on

90
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,719
the bud there these are

91
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:39,598
delicious and full of goodness these

92
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,439
calaxes

93
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:45,280
and the hairs are almost pure thc as

94
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:49,039
well

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,759
inside the kit we also provide you with

96
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,759
a pack

97
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,158
and so you inside you have

98
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:04,318
some scissors and papers

99
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,400
we like organic raw here's how you trim

100
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,798
the most important thing to remember is

101
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,080
to not cut these calyxes these calaxes

102
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,280
that we've just talked about that

103
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,439
contain all the

104
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,959
cannabinoids and all the terpenes we

105
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,439
don't want to lose them or

106
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,959
half of them we're going to aim only for

107
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,399
the parts that we want to remove the

108
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,759
leaflets

109
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,519
that are still attached to the flower

110
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,280
when we're trimming we're only using the

111
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,959
tips of the scissor we're not cutting

112
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,519
any red hairs and we're

113
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,879
just removing the individual leaves one

114
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,120
leaf at a time

115
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,918
removing the leaves one by one

116
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,439
individual

117
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:43,039
removal of leaf one by one not

118
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,160
cutting into the plant not damaging any

119
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,400
of the hairs

120
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,000
leaving all those beautiful hairs intact

121
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,638
leaving all those calyxes whole and

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,879
filled with medicine for you

123
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,079
the machines that process most of your

124
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,279
medicine

125
00:04:54,079 --> 00:05:00,560
will tend to just make a cut

126
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:02,719
like this which will not only cut

127
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,319
that little leaf right there it's like

128
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,600
using a sledge hammer

129
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:09,199
to open an egg it's

130
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,039
all they're trying to do is get rid of

131
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,360
this one little leaf but that machine or

132
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:13,918
that

133
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,520
person trimming will take their scissors

134
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,639
and they will literally

135
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:21,120
remove that whole

136
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,079
side of the flower instead of taking

137
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,478
their scissors

138
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,879
and removing that leaf that needed to

139
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:26,879
come off

140
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,079
as you can see them see swollen right

141
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,639
there individual round swollen calyx

142
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,199
with hairs coming out of them right

143
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,840
there

144
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,199
this is the calyx right here this is

145
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,000
what not to cut

146
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,960
and this is what most all the machines

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,720
and most

148
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:49,599
trimming processing scenarios stories

149
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,600
will be destroying

150
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,399
and so don't cut the calyx that's the

151
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,360
most important thing with trimming

152
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:57,679
that's all i got to say

153
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,840
with this people are shaving the calyxes

154
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,319
people are cutting the calyxes

155
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:04,478
we need to preserve the calyx the flower

156
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:09,199
in its entirety and its wholeness

157
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:09,199
and respect it as its fullness and

158
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,319
stop shaving it you love herb as much as

159
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:16,318
we do

160
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,720
and the ritual preparation of flour

161
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,038
become

162
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:27,120
to become medicine for the body mind and

163
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,120
soul is your spiritual process

164
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,719
afterwards soak it in oil and then wipe

165
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,720
them off

166
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,478
yeah you want to slide the scissors

167
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,919
behind the leaves so that you're not

168
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:48,560
damaging the bud behind it

169
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,560
and only removing the leaves that don't

170
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,879
have the crystal on it with the veins

171
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,879
because

172
00:06:53,120 --> 00:07:04,240
it's all useful

173
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,598
holding the bud very gently so that i'm

174
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,400
not pressing on the

175
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:11,279
hairs and squeezing it at all it's best

176
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:13,839
if you hold it from the stem

177
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,519
or at the bottom of the bud so that you

178
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,638
avoid touching it

179
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,000
too much you can wear gloves if you like

180
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,879
when you do this

181
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,720
so your fingers don't get sticky before

182
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,639
trimming and after trimming

183
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,639
so you can see there's very little leaf

184
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,160
you know we're not talking about a lot

185
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,000
of leaf this is just enough to make one

186
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,039
little infused snack remove all these

187
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,399
from the stems

188
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:42,000
or some of them from the stems at least

189
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:44,638
then what i'm left with now is this twig

190
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,959
the stem itself has calaxes on it with

191
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,478
hairs coming out of them see that

192
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,560
those are delicious some people like to

193
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,680
collect only the calyxes

194
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,879
these into these stem calyxes and make a

195
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,439
joint of just

196
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,680
stem calculus that's a popular old

197
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:03,120
classic grower thing to do for a grower

198
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,519
this way now and when you're ready to

199
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,879
trim

200
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:10,560
to roll one up what i suggest you do

201
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:14,160
is cut along the stem

202
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,639
down the middle of the bud

203
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,400
so that you can kind of like extract the

204
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,240
majority of the stem

205
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,478
you don't need to roll it up and smoke

206
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,918
it just extra carbon it's not going to

207
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:25,439
hurt you just

208
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,120
you don't need it it's not the what

209
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,639
you're going looking for it's

210
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:34,479
you can also cut your flower up this way

211
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,158
and we'll do the same thing almost

212
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,080
slightly different texture a little

213
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:41,679
different burn ability

214
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:45,200
but classic

215
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,199
so this is purple punch

216
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:55,838
they call it a day tripper

217
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,839
this is a classic roll even

218
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:08,528

219
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:24,519
[Music]

220
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:37,839
free your plant

221
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,800
