[Music]

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:30,868
that's the GMO right there you ready

3
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:32,609
smell it I just feel like it's only see

4
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:34,500
it on fake packaging kind of like how

5
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:48,840
Noah was saying he makes brass knuckles

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:50,939
I was like and I only see them on the

7
00:00:48,840 --> 00:01:03,359
Instagram of people who are like you

8
00:00:50,939 --> 00:01:06,118
know three more states east of me you

9
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,570
know talking about DHA and we're like

10
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:11,760
yeah we know that already but yeah it's

11
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:14,489
like blue hit like you could tell that

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,130
it's so surprising that it was so such a

13
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:18,688
knockoff that's because he's like so

14
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:21,269
sweet and innocent it doesn't know that

15
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:46,828
so people be out here who didn't like

16
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:56,359
literally anything in us and he's like

17
00:01:46,828 --> 00:02:00,149
oh I make distillate for breath like

18
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:02,218
like it's not an actual source but you

19
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,368
know what now what I could do is get

20
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:06,669
some from him and flex so hard on the

21
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:24,159
whole internet

22
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:26,889
I am real I'm gonna come cat what room

23
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:31,539
is it do you know Pasadena cool in that

24
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:39,699
hallway I'll come catch you I want to

25
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:41,680
see her she's so sassy Oh perfect I just

26
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:48,780
like listening to her talk I like her

27
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:58,480
her attitude on stage do you want to dab

28
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:59,920
okay another one yeah nice yeah you guys

29
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:07,389
go in the events later this evening like

30
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:09,789
whatever yeah we just got our I'm sorry

31
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:12,699
to pop some of those seeds I saw that I

32
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:14,169
saw that I saw them in Portland talking

33
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:15,399
about like Auto flower seeds then I was

34
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:17,589
like you know I still keep a little grow

35
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,789
like just for my own hobby has been kind

36
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,069
of laborious I'm like maybe I should

37
00:03:18,789 --> 00:03:23,259
just switch over to you know Auto flower

38
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:24,669
and just like have one room and just put

39
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:31,179
them in the little flower and then just

40
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:34,869
go from seed every time I just got some

41
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,219
crop King III think Clapton was I don't

42
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:40,539
know I are there a lot of people in the

43
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:42,729
auto flower game I guess some are better

44
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:43,389
than others and that's actually what I'm

45
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:45,310
interested

46
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:47,889
kind of exploring like everybody talks

47
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,560
about Mephisto so I want to see like I

48
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:52,839
want to grow it out myself and be like

49
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,670
it's pretty good yeah I mean what's

50
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,539
sweet about it um like because people

51
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:59,769
are if you like look in the like it's

52
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:02,560
like the autumn flower groups and stuff

53
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:05,080
like the people that are against like

54
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,670
aggressively angrily against it and it's

55
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,410
like you know you could just like grow a

56
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:11,019
plant and if it doesn't work out like

57
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:12,430
you just grow another plant like a

58
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:15,250
different plan you know like the

59
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,500
consequences of it not working out or

60
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:19,569
like pretty small unless you like just

61
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,509
plant 50 acres cuz you don't research

62
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:24,930
her yes of course please try whatever

63
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:24,930
you want

64
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:39,189
maybe the GMO or the peanut butter

65
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:40,990
brothers some diamonds oh yeah so I've

66
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:42,219
got they're basically all diamonds kind

67
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,389
of fundamentally because the terpene

68
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:46,150
contents higher so they just always

69
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:52,839
separate anyway but yeah I've got sour

70
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:54,279
Clementine over here this one's a

71
00:04:52,839 --> 00:04:56,139
raspberry light key and then this one's

72
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,029
death by cookies which is Death Star and

73
00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:02,769
cookies which is a weird combination

74
00:04:58,029 --> 00:05:07,029
I love the jars yeah they actually hate

75
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:10,478
them no the opaque part is a requirement

76
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:12,369
for regulations and so yeah and so the

77
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:15,969
way the companies make the jars opaque

78
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:18,519
is they just paint a clear jar so inside

79
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:20,530
the jar you can see the imperfections of

80
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:24,039
the paint job on the outside of the jar

81
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:27,639
so it looks like there's black shit in

82
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,300
my hash because it's like a wrinkle in

83
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:31,209
the paint

84
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:35,259
behind the jar you know and so it's

85
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:37,539
maddening to package and you can't tell

86
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:41,159
if they're like is a thing in your hash

87
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,160
or not and then people take a picture

88
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:48,000
yeah so that is delicious so the paint

89
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:50,490
part is a typical but yeah so

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,199
super-clean so you know are you just

91
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,360
doing it yourself are you in with the

92
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:56,729
company yeah so I have a couple of

93
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,569
things going on but I started a partner

94
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:03,000
with Santo Gardens which is not a garden

95
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:04,620
at all mostly because I got involved and

96
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,629
so I turn to their grow rooms into

97
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:13,199
extraction space because I needed more

98
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:16,409
room so we are live resin only

99
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,909
processing company all we make is live

100
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,280
resin it's all filtered through

101
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:22,830
absorbance using that like all cozy or

102
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,629
CTA so um you know it's just that one

103
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:25,919
product and that one niche and we do the

104
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:28,379
best that we possibly can

105
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,830
and I got involved with them because

106
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:35,069
they were brand new to the market 2019

107
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:37,199
is a really interesting year to decide

108
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:39,209
to become a medical dispensary in Denver

109
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,670
CO or a medical myth in Denver Colorado

110
00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:44,339
because the market is crazy saturated

111
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:46,800
with a lot of competitive low pricing

112
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:48,629
you know low quality on the inputs like

113
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,520
it's you know all of the premier brands

114
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:52,139
are running the exact same material so

115
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:56,399
it's really hard to have a like angle

116
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:58,139
over anyone else and what I needed was a

117
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,149
place to try out my experiments on

118
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,589
higher quality material because I'd just

119
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:04,609
been consulting for the previous 5 years

120
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:07,409
and under the pretense of consulting

121
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:09,420
people bring you in because things are

122
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,980
not going well because the material is

123
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,509
poor because the equipment is non

124
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,590
performing they don't call you and

125
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:14,819
they're like so things are going really

126
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:16,409
well our material is extremely

127
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:17,969
high-quality and we're just wondering

128
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:21,450
what we can do to get better like that's

129
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:23,940
never the higher yeah so I needed a

130
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:25,409
place to test some ideas and Santo

131
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:28,709
Gardens allowed me to come in the lab

132
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:32,730
and try out some weird stuff with their

133
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:35,009
freshmen so that's where I'm getting to

134
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,350
this so what it's often referred to as

135
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:41,039
color remediation I don't like that name

136
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:42,270
because color is in a compound and some

137
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,950
things that are colored aren't

138
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:46,199
contaminants and some things are so it's

139
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:46,949
a bad way to describe it but it's the

140
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,769
you know

141
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:52,589
the nomenclature of the day and the idea

142
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:55,740
there's we're using polar adsorbents to

143
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:57,629
remove polar compounds within our

144
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,250
extraction process and so with a

145
00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:01,139
hydrocarbon as their solvent it's

146
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,579
extremely nonpolar most of our target

147
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,629
compounds like terpenes and cannabinoids

148
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:08,399
are nonpolar and so those adsorbents

149
00:08:05,629 --> 00:08:10,290
disallow the things that we don't want

150
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,539
like moisture things that are soluble in

151
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:14,430
moisture heavy metals pesticides salts

152
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,860
sugars stuff that we don't want in our

153
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:20,400
final product and it allows everything

154
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:23,270
else through we don't know exactly what

155
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:27,149
the perfect ratio of like the ideal you

156
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:28,529
know hash oil really is but it you know

157
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:30,719
when you compare like the high-end

158
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:33,418
solvent list to the high-end solvent

159
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,540
made we have the same compounds we're

160
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:39,000
gonna see almost the same thca ratios in

161
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:41,009
your high-end versus mine we're gonna

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,389
see really high terpene ratios in your

163
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:43,500
high-end versus mine because it turns

164
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:55,529
out that if you do a really good job

165
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:57,720
extracting you get the but but like but

166
00:08:55,529 --> 00:09:01,019
to be fair I mean Mary told me my first

167
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,700
Lite hydrocarbon right so much

168
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,649
respecting the IDS on fire by the way

169
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,340
it's very following and like yeah it's a

170
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:10,529
it's a yeah so I'm I'm partial to like

171
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,840
hydrocarbon extractions and it is

172
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:14,370
because the product it's the best

173
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,019
extraction methodology and of course

174
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,560
people out there would argue about

175
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:21,689
crying ethanol and co2 and even refining

176
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,369
to distil it but yeah good you know my

177
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,480
hydrocarbon processes do you get you all

178
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,220
the trip you get you all that you need

179
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,259
right that what you're looking at what

180
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,340
know or what's in the trichome head is

181
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:31,470
another way to put it like those

182
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,970
materials are the ones you want the

183
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,660
other ones need to be filtered out

184
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,590
coming through

185
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:39,649
exactly ya know it's so yeah it's just

186
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:43,800
this is a client this is like yeah

187
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:45,539
definitely a lot very happy just like I

188
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:48,539
mean like I've been growing for a while

189
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:49,709
my first step into like the legit campus

190
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:52,259
world it's like you know I like

191
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:54,090
transporting myself to Denver started

192
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:56,490
building that map and like it was just

193
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,680
awesome I was like first I don't use

194
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,299
type things and like first but like

195
00:09:58,679 --> 00:10:02,969
going to a place like that

196
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,620
facility to buy and get checked out on

197
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,500
cannabis extraction equipment doubtfully

198
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,450
a first you know so super excited and

199
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,639
like now getting you know games

200
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,020
definitely leveled up like none of these

201
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,460
kinds of products were being discussed

202
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:17,159
back then people just weren't at that

203
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,570
level we were just happy for shadow you

204
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,120
know we're happy to have no residual

205
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:23,820
solvents right and and for a really long

206
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,289
time and even still now like what people

207
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,710
were always chasing with concentrates

208
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:30,659
was like consistencies and colors and so

209
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:33,150
like the idea of color remediation I

210
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:35,009
feel like is remediating or our attitude

211
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:36,600
towards color more than remediating the

212
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,639
product of color cuz when I make these

213
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,279
none of these are clear when I make them

214
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,949
I have absolutely clear th CA and then I

215
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,389
have slightly colored phenols I have you

216
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,070
know like there are compounds of colors

217
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:48,240
that are in my you know super Nate and

218
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,830
my mother liquor or whatever that other

219
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,049
solution you know whatever you want to

220
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,639
call it and it just happens to still

221
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:54,839
look really clear when I you know bring

222
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:56,340
it out by the gram but like I'm not

223
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,009
removing color so much it's just bring

224
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,210
you know using every resource I have to

225
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:02,700
make it a little bit better than before

226
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:04,560
and so like back when we met that's what

227
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,870
getting a closed loop was like that was

228
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,609
still you taking advantage of every

229
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,769
opportunity that you could and all the

230
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,090
technology that was available to make

231
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:13,919
the best thing that you could and at the

232
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,389
time probably the best advice I had was

233
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:20,789
like use propane that's more selective

234
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:23,340
but like we get yeah we get better

235
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:26,189
because we learn more and that's not

236
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:28,710
gonna stop so you know TBD till next

237
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,540
year this is really exciting because

238
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:33,030
people are finally is starting to

239
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:34,379
embrace some of this change and that's

240
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:35,819
something that's been really hard to do

241
00:11:34,379 --> 00:11:37,590
for a long time because the market was

242
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,840
so competitive everything sold there was

243
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:46,200
no reason to get better cuz if you could

244
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:50,310
just get shatter you could get money in

245
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,870
Colorado I mean the whole dab market was

246
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:55,289
there before anywhere else an

247
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:57,529
appreciation for extracted products and

248
00:11:55,289 --> 00:12:00,500
you're basically saying that like I mean

249
00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:02,659
it's good to be the one who can say and

250
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,929
we decided our competitive advantage

251
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:07,699
would be best quality yeah exact are

252
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:09,859
competitive in is where the cheapest or

253
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,230
we're the fastest melody buzz yeah yeah

254
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,669
yeah else has thought of that ya know in

255
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:15,500
our industry is now's the time for like

256
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:17,299
the top shelf right I do it's it's fair

257
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,350
point lake in the beginning not so much

258
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:19,789
here in California but definitely in

259
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,860
Denver it's like safe access was like

260
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:23,689
such a boom you didn't have you just had

261
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,639
to put out product like just put out

262
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:26,960
product people would buy it was like I

263
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,490
felt like especially without coming that

264
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,470
we were selling into a void I didn't

265
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:33,289
have to try to innovate or try to raise

266
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,759
the game and now yeah and look look even

267
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:39,769
this device the peak it's like

268
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:41,299
normalizing yeah we couldn't articulate

269
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:43,669
it the consumer had no palate like so

270
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:45,349
even if you think the alcohol model when

271
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:46,879
we come out of prohibition most people

272
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,830
are still used to drinking soda and milk

273
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,919
they have no refined palate for spirits

274
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:53,960
or wine or beer and that impacts America

275
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,639
for a while you know we they had mixed

276
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,710
drinks it could be a sweet thing mixed

277
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,659
with alcohol but refined spirits good

278
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:01,940
wine take a while to get that palate

279
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:03,379
back in cannabis there's a few of us

280
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,670
that may have had it earlier on and

281
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:06,919
didn't even have access to high-end

282
00:13:04,669 --> 00:13:08,838
stuff we're just happy for good flowers

283
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:12,319
and whatnot or extractions you might

284
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:14,839
make it home but now people are catching

285
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,940
up quick right into market in Colorado

286
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:21,980
California you're both seeing a slow

287
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:24,290
like finally sure sure I think every day

288
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,330
of dispensaries there's a higher demand

289
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:27,679
for quality and because we can talk

290
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,450
about it let's just start there the fact

291
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,979
that like you know brand ambassadors can

292
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:32,960
go out and articulate the value

293
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,399
proposition and the differentiation of

294
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,440
what you make your products and how you

295
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,990
make them and like science education

296
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,400
like it takes TLC to innovate right and

297
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,049
usually people like myself like we

298
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,750
talked about and get passionate about

299
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:47,029
how we make our products because we're

300
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,039
thinking and putting like energy into it

301
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:50,600
and like I think consumers resonate with

302
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:52,250
that they're like all that those dudes

303
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,290
are doing it real like there that's good

304
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,289
stuff and then like and then they taste

305
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:58,338
and everybody's palate is different and

306
00:13:56,289 --> 00:14:00,379
and look I'm really psyched on

307
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:02,089
concentrates because this could like

308
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:05,450
these kinds of devices in this kind of

309
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:07,280
session could mitigate like the vape pen

310
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,700
craze that's going on and while I

311
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,559
appreciate the convenience

312
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:18,020
the pennants like I don't walk little

313
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:18,019
flash right you know right that's right

314
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:22,919
there's a little bit of ritual to it and

315
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:25,500
like while I appreciate the convenience

316
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:25,919
of a pen beyond just losing them all the

317
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,419
time

318
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:29,039
I don't know that that device will ever

319
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:31,349
be ready for primetime and most of these

320
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,789
are solids those pens are not really for

321
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,930
that I know the heated chamber but

322
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,879
they're also if they're done right

323
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:38,429
they're potent enough to be curated

324
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:41,460
right like stop we just walked in here

325
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:43,469
have a session and move on you know and

326
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,580
go for quality not everybody's gonna

327
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,860
think that way there are people that

328
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,270
walk around with six packs of paps you

329
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,610
know and there's gonna be concentrates

330
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:52,110
and pens for those people but yeah the

331
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:53,909
game is leveling up every year like next

332
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,980
year I mean the peak wasn't around last

333
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:57,329
year right next year it'll be something

334
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,310
else it'll be another dealer great

335
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:01,920
device or some new innovation in

336
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:05,069
technology you know obviously saucing

337
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:07,129
diamonds all those things you know that

338
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:12,000
have been coming out lately are amazing

339
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:14,549
yeah so it's a talked about and so two

340
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,480
markets the farmers you're working with

341
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:20,759
the dynamics between like what cultivars

342
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,769
are we smoking and then like are you

343
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,509
telling them what you want or are they

344
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:26,250
being like I have some hot news ship

345
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:29,340
that you guys definitely need to check

346
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:32,100
out I mean the market difference is

347
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:34,710
probably huge then between us cuz you

348
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,200
know one thing that I always like to

349
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:42,360
point out is that Colorado is famous for

350
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:45,509
good concentrates and bad weed so we're

351
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,830
doing our very best out there yeah I

352
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:48,779
mean that's probably a product of like

353
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:50,610
we have a lot more Sun grown and there's

354
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:53,339
a lot more farmers and so yeah we do get

355
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:56,580
good quality weed and people nerd out on

356
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:58,200
flowers concentrates definitely of

357
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:02,180
course have had a rise here our

358
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,180
relationship like you know this is not

359
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:08,190
it's all sorts from Sun grown and it all

360
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:10,259
goes back to to the farmer right so we

361
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:12,930
are trying to go for just as a value

362
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:16,860
proposition of farm-to-table handcrafted

363
00:16:12,929 --> 00:16:19,009
product you know so yeah it's just no

364
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,789
one can poke any holes and

365
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:23,990
yeah it's hard again iodine look I'll be

366
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:25,429
honest and we would not be able to

367
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,759
effectuate the strategy had we not had

368
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:30,259
an already in another grand identity

369
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:32,450
like our core brand identity with our

370
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:34,039
topicals and our wellness suite we call

371
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,480
that the tip of the spear it's allowed

372
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:37,490
us to grow that marketplace and

373
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,259
dispensary get revenue and now take our

374
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,060
time I mean this is definitely a quality

375
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:43,639
over margin product it's hard to scale

376
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:45,529
it takes there's a labor to create these

377
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:47,059
high-end concentrates put them at a

378
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:48,709
price point that only so many people are

379
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:51,169
buying we're growing that marketplace

380
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,460
without here talking I try to dab as

381
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:54,949
many people out so that they can

382
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,990
understand them what it is to have great

383
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,060
low-temperature vaporization and whatnot

384
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:01,519
and I love smoking flower don't get me

385
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:03,439
wrong but when it comes it's like flower

386
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,109
because that's awesome and the tradition

387
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,190
and then after that I'm all low temp

388
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,588
favored ization it's like you can

389
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,390
harness everything all the flavors and

390
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:15,349
yumminess that you need that way you

391
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:17,540
know definitely so talk so you're

392
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:19,730
starting to talk about some of the farms

393
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:21,259
and like what what are you both asking

394
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,180
them what are they both asking do you

395
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:25,459
actually sorts me indoor so yeah so

396
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,920
everything that we source is indoor and

397
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,690
we only process fresh frozen our

398
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:34,759
facility which is also a little bit more

399
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:37,970
specific because yes yes same thing but

400
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:39,680
there's a lot of resistance to that from

401
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,990
a lot of farmers like it's hard to get

402
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:47,420
really high quality fresh frozen on a

403
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:49,099
consistent basis yeah so it's a limited

404
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,930
market you know for example with the

405
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:52,849
medical license all of those pounds and

406
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:54,860
plants are literally still associated to

407
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:56,449
individual humans and that you know that

408
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:58,399
market is shrinking and so then it

409
00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:00,740
becomes harder to provide enough

410
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,620
cannabis for everyone let alone enough

411
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:06,920
cannabis for me to process and turn into

412
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:09,319
high quality concentrates and so you

413
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:12,890
know the amount of low quality material

414
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:14,419
that's available definitely is excessive

415
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:16,550
compared to the amount of you know high

416
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:18,740
quality material which makes it you know

417
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:20,919
restrictive marketplace we also only

418
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,000
purchase wholesale and sell wholesale

419
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,470
compared to where you're going you know

420
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,369
and working directly with a farm and

421
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:31,240
right back we handpick regardless of who

422
00:18:28,369 --> 00:18:33,369
our supplier is some suppliers

423
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,710
we purchase only specific things from

424
00:18:33,369 --> 00:18:37,599
them and we you know choose the best of

425
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,920
what they're growing in our opinion or

426
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,949
the stuff that's best for us for our

427
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:43,360
extraction because the way that you want

428
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,069
to grow cannabis and the types of

429
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,079
cannabis that are best for extraction

430
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:49,809
are not always the best for big fat

431
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:52,569
colas and you know nice easy to sell

432
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:53,980
high-end pounds and so and especially

433
00:18:52,569 --> 00:18:55,629
with like solvent list as your

434
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,569
application that matters even more

435
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:00,880
because your yield is so much less

436
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:02,559
accessible when it's difficult compared

437
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,410
to my solvent you can you know dissolve

438
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,299
it easily and so it's not even just the

439
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,820
the quality of the material that we have

440
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:11,710
to go after but the like the type of

441
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:14,889
material itself because anything that's

442
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:18,009
too dense anything that is you know

443
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:20,259
those big giant like football colas um

444
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:22,509
you know is really not the best product

445
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:24,879
for us we're looking for surface area in

446
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:26,769
addition you know to having the you know

447
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,560
the incredible potency and the perfect

448
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:31,480
print you know turbulent flavor but it's

449
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:33,579
definitely same for us like you know we

450
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,069
send a truck out to the farm we have to

451
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:38,289
we test wash every strain where now that

452
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:40,089
we're in our second year we're second

453
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:42,460
set of cycles we do have certain crops

454
00:19:40,089 --> 00:19:43,990
like the GMO being grown consistently by

455
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,460
the same farmer but it's intimate

456
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,559
relationship because with this solvent

457
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,269
list it's about trichome head size so

458
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:50,559
not everything is gonna wash well just

459
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:52,119
straight up and there's nothing we can

460
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:56,589
do about that so we need to find the

461
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:58,149
strains that wash well right now is by

462
00:19:56,589 --> 00:19:59,829
eye even though there's a proposed

463
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:01,570
technology we're trying to develop where

464
00:19:59,829 --> 00:20:04,289
we can take snapshots of the trichomes

465
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:06,519
and get a measurement and understand

466
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:08,500
scientifically the average trichrome

467
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:10,599
heads on this particular strain are this

468
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,119
and we'll get them at 90 or 120 and

469
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:15,250
it'll be perfect right now Brady does

470
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,289
that because he's a fucking magician I

471
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,519
mean there's still a little art I mean

472
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:20,379
I'm sure you could be there's a lot of

473
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:22,539
art still in this process I mean like

474
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,670
all good cutting-edge science we have

475
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:27,190
some good tool box like understandings

476
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:29,019
of the apparatus and the methodology of

477
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,580
what we're trying to do but we're trying

478
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,259
to push it right we're trying to find

479
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:34,389
the new and we're trying to make it

480
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:35,920
scalable of course right so you know how

481
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:39,009
if we can effectuate this photographic

482
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,690
way it'll allow others to go and it'll

483
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:42,789
allow us to maybe go through different

484
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:44,320
supply chains quicker in terms of

485
00:20:42,789 --> 00:20:44,649
evaluating as opposed to test washing

486
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,349
every

487
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:50,200
which takes time but which is also fun

488
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:51,639
but yeah it's an intimate process and

489
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,350
now that we have some strings and we're

490
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,028
gonna standardize you know I've called

491
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:56,379
for four of them like I'll still let the

492
00:20:55,028 --> 00:20:57,700
guys play because of course that's part

493
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,740
of the industry you always want to have

494
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,778
the new new and some inconsistent

495
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,308
product but business demands and

496
00:21:01,778 --> 00:21:04,569
pressures are me to be like can we just

497
00:21:03,308 --> 00:21:07,839
have like the same screen at the

498
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:09,908
dispensary all the time yes I guess but

499
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,918
you're like that's what you should want

500
00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:13,539
different stuff and I do one and I am

501
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,400
look we're towing the line I hope that

502
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:17,288
at one point we'll be like a sneaker

503
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,240
company when we drop a strain on IG

504
00:21:17,288 --> 00:21:20,980
people show up and it sells out and we

505
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,349
that happens a little bit we have some

506
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,610
fan following but that's the level of

507
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:27,398
quality of the product I don't think

508
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:28,808
that's too much to ask for quality but

509
00:21:27,398 --> 00:21:30,489
we will put a consistent product we

510
00:21:28,808 --> 00:21:32,349
thought about like putting a lower tier

511
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,450
product as a high-end brand that's

512
00:21:32,349 --> 00:21:36,038
always a difficult choice to make to

513
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,538
like have a lower price point product to

514
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:39,069
suppose we're not there yet it's almost

515
00:21:37,538 --> 00:21:41,379
like you have to be really big to offer

516
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:43,028
like yeah exactly or like a key chain

517
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,860
and Tiffany's or something like that

518
00:21:43,028 --> 00:21:46,450
yeah you know something you can have a

519
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:48,129
little something you have a little

520
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,380
something but you can't have this you

521
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:56,649
know you only get this on the holidays

522
00:21:50,380 --> 00:22:01,000
or something I actually don't believe I

523
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:02,709
don't believe in shiny things at all I

524
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,329
love spending money on the things I'm

525
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:11,860
passionate about and I appreciate people

526
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:14,139
are passionate about so it's not really

527
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:15,609
for me to say I definitely want Brady

528
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:20,320
here but I definitely know the garlic

529
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:22,479
cookies is one of them the THC bomb is

530
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,189
running in like 8% so of course there's

531
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,778
some economics around that oh man like

532
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,669
what washed well and had a good like

533
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:29,710
yummy profile and what we could

534
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:32,288
encourage farmers to you know do a few

535
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,788
hoop houses or some full term I built

536
00:22:32,288 --> 00:22:35,679
out a lot of good climate control store

537
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:38,140
that a lot of fucking walk-in freezers

538
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,880
do you power power constraints for

539
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:47,470
walk-in freezers and yeah and we've also

540
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:49,059
you know especially well yeah yeah so we

541
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,470
have Webb freezer trucks right and they

542
00:22:49,058 --> 00:22:54,099
don't really get frozen on the truck but

543
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:56,409
they definitely spacious yeah right and

544
00:22:54,099 --> 00:22:57,849
the truck is definitely it's a freezer

545
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:59,410
but it's not like subs

546
00:22:57,849 --> 00:23:00,730
so it's not gonna freeze the product but

547
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,440
it'll definitely start to mobilize it

548
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:03,849
and then by the time it gets to the lab

549
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,039
you know depending on how far in the

550
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:09,279
hill it is our whatever I immediately

551
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:11,230
gets so Brady you know it's like that

552
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,490
thing like the dense coal is like we're

553
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:14,259
wrestling and trying experiment if you

554
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,670
start to macerate them you open up cell

555
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:17,920
walls and that potentially is gonna

556
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,690
leach things that you don't want but at

557
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:23,259
the same time you want to have surface

558
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:25,120
area there exactly so we've been

559
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:28,119
experimenting with techniques we usually

560
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:30,099
only do smalls right so we partner with

561
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:31,389
the farmers they come through because it

562
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:32,679
again outdoor a little bit different

563
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,330
process even from the harvesting

564
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,039
perspective so they'll just take all the

565
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,240
tops and then they'll just be all the

566
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,649
smalls and we come literally the next

567
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,509
day so the plants have had those buns

568
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,710
have had a chance to like flesh out

569
00:23:40,509 --> 00:23:43,539
again right and there you see they're

570
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,549
all and then we just stripped them and

571
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:47,230
how we macerate them is definitely

572
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,450
something the breeding watches carefully

573
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:51,519
because while we want surface area we

574
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:53,289
also have to be careful not to break the

575
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:59,079
plan up too much to let out certain

576
00:23:53,289 --> 00:24:00,460
things that hands right now although if

577
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:03,009
I had to shout out pure pressure for

578
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,630
sure we use peer pressure presses and we

579
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:07,750
use peer pressure stainless steel

580
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:10,510
washing drums 50% because some people

581
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:12,849
still love a fucking trash can food save

582
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:14,920
trash can and we paddle by hand and we

583
00:24:12,849 --> 00:24:17,289
do use peer pressure paddles we use

584
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:18,670
professor rosin bags so you know yeah I

585
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:21,220
mean again that's just that denver

586
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:22,720
connection those are my people the

587
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,860
equipment is good you know it's like

588
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,200
they're at least you're trying to scale

589
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:28,179
the solvent was there are other other

590
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,519
company other couple of companies out

591
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,930
there while we do a lot of humble

592
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:34,269
centric stuff pure pressure is

593
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:36,610
definitely one of the brands that we

594
00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:38,559
work with it's not in Humboldt and there

595
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:41,019
are like sasquatches some rosin folks up

596
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,970
north that we could partner with but

597
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:56,309
right now we mostly use peer pressure

598
00:24:42,970 --> 00:25:00,190
equipment and lots of hands and TLC that

599
00:24:56,309 --> 00:25:01,779
has to be hits yeah that's people

600
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,670
literally like yeah and we and it's

601
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:05,109
definitely our team we used to let them

602
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,029
do it and it would show up in totes and

603
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:08,139
like Brady's a perfectionist I think

604
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:09,849
most extraction artists are

605
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:10,788
professionist like he takes these jars

606
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:12,528
and how does his team

607
00:25:10,788 --> 00:25:14,538
wipe them out because they came from

608
00:25:12,528 --> 00:25:17,538
China and if it leaves black on the foot

609
00:25:14,538 --> 00:25:19,788
I'm just like I kind of get shocked by

610
00:25:17,538 --> 00:25:23,419
the labor but you cannot argue quality

611
00:25:19,788 --> 00:25:24,499
yeah exactly yeah like yeah he wants you

612
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:26,269
know he's got this guy clean blood

613
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:28,098
coming in he's like we're like we're

614
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:30,848
building clean rooms to make cash and

615
00:25:28,098 --> 00:25:34,848
I'm like okay I get it I'm with it right

616
00:25:30,848 --> 00:25:37,698
so yeah so we have to go and take the

617
00:25:34,848 --> 00:25:38,928
product the right way and like wow you

618
00:25:37,699 --> 00:25:40,849
know some of it believe it or not to

619
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:42,649
investors and whatnot and like if I to

620
00:25:40,848 --> 00:25:45,108
people who may not understand I'm like

621
00:25:42,648 --> 00:25:47,148
it's just for the ritual of it I will I

622
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:49,098
will articulate to the public and

623
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:52,218
document this process but this is not

624
00:25:49,098 --> 00:25:52,548
crazy winemakers do it spirit makers do

625
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,259
it

626
00:25:52,548 --> 00:25:56,239
craft people do this kind of thing to

627
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:58,118
create quality products it's on us as

628
00:25:56,239 --> 00:26:00,169
business people our marketing people to

629
00:25:58,118 --> 00:26:01,788
articulate that to the consumer and

630
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:03,949
people love that this is beyond grand

631
00:26:01,788 --> 00:26:09,548
story of course we're taking all the

632
00:26:03,949 --> 00:26:09,548
videos in the drug is gold exactly

633
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:15,588
people to see it yeah

634
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:16,909
but I would argue that it's still it's

635
00:26:15,588 --> 00:26:19,308
still a part of the scientific process

636
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:21,259
because the fact that you go out and do

637
00:26:19,308 --> 00:26:22,729
it puts accountability on you which is

638
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:24,288
really important to the scientific

639
00:26:22,729 --> 00:26:26,088
process someone has to have been the one

640
00:26:24,288 --> 00:26:28,788
who did the thing so you can report back

641
00:26:26,088 --> 00:26:30,739
and know what happened so you just have

642
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:33,288
so much more data when you can go and be

643
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:35,719
there at the source you know like it's

644
00:26:33,288 --> 00:26:38,088
really easy to be fooled when a grower

645
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:40,068
says I never spray anything if you never

646
00:26:38,088 --> 00:26:41,658
go into their grow if you go into their

647
00:26:40,068 --> 00:26:43,719
grow to harvest their stuff and there's

648
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:48,109
flying bugs in the air

649
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:49,909
you may have the answer and so like that

650
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:52,698
relationship is important for

651
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:55,219
transparency which is also important for

652
00:26:52,699 --> 00:26:56,709
that scientific process so as artistic

653
00:26:55,219 --> 00:26:58,399
as it might be I think it's still very

654
00:26:56,709 --> 00:27:00,889
mathematical I think you could still

655
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:02,598
absolutely calculate the business

656
00:27:00,888 --> 00:27:05,988
advantage that comes from that because

657
00:27:02,598 --> 00:27:08,808
you won't end up making a poor decision

658
00:27:05,989 --> 00:27:10,489
based on a lack of information if you

659
00:27:08,808 --> 00:27:12,440
are more hands-on or at least you won't

660
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:14,659
be able to make that mistake twice

661
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,889
right because you'll have made it you'll

662
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:17,299
learn all the way through that problem

663
00:27:15,888 --> 00:27:18,918
yeah and it's awesome because like we

664
00:27:17,298 --> 00:27:20,269
see people like getting like some of the

665
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:22,999
younger members just getting more

666
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:24,038
knowledgeable and like yeah there's no

667
00:27:22,999 --> 00:27:25,538
phoning in hash that's

668
00:27:24,038 --> 00:27:29,138
other thing is our guys are incentivized

669
00:27:25,538 --> 00:27:31,058
like unlike our other workers you if you

670
00:27:29,138 --> 00:27:33,928
don't show up to this job whether it's

671
00:27:31,058 --> 00:27:36,940
at the farm or while your hand paddling

672
00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:38,619
you will lose quality you will lose

673
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,359
extraction arey and that's money I mean

674
00:27:38,618 --> 00:27:41,618
I think it's all extractors right so

675
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:44,439
whoever is running your equipment

676
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:46,478
regardless of the methodology they have

677
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,919
to be in the game right even if it's you

678
00:27:46,479 --> 00:27:49,389
if you think it's automated then you're

679
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,788
just making crude if you're trying to

680
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:53,558
make a quality product every like nuance

681
00:27:51,788 --> 00:27:55,419
needs to pay attention if somebody is

682
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:57,190
not heart's not in it or they're not

683
00:27:55,419 --> 00:28:00,038
some some way tied to the economics or

684
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:01,389
the other side that's right and not then

685
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:03,339
all of a sudden it's not a craft product

686
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:05,798
right if you were I mean if you were to

687
00:28:03,339 --> 00:28:08,618
compare it to food it's like someone who

688
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:10,598
you know just makes Haribo gummy bears

689
00:28:08,618 --> 00:28:12,189
and a factory there make the same thing

690
00:28:10,598 --> 00:28:13,720
all day every single day it does not

691
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,729
matter what they think or feel about the

692
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,220
product that they're making but if you

693
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:20,379
take that to like someone who makes you

694
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,819
know confections and a bakery one day

695
00:28:20,378 --> 00:28:23,259
they make maybe these little cupcakes

696
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:25,298
one day they make the little candy

697
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:26,769
decorations that go on the cupcakes the

698
00:28:25,298 --> 00:28:27,970
next day they're making different icing

699
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:29,229
for all of the different other cakes

700
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,598
that they're gonna make them make the

701
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:34,840
next week and so the diversity of

702
00:28:31,598 --> 00:28:36,759
products that they make is really what

703
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:39,638
makes them good at their job they might

704
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:41,679
make the same type of gummy bear that

705
00:28:39,638 --> 00:28:42,728
someone who works in a factory makes but

706
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,590
those someone who works in a factory

707
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:47,710
can't come in and make a different type

708
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:49,598
of gummy bear also so it doesn't make me

709
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:52,090
a good extractor to make good hash out

710
00:28:49,598 --> 00:28:54,999
of one thing one time like that just

711
00:28:52,089 --> 00:28:56,470
happens what makes you good at it is to

712
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:58,210
be able to make good hash out of

713
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,669
everything that you take in and to be

714
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:03,220
able to repeat it all of the time with

715
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:04,419
wildly different material because even

716
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,308
when you're talking about like I've got

717
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:08,559
four that I really like those four

718
00:29:06,308 --> 00:29:10,658
aren't coming in at the same bag size

719
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:11,950
that you're choosing they're not coming

720
00:29:10,659 --> 00:29:14,440
in probably even with the same

721
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,970
temperature and pressing necessarily the

722
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,409
size of batch that you're gonna run at a

723
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,639
time might be different based on the way

724
00:29:17,409 --> 00:29:21,549
that they yield like all of those

725
00:29:18,638 --> 00:29:22,719
parameters make them individual products

726
00:29:21,548 --> 00:29:24,249
every time I have a different strain

727
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,019
even if I get the same consistency out

728
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:28,839
of it like I'm still making something

729
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:31,479
totally new and so that's that's like

730
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:33,848
the expertise is that you need you need

731
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:34,740
versatility to be able to do this all

732
00:29:33,848 --> 00:29:37,079
the time and you

733
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,870
can't phone in versatility you can phone

734
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:41,730
in a repetitive process but even when

735
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:43,889
you do the same thing it's not the same

736
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:46,140
the scaling comes in getting such a

737
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:48,390
large team to be able to be on the same

738
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:52,410
page all the time well talk to me about

739
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:55,650
one thing which is if the concept of

740
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:57,690
long-term aging of hash like a lot of

741
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:59,850
times cannabis has always been like it

742
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:01,789
needs to be consumed now like the best

743
00:29:59,849 --> 00:30:05,009
time to consume it is immediately

744
00:30:01,789 --> 00:30:06,990
whereas some stuff you can you know cure

745
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:08,808
it and age it for a long term and then

746
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:11,579
you could have concepts of like oh the

747
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:14,428
2015 year was amazing and these things

748
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:18,210
peak like 3 to 6 years out so anywhere

749
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:20,040
and then your batches become more

750
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:22,410
valuable yeah I mean that's more in

751
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:25,470
Frenchie's game I guess right and you

752
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:27,480
know cured hash is definitely not my

753
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:32,579
personal skill set but yeah there's

754
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:35,160
definitely yeah and that's you know so

755
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:37,139
that's an interesting one too you know I

756
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:39,000
think flowers are definitely perishable

757
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,500
you can immobilize them to a good end

758
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,079
but that's all you're doing it's like

759
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,210
terpenes or VOCs they want to go they're

760
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:55,259
gonna oxidize whether you smoke them or

761
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:57,569
not it's not like wine in that bottle

762
00:30:55,259 --> 00:31:00,119
but definitely true Moroccan hash can

763
00:30:57,569 --> 00:31:02,700
age and definitely gets older and more

764
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:05,369
CBN e'en more sleepy and but it has a

765
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:07,500
distinct taste aroma and you know that's

766
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:10,079
uh I can see I could see that and like

767
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:11,460
cigars in the future and like that's

768
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:13,349
what you put in it like a good like

769
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:16,620
Hanna gar like freshly rolled with like

770
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:18,569
old like you know 20 year old Moroccan

771
00:31:16,619 --> 00:31:19,678
hash or something like that maybe we'll

772
00:31:18,569 --> 00:31:20,460
get there I don't know I mean I'm sure

773
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,269
there are people that are passionate

774
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,529
about those products but yeah anyway I'm

775
00:31:24,269 --> 00:31:27,269
fortunate have to start to bounce when

776
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:29,819
you guys dude I did promise we have a

777
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:34,529
tour of cannabis dispensaries to hit

778
00:31:29,819 --> 00:31:37,879
before and get back here at one point so

779
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:49,470
I've got uh let's see

780
00:31:37,880 --> 00:32:02,280
got some sour clam over here and then

781
00:31:49,470 --> 00:32:05,039
raspberry Lachi and white cookies and

782
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:18,960
then you brought with car the cookies

783
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:20,490
mainly papaya wedding crashers these

784
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,259
last few events I've had a good time

785
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:26,220
just like posting up like this and just

786
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:33,809
like that's like Frenchie

787
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:35,519
French cheese heaven is like that's the

788
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:41,129
best way to spread the word though you

789
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:42,900
can't argue with this I have the best

790
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:44,940
picture like with Frenchie in the

791
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,890
background like wafting the cold and

792
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,230
that is a completely different smoke

793
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:51,180
smoking experience regularly this

794
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:53,039
definitely has I mean even again the

795
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:54,420
drawing the curing you know with our

796
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,420
something like this hash for use of

797
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:59,009
freeze drying I mean that's like

798
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,269
next-gen dry right it's not the same art

799
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:07,250
and curing but the freeze dried it has

800
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:12,240
its nuances to be sure well what are the

801
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:16,950
the freeze dryer like its pluses and

802
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,319
minuses versus above my paper honestly

803
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:22,890
it's like those kids have better I can

804
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:27,480
tell you a little bit about what's it

805
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:29,250
called sublimation or vacuum sublimation

806
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,160
whenever the type of a term for freeze

807
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:35,190
drying is and why it works but yeah the

808
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:36,900
nuances and the timing and look it's all

809
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:40,470
in the prep right so it becomes a hand

810
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,940
feel how they lay out so makes me out

811
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:43,200
you know as it comes out of the bags you

812
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,970
scoop it up and it looks like sand

813
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,980
basically you know the thickness that

814
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:49,360
that paddy is how it gets stacked in the

815
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,610
oven same thing with working of a coven

816
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:53,409
right it's like right now I feel like I

817
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:55,359
feel like I used to understand my back

818
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:59,170
of course like to Marie's point there's

819
00:33:55,359 --> 00:34:00,579
numbers somewhere so and bring the

820
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,750
number back and then all of a sudden

821
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:03,669
that would bring like the cooks

822
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,920
experience back to front right because

823
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:07,660
in a way I guess what science data is

824
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,460
your recipe right you go back in like oh

825
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,730
these were the view of the variables

826
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:14,590
that I use and it worked perfectly right

827
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:17,250
so even things like testing just

828
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:20,260
different thicknesses and being like oh

829
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:21,550
yeah yeah I mean I mean I'm sure my

830
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,200
hidroméis are just the way you pack your

831
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:25,269
columns way to get the materials

832
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:27,159
macerated all of it and it's wildly

833
00:34:25,269 --> 00:34:28,840
different so I'm sitting on a panel the

834
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:31,210
other day with a guy from hammer mill

835
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,640
like that like grind shit to a pump and

836
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:36,340
I'm thinking oh right but there are

837
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:39,129
people out there especially on the side

838
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:42,100
like what a masturbation sawdust you see

839
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:44,619
a massive surface here you blasted right

840
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:45,940
they get dark as crude oil but then they

841
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:48,880
were finding it to distillate anyway so

842
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:50,650
just big eyes you know stress is the

843
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:53,470
hardest way to make distillate because

844
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:56,470
you have to do so much pose much like

845
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:59,409
prep like it's just you know it's the

846
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:01,359
longest road grease it the same you know

847
00:34:59,409 --> 00:35:06,909
high purity product if you would just be

848
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:07,930
faster than the first silly all right

849
00:35:06,909 --> 00:35:10,089
well I'll see you guys later

850
00:35:07,929 --> 00:35:14,739
yeah we're gonna run in by some desert

851
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:16,920
weed it's funny they're like part of the

852
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:16,919
job
