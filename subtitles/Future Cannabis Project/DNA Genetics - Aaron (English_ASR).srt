19
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,100

22
00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:04,198
makes you different from all these

23
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,629
brands around because now you have a lot

24
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:11,099
of petition considering in 15 years ago

25
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:13,709
there's a few seed companies that have

26
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:17,129
been really doing their their work you

27
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:19,559
know they're breeding and there's a lot

28
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:22,530
of seed companies that don't do any work

29
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,728
and just buy seeds from another seed

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,579
company and do you have any breeder that

31
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:33,799
you can say I respect them or or I would

32
00:01:29,578 --> 00:01:36,000
like like you I respect Santa Barbra

33
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:39,079

Franco was a friend of ours we respect

36
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,118
all the real seed companies I could say

37
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:50,908
there's there's too many to name that I

38
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:53,150
that I respect and I and I approve of

39
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,250
their work nice

40
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:57,469
I love cannabis and then you know that's

41
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,510
why we're here standing here is because

42
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:01,789
me and my business partner love weed

43
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:05,450
it's been a part of our lives for many

44
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:08,868
years over the past 16 years we've just

45
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:12,680
seen the everything grow grow grow grow

46
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:17,259
grow business grow the whole the whole

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:19,640
plan has grown the company has grown

48
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:23,269
we're living in a dream right now it's a

49
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:25,639
rocket ride to who could who all else is

50
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,650
going up to space with us you know the

51
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:29,929
vision people some people who just make

52
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,959
seeds and then there's gonna people that

53
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:37,189
use their brand to elevate them their

54
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:40,159
company a lot higher and in the what is

55
00:02:37,189 --> 00:02:43,370
the customer or the public requesting

56
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:47,659
more about characteristics in your

57
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:52,069
thought of course I think the world is

58
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:53,568
is enjoying the fruitier varieties they

59
00:02:52,068 --> 00:02:57,469
still love the cush is from California

60
00:02:53,568 --> 00:03:00,009
but I say the fruitier varieties really

61
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:03,259
tasty things I mean this is what we've

62
00:03:00,009 --> 00:03:07,219
we've been breeding for for the past 16

63
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:12,169
years is based on flavor flavor taste

64
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:15,620
and aroma open a new orisons right like

65
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:18,379
it experiences like its other kind of

66
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,900
taste for example in Ecuador like I'm

67
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:24,680
from my work that's why if a strain like

68
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,430
tangi comes to Ecuador and grows good in

69
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:30,109
Ecuador

70
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:32,420
you'd be like wow everybody in Ecuador

71
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:35,689
would be like holy shit this really

72
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:39,909
smells like a fruit it's this is amazing

73
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:45,650
and the high is very nice - very up high

74
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:50,060
again we for Don and I it's about smell

75
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:54,109
and taste it's it's everything is going

76
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:56,449
to get you high some smooth things will

77
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:58,989
get you stone but it's all about the way

78
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:01,429
it tastes in my in my honest opinion

79
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:02,420
taste is the most important thing in

80
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,180
cannabis

81
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:07,879
nice I I actually shared that because I

82
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,520
always choose by smell and and imagine

83
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:14,120
which one is gonna be taster like I

84
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:18,139
personally prefer Swedish one but also

85
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:24,168
it depends but I prefer a sweet flavor

86
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:27,168
like well so the smell the terpenes play

87
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:32,079
a role in how you feel when you smoke

88
00:04:27,168 --> 00:04:35,180
cannabis THC has no real feeling

89
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:39,500
different terpenes make your high go up

90
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:42,470
make your high go down make you more

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,000
active make you more sleepy different

92
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:48,200
terpene different terpene profiles

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,240
dictate how the high is so it's really

94
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:52,969
about the smell and the taste the

95
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,699
terpenes nice oh we already know if we

96
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:59,030
want a really nice fruit we should come

97
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:00,560

98
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:01,899
