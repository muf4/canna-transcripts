57
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,919
space who've been doing

for a long time and really taking care

59
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,359
of the land while you're doing that so

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,879
we really try to partner with farmers

61
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,220
who are eco conscious manufacturers who

62
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:43,439
are also along the same mission and

63
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:45,479
vision and work with industry pioneers

64
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,430
across the supply chain right now we've

65
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,979
been focusing on bulk commodity

66
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:53,280
procurement distribution so that's bulk

67
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:55,828
trim be buds flour and different oils

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,419
and distributing those to other members

69
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:59,610
of the supply chain for their products

70
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:01,009
and uh it's been it's been pretty cool

71
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,299
you know we've been all over the state

72
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:05,009
procuring flour and doing a lot of a lot

73
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:07,109
of testing a lot of our D tests and

74
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:08,370
micro extraction tests really seeing

75
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:10,890
which counties are coming back

76
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:14,189
consistently clean and it's been very

77
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:16,108
eye-opening out there and over the next

78
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:18,150
couple of quarters we'll be rolling out

79
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:19,700
our first brand so that's exciting I'm

80
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,109
really targeting the medical space

81
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:25,589
wanting to stick to full-spectrum oils

82
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:27,599
and really ailments for patients yes sir

83
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,939
engines for patients and gelcaps as well

84
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,229
so really excited to get into the

85
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:34,469
packaged and branded space and

86
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:36,689
distribution and and access and activate

87
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:39,959
all of our retail accounts we also have

88
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:42,120
a bulk extraction manufacturing facility

89
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,430
over in Santa Rosa so we are working

90
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,950
with a lot of farmers with integrated

91
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,659
partnerships as we call them so you can

92
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:50,578
grow for a purpose and I can talk about

93
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:52,769
that a little bit later but there's a

94
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:54,659
lot of ways that we want to support all

95
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,359
the farmers out there and all the people

96
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:59,340
who have paved the way to where we can

97
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:05,879
can step out in the light and continue

98
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:07,829
to do what we love hi I'm Matthew

99
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:10,108
I'm with madrone we're based out of

100
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:13,199
Mendocino California where distributors

101
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:16,109
focused on bringing Triple A cannabis

102
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,699
directly to retailers and helping them

103
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:21,329
sell it and really helping them

104
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,680
supporting our farmers by again the best

105
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:25,168
price they can well at the same time

106
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:29,668
representing the ecosystem what is

107
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:31,769
Mendocino we've been we 60 clubs really

108
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:32,819
more focused and less than bulk even

109
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:35,519
though we've been doing more bulk and

110
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:37,469
now more focus on creating products and

111
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,939
working with manufacturers in creating

112
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,440
co-branded products and getting the name

113
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:43,779
out there but our end goal is

114
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:47,168
highlighting the high-grade from

115
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:49,929
we were based out of Fort Bragg main

116
00:04:47,168 --> 00:04:52,269
offices in Mendocino and we really we

117
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:54,939
really focus on doing everything we can

118
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:57,279
to represent the farmer at the retail

119
00:04:54,939 --> 00:04:59,259
level that's what we find that a lot of

120
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,549
la this game is is actually walking the

121
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:02,979
stores developing relationships with

122
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,780
retailers and then delivering

123
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:07,180
consistently and so that's something

124
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:09,459
we're focused on because we know that if

125
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:18,759
we can help farmers tie the supply chain

126
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:21,128
they only worry about farming my name is

so we do a lot of different varieties of

135
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:47,770
things right now we're doing Co packing

136
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:53,318

144
00:06:06,728 --> 00:06:10,389
white labeling it's tricky because I

145
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,370
have you got to use my employees you

146
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:14,079

150
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,949
figured out workarounds in this industry

151
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:25,750
that is able to adapt cuz you know we're

152

head out to market across California

168
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:12,490
that sounds really easy but that's a

169
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:14,949
whole complicated nightmare right there

170
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,379
there's nothing no doubt about that but

171
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:21,159
it's exciting like we're doing this

172
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:27,009
we're doing it together and let's get on

173
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:28,360
with the next question well as an

174
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:30,039
attorney that represents a ton of

175
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,770
farmers I've asked some local

176
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,600
distributors to kind of you know tell us

177
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:37,089
what services that they could provide to

178
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,220
the farmers what services they're hoping

179
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:40,779
to be able to provide in the future and

180
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,250
so I'm wondering if you guys can go

181
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:44,679
through I mean some of those services

182
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,120
that you know it came up in this list of

183
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,150
the different services that distributors

184
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,670
could provide and it's like 40 different

185
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:53,909
things that distros can do you know we

186
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:58,750
have this stuff that's regulatory

187
00:07:53,910 --> 00:08:00,640
mandated you know Quality Assurance you

188
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:03,180
know quarantined during testing

189
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,259
arrangement a testing arrangement

190
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,090
transportation required to be done by a

191
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:08,769
distributor can each of you guys tell us

192
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:12,250
like what are the services that you're

193
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:14,709
currently providing right now to farms

194
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:16,089
and manufacturers and what are the

195
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:19,060
services that you guys are hoping to

196
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:20,979
expand into in the future whether that's

197
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,120
the stuff that's mandated by regulation

198
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,040
or just some of the other cool stuff

199
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,110
that distributors can provide to the

200
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,280
service so if you guys don't mind going

201
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,520
back through each of you and Tony's

202
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,989
coming what'd you do on that list and if

203
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:34,629
I had service I would read the list but

204
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,340
I have no service and you know what you

205
00:08:34,629 --> 00:08:38,139
do in terms of what your services are

206
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,259
and what you hope to do in the future as

207
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:45,699
you expand and grow and build in this in

208
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:47,259
this market sure so you know right now

209
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,870
we just launched in January and we've

210
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:51,309
been really focused on procurement a lot

211
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:54,009
of our founders have a cultivation

212
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:55,779
background and then we also have you

213
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:58,360
know site on what's happening out in the

214
00:08:55,779 --> 00:09:00,610
retail market space too so in the

215
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,830
procurement process it's not necessarily

216
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:05,050
about just going to a farm and procuring

217
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:07,030
we are buying something anymore it is a

218
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:09,338
whole protocol associated with that

219
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:10,639
called quality control it's sorting

220
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:13,210
grading

221
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:16,460
sesang IPM integrated pest management

222
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:18,560
micro extractions and there's a whole

223
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,389
education process associated with that

224
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,729
so we've really focused on the

225
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:24,649
procurement we have a lot of cells that

226
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,690
we do for other distributors and brands

227
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:28,549
and the rest of the state and given our

228
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,560
background and location and our

229
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:33,109
connections of course and relationships

230
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:34,459
in the in the farming space that's where

231
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,620
we've started right now and have had a

232
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,389
lot of traction around that when I

233
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,360
noticed out there is the farmers are

234
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:43,549
really seeking that support it's it's

235
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,500
scary hearing that there's you know huge

236
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:46,969
farms happening in SoCal and big

237
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,820
commercial grows and everything's

238
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:51,980
automated and big out coming in so you

239
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,930
know being a support for small pioneers

240
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,330
as we call them or small growers and

241
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:59,870
Industry pioneers and really being able

242
00:09:56,330 --> 00:10:02,660
to help them grow for a purpose so right

243
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:04,700
now we're rolling out an integrated

244
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:06,620
partnership structure for farmers out

245
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,960
there who want to grow for a purpose

246
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:12,560
this is going to streamline not only our

247
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,720
sales but also our vendor sells so what

248
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,579
I mean by this is we have a lot of

249
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,590
brands that we work with and they need a

250
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:21,259
consistent supply of a certain genetic

251
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:22,790
or they there's extractors out there

252
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:24,769
that need a consistent supply of a

253
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,569
certain you know phenotype or

254
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:28,909
cannabinoid ratio within their

255
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:30,860
extraction process some farmers like to

256
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:32,209
grow four tops some farmers just want to

257
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,970
grow buck done trim straight for

258
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,889
extraction so being able to be a nexus

259
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,990
in the supply chain right now and really

260
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:41,439
help not only farmers but processing

261
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:44,029
clients and manufacturers and brands

262
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,530
Network and integrate their systems

263
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:47,240
together to where the farmers are

264
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:48,769
growing for a purpose and then all of

265
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,810
the people on the other side of the ply

266
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:53,120
chain have that consistency that's the

267
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:55,279
main complaint out there you know

268
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,289
whenever we have you know forty pound

269
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,209
batches 50-pound batches of the same

270
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:01,699
strain it's really challenging in the

271
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,840
market for a brand to take that on if

272
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,540
they don't know that they have another

273
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,820
batch coming through regularly

274
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:09,799
throughout the year so a big part of our

275
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:12,200
focus right now is streamlining these

276
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:14,599
efforts and having farmers grow for a

277
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,770
purpose and and connect them with you

278
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,180
know where they fit in a supply chain

279
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:21,199
and where they want to focus their

280
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:23,029
energy within cultivation that's what

281
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,090
we're focused on right now and then over

282
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:28,339
next year we we really want to focus on

283
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,780
our own in-house brands and there's a

284
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:32,210
few different ones that we want to roll

285
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:34,189
out one of them is called lifted legacy

286
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,650
and this is very much focused on the

287
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:38,330
legacy culture bringing back some of the

288
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:41,539
old strains that we all used to grow

289
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:43,400
back in the 90s and and on back and

290
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:46,429
really doing what we do best and having

291
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:48,500
that you know that consistent access for

292
00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:51,379
the retail market for the consumer

293
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,929
market and launching brands to support

294
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:55,759
that legacy culture as well so I'm

295
00:11:53,929 --> 00:11:57,949
looking forward to the to the branding

296
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,080
part and the creative part but right now

297
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:02,120
I think it's really important given that

298
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,180
the supply chain the new white market is

299
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,950
so new it's extremely chaotic a lot of

300
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:08,809
people are just figuring it out as you

301
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:11,810
guys all know there's a big lag time

302
00:12:08,809 --> 00:12:14,449
with the CDFA on cultivation licenses

303
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:16,459
that's really causing some issues but

304
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:19,070
it's also making the market prices go up

305
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,570
so that's good but I think that

306
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,030
everybody could really use support

307
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:25,220
within the Pioneer industry and if we

308
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:27,529
stick together and really streamline our

309
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,960
efforts and our intentions for the year

310
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:35,539
we can really sustain this way of life

311
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:38,060
that we love so much so for us it really

312
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:40,219
started with three years ago we saw

313
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:42,169
testing being necessary and so we

314
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,060
started pushing for phase 2 testing and

315
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:45,649
face 3 testing with our farmers way

316
00:12:44,059 --> 00:12:47,629
before so we could catch any problems

317
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:48,919
then to become compliance helping and

318
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:51,110
then helping them with licensing and

319
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:52,429
that's evolved and everyone knows what

320
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,320
the issues happening that way now and

321
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:56,029
now because these are partners that

322
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,290
we've worked with for five years it's

323
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:59,240
now getting them ready for track and

324
00:12:57,289 --> 00:13:01,399
trace and these are all things I just

325
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,980
fundamentally need to be done for them

326
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,959
to flow and for them to be able to to

327
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,120
have the velocity we want them to do but

328
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,100
I'll focus as Madone and my focus is

329
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,029
when I saw the drone before I saw them

330
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,529
doing I was working for corporate

331
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:14,029
cannabis company who just didn't

332
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:15,319
understand the value of farmers and the

333
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:17,449
reason I joined the drone and helped

334
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,160
help build what we're building is

335
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:21,140
because at the end the day I feel like

336
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:23,059
grading is everything I feel like when

337
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:24,439
you work with a farmer and you can pick

338
00:13:23,059 --> 00:13:26,539
up the whole product and get them to

339
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,790
maximize the amount for every piece of

340
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:30,379
it that's when you've helped the farmer

341
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:32,389
continue what they're doing and that's

342
00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:34,789
been our focus I focuses grading and

343
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:36,799
then velocity we saw that with like the

344
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:37,849
pot that everyone you just the triple-a

345
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,698
and now welcome to more and more

346
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,860
partners to grade and then peace out to

347
00:13:40,698 --> 00:13:44,688
where needs to go because like as you

348
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,699
say Kent that this is an ecosystem and

349
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:48,860
people specialize in focus in certain

350
00:13:46,698 --> 00:13:50,479
things and there's not enough people

351
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,428
focus on getting the farmers to maximize

352
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,449
the mound for the coop and I think

353
00:13:52,428 --> 00:13:55,100
that's something that we've been

354
00:13:53,448 --> 00:13:58,998
building and focusing on since the

355
00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:02,329
beginning oh yeah we are we partnered

356
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:04,639
with distribution up in Mendocino really

357
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:06,138
I mean we took it over and who just

358
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,970
really they just would do nothing with

359
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:11,139
it and we saw it as a need and a way to

360
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,139
grow and build

361
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,889
you
