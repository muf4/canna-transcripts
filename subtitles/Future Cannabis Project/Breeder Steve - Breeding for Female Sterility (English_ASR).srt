1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,650
to think the way I think of it as I've

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:07,169
got this huge palette of colors to work

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:12,300
from then it's the best palette of

4
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:16,259
colors and I can draw on that to make

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:19,380
any shade of anything when I do I don't

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,609
feel limited to just pursuing two or

7
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:26,399
three paths I really like to keep the

8
00:00:22,609 --> 00:00:29,039
keep the door wide open to what what is

9
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,778
required and what people want and I

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,270
think from a production point of view

11
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:36,570
what people are going to want is going

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:39,149
to be sterile versions of those plants

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,250
so once you've got the plants you want

14
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,950
then you want to work on making sterile

15
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,469
versions of them because the sterile

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,140
plants won't take seed so if you want to

17
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,120
grow a field with no seeds in it even if

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,520
the neighbors have hemp all around you

19
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:57,558
need to have sterile plants so that's

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,210
going to be the real one of the notable

21
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:02,280
features of the current cannabis

22
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:07,260
genetics Renaissance are seeing there's

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:10,049
so many more people involved in cannabis

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,270
genetics research now than ever was on a

25
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,900
more professional level than there ever

26
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:18,599
was more academic level let's say you're

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,540
gonna see a lot of advances from plants

28
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:23,399
you don't need the trim the plants that

29
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,909
can't be seated in plants that mites

30
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,960
bony plants that are very very resistant

31
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:33,000
to different fungal issues it's I think

32
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,798
we're gonna see an enormous leap in

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,599
cannabis genetics it's just in the next

34
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,700
five years like there's gonna be more

35
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:42,169
happening in cannabis genetics in the

36
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:46,740
last five years than has ever happened

37
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:49,140
you were talking sterile before right

38
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:52,319
the sterile plants that I'm referring to

39
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:56,340
that I've seen and that I'm endeavouring

40
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:58,889
to reliably produce they right now I'm

41
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,409
only about 50% success rate but I need

42
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,769
him to be at a hundred but those plants

43
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:07,950
have no pistols they're female plants

44
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:11,038
with no pistols so you can smother them

45
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:13,050
in Poland say name their barren

46
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,469
basically they're barren

47
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,630
won't be they cannot get pregnant yes so

48
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:22,139
so is this something is this something

49
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:24,539
new or has this been ER I've seen is

50
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:27,059
there word for that first time I saw it

51
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:29,969
it was in well the sterile females is

52
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,969
essentially apathy there's different

53
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:38,550
routes to it I found and the first plant

54
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:41,909
I found were in 96 and there's hormonal

55
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:47,820
ways of inducing this and some people

56
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:53,939
aim for polyploidy mutagens others go

57
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:56,310
for mono points I think the mono Koide

58
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:58,919
is the way to go there's also the

59
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:02,759
possibility of doing if I gene editing

60
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:05,369
but I'm not as happy about that it's the

61
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:07,439
problem I find with gene editing that

62
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:13,319
scares me about it is that there's been

63
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:17,459
instances of the bacteria used to cut

64
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:20,639
the chromosome is it ends up

65
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:24,659
occasionally inserting its own genes

66
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:27,509
into the organism so you end up with a

67
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:30,629
transgenic plant even if you didn't mean

68
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:32,579
to because maybe you you know you think

69
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:36,090
gene editing oh it sounds nice and clean

70
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,190
but it's not as it's not as clean as it

71
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,469
could be yet and it's filling its

72
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:43,050
infancy I thought but let's say there

73
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:45,509
was a gene for hermaphrodite amande you

74
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,730
had a great plant you loved that plant

75
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:50,069
but it threw some bananas at the end

76
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:52,409
every time and you're like I can't keep

77
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,939
this plant cuz I hate Hermes I can but I

78
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:55,650
don't want to lose it because it's the

79
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:59,669
only one I've got that tastes like

80
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,539
whatever so you say if only I could get

81
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:05,119
in there and just remove the

82
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:08,609
hermaphroditic tree that would be great

83
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:13,200
but if in doing so you introduce a

84
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:16,199
foreign gene then you may regret it

85
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:19,259
another ways down the road so for me the

86
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,978
jury's out on it in a way and I wouldn't

87
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:25,168
I'm all about learning from these

88
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:26,459
techniques but I would be really loath

89
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:29,639
to release and

90
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:32,698
thing done that way without knowing a

91
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:35,069
lot more about it because I'm not

92
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,348
convinced it's already for release but

93
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:40,590
I'm totally convinced it needs to be

94
00:04:37,348 --> 00:04:43,139
studied you know the concept here is

95
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:44,969
basically sterile females and then you

96
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,180
could plant a field full of sterile

97
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:52,110
females and never have to worry about

98
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:54,720
the hemp farmer down the street in

99
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,000
pregnant you know Kay the fox in the hen

100
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,860
house coming in and pregnant it but but

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,079
your old plants you put them out they

102
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,080
can not make us and they're incredible

103
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:10,288
but what you're saying is that we don't

104
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:12,598
know you know it's like every

105
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:16,288
pharmaceutical drug commercial like this

106
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:18,829
will this will solve problem a but

107
00:05:16,288 --> 00:05:23,129
you'll have anal leakage and you'll die

108
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:26,310
no no this this is a I was only talking

109
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:29,969
about that in reference to gene editing

110
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:34,800
as a pathway the other ways of doing it

111
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:37,740
through mutagenic readings really is not

112
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,280
gonna have any risk of transgenics

113
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,519
there's nothing about that the the other

114
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:46,198
the hormonal II induced ones the other

115
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,089
way of doing them there's not harm only

116
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,370
inducement and does bring you back to

117
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:52,348
the tissue culture angle is pollen

118
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,870
culture some people do it as ant ant

119
00:05:52,348 --> 00:05:57,930
their culture but you could take a

120
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:00,240
single grain of pollen they come I mean

121
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,038
think how much grains of pollen you'd

122
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,110
have in one gram of Poland it's

123
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:07,699
mind-boggling if you think of those

124
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:11,550
grains of pollen as a haploid seed and

125
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:14,848
you raised that grain of pollen in its

126
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:17,009
own test tube into a Kahless and from

127
00:06:14,848 --> 00:06:20,728
the Kahless you initiate grain growth

128
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:22,740
and start a new plant that plant is a

129
00:06:20,728 --> 00:06:26,490
haploid it doesn't have a mother and

130
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:28,740
father is only the father so it's a

131
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,168
haploid the cannabis is typically

132
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,019
diploid so it's got two sets of

133
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:36,689
chromosomes and one from the mother one

134
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:38,159
from the father same as you and I are we

135
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:41,939
talking somatic and

136
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:45,480
Genisys well yes somatic embryogenesis

137
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:49,019
is a Kahless culture that is Kahless

138
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:52,800
culture but growing you can do careless

139
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:54,930
culture from somatic embryogenesis is

140
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,319
when you do Kahless culture and you

141
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:02,280
encapsulate it first synthetic c so

142
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:05,159
that's the somatic part that you want it

143
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,469
sleeping so you're taking you're making

144
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,170
tissue culture dormant for a little bit

145
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,420
thinks and encapsulating it is somatic

146
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:15,390
embryogenesis but that starts as Kahless

147
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:19,020
culture typically but Kahless culture is

148
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:22,079
usually a Kahless is an adventitious

149
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:24,959
root so when you look at the bottom of

150
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:27,149
your trunk right above the soil line

151
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,430
there'll be some little white bumps on

152
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:31,349
the bark and if you buried them they

153
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,410
would grow into roots so those little

154
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:37,680
bumps are called adventitious roots also

155
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:39,689
known as Kahless so if you sanitize the

156
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,780
surface of that and took a razor and

157
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:46,199
nicked off some Kahless you could

158
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:48,509
propagate at a cellular level and raise

159
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:51,599
up you know you could put those Kahless

160
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:54,839
in a blender and make it into a million

161
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:59,460
little kala cells and grow them in a

162
00:07:54,839 --> 00:08:01,409
suspension culture and then as they get

163
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:03,299
to a size where you want them to have

164
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,500
some great because it's very easy to

165
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,720
have been throwing in the white the

166
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,060
trick is to get them and different for

167
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,070
every variety but to get them to

168
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,079
initiate the green growth and you

169
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:15,089
typically would do that by changing the

170
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:19,529
spectrum of the lighting over your

171
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:24,049
bioreactor and hormonal initiation so

172
00:08:19,529 --> 00:08:27,269
the once you've got those little

173
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:29,879
artificial seeds in suspension you could

174
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:31,769
start encapsulating them but that has

175
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:36,029
nothing to do with the sterile females

176
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:40,019
other than the Kahless culture could be

177
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:41,668
initiated from if you're doing it just

178
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:43,799
from a mother you're just making

179
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:45,929
cuttings of that mother but if you're

180
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,539
doing it from my single grain of pollen

181
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:51,179
you've got you're doing it from a plant

182
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:51,500
you've never seen yet you know and when

183
00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:53,959
you

184
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:58,580
throw that plant out from a single grain

185
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:01,070
of pollen not a lot of people are doing

186
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,379
that I know I think I know two other

187
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,930
groups actually doing pollen culture

188
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:09,950
right now and this is something that

189
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:11,509
you're researching yep this is something

190
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:15,320
we're playing with that I have because

191
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:18,970
because I think and I really want and

192
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,920
we're working on the financing in-house

193
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:24,170
testing because right now for sequencing

194
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,059
I have to send it out so we can prepare

195
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:28,159
the samples but we would send it out for

196
00:09:26,059 --> 00:09:30,799
sequencing but it's quite expensive and

197
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:34,000
especially when you want a sample high

198
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:37,849
volume so let's say I want a sample a

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,509
million grains of pollen you look for a

200
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:43,610
specific trait you know that's a bit

201
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:47,120
cost prohibitive sending that out of

202
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:49,580
1,500 bucks a pop for a sample right so

203
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,649
if you can get high-volume sample the

204
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,230
equipment which is very expensive but if

205
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:56,899
you can get that and run it in-house and

206
00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:01,070
keep it busy then it makes sense so

207
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:02,870
sifting through and weeding out plants

208
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:05,629
even from seedlings right if you've got

209
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:07,490
a million seedlings started you can take

210
00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:09,350
a little punch out of the second or

211
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:13,759
third leaf that's growing from each one

212
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:16,100
and you could say okay you know whatever

213
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:18,110
trait you're looking for if it was

214
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,360
purple or green or sterile and

215
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,519
non-sterile you could separate those

216
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,950
plants out you know male female or

217
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:28,129
hermaphrodite you can separate those

218
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,870
plants out at a very young age and and

219
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:33,259
if you're looking for one that's a the

220
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:37,100
highest and CBD v which one if you have

221
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:39,500
a known marker for CBD v then you're

222
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,690
saying which ones have the the best

223
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,089
concentration of that marker you know

224
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:47,510
which ones are really gonna push the CBD

225
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:50,690
v so you can start once you can start

226
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:52,929
isolating your selections you know

227
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:55,700
through lab assisted selective breeding

228
00:10:52,929 --> 00:11:00,909
even without doing any transgenic

229
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:04,310
madness you can have some really stellar

230
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:05,328
information quickly from large batches

231
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:08,149
and that's the

232
00:11:05,328 --> 00:11:10,789
you so much time you know you still want

233
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:13,100
to take the contenders and finish them

234
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:16,068
off and see them in in under real

235
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,920
conditions but just being able to thin

236
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:22,188
the herd out by looking under the hood

237
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:24,588
that's a huge advantage because those

238
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:26,629
pollen grains are gonna make a haploid

239
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:28,790
plant which has a single chromosome

240
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:31,188
rather than you and I have

241
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:33,259
we're diploid x' because we have one

242
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:35,629
strand from our mother and what strand

243
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:37,818
from our father whereas that one only

244
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:40,069
has the screen from the father never met

245
00:11:37,818 --> 00:11:40,998
the mother and we went ahead and took it

246
00:11:40,068 --> 00:11:45,919
to the next level

247
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:49,220
so so starting with haploids you can use

248
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:51,528
that and cross it to itself later and

249
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:57,048
make a double half lloyd and it's got

250
00:11:51,528 --> 00:11:59,058
the identical two strings of genes so

251
00:11:57,048 --> 00:12:01,220
there's different pathways you'll see

252
00:11:59,058 --> 00:12:03,469
people using to get to the sterile

253
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,079
females but important thing to remember

254
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:09,649
which I was about to touch on earlier

255
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:13,039
but we switched here somehow but there's

256
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:16,610
two types of sterile females and in the

257
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:19,818
world we see part on the carpet which is

258
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:22,459
the virgin fruit which is the only way

259
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:25,488
I'm interested in that will not take the

260
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:28,368
pollen and then you have steno carpet

261
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:30,079
plants and that has little aborted seeds

262
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:32,239
in it and that's useless for us so

263
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,308
that's like the seedless watermelon

264
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:36,350
seedless grapes and you get those little

265
00:12:34,308 --> 00:12:39,168
white tips in them and stuff but they

266
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:41,569
don't develop a finish seed but nobody

267
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:44,028
wants thud that's all polluted with

268
00:12:41,568 --> 00:12:45,828
little white seeds right so it's not

269
00:12:44,028 --> 00:12:48,619
good enough that they abort them later

270
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:50,359
which is Stena Karthi we don't want them

271
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:55,278
to make them in the first place that's

272
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:57,168
part of the curtain and that's the the

273
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,869
big dividing line I've seen a lot of

274
00:12:57,168 --> 00:13:04,399
breeders fail to make sterile females

275
00:12:59,869 --> 00:13:07,629
using polyploid and polyploid czar how

276
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:11,480
stand the carpet plants are made are

277
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:15,860
people using these procedures in in this

278
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:18,420
in the stator or how humans live I've

279
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:21,899
seen one American and

280
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:27,839
in Spain and then us in Colombia so

281
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:31,350
there's it would be the the cost of

282
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,629
doing this the lab cost I don't think so

283
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:36,060
if there's a straight-up sterile females

284
00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:38,220
you don't have to spend you know

285
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:39,989
millions of dollars the first time I saw

286
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,720
it was in 96 and it was out of

287
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:44,669
somebody's basement I mean you could

288
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,040
make it was like you know when the first

289
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:49,409
sterile females came out is when people

290
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:51,719
started trying to make feminized Heat

291
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:54,149
and it was before anybody was using

292
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:58,440
silver even people were using other

293
00:13:54,149 --> 00:14:01,620
hormones they'd be a chocolate and it's

294
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:06,390
basically just a freaky little what's

295
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:09,360
the form factor like if people can

296
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:11,970
create sterile females and you could

297
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,220
plant a whole field of it is the form

298
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,950
factor like could you create seeds where

299
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,470
if I popped those seeds every female is

300
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:22,050
sterile or is it tissue culture or do

301
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:24,000
you have to have one mom that's what

302
00:14:22,049 --> 00:14:26,159
we're working on now the best I've done

303
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,370
is 50% so I'd get a hundred percent

304
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:32,759
female seeds and only half of them had

305
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:36,149
pistols but I want to release those with

306
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:39,480
a hundred percent without crystals so

307
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:41,909
you can you can make a selection right

308
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,580
now without with only get it in half

309
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:46,829
Attis turtles you can make a selection

310
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,610
and propagate those and vision culture

311
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:54,600
but ideally I would like to be able to

312
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:57,090
make the seed 200% that sterile so that

313
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,279
they can just go straight into the field

314
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:02,790
without having to be propagated any way

315
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:06,600
shape or form they have recently brought

316
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:08,399
up an American friend that has a lot

317
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,389
more explaining to me in molecular

318
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:15,449
genetics and he was growing spice in the

319
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:17,970
92 early 2000s he came to visit the

320
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:21,300
beads which one he's a longtime spice

321
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:25,460
fans by issuer he was growing aquaponic

322
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:28,859
sweet tooth in like 2000 and now he's

323
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:31,560
spent the last 20 years getting degrees

324
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:35,818
and studying molecular genetics

325
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:38,849
he said hey I want to do a PhD on

326
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:41,458
cannabis if your company kids collection

327
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:44,730
yet you bet with you guys we were able

328
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:47,969
to bring in it so it's really fun to

329
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:50,249
build the teams so with him specifically

330
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:53,069
what what kind of problem what kind of

331
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:57,480
tasks problems do you want to task him

332
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:59,929
with solving light light like what

333
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:08,360
what's what's what's his first project

334
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:08,359
find us powdery mildew resistant genes

335
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:18,269
but also the sterile females is me I

336
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:20,938
said that's really got to be a strong

337
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:23,188
focus on each of the pathways doing it

338
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:25,558
to chart them and what's good and bad

339
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:28,259
about each of the pathways we found to

340
00:16:25,558 --> 00:16:30,958
which doing that the photo resistance

341
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:35,058
goes understand that's really deals to

342
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:38,878
watch but as far as like I like send out

343
00:16:35,058 --> 00:16:41,789
prepared samples to be sequenced I can't

344
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:44,699
read the information that comes back so

345
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:47,120
I require genetics interpreter that

346
00:16:44,698 --> 00:16:49,919
knows how to look at a sequencing

347
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,409
analysis and say okay here's what you're

348
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:56,188
looking at and it explained it and they

349
00:16:52,409 --> 00:16:59,068
can decipher that so he's pretty gifted

350
00:16:56,188 --> 00:17:02,129
at that sort of thing and he showed me a

351
00:16:59,068 --> 00:17:05,129
lot of the work he's done has been in

352
00:17:02,129 --> 00:17:07,409
tracking specific markers and lettuce

353
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:12,630
and he would attach a glow-in-the-dark

354
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:14,819
gene the thing he's looking for and then

355
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,679
it would make a very obvious because all

356
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:19,648
the lettuce fruits that had it good in

357
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,329
the dark so I mean that's transgenic

358
00:17:19,648 --> 00:17:22,918
lettuce but you know we don't

359
00:17:21,328 --> 00:17:26,099
necessarily want to eat that let us

360
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:28,620
first book it but to be able to work

361
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:30,990
under the hood like that not just to

362
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:33,239
look under the hood is an asset I don't

363
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:36,720
necessarily want of making transgenic

364
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:41,130
animals but I wanted them to be able to

365
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:44,480
help me identify and track markers for

366
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,480
the development of trades
