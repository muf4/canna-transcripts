[Music]

2
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:30,899
we're going to talk about something that

3
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,058
has been very here and dear to me my

4
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:36,448
entire career which is employee benefit

5
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:40,250
and you know the benefits arena has

6
00:00:36,448 --> 00:00:46,649
changed dramatically over the last five

7
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:52,378
years with the ACA and or Obamacare and

8
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:54,509
you know the employers getting fined for

9
00:00:52,378 --> 00:00:58,049
not having employee benefits just

10
00:00:54,509 --> 00:01:00,329
basically Cory's gonna talk about you

11
00:00:58,049 --> 00:01:02,069
know what what you need to do for your

12
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:03,808
employees what you can do for your

13
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,280
employees what options you have out

14
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:07,349
there and I'm really excited because

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,859
I've worked with Bolton for many many

16
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:12,868
many years so Cory if you will enlighten

17
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:14,219
us I'd appreciate him I have been

18
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:15,929
working in the cannabis industry for

19
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:19,679
about two years now but the insurance

20
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:21,478
industry for about seven years and one

21
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:23,879
of the biggest things that I see is in

22
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,429
the employment benefits and retention of

23
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,489
employees and especially in the retail

24
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,939
venture to speak to is there's a lot of

25
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:34,949
turnover and one of those areas is not

26
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:37,469
offering employee benefits and not

27
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,600
taking care of those employees and they

28
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:41,759
are your most valuable asset that that

29
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,009
need that taking care of especially here

30
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,618
with the Affordable Care Act it's

31
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,629
something that needs to be offered and

32
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:52,680
there's a couple handouts going around

33
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:54,688
that we have described what those

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,659
employee benefits are when it comes to

35
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,908
penalties and so on anything under 100

36
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,640
employees in city california's consider

37
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,140
small group so you're basically rated

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,420
based off of your age in their zip code

39
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,969
anything above 100 employees to get

40
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,489
composite rating and much better rates

41
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:14,430
and sometimes much better benefits so

42
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:17,519
one thing that we have done is partnered

43
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,500
with Oaksterdam University that has an

44
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,700
association called Oaksterdam Business

45
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,860
Association that has created a

46
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:26,750
composite rating for small group

47
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,660
employers to give them access to large

48
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:32,629
group health benefits and rates and just

49
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:34,729
to give you an example is most small

50
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:37,250
group benefits as its rated based off of

51
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:39,439
age if you were paying and this is an

52
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,650
example full disclaimer if you're paying

53
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:44,959
let's say $400 a month for this employee

54
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:48,590
in a small group and a large group it

55
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,449
may be 189 or $200 which is a big

56
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,330
savings for small businesses out there

57
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:54,799
so it's definitely important to learn

58
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:58,719
and understand what the employee

59
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,719
benefits are and what's available to us

60
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:06,289
and when you're looking at getting

61
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,349
benefits for your staff it is an amazing

62
00:03:06,289 --> 00:03:12,109
retention tool but it is a cost to the

63
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:14,899
company and so it's really a great idea

64
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:17,629
to speak with somebody like Cory that

65
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,719
can really help you understand you know

66
00:03:17,628 --> 00:03:22,969
how you can structure it so that maybe

67
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:25,189
it's not so you know damaging to the

68
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:26,900
company finances or if you're doing

69
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:28,878
really really well like I know all of

70
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,920
you are doing and maybe you could be a

71
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,289
little bit more giving you know to your

72
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,179
staff which trust me they appreciate a

73
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:37,519
lot of people out there even with the

74
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,469
ACA they don't have benefits they can't

75
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,810
afford it

76
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:44,479
California care it's very expensive if

77
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:47,239
you're really young and really healthy

78
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:50,568
you get great rates but the older you

79
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:53,810
get the more you have to pay it's just

80
00:03:50,568 --> 00:03:56,149
it's an unfortunate truth so talking to

81
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,519
a broker somebody like Cory is so

82
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,039
invaluable even if you're just thinking

83
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:03,019
about it you know go into your thought

84
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:06,078
process with with some really good

85
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:09,319
information behind you and so now we can

86
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,180
talk about sure we can talk about going

87
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:14,448
into a retail and bringing it all

88
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,939
together right now we're kind of on the

89
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:18,709
smaller end of not doing that 100

90
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:20,899
employees but it's still really

91
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:23,870
important to be thinking like he

92
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:25,728
mentioned in terms turnover that as

93
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,370
you're bringing people into this

94
00:04:25,728 --> 00:04:29,839
industry what's gonna keep them here

95
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,269
what's gonna keep them growing what's

96
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,848
gonna turn them into tomorrow's leaders

97
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:36,228
right instead of turning them frustrated

98
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:39,589
right away we're running out the door

99
00:04:36,228 --> 00:04:43,339
because it's crazy right

100
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:45,408
but it's some businesses mate might not

101
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:47,179
feel ready yet for things like health

102
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:49,219
benefits but there's also some other

103
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,250
creative benefits that you can move

104
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,800
towards to start getting yourself there

105
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,120
as as you budget for

106
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,329
a little bit more stability for

107
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,399
employees we have partnered with an HR

108
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:03,098
company that offers things like employee

109
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,049
assistance programs so maybe that's not

110
00:05:03,098 --> 00:05:07,329
full on health benefits but if you have

111
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:09,668
somebody dealing with a specific issue

112
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:12,758
they can reach out and get some support

113
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:15,008
so there are benefits like that

114
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:17,379
mentioned or even things like flex time

115
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:20,259
with your scheduling or paid time off

116
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:22,330
that can't show your staff that you do

117
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:24,939
appreciate that they're here for you and

118
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:27,008
that you're here for them as well so

119
00:05:24,939 --> 00:05:28,779
even if you feel as though your business

120
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:30,848
that's maybe not ready to start

121
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:33,098
investing in things like health

122
00:05:30,848 --> 00:05:34,718
insurance vision dental all that good

123
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:36,878
stuff there's definitely some creative

124
00:05:34,718 --> 00:05:40,199
solutions that you can make your company

125
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:42,968
more competitive to bring people to your

126
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:46,389
place and working their talents for you

127
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:48,459
and somebody you would touch a little

128
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:52,120
bit in the last panel about this

129
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:54,459
transition from the great market if you

130
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,209
will to the new legal market and I think

131
00:05:54,459 --> 00:06:00,568
that this is a really important place to

132
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:03,549
have some of these conversations because

133
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:05,080
what we were doing before again I don't

134
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,699
think people were intentionally doing

135
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:08,949
things wrong they just maybe didn't have

136
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,788
to do things a certain way but now that

137
00:06:08,949 --> 00:06:12,250
you guys are reading through the

138
00:06:09,788 --> 00:06:15,639
regulations we see that labor law

139
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,680
violations are serious violations so

140
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,449
getting to know your labor codes and

141
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,069
doing all that is something that's

142
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:24,520
really important now that maybe it was

143
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:26,669
easy to gloss over before so I think as

144
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:29,049
a retailer manufacturer whoever you are

145
00:06:26,668 --> 00:06:30,848
to stop looking at yourself is a

146
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,098
cannabis business that applies to

147
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:34,538
cannabis rules and start imagining what

148
00:06:33,098 --> 00:06:36,370
it would be like if you were selling or

149
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:39,490
manufacturing you're totally normal

150
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:42,158
products know what what kinds of things

151
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:44,259
as a retailer would you have to abide by

152
00:06:42,158 --> 00:06:46,360
and instead of going to cannabis

153
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:48,129
regulations you'd be going to the labor

154
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,110
code to the business and Professions

155
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:52,810
Code so looking to these places and

156
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,060
pretending like we're any other industry

157
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:57,040
is a really great place to start what do

158
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,668
you see as far as the day-to-day

159
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,710
challenges in the industry sure so the

160
00:07:00,668 --> 00:07:04,509
challenge is twofold in this transition

161
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:07,239
right we have employers who have done

162
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:11,759
things a certain way for a long time who

163
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:14,949
are maybe afraid to change procedure and

164
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,300
this is a good strategy in some ways

165
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:18,579
because you know when you're constantly

166
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:21,040
changing policies that's bad for

167
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:23,409
employee morale and right now we kind of

168
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,479
have these what's what's the law what's

169
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:27,520
not in cannabis well the good thing

170
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:29,219
about HR is there's not a whole lot of

171
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,009
questions about what the law is

172
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:35,380
California labor laws are easy to find

173
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:38,500
so figuring out what that is allows you

174
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:40,029
to to be compliant in that way almost

175
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,189
right away these are things that are not

176
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:44,228
going to change in another two months

177
00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:46,120
so there's sometimes resistance from

178
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:47,680
employers in that way well hey I've

179
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,180
always paid people cash at the end of

180
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,780
the day so I just want to stay doing

181
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,978
that before you know things change again

182
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:57,009
well that's not something that's gonna

183
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:59,529
change in 2019 we're still gonna have to

184
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:02,050
abide by the labor laws so I think that

185
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:04,839
that's really important we do often see

186
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,100
it resistance from employees to certain

187
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:09,009
people who are coming to the industry

188
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:11,490
before wanted benefits if you will like

189
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:13,990
not having a show up to work on time or

190
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,090
being able to be medicated all the time

191
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:19,120
getting paid cash at the end of the day

192
00:08:16,089 --> 00:08:21,339
so those were some people consider those

193
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,750
things benefits and the transition to

194
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:25,269
know you're gonna get direct deposit

195
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,990
every two weeks and I'm gonna take out

196
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:32,019
your taxes and pay my payroll taxes

197
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:33,940
these are difficult transitions and for

198
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:35,679
me I keep coming up with transitional

199
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,530
strategies right so for both my

200
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,088
employers and my employees this might

201
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:41,769
not be what it is forever but this is

202
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:44,080
what we're gonna try now to get to a

203
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:46,329
more compliant place so taking those

204
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,209
baby steps is a lot easier for people

205
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:51,420
than recreating your entire business

206
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:55,528
model overnight I have

207
00:08:51,419 --> 00:08:59,399
personal knowledge of a cannabis broker

208
00:08:55,528 --> 00:09:02,789
who buries his money in his backyard I

209
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:05,250
don't know if he does it today but I

210
00:09:02,789 --> 00:09:06,719
know that if he ever moves I know where

211
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,750
I'm gonna start digging because it's a

212
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,730
lot of money but I know that that's how

213
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,289
people were keeping their money because

214
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,389
they couldn't put it in the bank they

215
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:18,120
couldn't do anything traditional with it

216
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:19,320
and so now the thought of paying taxes

217
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,389
on that money that's gotta be

218
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,149
mind-blowing because you got that free

219
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:27,180
and clear but now you you're you're

220
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:30,600
legal you're in the system so you know

221
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:32,909
we we have to pay taxes all of us do you

222
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,620
know I I don't like it either but you

223
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:38,129
know you just have to help everybody

224
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:40,500
make that transition and I think we can

225
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:43,289
help you and you know you may have

226
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,480
questions and you may get really really

227
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:47,250
angry it to babies because it's the way

228
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,659
you've always done it and nobody should

229
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:52,230
be able to tell you how to run your

230
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:59,028
business and I gotta say sorry Uncle Sam

231
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:59,028
he tells us how to run our business I

232
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:07,018
briefly touched on it so it is as I

233
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:09,689
mentioned a health insurance platform so

234
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:12,629
you get employee benefits medical dental

235
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,329
life vision long term disability short

236
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:18,149
term disability and a few other benefits

237
00:10:14,328 --> 00:10:20,309
that is for the employees of small

238
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:22,889
businesses and what that does is it

239
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:26,219
gives small businesses the opportunity

240
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:28,078
to offer health benefits but they are

241
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,360
large group health benefits so it's like

242
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:32,009
if you have 2,000 employees you're

243
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,028
getting benefits as if you have 2,000

244
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:35,578
employees even though you may only have

245
00:10:33,028 --> 00:10:40,588
10 employees so the very broad benefits

246
00:10:35,578 --> 00:10:42,269
and they are affordable as well so right

247
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:46,620
now what we're working on Patrick back

248
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:48,269
here he is working with me on this we

249
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,818
would collect information on the

250
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:51,950
employer and the employees and we will

251
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:54,439
submit to the healthcare

252
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:58,009
and look at rates and it should be going

253
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:00,920
live November first so there's a couple

254
00:10:58,009 --> 00:11:03,200
handouts one is on health care but also

255
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:05,599
one is on coverages that are very

256
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,149
important for the cannabis industry and

257
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,399
there's a lot of manufacturers

258
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:12,049
distributors growers etc and how to

259
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,230
protect that product and protect your

260
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:17,269
assets in some of those handouts my

261
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,980
contact information is on there and it

262
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:21,230
just kind of gives you some descriptions

263
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,420
on what those coverages are and why

264
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:24,139
they're important so take a look at

265
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:27,319
those because I know

266
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:29,440
LA County in itself is requiring certain

267
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,028
coverages to be able to get the license

268
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,800
so just just look at that and be aware

269
00:11:32,028 --> 00:11:36,669
of that before going in to apply for

270
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,669
those licenses

271
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:50,059
regulations wire

272
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:59,279
but as a retailer I've noticed one of

273
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:02,909
your strongest strengths for good morale

274
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,879
and efficiency is to have very accurate

275
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:08,429
job descriptions so instead of having

276
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,720
people who fit you know oh hi you're my

277
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:11,519
employee and you're gonna do all of

278
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,980
these things for me it's actually a

279
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,139
little bit easier to have an

280
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:20,250
organizational structure that supports

281
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:22,409
this is your role and your expertise and

282
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:25,409
and to fit people into that and to grow

283
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:27,089
out those places now I understand that

284
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:29,699
not everybody is necessarily ready for

285
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:32,759
that so I'll move on to you guys first

286
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,920
more maybe legal advice but just in

287
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:37,439
general I feel like I've seen people

288
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:40,529
thrive a lot more when they have when

289
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,480
the expectations are very clear about

290
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:45,209
what they're supposed to be for

291
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,220
multi-state employees and I'm gonna just

292
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:51,509
address this from a payroll point of

293
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:53,580
view when you're paying your folks in

294
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:56,399
different states you have to abide by

295
00:12:53,580 --> 00:13:01,950
those payroll laws within that state so

296
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:06,409
if cannabis was not legal in another

297
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:08,930
state I'm not sure how that would work

298
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:13,789
as far as

299
00:13:08,929 --> 00:13:15,739
I'm sure it would be fine no no no no no

300
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:17,448
your life in 70 if you're a licensed

301
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,039
entity that you you have a life in the

302
00:13:17,448 --> 00:13:20,929
next state but it's it's fair you could

303
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:24,019
have a entity that serves another

304
00:13:20,929 --> 00:13:26,599
purpose for your corporate structure and

305
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:28,490
potentially is not analyzing state so

306
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,990
okay you can have a Salas important

307
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:34,698
sales rep that lives in I some other

308
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:37,818
state that's not like George's Georgia

309
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:39,979
and and so they when you release their

310
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:43,698
checks you release them based on

311
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:49,249
Georgia's taxes and you have to fall

312
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:53,118
under Georgia's legal like employee laws

313
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:55,909
but even though that they they probably

314
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:57,350
work in multi states so I don't know if

315
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:59,629
that would be a huge issue at this point

316
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:03,619
in time but it's something to remember

317
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:04,789
and consider Cordia every corporate

318
00:14:03,619 --> 00:14:07,399
strategy you'd like to share with us

319
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:10,039
perhaps we have a license energy in

320
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:14,808
Nevada and in California and then we

321
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:16,188
have a call center in Michigan so the

322
00:14:14,808 --> 00:14:18,740
way we did on the insurance standpoint

323
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:20,269
on the risk management is we different

324
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,058
state we'd write a different policy from

325
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:25,428
each state just because crossing state

326
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:26,688
lines obviously can't do that and a lot

327
00:14:25,428 --> 00:14:29,240
of other things within the insurance

328
00:14:26,688 --> 00:14:29,948
side that's what we would do but keep in

329
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,448
mind

330
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:35,019
aside from that on the health insurance

331
00:14:32,448 --> 00:14:37,370
side if you have over 50 employees

332
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:40,938
whether you're local or you're

333
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:42,409
multi-state you are subject to the

334
00:14:40,938 --> 00:14:44,480
Affordable Care Act and the penalties

335
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:46,759
that they have as well so I can't tell

336
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,289
you how many cannabis accounts that are

337
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:50,509
being acquired or all over the place

338
00:14:48,289 --> 00:14:52,248
that may have 100 employees and they

339
00:14:50,509 --> 00:14:53,778
don't offer employee benefits it could

340
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:55,389
literally the business overnight

341
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:57,669
if if there was an issue

342
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:59,379
in the state of California is there a

343
00:14:57,669 --> 00:15:01,389
threshold the never employees that you

344
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:04,929
would want to have from that perspective

345
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:06,970
so if you have over full 50 full-time

346
00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:08,889
equivalent employees and there's some

347
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:10,750
information on that on the handout you

348
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:12,730
are subject to the Affordable Care Act

349
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,379
and offering you have to offer benefits

350
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:18,060
if you have 50 full-time equivalent

351
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:21,750
employees may we all be in that position

352
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:21,750
Brett you have a question

353
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:27,370
[Music]

354
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,340
[Music]

355
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:13,340
it's called outsourcing and benefit

356
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,440
businesses now our are looking at the

357
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,269
need for having in-house because when

358
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,040
you have somebody in-house and under

359
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:21,470
your employment then you're paying your

360
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,419
payroll taxes and you're having to give

361
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:26,149
them sick leave and a you know benefits

362
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:28,099
so a lot of times like for my services

363
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:30,230
small companies would absolutely not

364
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,710
need a full-time HR person that would

365
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:35,269
absolutely not be financially

366
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:37,550
responsible I don't think because it's

367
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:40,370
something that you know once I get in

368
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:44,000
and get you compliant on an ongoing

369
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:45,769
basis it's a very simple thing so I from

370
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,169
my point of view I'm seeing a lot of

371
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:50,329
outsourcing out there to touch on the

372
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:51,919
management company is very common we'll

373
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,930
see most of the distribution companies

374
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,329
manufacturers all of them in separate

375
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:57,919
entities from the wrist side depending

376
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,480
on the common ownership we can structure

377
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,149
that and that's fine to protect that

378
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,130
business but it still correlates with

379
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:07,599
the common ownership when it comes to

380
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,600
the ACA Affordable Care Act

381
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,970
here

382
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:29,039
this is a question about transitioning

383
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:31,139
in our industry and this is open to all

384
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:35,460
of our panelists but the question was

385
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:38,490
about integrating the OD our original

386
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:41,130
data that would be individuals have been

387
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:44,099
in the industry for potentially 20-plus

388
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:46,920
years or longer legacy cultivators for

389
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:49,439
example and then those individuals who

390
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,990
see the re rush and want to be a part of

391
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,700
this flourishing industry the greatest

392
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,859
fastest growing industry of our day how

393
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:59,490
do we bring them together to work as a

394
00:17:55,859 --> 00:18:02,189
cohesive group towards the common goal

395
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:07,380
of the corporation or the entity of

396
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:10,559
maybe and the team so um I like to refer

397
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:12,540
to these as start overs instead of

398
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,059
startups because you have to deal with

399
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:16,680
the legacy and the OGS and that is

400
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:19,409
probably one of the most difficult

401
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,299
things to deal with because you have the

402
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:23,430
attitude of it's always been done this

403
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,500
way versus you know somebody coming in

404
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,870
and saying we can make it better so I

405
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,970
what I recommend is that you could

406
00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:33,179
change management a strategy in place

407
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:36,630
and you really try and respect both

408
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:38,549
sides it's very easy to say you know

409
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,990
well you've been here for forever and

410
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:42,599
you just don't know how to change your

411
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,940
way of thinking and they really do some

412
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:47,099
people you know to be brutally honest

413
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,860
some people won't make the cut they

414
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:52,980
won't last but if you if you have a

415
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:55,889
really strong respect for your old

416
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:59,190
employees and I talked time served

417
00:18:55,890 --> 00:19:00,920
never age and the incoming employees and

418
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:03,440
you really try to get them to

419
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:08,420
gather and you put together a strategy

420
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:10,759
that everyone can agree on and then you

421
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:12,289
monitor it and you really make it you

422
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:14,210
you help them understand why it's

423
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:17,059
necessary and the more you communicate

424
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:19,279
with them the more apt they are to

425
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:20,869
change so you just have to pay a little

426
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:22,490
bit more attention and I guarantee in

427
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:24,919
the long run they're probably beneficial

428
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:26,900
I definitely want to touch on this

429
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,690
because I've had some very real

430
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,519
experience with this as a retailer and I

431
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,710
would definitely second what you were

432
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:36,220
saying about making really clear

433
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:39,710
expectations and and communicating that

434
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:42,350
I feel like there's a lot of if first of

435
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:44,269
all if the new people coming in one in

436
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:45,919
on the green rush they're definitely

437
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:48,410
gonna have to understand that its

438
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,720
patrons first because all of us

439
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,940
retailers manufacturers regulators who

440
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,200
do we work for right it's these people

441
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,519
who are trying to come in and get access

442
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,950
the people who fought for medical

443
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,230
cannabis and it voted for adult use

444
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,990
cannabis so we have to make sure that

445
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:05,180
that first and foremost were this is not

446
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:08,720
about us as employees this is about

447
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:10,970
those patrons and and a retailer you are

448
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,000
absolutely dealing with that on the

449
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:15,710
front line so I think that integrating

450
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,829
those two different ideas is really

451
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:21,799
important and I would go a step further

452
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:25,159
and say that diversity within your staff

453
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:26,839
is is essential because cannabis you

454
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,490
know there's with the exception maybe of

455
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:30,589
Oaksterdam University there's nowhere

456
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,660
you can go to like get groomed for

457
00:20:30,589 --> 00:20:35,029
canvas right some people are gonna learn

458
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,340
it in the gray market some people are

459
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:39,619
gonna come in brand new here but the

460
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:41,569
idea that everybody has a different

461
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:43,189
experience with this plant and has a

462
00:20:41,569 --> 00:20:45,169
different experience maybe from another

463
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,539
industry that they're gonna bring a lot

464
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:50,420
of strengths so if you're new people

465
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:52,579
think they understand what's going on

466
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:54,860
and they're not going to listen to your

467
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:56,480
older employees they're gonna miss out

468
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:59,059
on a lot of valuable knowledge about the

469
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,789
history of how we got here which is

470
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:03,289
really important but and I also think at

471
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:05,000
the same time if you've got people who

472
00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:06,950
are like no I'm only gonna work here if

473
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,319
I can get cash at the end of the day and

474
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:12,840
like Deb well I stand here

475
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:15,509
yeah they're they're not gonna make it

476
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:17,099
because I say this all the time are the

477
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:18,960
biggest misconceptions in the cannabis

478
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:22,199
industry is that beanie budtender or

479
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,720
customers cisgender whatever your store

480
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,789
calls it is an unskilled position right

481
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,700
these people need to understand body

482
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:32,220
systems complex regulatory systems and

483
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:35,490
product life that change Oh what every

484
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:37,500
two weeks lately but somehow it feels

485
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,809
right so if you're gonna have people

486
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,700
coming in here they're they're gonna

487
00:21:39,809 --> 00:21:43,019
have to be people who are engaged and I

488
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,750
think that you can find these people

489
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:48,180
from all kinds of walks of life so

490
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,519
coming in as if manager and saying hey

491
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:52,410
these are my expectations and all of

492
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:55,470
these people from diverse populations

493
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:57,480
have to succumb to this I think you're

494
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:00,000
really gonna see a lot of strengths and

495
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,860
and listen to your staff as well you

496
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,599
know sit down with them and say hey

497
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:05,429
maybe I'm newer to this and you've been

498
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,619
in this for five years what can we learn

499
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:09,120
from each other cuz maybe I'll learn

500
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:10,919
something from somebody who's been in

501
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,739
cannabis for 15 years and they're gonna

502
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,660
learn something from my experience which

503
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,279
comes from an outside industry so I

504
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:18,269
think that this is a great strength that

505
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,460
we have here when we're building

506
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:22,349
something you know 10 years from now it

507
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,240
might be oh yeah it's just this guy went

508
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:26,399
to Canada's college so he's a shoo-in

509
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,349
we're right now we can actually build

510
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,009
some of these relationships that create

511
00:22:28,349 --> 00:22:34,319
a stronger workforce and diversity is

512
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:36,329
literally written into these regulations

513
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,869
so I think that this is important not

514
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:41,669
just from OG cannabis people to the

515
00:22:39,869 --> 00:22:42,779
newcomers but all across the board we

516
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,279
have to make sure that everybody's

517
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:46,740
voices are being heard and we're using

518
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,539
our best ideas if you're hearing it for

519
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,099
the green rush I think you're gonna find

520
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:53,039
that the community does not support you

521
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:55,679
in that effort if you're in it to to

522
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:59,430
bring medicine and help people and to

523
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,740
restore the medical access that we had

524
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:03,299
prior to Prohibition then you're gonna

525
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:07,130
find that people come out in big numbers

526
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:07,129
to help you build something

527
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:19,920
ya know Peterson Thank You Santa Monica

Monica we do have a unique experience

536
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:40,620
and that we don't have any retailer not

537
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,000
medical not adult use an ordinance was

538
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:45,299
passed in 2015

539
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,369
authorizing to retailers and as of right

540
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:50,549
now we've had a holdup with Live Scan

541
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:52,919
those what I call winners not been yet

542
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:55,079
announced but stay tuned we will have

543
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:59,009
access to medical cannabis here in Santa

544
00:23:55,079 --> 00:24:00,720
Monica very soon and potentially the

545
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:02,429
sama task force will be able to provide

546
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,190
some crucial information regarding

547
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:08,070
public safety I spoke to the city of

548
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:10,830
commerce this past week and we talked

549
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:12,928
about medical cannabis and the audience

550
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:15,000
really wanted to provide some Q&amp;A

551
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:17,910
feedback because they wanted more

552
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,829
information about public safety and some

553
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:22,500
of the questions were you know how is

554
00:24:19,829 --> 00:24:24,000
how is cannabis use affecting the number

555
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,619
of accidents on the road and

556
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,779
unfortunately these are very

557
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:30,089
controversial questions the answers to

558
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:33,240
which are debatable according to the

559
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:35,039
source and we've just been just been

560
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,769
legal for adult use here since January

561
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,329
we just got our regulations so having

562
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:42,569
that data and be able to report on it

563
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:44,039
it's quite difficult but potentially we

564
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:46,409
can put that together and we'll be able

565
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:48,659
to communicate more succinctly on issues

566
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:52,600
pertaining to public safety in the

567
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:55,990
future all right gentleman in the back

568
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:55,990
follow-up question

569
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,900
we want to work with both mom-and-pop

570
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:55,210
entities we also want to work with some

571
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,038
the larger corporations we're seeing

572
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:58,750
that mom-and-pop and a teaser may be

573
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,660
having a difficult time with cash flow

574
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:06,009
and be able to purchase our emojis or

575
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:08,710
many orders how do we provide a more

576
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:12,879
level playing field for both mom and

577
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:17,048
pops and those larger corporations so as

578
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,059
a buyer with your company among many

579
00:26:17,048 --> 00:26:21,879
other companies is consistent

580
00:26:19,058 --> 00:26:23,889
communication like when I reach out to

581
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,570
you get back to me let me know what you

582
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:27,759
have in stock right now everybody has

583
00:26:25,569 --> 00:26:30,668
varying amounts of product in stock from

584
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,230
stores to distributors to vendors like

585
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:33,820
as soon as you know something even if

586
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:35,019
you're knowing that that week hey I

587
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:37,599
still don't know where we're at like

588
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:39,940
communicate that with us like keep your

589
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:42,189
leaf link up today you know that's a big

590
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:44,500
issue as many of us use leaf link or

591
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:46,570
cannily or handshake and all these

592
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,009
different you know platforms to allow us

593
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:50,048
to order like keep that stuff up to date

594
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:51,609
me to go place an order on there and

595
00:26:50,048 --> 00:26:58,538
then you call me back or you shoot me a

596
00:26:51,609 --> 00:27:00,609
text which I've asked you to email me so

597
00:26:58,538 --> 00:27:02,740
really everybody is the distributor and

598
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:07,058
the painter question is this step of

599
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:09,069
your daily communication we're talking

600
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:09,700
about HR and staffing right and all of a

601
00:27:09,069 --> 00:27:12,639
sudden we're gonna talk about

602
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:14,110
distribution think this industry is

603
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,710
really interesting because we have the

604
00:27:14,109 --> 00:27:19,808
choice to make some ethical choices

605
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:22,150
right so you're sitting here and now you

606
00:27:19,808 --> 00:27:24,639
as a distributor have have choices to

607
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:27,669
make I have X amount of product you can

608
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,700
determine you know how can I can I

609
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:33,370
increase maybe for these corporate

610
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:35,140
clients who have a lot of cash flow and

611
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:38,139
money to burn and they're like they

612
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:40,360
don't have as tight of a budget

613
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,970
and can I use that business to literally

614
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:44,919
sustain maybe something that's a little

615
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:47,200
bit near and dear to my heart which is

616
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,519
supporting mom-and-pop businesses so

617
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,039
maybe as a distributor that's really

618
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:52,960
important to you there's different ways

619
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,389
to make this decision you know some

620
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,250
purchasers are saying you know well it's

621
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:59,350
not only enough to have good product at

622
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:01,240
a good price point you also need to make

623
00:27:59,349 --> 00:28:03,459
sure that everybody on your staff is

624
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,370
helped these moral and ethical standards

625
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:08,259
right so there's purchasers all over the

626
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:10,178
place that are making stamps like that

627
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:13,058
and so I think distributors can do an

628
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:15,370
equal thing you know if you know ok well

629
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:17,289
that person can order tens of thousands

630
00:28:15,369 --> 00:28:19,479
of cartridges at one time so obviously

631
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:22,329
they're able to get that lower price

632
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,250
point what can you do to make that money

633
00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:25,329
work for these smaller businesses who's

634
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,130
something that you want to see in your

635
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,970
industry somebody that you want to see

636
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,799
on your corner

637
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,660
you know if you guys as distributors

638
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:33,879
don't only want to see Walmart's of

639
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,620
cannabis well then guess what you know

640
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,809
you're gonna have to build into your

641
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:40,959
business model how am I gonna be sure to

642
00:28:37,808 --> 00:28:43,178
protect the little guy if you will and

643
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,950
so I think instead of instead of

644
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:47,230
wondering how small businesses are gonna

645
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:49,090
be able to compete with large ones think

646
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:51,730
well what can I do to make my business

647
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:53,619
more attractive to these to these

648
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,990
smaller companies so maybe you don't

649
00:28:53,619 --> 00:28:58,329
offer net 15 to big corporations offer

650
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:01,509
it instead to the mom-and-pop who you

651
00:28:58,329 --> 00:29:02,859
trust I am preparing for this event this

652
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:05,319
evening actually had a similar

653
00:29:02,859 --> 00:29:07,209
conversation with someone and it was

654
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:09,029
kind of a debate of you know well are

655
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:11,558
the retailers in LA mom and pop

656
00:29:09,029 --> 00:29:14,410
organizations I mean I got a rose

657
00:29:11,558 --> 00:29:16,839
caregivers for example they got bought I

658
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,279
think maybe six months ago a lot of the

659
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:20,379
shops are getting purchased by bigger

660
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:22,119
companies so it kind of made me question

661
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,799
a little are they mom pops and the

662
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:25,989
answer on the other side of this

663
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:28,509
conversation was yes many of these

664
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,980
retailers here in LA have been in the

665
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:32,099
industry

666
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:34,289
for 15-20 years they are monocots and

667
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:36,750
it's been difficult to maintain their

668
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:39,569
storefronts in the face of regulations

669
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:41,910
in the face of a declining consumer base

670
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:44,819
in the face of all these these new

671
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:47,090
things that we have to adapt so they are

672
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:49,319
now pops and if there is a way to

673
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:52,079
support those entities that you think

674
00:29:49,319 --> 00:30:35,879
could use a leg up then yes absolutely

675
00:29:52,079 --> 00:30:40,710
let's do it we have a orders but smaller

676
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:44,070
orders more frequently and looking more

677
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:46,500
regional hubs where folks largest

678
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:47,579
distributors can now bring that product

679
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,339
and

680
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:55,189
did store it somewhere and then purchase

681
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:58,048
smaller quantities and do like route

682
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:59,970
that's a great point he just pointed out

683
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:02,638
that distribution companies are actually

684
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:04,379
required to store their inventory in

685
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:06,979
warehouses and potentially they could be

686
00:31:04,378 --> 00:31:09,658
dispatching that in smaller orders

687
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:12,628
retailers historically have a difficult

688
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:14,730
time managing inventory or holding

689
00:31:12,628 --> 00:31:17,579
inventory in what is a small retail

690
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:19,470
space and they typically prefer to have

691
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:22,888
more of a turnover so they're ordering

692
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:24,538
smaller smaller orders more frequently I

693
00:31:22,888 --> 00:31:28,998
think that's a great solution thank you

694
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:28,999
oh right here

695
00:31:36,579 --> 00:31:44,230
all of the above absolutely I think that

696
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:46,929
I am somebody who's very excited for the

697
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:49,028
regulated market I love the idea of lab

698
00:31:46,929 --> 00:31:52,509
tests of cannabis and all of these

699
00:31:49,028 --> 00:31:55,240
different things but absolutely throwing

700
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:58,329
a whole new set of rules on a 20 year

701
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:01,089
old industry creates an awkward

702
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:04,178
transition so I think that that's that's

703
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:06,069
absolutely true and and many people have

704
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:08,320
talked about the changes in budgets

705
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:09,939
right so from going from paying people

706
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:11,288
cash at the end of the day to paying

707
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:14,830
payroll taxes and all these things

708
00:32:11,288 --> 00:32:17,109
things these are huge hurdles the fact

709
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:18,699
that and maybe we've got people here

710
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:20,500
from all over California but I think we

711
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,940
can all talk to your bit about the fact

712
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,880
that the black markets not being

713
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:27,159
particularly regulated so for me as a

714
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,210
retailer well guess what I'm paying my

715
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:31,240
state taxes

716
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:33,850
I'm paying my county and city taxes I'm

717
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,319
here my labour taxes and I can only sell

718
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:37,898
edibles that are a hundred milligrams

719
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:39,759
where the guy down the street he's not

720
00:32:37,898 --> 00:32:41,619
paying any of those taxes he's not

721
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:44,200
playing his employees correctly and he's

722
00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:46,209
got all the good stuff right so these

723
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,909
these are huge hurdles that I think

724
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:50,950
we're facing in this present moment and

725
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:52,450
I think that you know and hopefully in

726
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:54,190
the future we're looking back at like

727
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:55,808
okay well the regulated market did get a

728
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,590
leg up because we have access to things

729
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:01,898
like HR companies and health insurance

730
00:32:58,589 --> 00:33:05,079
good thing yeah but right now I think it

731
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:06,158
is a big struggle in a big risk you know

732
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:07,990
if you're somebody who's been in this

733
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,820
industry for a while and you're looking

734
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:10,899
at hey I've made this business from the

735
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:12,939
ground up and I've made it really

736
00:33:10,898 --> 00:33:17,168
successful and I have to do literally a

737
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:20,259
180 just to compete and that 180 comes

738
00:33:17,169 --> 00:33:22,090
with with a pretty big price tag so I

739
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:25,388
think you know I can really only speak

740
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:27,009
to the retailer so if there's anybody

741
00:33:25,388 --> 00:33:28,990
who wants to speak I maybe if there's

742
00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:30,940
bigger hurdles to manufacturing

743
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:33,130
cultivation something like that

744
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,538
but I think just a constant transition

745
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:36,610
is really tricky

746
00:33:34,538 --> 00:33:39,000
not only for employee morale and

747
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:41,528
turnover but just for operating cost

748
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,109
it's it's difficult to make a

749
00:33:41,528 --> 00:33:44,730
perspective

750
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:46,859
plant right where do I want to be in a

751
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,210
year from now well what are the rules

752
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,740
gonna be a year from now I don't think

753
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:53,308
there's anybody in this room who can say

754
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:54,599
that for sure so that's I think these

755
00:33:53,308 --> 00:33:56,129
are big hurdles and even though we're

756
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,990
excited to move forward into the

757
00:33:56,130 --> 00:34:01,470
regulated market it doesn't mean it's

758
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:02,970
simple does that answer the question I

759
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:05,788
don't know I think I need to support

760
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:08,250
that we can all make an effort to go to

761
00:34:05,788 --> 00:34:10,980
those licensed entities when we do

762
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:12,780
purchase cannabis products let's make

763
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,980
that effort because it's true that's

764
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,960
been it that's actually been an issue

765
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,820
for retailers here for quite a long time

766
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,769
and they've been reporting them to

767
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,588
authorities there's been no enforcement

768
00:34:19,769 --> 00:34:24,539
and it's continued so I think it's

769
00:34:22,588 --> 00:34:27,179
really up to us as consumers to educate

770
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:29,750
our fellow consumers and really support

771
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:31,829
this license movement so that we are

772
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,539
protecting our industry and those

773
00:34:31,829 --> 00:34:35,338
individuals who have put a lot of money

774
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:36,690
on the line they've and they've hired

775
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:39,239
attorneys and they've gone through the

776
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:40,168
application process it's not easy so we

777
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,799
really need to make sure that we're

778
00:34:40,168 --> 00:34:45,809
supporting those individuals also to

779
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:49,379
touch on that get involved with the

780
00:34:45,809 --> 00:34:51,148
local associations or CCI a really you

781
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:52,799
could meet some other operators that can

782
00:34:51,148 --> 00:34:55,138
can help out with some of those hurdles

783
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,460
that you're struggling with and and ask

784
00:34:55,139 --> 00:35:00,800
for their help they're more than happy

785
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,800
to help and lend a helping hand

786
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:08,329
Neal is here with urbe and we'd like to

787
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,559
know if anyone would like to comment on

788
00:35:08,329 --> 00:35:12,179
the closing of the comment period and

789
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,400
how we can actually contribute our

790
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:16,139
opinions through the comment period I

791
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:21,059
have a question did anybody attend that

792
00:35:16,139 --> 00:35:25,529
today yeah maybe your friend can jump in

793
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:28,679
on that as well there was a hearing

794
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:34,260
today in downtown Los Angeles from the

795
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:37,699
BCC to discuss these matters she says it

796
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,700
was 90 seconds and he was a joke

797
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:19,848
you can send an email to the BCC or the

798
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:20,449
CD pH they are very receptive they will

799
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:23,150
respond

800
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:26,539
Dean wants to say something piggyback

801
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:27,108
off Rico was saying and give it more

802
00:36:26,539 --> 00:36:29,509
concrete

803
00:36:27,108 --> 00:36:30,348
sort of Avenue for you to do that one of

804
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:33,619
the things I've been really impressed

805
00:36:30,349 --> 00:36:35,838
with over the last 3-4 months with the

806
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:38,269
CCI a is it has committees that are

807
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:40,130
dedicated to the different industry

808
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:42,588
segments and that in the supply chain so

809
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:44,000
there is a manufacturing committee there

810
00:36:42,588 --> 00:36:46,219
is a retail committee there's a

811
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,920
distribution committee if you are a

812
00:36:46,219 --> 00:36:50,149
retailer and you've got concerns that

813
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,530
you don't think are being heard or you

814
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,358
don't know where to go with them or you

815
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:56,300
don't know what the what the the

816
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:57,679
industry is doing for you that's a great

817
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,300
place for you to go and speak with

818
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:01,159
retailers that are all sitting in a room

819
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,740
figuring out what comments do we want to

820
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:06,139
provide if you're a manufacturer or a

821
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:08,088
grower and you can't get product through

822
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:09,500
a testing lab where it's getting it's

823
00:37:08,088 --> 00:37:11,838
getting bottleneck and you're getting

824
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,400
frustrated or you send it out to test

825
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:15,679
and it passes and then you send it to a

826
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,180
manufacturing facility then it comes out

827
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:18,710
as a finished product and then it fails

828
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:19,598
and you say how the hell is this

829
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:21,980
possible

830
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,079
get involved in that group there right

831
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:26,300
now the manufacturing committee the

832
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,440
testing committee the retail committee

833
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,810
they're all sitting around the room

834
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,309
saying what's your fault you're screwing

835
00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:32,989
up my product and the testing bugs are

836
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:34,400
saying don't kill me I'm just doing what

837
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:36,139
the law says and then they're saying oh

838
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,210
really and they're starting to listen to

839
00:37:36,139 --> 00:37:39,858
each other and figure out how you put

840
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:42,798
these regulations to

841
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:45,139
a way that makes sense so go go find a

842
00:37:42,798 --> 00:37:47,329
group like that and do exactly what we

843
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:49,608
Co said don't sit here have a couple of

844
00:37:47,329 --> 00:37:51,200
drinks tonight say it's the BCC

845
00:37:49,608 --> 00:37:54,619
is out of control or the regulation sock

846
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:55,998
and I can't that's that's not gonna make

847
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:57,349
you successful what's gonna make you

848
00:37:55,998 --> 00:37:59,088
successful is going out and doing

849
00:37:57,349 --> 00:38:01,160
something about it and finding an

850
00:37:59,088 --> 00:38:03,739
organization like that well you can

851
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:05,659
contribute an idea to a group that's

852
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:08,150
actually sitting in Sacramento and

853
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:10,639
trying to make these things work and put

854
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:12,889
it into action so I'm seeing it happen

855
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:14,929
firsthand get get in there and make

856
00:38:12,889 --> 00:38:16,848
yourself heard before this this comment

857
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:18,288
period closes because we don't know when

858
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:20,809
there will be another opportunity once

859
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:22,249
these regulations get fully baked find

860
00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:27,170
sort of intended as it was coming out of

861
00:38:22,248 --> 00:38:29,959
my mouth these are monthly events at the

862
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:32,389
last event last month we actually had a

863
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,489
panel and we talked about the open

864
00:38:32,389 --> 00:38:36,498
comment period it's quite important and

865
00:38:34,489 --> 00:38:38,420
if you can reach out and just put

866
00:38:36,498 --> 00:38:39,919
together a list what you think is

867
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,989
relevant send it over

868
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,869
he doesn't have to be exhaustive it can

869
00:38:41,989 --> 00:38:46,639
be what's most crucial to you and just

870
00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:48,559
be aware that unfortunately some of

871
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:49,848
these things are built into prop 64 and

872
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:51,739
we can't change them some of them

873
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:53,809
require referendum but you can certainly

874
00:38:51,739 --> 00:38:55,039
voice your concerns and potentially

875
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:56,569
someone on the other line is going to

876
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:59,599
make a note of it and in the future

877
00:38:56,568 --> 00:39:01,548
those things will change we are here to

878
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,599
affect policy we're not here just to

879
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:05,179

880
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:07,430
