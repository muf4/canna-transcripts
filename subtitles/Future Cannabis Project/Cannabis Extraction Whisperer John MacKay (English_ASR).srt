2
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:20,420
john has a new company let's hear about

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:22,519
your new co oh my goodness yeah

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:25,250
so I'm actually consultant so I'm a

5
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:28,640
seagull I fly in I shit all over you and

6
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:31,129
I fly away and so within that process

7
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,399
it's more of going through and looking

8
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:35,479
at where a manufacturing facility is

9
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,030
going so it doesn't matter what the

10
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:40,578
manufacturer of equipment is it's more

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,960
of taking an analysis along the way of

12
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:43,910
the material before it goes in the

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,660
extractor X Y Z I don't care if it's

14
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:49,819
propane butane tetrafluoroethylene co2

15
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:52,009
or I don't care what it is but what I do

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,649
is I see what's happening before test

17
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:56,179
that material then test the conditions

18
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:57,710
that it's going through and then testing

19
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:59,600
the material afterwards and so if

20
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,750
there's one thing that I'll harp on and

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,549
that is good is not a number I mean you

22
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:06,618
need to know the numbers to be able to

23
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:09,228
know what is your yields supposed to be

24
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:10,969
what was your yield and so therefore

25
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:12,679
you're able to find out where do you

26
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:14,539
have holes in the bucket of the

27
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,670
manufacturers so if you fill up a bucket

28
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,140
with water or how many holes are in

29
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,700
there I mean it's it leaking out

30
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,200
everywhere and you don't realize it

31
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,540
through your decarboxylation you're

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,728
losing 20% to didn't have to if you're

33
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,140
doing it through your extractor and you

34
00:01:25,728 --> 00:01:29,209
find out that it's channeling so

35
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,478
channeling is like a river going through

36
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:34,368
an extractor and the co2 or propane will

37
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:37,158
find the path of least resistance if it

38
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:39,319
finds the side of that vessel it's it's

39
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,060
you know it's fast past time off you go

40
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:42,769
if it's sitting in the middle it'll just

41
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,118
continue to go like the Colorado River

42
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,828
and you're just gonna have erosion and

43
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:47,840
so but you're not gonna get to that

44
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:49,908
material so those are the sort of things

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,909
to be you quickly find out by testing

46
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,350
something in-house it's not that much

47
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:56,118
money to be able to go back through and

48
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:58,218
know what the numbers are so I say

49
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:00,140
that's what synergistic technology

50
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:02,959
associates does it's really looking at

51
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,310
process design you know where are you

52
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:08,228
losing money where can you maximize

53
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:08,229
money working you maximize productivity

54
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:14,589
it's not cheap but it'll save you a lot

55
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:16,449
more money than he charges you and and

56
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,069
if you take him out to lunch you get

57
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:19,869
good comic relief too so that's always a

58
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:22,079
bonus he's not funny you're not doing a

59
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,080
good job

60
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:31,710
