1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,320
we get a lot of vendors that come in

2
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:12,000
with their products over the years and

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,290
one of the main things that we're

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,440
looking for since there are no

5
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:19,410
regulations regarding the supply or the

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,929
labeling or lab testing we were really

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,000
rely on a professional appearance and a

8
00:00:21,929 --> 00:00:26,280
professional product so when it comes to

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,809
the infused products it's it's we've

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,760
irritated I guess probably a lot of

11
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:31,919
people over the last couple years but

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,469
we've had some strict demands and it

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,739
just comes down to their packaging being

14
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:41,280
lab tested and being accurate and being

15
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:43,738
professionally packaged and also having

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,448
a consistent distribution system so

17
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:46,858
those are really the first things and

18
00:00:45,448 --> 00:00:49,588
same thing when it comes to the flowers

19
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:51,059
we definitely want samples we're not the

20
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:52,768
kind of place that will make a decision

21
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:55,828
on the spot just by the way it looks or

22
00:00:52,768 --> 00:00:57,179
smells we really need to try the product

23
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,359
and that's probably the biggest thing

24
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:01,739
that we're concerned with so I have had

25
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,469
people that we've said hey can you bring

26
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:07,170
some samples and they seem a bit turned

27
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:08,728
off by it like we might just use the

28
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,620
samples maybe they have this experience

29
00:01:08,728 --> 00:01:13,260
at other places and then never get back

30
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,270
to them but we take taking in samples

31
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,640
extremely seriously we make sure all the

32
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:19,799
right people try it we have forums for

33
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,329
everybody to fill out and then we

34
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,379
basically we take it from there and if

35
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:24,170
it's a good product

36
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:27,269
we usually carry it there's so many

37
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,400
little things that are missing from our

38
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:31,170
shelf like we just got medicated hemp

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,980
milk we didn't have that before why

40
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:39,570
would we not take someone that had that

41
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:41,700
we have even handmade cigars wrapped in

42
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:44,069
gold or cannabis leaf again there's no

43
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,650
competitor in that space so the product

44
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:48,839
came to us it it's a good product and we

45
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:51,120
accept it so I think the big thing is

46
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,400
trying to find what's missing on a shelf

47
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,230
but I see especially in the last few

48
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,270
months I've seen so many new products

49
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,219
and so many new categories it's really

50
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:00,629
exciting but I hate to keep going back

51
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,359
to this theme but like we're gonna run

52
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:05,280
out of display case space so we're gonna

53
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:07,730
have to kind of change the layout of

54
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,730
everything

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,640
the biggest thing is isolating the

56
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:15,319
cannabinoids and having different

57
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,878
combinations with those so kind of like

58
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:19,280
we were talking about earlier of course

59
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:22,938
CBD has become more and more popular

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,640
over the last couple years the vape pens

61
00:02:22,938 --> 00:02:28,789
the we just got in a soda and this thing

62
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:30,649
take its sprig and it I mean it tastes

63
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:34,158
like sprite and it's medicated and it's

64
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:37,370
in a nice can with a nice packaging so

65
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:39,078
and new vape companies keep coming out

66
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,939
with things because early on in the

67
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:43,310
beginning there we could get vape pens

68
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:46,939
but a lot of them had a weird taste and

69
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:49,009
people were putting like PG and PE g and

70
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:50,299
these like fillers into the pen because

71
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:53,120
they couldn't get them to flow properly

72
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:55,040
and our patients basically don't want

73
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,420
any of that they want them pure and I

74
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,250
think the vape companies have noticed

75
00:02:56,419 --> 00:03:00,138
this and they're and that's what most of

76
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,669
them are doing now so you know the

77
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:05,120
products are just getting cleaner better

78
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:07,009
packaged more consistent and it's it's

79
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,090
exciting it's an exciting time to be a

80
00:03:07,009 --> 00:03:10,090
cannabis retailer
