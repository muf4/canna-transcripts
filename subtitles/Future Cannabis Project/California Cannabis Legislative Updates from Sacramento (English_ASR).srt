2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:24,870
[Music]

3
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:36,329
what is going on in the legislative and

4
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:37,710
regulatory landscape to start off I

5
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,649
thought it would be nice to summarize

6
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,210
just where we are in the process with

7
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,519
the regulation

8
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,730
you might recall last time we were here

9
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,340
Pamela and I yelling at you passionately

10
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:52,579
two comments during the 45-day comment

11
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,580
period

12
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:57,119
Laurie Ajax at one of it was head said

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,239
that she anticipated getting about a

14
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:09,390
thousand comments we wanted I think we

15
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:12,090
got $4,000 well done people about 1800

16
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,409
of them were about delivery so you know

17
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,560
yep

18
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,780
and so now they're in the process so

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,399
maybe max you could help like describe

20
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,549
where we are in that process and what

21
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:25,769
the next steps are right right so you

22
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,689
know there's two stages two processes

23
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:29,429
going on right now right we've got the

24
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,439
regulatory process which has been going

25
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,140
on in fits and starts the entire the

26
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,640
entire year and then we also have the

27
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,140
legislative process which we're at the

28
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,510
very end of I'll start with the

29
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,099
legislative process briefly because that

30
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:44,609
does you know what has just been

31
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:47,579
wrapping up so bills I have a two-year

32
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:50,930
life cycle that life cycle starts after

33
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:54,209
an election and it ends at the following

34
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:56,909
August or September of the year we're in

35
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:59,368
the second year of a two-year cycle all

36
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,670
bills had to be passed by the

37
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:05,340
legislature by the end of August now the

38
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:08,549
governor has one month has until the

39
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,560
last day of September to go and sign or

40
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:13,170
veto those bills that are currently

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,269
pending so he's taking action on one

42
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:17,759
bill thus far which was the electronic

43
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:20,430
funds transfer bill saying that if

44
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,109
you're paying your taxes and you're

45
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,120
paying them in cash you shouldn't be

46
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,560
penalized for that because you're in

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,079
cannabis because you don't have banking

48
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,180
access so is a good bill is an easy bill

49
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:32,400
you signed it that's the one bill he's

50
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,280
signed thus far there's a couple of

51
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,099
smaller ones they got a veto but what

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,259
we're really waiting for the big less

53
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:42,810
the big set of them that Pam's excited

54
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:44,909
about and we can you know touch on that

55
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,300
in just a moment but that's you know

56
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:54,079
more of action in the next you know 11

57
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:55,830
days or 13 days on all those bills

58
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,560
simultaneously we've got the regulatory

59
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,840
process going on we just had a 45 day

60
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,830
public comment period that period closed

61
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,719
what we're now at is a question of will

62
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:08,640
there be or what will be the next

63
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,400
comments period because there will be

64
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,628
changes to the regulations and when

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,060
there are changes and when there are

66
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:16,709
substantive changes in particular there

67
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,959
has to be an additional comment period

68
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:22,500
we're anticipating another comment

69
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:27,000
period either between mid October and

70
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:29,789
November somewhere around there but the

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,430
important date is this the emergency

72
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:35,370
regulations were only authorized for one

73
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:38,340
year and so the emergency regulations

74
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,890
that have been in effect since the first

75
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,509
week of December of last year that have

76
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:45,000
to be replaced by permanent regulations

77
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:48,359
by the first week of December of this

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,189
year and so keeping an eye on that week

79
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,830
from there we're just working backwards

80
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:55,139
we're working backwards on when the

81
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,909
comment periods will be how much review

82
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:58,619
there will be because they have to be

83
00:03:56,908 --> 00:04:00,929
approved and finalized by that first

84
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,200
week of December so cancel your

85
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,310
Thanksgiving plans last year the regs

86
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:06,889
came out the Thursday before

87
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,370
Thanksgiving

88
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:12,500
MJB I'm JP so every Californian right

89
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,780
and in Vegas everyone was in Vegas on

90
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,100
their phones and the laptops looking at

91
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:20,060
the regulations and they came out last

92
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:23,510
time and probably around that time for

93
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,949
the final version to going back to

94
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:27,579
legislation and you wanna talk about

95
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:30,860
some of your favorites we talked about

96
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:34,189
1459 which is I think one of the most

97
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:38,500
important bills it had an interesting

98
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:41,240
iteration because it took the shape of a

99
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:45,199
previous cultivation bill that was

100
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:48,379
gutted and repurposed yeah so the what's

101
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,449
so important about 15 14 59 is that

102
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:52,569
temporary permits which is what

103
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:55,849
everybody's been using to operate on

104
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:58,969
expire and can no longer be issued as of

105
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:01,340
December 31st of 2018

106
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,470
that was part of 64 that was voted in by

107
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:05,539
the voters so what does that mean that

108
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,850
means that the state has how many people

109
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,760
know how many annual permits the state

110
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:14,450
has issued so far it's a big goose egg

111
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:16,279
right none so we are nearing the back

112
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:18,860
half of the year more than the back half

113
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:21,349
of the year and there's no state permits

114
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,910
why is that myriad of reasons some of

115
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:26,240
them may have to do with a little thing

116
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:28,400
called metric that we talked about but

117
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,110
what does that mean is that all these

118
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:32,060
cities and counties are moving forward

119
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:35,540
with their process some operators are

120
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:38,149
currently operating if on the 31st we

121
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,790
don't have a fix to that that either

122
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:43,189
means that certain operator that need

123
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:45,650
priority are gonna have maybe 90-day

124
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:48,050
runway or others who are closer to being

125
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:50,799
issued more towards December would have

126
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,360
120 days given that we're gonna be at

127
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,060
365 days potentially without any

128
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,220
issuance of an annual that starts to put

129
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,250
everybody in a line that if you don't

130
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:04,060
have an annual permit you cannot operate

131
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:06,089
so that grinds the entire industry

132
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,579
chûjô

133
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:10,649
14:59 would give what is affectionately

134
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:12,870
being called a provisional annual

135
00:06:10,649 --> 00:06:15,149
license what does that mean that would

136
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,149
mean that if you have a state temporary

137
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:20,370
permit in your hand by December 31st of

138
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:22,109
this year you would then be entitled to

139
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,478
get a provisional annual with that

140
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,330
provisional annual you would be allowed

141
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,699
to operate without a vested right but

142
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:31,969
throughout the process of the year to

143
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,830
get through fire planning and building

144
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,930
sequel California Environmental Quality

145
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:39,449
Act which will rear its ugly head in

146
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,120
this industry not only are you going to

147
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:44,099
need sequel level review at your local

148
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,139
level but because the second

149
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,930
discretionary action is happening an

150
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:51,418
agency is giving you another permit they

151
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,860
and specifically the Bureau of cannabis

152
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:55,620
control who when you read the

153
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:58,020
regulations had very robust sequa

154
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,240
parameters they're gonna be looking at

155
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:02,490
that secret document and if they don't

156
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,259
think let's look at the city of La we

157
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,819
can look at the city of Long Beach and

158
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,478
we can look specifically at the city of

159
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:08,459
San Diego

160
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,649
none of those cities went through a land

161
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:13,138
use entitlement process there was no

162
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:15,599
discretionary action taken by a local

163
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,819
jurisdiction that allowed for some level

164
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,129
of sequel review their ordinances may

165
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:22,409
have been sequel and reviewed or sequa

166
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:26,788
accepted for the city of La like to use

167
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:29,010
the June or July 1 of 2019 sequin that

168
00:07:26,788 --> 00:07:31,168
exists right now but that means that the

169
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:33,060
BC so you can say aren't you having an

170
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:35,519
existing facility there are always

171
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,339
exceptions to the exemption that's what

172
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,439
California loves and if you went beyond

173
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:42,929
your footprint if you did something more

174
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:45,149
aggressive the BCC you can say well then

175
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:48,269
we want our own sequel review and in

176
00:07:45,149 --> 00:07:50,629
their sequel language in the proposed

177
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:53,339
draft regulations permanent regulations

178
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:55,949
they said you write us a check we tell

179
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:58,329
you how we want you to do sequa and you

180
00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:00,490
pay us to administer that process

181
00:07:58,329 --> 00:08:04,029
a former sequel lawyer I will tell you

182
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:06,699
that sequa can cost tens if not hundreds

183
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:09,429
of thousands of dollars and take six

184
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:11,590
nine twelve months or longer so this

185
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:13,750
provisional annual is critically

186
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:15,399
important it also puts you on the hook

187
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,529
for metrics so the other part about

188
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:19,628
temporary licenses and why temporary

189
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:22,388
licenses aren't something that can move

190
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:24,370
forward into 2019 is we really all need

191
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,168
to start getting on board with track at

192
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,319
rates we're supposed to be doing it

193
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:31,060
paper versions now every time something

194
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:32,829
happens into something moves throughout

195
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,320
the supply chain you're supposed to send

196
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:37,418
a paper manifest or an email manifest up

197
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,849
to the BCC which somehow goes into their

198
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:44,139
general mailbox and is diverted into the

199
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:46,000
right at management we're not gonna ask

200
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:47,919
where those go but you just send them in

201
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,659
because for five years after the fact

202
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,870
they can go back and look at that and

203
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:56,169
Gary out you enforcement actions them

204
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,940
right now some where they do into a

205
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:59,399
black hole that can then cause you

206
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:03,040
issues later

207
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:05,769
so with that provisional annual you are

208
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:08,409
responsible to pay your fees for the

209
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:10,360
whole year upfront you are responsible

210
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:12,519
did you track and trace and you are

211
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,829
responsible to not let what is happening

212
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:18,759
in Sacramento and Oakland happen go

213
00:09:14,828 --> 00:09:21,129
through your local land use process do

214
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:23,500
not think that this license like your

215
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:25,720
temporary license to some is an

216
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,149
entitlement not to go through the rest

217
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,399
of your entitlement process it means you

218
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:33,269
are actively engaged in both operations

219
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,198
and both those operations and critical

220
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:37,600
opportunities that allow you to keep

221
00:09:35,198 --> 00:09:40,899
operating so we wait with bated breath

222
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:45,610
for that to get passed which is my most

223
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:47,919
important point yeah also if you're

224
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:51,519
restructuring this is an important bill

225
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:53,409
for you you can restructure and then get

226
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,078
a provisional annual without losing your

227
00:09:53,409 --> 00:09:57,610
potential priority status which is also

228
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:59,859
something important for those that were

229
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,720
operating maybe as a sole proprietor or

230
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,659
as an NBC that would like to convert

231
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,540
potentially have that issue and just on

232
00:10:05,659 --> 00:10:11,360
1459 you know it we cleared this bill

233
00:10:08,539 --> 00:10:13,669
which was a guttin amend it we

234
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,050
anticipate it will be signed because it

235
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:17,299
was worked with very closely by the

236
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:19,399
governor's office and requested

237
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:21,588
initially by the local governments local

238
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:24,649
government said we don't have enough

239
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:26,149
time to issue these local licenses to

240
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:28,789
get through building planning to get

241
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:31,159
through fire approval so give us more

242
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:33,318
time beyond the temporary license

243
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:35,208
process so that's why we do think it

244
00:10:33,318 --> 00:10:37,610
will go and get signed it is for all

245
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:40,028
licensing authorities but the one thing

246
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:43,399
there's one thing there that I caught on

247
00:10:40,028 --> 00:10:46,100
you don't have a right to a provisional

248
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,679
yeah if you have a temporary the state

249
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,360
may grant you a provisional but it's

250
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:52,039
more it's not going to list doesn't be

251
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,449
it sort of like applying for your

252
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:56,028
provisional it's sounding more like it's

253
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:57,708
going to be a they've your your temp is

254
00:10:56,028 --> 00:10:59,269
expiring and we will grant you a

255
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:01,818
provisional which has a one-year

256
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:03,649
timeline on it and you PI don't want to

257
00:11:01,818 --> 00:11:05,299
be granted a provisional until December

258
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:08,240
frankly if you can get it because you

259
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:10,639
want it to last as long as possible but

260
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,049
you know just that it isn't necessary

261
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,209
saying that you're applying for in the

262
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:16,969
same way it's much more an extension of

263
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:19,159
the temp licensing process if you are

264
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,569
working with a local jurisdiction we're

265
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:22,129
I think we're gonna see an uptick and

266
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:24,708
what the local jurisdictions are able to

267
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:26,209
do you want to make sure I think with

268
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:28,159
the provisional annuals that they have a

269
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:29,539
bifurcated process because this is

270
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,009
something that we're running into with

271
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:34,909
some of our clients where they try to

272
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:36,709
unify it for expediency they can't grant

273
00:11:34,909 --> 00:11:38,778
okay you're gonna want them to issue

274
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:41,508
something akin to a business license

275
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:42,740
that can be conditioned upon going

276
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:44,419
through a lien G since we know my

277
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,490
process if they merge them together

278
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:48,110
they're not gonna be able to condition

279
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,539
them and if they have to make sequel

280
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,159
findings even if you're gonna try to do

281
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:55,039
a notice of exemption or you're gonna

282
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:57,289
try to do a mitigated negative you still

283
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,688
have to go through all of those 18

284
00:11:57,289 --> 00:12:01,549
analysis areas that are within the

285
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:03,469
California Environmental Quality Act and

286
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:05,948
you may not be able to complete an air

287
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:09,170
quality analysis a traffic analysis

288
00:12:05,948 --> 00:12:10,969
those two being the biggest in that time

289
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:12,708
period so if they can bifurcate it out

290
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,449
and issue you something that they can

291
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,959
condition while you go through the

292
00:12:14,448 --> 00:12:18,179
secondary process or

293
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,009
r.fp that's something that you can

294
00:12:18,179 --> 00:12:21,659
engage with your local jurisdiction in

295
00:12:20,009 --> 00:12:25,139
if they haven't quite gotten to the

296
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:27,589
point of issuance and 1459 is past the

297
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:30,960
one thing i heard also on that topic was

298
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:33,120
potentially a registry I think Nevada

299
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,040
County is looking at a registry perhaps

300
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,500
or The Advocate small push for a

301
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,079
registry because do you go get people on

302
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,759
the list to go and say under your

303
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,220
registry you can go and apply for a

304
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,799
state temp have it be non-operational

305
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,389
but having the state temp before the end

306
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,250
of the year gets grants through that

307
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:52,289
opportunity for the provisional and so

308
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:56,009
it's much more valuable to get state

309
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:57,209
temped on December 31st even comparator

310
00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:01,189
trying to start through an annual

311
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,190
license process on January 1

312
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:12,269
do you know that the BCC last year

313
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:15,210
issued permits on Christmas Eve

314
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:17,819
Christmas Day and on New Year's Eve

315
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,700
which I think they will be doing again

316
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,590
which means that I will be spending

317
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,930
holidays at the computer but the main

318
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:28,139
thing with 1459 was that it took care of

319
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:29,729
two important issues with the state

320
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:32,429
which is one that they needed to get

321
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,960
revenue from the license holder since

322
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:35,939
you don't pay your licensing fee with

323
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,980
the temp they needed to get that annual

324
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,670
license fee revenue coming into the

325
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,139
state and then to was the issue of the

326
00:13:41,669 --> 00:13:44,639
biggest thing with the rollout and track

327
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:46,439
and trace is going to be getting enough

328
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,929
people to get on it at the same time

329
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,090
right have any meaning so if they just

330
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:52,769
started piecemeal issuing annuals now

331
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,389
and you're the first person on track and

332
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:56,159
trace the system is useless because

333
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:56,819
you're just inputting everybody else's

334
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,709
paper

335
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,560
I mean it's idea that you know you've

336
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:04,379
got a tracked cultivator going through

337
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:07,619
an untracked distro to attract or

338
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:10,769
untracked manufacturer and then nest or

339
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:13,259
and mix thereof and then you know you're

340
00:14:10,769 --> 00:14:15,120
you're deleting and creating tags and

341
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:16,769
there's no accountability needs to be

342
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,200
rolled out and so what we've actually

343
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:21,750
been suggesting and arguing is that

344
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,750
they're you know not not not gen1

345
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,509
actually bore more like March 31st from

346
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,360
April 1 ideally and not not saying we're

347
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:31,970
gonna be able to get this but there were

348
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,730
should be no more temps in the system

349
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:37,430
one track and trace gets turned on so

350
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:40,639
that everyone can be and is required to

351
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:42,379
be in the system one it does happen but

352
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,689
it could happen but they could turn on

353
00:14:42,379 --> 00:14:46,250
much earlier and have to deal with that

354
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,470
sort of miss max matching the

355
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:51,169
consequences but I deal a more ideal

356
00:14:48,470 --> 00:15:05,420
situation would be wait till everyone

357
00:14:51,169 --> 00:15:07,879
can actually be in there and I think

358
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:10,578
we'll find that I mean I've heard that

359
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:13,009
the state will you know probably have a

360
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:14,599
lot more receptivity to other fixes and

361
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:16,970
issues win track and trace is

362
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,060
implemented because issues which they're

363
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:22,160
incredibly resistant to tackle right now

364
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:25,039
such as sampling and stuff like that

365
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:27,199
becomes much more visible and

366
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,149
controllable when there actually is a

367
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,740
robust track and trace system happening

368
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:33,019
and measuring every single little piece

369
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:36,620
of everything going around so on the

370
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:40,129
other top line issues do we want to talk

371
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:44,778
about 2020 right now well we're at we're

372
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:45,740
at you just came from all fires but I

373
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:49,850
was at a fairground

374
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:51,198
so so a B 2020 by Bill quark is a bill

375
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,360
that's also pending before the governor

376
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:56,448
essentially would expand the number of

377
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,180
license our number of eligible venues

378
00:15:56,448 --> 00:16:01,250
for on-site consumption special events

379
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:04,969
the Bureau create the special event

380
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:08,000
license in through regulations you know

381
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:10,519
further in the emergency regulations

382
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,519
there wasn't really statutory basis for

383
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,230
it but it goes and helps provide for

384
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,149
additional consumption opportunities

385
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,420
retail sale opportunities however by

386
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:21,500
statute it was limited to degree of the

387
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:23,719
consumption itself was limited to

388
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,708
fairground areas and so what this bill

389
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,089
goes and dies is expand the eligible

390
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:31,129
locations for consumption so it's not

391
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:33,769
just fairgrounds and district AG

392
00:16:31,129 --> 00:16:35,929
associations it also could be wherever

393
00:16:33,769 --> 00:16:38,629
essentially a city goes and license is

394
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:41,568
it if you know there is a restricted

395
00:16:38,629 --> 00:16:42,830
access to 21 plus no minors going and

396
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:45,289
seeing the smoke

397
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:47,509
a couple other conditions so it's it's a

398
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:49,909
bill that it's anticipated to be signed

399
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:53,240
and it will go help cause an explosion

400
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:55,789
of licensed events but a licensed event

401
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,930
is not necessarily a compliant event and

402
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:59,419
Pam went to probably well the more

403
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:03,589
compliant events she's seen just earlier

404
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:07,909
this week but it was really interesting

405
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:11,750
to see how a compliant you can do a

406
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:13,640
compliant event that has what I will say

407
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,470
the version of sampling because you

408
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,380
still had to pay for your sample being

409
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,930
very important and there was one

410
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,310
centralized retailer that everything

411
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,200
went through interesting to note it was

412
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:26,450
not a retailer that was located in

413
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,370
Sonoma County or Santa Rosa so it will

414
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:31,069
be interesting to see where those tax

415
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:32,899
the the tax implications happen there

416
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:34,399
with a retailer not based within the

417
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,240
county or the city where the event was

418
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,040
handled hmm but you got little tickets

419
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,529
and you went up and you had to pay a

420
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:44,299
dollar plus the excise tax also a little

421
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:46,490
weird since sometimes the excise tax is

422
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:50,299
embedded into the cost of the project

423
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:52,609
but that is still how it went uh this

424
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:54,680
will sort of help I think what we've

425
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:56,419
seen more recently is these pop-up

426
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,779
events that are curved and how does

427
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:02,960
product get to such an event because it

428
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:05,990
cannot come from the manufacturer or the

429
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,230
cultivator it has to go through we awake

430
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:11,960
you see it to go through a retailer so

431
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:15,860
that the taxes are taken out and then it

432
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,840
goes to the event right so um this will

433
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:20,359
kind of help streamline getting events

434
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,730
in more locations which may then help

435
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:24,199
operators to understand that they need

436
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,839
to be compliant while they're doing

437
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,759
because it's if it's held at a licensed

438
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,699
facility that the city allows there's

439
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:33,349
going to be a lot more robust regulation

440
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,090
that goes within that because it's

441
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:37,279
unfortunate with the level of pop-up

442
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:39,199
events that I've been seeing what would

443
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:42,289
happen if track and trace were truly

444
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:46,400
online yeah and you had to account for

445
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:48,649
how these samples got to an event and

446
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,740
didn't go through those proper channels

447
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,250
and just came your repair your

448
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:53,450
manufacturer and you bring your

449
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,148
manufacturing prod

450
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:58,308
to a private venue it doesn't matter

451
00:18:56,148 --> 00:19:01,729
that that's a private venue and isn't

452
00:18:58,308 --> 00:19:04,398
then eligible for going through the

453
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:07,130
event licensed rhetoric that product is

454
00:19:04,398 --> 00:19:08,599
still licensed product and needs to

455
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:14,240
follow their correct supply chain

456
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:16,730
something that 2020 does more to instill

457
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:20,028
an idea that you can have more events

458
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:21,889
that therefore are responsible I think

459
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:23,690
also there's other challenges there

460
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:25,969
though with the special event license in

461
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:29,720
general terms of the the fee per event

462
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:32,389
is a thousand dollars and I wrote an

463
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:36,460
event cap as was in the regulation like

464
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:36,459
a proposed cap of ten events per year

465
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:41,750
mmm there was talk about that on some of

466
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,210
the toy 6:41 stuff but not really not

467
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,950
not in 2020 yeah we're still well we're

468
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:49,579
I don't think we are a statutory cap I

469
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:52,720
believe it's in I know we're going back

470
00:19:49,579 --> 00:20:00,980
and forth sorry gotcha

471
00:19:52,720 --> 00:20:02,778
sidebar ultimately there's there needs

472
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,149
to be other changes to the event

473
00:20:02,778 --> 00:20:06,798
language and while we appreciate the

474
00:20:05,148 --> 00:20:08,839
fact that this language is being moved

475
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,759
in there there are some just big

476
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:12,619
questions on how events are NIF events

477
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:15,500
will work and part of that's tied into

478
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:17,418
if everything has to be sold by licensed

479
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,099
retailer and move through the supply

480
00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:22,190
chain violations distributor to that

481
00:20:19,099 --> 00:20:24,349
retailer is there what incentive is

482
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:27,048
there for retailers to take a chance on

483
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:29,119
brands they don't know if you have to

484
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:31,038
have purchased that product if you have

485
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,259
to have possession of that product for

486
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:36,138
it to be at the event at the booth of

487
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:38,298
the manufacturer or cultivator it's

488
00:20:36,138 --> 00:20:41,388
going to disincentivize you know a

489
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:44,079
desire to go and allow emerging brands

490
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:45,798
to go and be at these events

491
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,778
additionally and that's why there was

492
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:50,388
some discussion and movement on the bill

493
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:52,369
26:41 earlier this year which did not

494
00:20:50,388 --> 00:20:54,798
make it through I'm it was held in

495
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:56,658
Appropriations Committee near the end of

496
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:59,599
the year which will allowed some degree

497
00:20:56,659 --> 00:21:02,000
of farm direct consumer direct access by

498
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,548
licensed producers but even the

499
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,829
underlying issue there is there's just

500
00:21:03,548 --> 00:21:08,809
some structural issues with events

501
00:21:06,829 --> 00:21:10,849
and with running events through distro

502
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,710
through retail that I think we have to

503
00:21:10,849 --> 00:21:15,980
address before we can have a successful

504
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:18,470
fix like 26:41 or like something else is

505
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:28,579
just we have a more discussion about how

506
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:30,319
to make events work supposed to attract

507
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,849
a distributor without the ability to

508
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:46,460
provide them with a sample of their

509
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:48,439
products well I do want to talk we

510
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,110
wanted to save some time on this portion

511
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,549
too for any questions that people have

512
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:54,199
but just to burn through some other

513
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:56,240
important ones

514
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,000
there's SBA 29 which is the

515
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:02,539
compassionate care license well it's not

516
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,160
compassionate care license I know they

517
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:07,099
need to change the name of the thing and

518
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,900
it essentially it's gonna let licensed

519
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:11,000
retailers go and Disney eight fraught

520
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,790
for compassion if it stays need for

521
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,079
compassion there can be no compensation

522
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:17,480
for frog has been designated for

523
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:19,549
compassion but you will not owe your

524
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,579
sales and use tax you will not

525
00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:24,680
Oh your excise tax if it's designated at

526
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:28,189
a producer level you will not owe your

527
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:30,410
cultivation tax so there is not there it

528
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:33,049
is truly a compassionate operation there

529
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:36,290
is not a way to get revenue to go cover

530
00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:38,329
the costs of doing that but for those

531
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:40,309
that are either its product that's been

532
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:42,919
staying on the shelves for too long this

533
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:45,529
is a way to go and not be taxed on

534
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:48,980
giving that product away additionally

535
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:51,589
the compassion license bill SB 829 by

536
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:54,289
Senator Weiner the bill goes expands

537
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:56,089
who's eligible for compassion to be not

538
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,920
just people with ID cards and their

539
00:22:56,089 --> 00:23:00,289
caregivers which is current law but

540
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:03,019
statutorily expands it to be those who

541
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:05,000
ever have a recommendation and so it's

542
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:07,309
very exciting the opportunity to go and

543
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,230
be able to give cannabis to just two

544
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:12,099
recommendation holders and not the

545
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:14,960
limited ID card holder universe and then

546
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:16,819
allow businesses not to be taxed to not

547
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,100
be penalized for that compassionate

548
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:22,039
activity we think this is not the end of

549
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:24,139
the conversation certainly and we would

550
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:26,000
hope that some of these you may be able

551
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,920
to be tax-deductible in the future or

552
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,079
there could be other implications and

553
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,970
incentives but it was definitely a big

554
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:36,058
fight for compassion that we're hoping

555
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:38,879
we'll get signed in the next two weeks

556
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:40,678
SB 311 was a distributed distributor

557
00:23:38,878 --> 00:23:45,388
transfers which was just one that

558
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:47,340
somebody realized this necessary as you

559
00:23:45,388 --> 00:23:49,548
may know the way that the regulations

560
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:51,778
work now is it's the last distributor to

561
00:23:49,548 --> 00:23:53,489
distribute the test the product has to

562
00:23:51,778 --> 00:23:56,999
be the one to deliver it to the retailer

563
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:59,519
so a distributor if a retailer wanted to

564
00:23:56,999 --> 00:24:01,288
or if a manufacturer wanted to had a

565
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,909
thousand products and wanted to give a

566
00:24:01,288 --> 00:24:05,249
hundred to ten different distributors

567
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:07,219
each distributor would have to test that

568
00:24:05,249 --> 00:24:09,569
product rendering it you know

569
00:24:07,219 --> 00:24:11,548
unprofitable so this will allow

570
00:24:09,569 --> 00:24:13,739
distributors to transfer to each other

571
00:24:11,548 --> 00:24:15,749
so that the one that tests it can then

572
00:24:13,739 --> 00:24:18,509
can then transfer to another distributor

573
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:22,048
so you can have those distributed to

574
00:24:18,509 --> 00:24:23,460
more retailers and and the big question

575
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:25,558
we have with this one and I don't have

576
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,629
an answer on this is the bill is an

577
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:30,178
urgency clause urgency clause means it

578
00:24:27,628 --> 00:24:32,759
takes effect immediately this type of

579
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:34,830
idea of distorted distro transfers was

580
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:39,210
included in the Bureau regs I want to

581
00:24:34,829 --> 00:24:43,499
say 5307 but I'll have to look later but

582
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:45,119
it was it was in the Bureau regs but the

583
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:46,319
question is even though the bill takes

584
00:24:45,118 --> 00:24:48,058
effect immediately

585
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:51,509
the regulations have not been updated

586
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:54,329
and so I would not be comfortable going

587
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:57,179
in advising clients to do these distro

588
00:24:54,329 --> 00:24:58,769
distro transfers with a CoA unless

589
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:00,899
there's a signing statement or some

590
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:02,969
other indication from the bureau from

591
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:05,728
the governor's office they intend this

592
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:08,159
to go and sort of supplant the existing

593
00:25:05,729 --> 00:25:12,629
emergency regulations and allow for this

594
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:14,969
activity so you know hopefully we'll be

595
00:25:12,628 --> 00:25:16,918
able to do this sooner but if not first

596
00:25:14,969 --> 00:25:19,369
week of December it would likely be

597
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:19,369
included

598
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:49,730
because we'll send the same product to

599
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:52,519
another distributor the same product

600
00:25:49,730 --> 00:26:08,750
then again the other distributor the

601
00:25:52,519 --> 00:26:10,099
same product so SB 311 that we're just

602
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,919
discussing would go and address that

603
00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:16,099
issue by allowing the first distributor

604
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:17,299
that gets the product its final form so

605
00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:20,599
you wouldn't be able to nestle use it

606
00:26:17,298 --> 00:26:22,099
for you know flour versus flour or vs

607
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:24,918
stuff that's turned into carts or

608
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:29,028
whatnot but the first distro and tests

609
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:31,340
in its final form can go and keep that

610
00:26:29,028 --> 00:26:34,099
certificate of analysis and transfer to

611
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:37,278
distributors downstream so that if you

612
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:40,369
have you know a hundred units up in

613
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:43,069
Humboldt County then get tested up there

614
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:45,949
and then move down to move down to

615
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:47,869
Oakland and then 25 units are sold in

616
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:50,269
this of Bay Area and those who have to

617
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:53,658
get tested themselves and then the other

618
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:55,940
75 go down to LA and then 50 are sold in

619
00:26:53,659 --> 00:26:57,320
the LA area and last 25 grand San Diego

620
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,179
instead of having to test it for

621
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:01,428
different times it would all be able to

622
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:15,710
be tested and kept with that first test

623
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:17,210
up in Humboldt so so so the distro to

624
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,190
distro that's more of a supply chain

625
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:21,110
question and disorder distro transfers

626
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:23,720
we're at least solving the issue of not

627
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:26,209
having to text test it repetitively and

628
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,558
cost-prohibitive lee but you know if you

629
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:29,149
if you're destroyed does not have a

630
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:34,609
statewide infrastructure you'd have to

631
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:37,579
use multiple districts transport fee QA

632
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:39,589
fee but at least there won't be an

633
00:27:37,579 --> 00:27:41,449
additional test and with the testing

634
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:44,269
backlogs we've been getting

635
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:59,750
this will be good to not recreate that

636
00:27:44,269 --> 00:28:02,058
problem they do for non Seaway products

637
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:07,460
I mean like pre CoA product they can

638
00:28:02,058 --> 00:28:09,109
yeah product then you're just paying a

639
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,720
transport fee and then you're gonna

640
00:28:09,109 --> 00:28:13,849
ultimately pay the CEO a fee yeah

641
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,649
hopefully that distributor has statewide

642
00:28:13,849 --> 00:28:23,359
reach otherwise we're gonna be paying

643
00:28:15,648 --> 00:28:25,189
multiple it all depends on what your

644
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:30,019
needs are what your target markets are

645
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:32,659
and what the costs look like well you

646
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:34,788
can see a pathway for regional

647
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:36,080
distributors especially in areas like up

648
00:28:34,788 --> 00:28:38,720
north where you might not have

649
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,849
especially when you have smaller growers

650
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,860
or smaller manufacturers where you need

651
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:45,079
somebody to take that first chance in

652
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:47,089
the first leg of the visit those are

653
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:49,250
gonna create a real good market place

654
00:28:47,089 --> 00:28:50,990
for a regional distributor who's gonna

655
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,058
kind of take your product and wrap it

656
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:55,759
and get it to the next phase of possibly

657
00:28:53,058 --> 00:28:57,980
then going to a statewide distributor it

658
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,778
could save you money and the great you

659
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,730
know expanse of getting it through out

660
00:28:59,778 --> 00:29:03,950
in the retailers throughout the state

661
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:07,159
state but I think at that first level of

662
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:09,590
jumping it to getting it to market

663
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:11,570
you're gonna have real niches for people

664
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:13,699
to we're gonna do products in the market

665
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:15,619
it depends on what your footprint is

666
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:19,159
right when you're first releasing a

667
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:20,599
product typically you're gonna try to do

668
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:22,610
it in a market share that you can

669
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:24,859
control versus trying to saturate the

670
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:27,079
entire market at first so that's about

671
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:29,359
business dynamics and growing your

672
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:30,918
business scaling up as to what that's

673
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:32,719
going to be like because if you also

674
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:34,669
then just do a straight to market

675
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,860
strategy and try to saturate the state

676
00:29:34,669 --> 00:29:37,350
can you scale up and provide the state

677
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,609
so some

678
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:40,709
time's it's gonna be who view to use a

679
00:29:38,609 --> 00:29:43,558
regional distributor to get your name

680
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:45,120
out there first and then you know expand

681
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:47,970
to markets that you think that you would

682
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:50,819
do well in you may not want to be in

683
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:53,130
every single retailer across the state

684
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:57,019
you may want to target so many other

685
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,020
questions in the last few moments with

686
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:03,769
okay

687
00:30:18,509 --> 00:30:20,899
really

688
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:25,150
let's say there's only 24

689
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:28,920
Wow

690
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,230
so many operations in terms of

691
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:42,380
shouldn't there be organized or state or

692
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:42,380
anyone really

693
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:12,340
already we're looking at the issue of

694
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:15,790
the number of testing labs and who can

695
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:17,049
pass phase 2 January 1 we move into

696
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:19,089
phase 3

697
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:23,079
how many labs are prepared to do phase 3

698
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:31,959
testing right now may wait which one do

699
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:33,699
you think is is on steep oh that's deep

700
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:39,460
hill

701
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:43,120
we might have one lab in the state in

702
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:45,519
the state that's ready for Gen 1 testing

703
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:46,289
they'll be clear when phase 2 testing

704
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,319
right now

705
00:31:46,289 --> 00:31:54,069
phase 3 testing or Gen 1 testing adds in

706
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:57,399
heavy metals ads in mycotoxins adds in

707
00:31:54,069 --> 00:32:04,589
some residual water content is there one

708
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:04,590
more all the mycotoxins

709
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,069
I want to make sure right now that my

710
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:17,230
products are ready for January 1 I want

711
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:20,019
to get phase 3 tested right now so I'm

712
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:24,190
ready to go and back stock you can't you

713
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:26,619
can't be prepared for that anticipated

714
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:31,029
labs that are saying they'll be ready by

715
00:32:26,619 --> 00:32:33,639
January 1 15 maybe how many are we at

716
00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:35,849
now I was trying to pull up the actual

717
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:43,720
number of labs on my life

718
00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:47,079
err net here's bad expensive and what

719
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:50,740
happens if this one lab or maybe upwards

720
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:52,779
of 15 get it and their equipment goes

721
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:55,150
down and as Julie always likes to point

722
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:56,859
out you can't then send your sample

723
00:32:55,150 --> 00:33:00,310
somewhere else please note that this

724
00:32:56,859 --> 00:33:03,399
testing lab one of the 15 let's hope or

725
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:04,399
one on and that piece of equipment which

726
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,830
is so

727
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,600
and we know that expensive equipment

728
00:33:06,829 --> 00:33:10,449
fails ask hospitals they go through this

729
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:14,389
all the time they're able to send

730
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:16,220
samples out so that you don't lose the

731
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:18,380
life right this is everything a bit

732
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,269
distributed distributor transfer period

733
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,370
we'd previously there's no lab the lab

734
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:24,558
transfer where they can be like ah dang

735
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:31,549
we're down can you do this no code I

736
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:35,750
can't is anyone asking for it I mean

737
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:37,819
some of they're asking for that but it

738
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:39,349
was also that even if it's the same lab

739
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:41,269
so a lab like steep hill that has

740
00:33:39,349 --> 00:33:42,619
multiple location yeah the way that it

741
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,750
was they couldn't transfer it to another

742
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:48,799
of their own location

743
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:51,019
so hopefully that part gets settled lab

744
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,149
till that lab to a different lab might

745
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:55,490
just make somebody's brain explode so

746
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:58,009
yeah absolutely at least in a lab would

747
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,990
be able to send it to its own you know

748
00:33:58,009 --> 00:34:01,940
remote location if they didn't have the

749
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:04,190
piece of equipment but but as you're

750
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,019
saying yeah it would make sense but I'm

751
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:08,898
sorry the open the other thing that I

752
00:34:06,019 --> 00:34:10,820
would say is obviously we're having this

753
00:34:08,898 --> 00:34:12,138
huge problem of labs and you send it to

754
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,730
the same lab three times and there's

755
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:16,039
different results so as much as there's

756
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,699
an urgency to say oh my god we need more

757
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:19,070
labs

758
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:20,839
I for one would have concerns of the

759
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:24,879
fact that they will issue a license to a

760
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,879
lab before it's accredited so

761
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:43,280
yeah well let me let me debunk that the

762
00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:45,378
highest percentage of those fails was

763
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,269
the label claims right so it's important

764
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:50,000
to read into that that it's not like oh

765
00:34:47,269 --> 00:34:53,239
my god it's all poison it's that most of

766
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,280
it is not hitting that 10% window right

767
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:57,618
of label claims which is an incredibly

768
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,329
difficult target to hit especially when

769
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:08,568
you're dealing with low dose items it

770
00:34:59,329 --> 00:35:10,970
was a 60 60 percent were label yeah 60%

771
00:35:08,568 --> 00:35:12,858
of the fails were of label claim

772
00:35:10,969 --> 00:35:15,828
failures label claim failures can be

773
00:35:12,858 --> 00:35:18,889
from being outside of the percentages or

774
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:21,318
it can be having a claim of medicinal

775
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:24,318
benefits or impacts that can that

776
00:35:21,318 --> 00:35:27,769
they're not allowed to go into 60

777
00:35:24,318 --> 00:35:37,460
percent of the 20 percent failures 60

778
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:40,818
percent of those were label claim some

779
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:43,190
was ingredients some where there was a

780
00:35:40,818 --> 00:35:45,710
breakdown in one of the things but like

781
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:48,139
you're saying for the public at large

782
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:50,329
where everybody only reads the headline

783
00:35:48,139 --> 00:35:54,199
and goes oh my god California is

784
00:35:50,329 --> 00:35:56,329
poisoning everybody terrible opportunity

785
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:58,969
to bring back our original panel which

786
00:35:56,329 --> 00:36:01,400
is the comment so when those 15 days

787
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:03,679
come these critical 15 days and you

788
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:06,619
don't see that they've addressed testing

789
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:08,568
or any of these other concepts that we

790
00:36:06,619 --> 00:36:11,119
talked about that are so important it is

791
00:36:08,568 --> 00:36:12,949
that they hear from the operators and

792
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,170
the public that says look this is a

793
00:36:12,949 --> 00:36:17,689
concern to us you need to address it

794
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:21,889
that's like the last time that you have

795
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:23,630
to be citizen empowering and tell them

796
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:26,389
you didn't address the right things

797
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:28,579
right and get in there or we want a

798
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:30,219
compassion license if they compassion

799
00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:32,590
bill passes and

800
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:35,108
they don't do a compassion fee reduction

801
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:36,880
to allow licensees that maybe go through

802
00:36:35,108 --> 00:36:38,650
a social equity program to not pay it

803
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,869
the same fees at the state level that

804
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:43,510
everybody else pays that's your window

805
00:36:40,869 --> 00:36:46,869
and if we get some of these bills passed

806
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:49,270
that give you more of a foundation to

807
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:51,010
make the app then make the app so don't

808
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:52,719
think it's over I don't think that that

809
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:56,230
can be understated because it's gonna be

810
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:58,358
15 days possibly during Thanksgiving

811
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:00,039
where people aren't paying attention we

812
00:36:58,358 --> 00:37:02,049
need to pay attention it's the last 15

813
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:04,179
days we're gonna have before we have to

814
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:07,150
make legislative action to fix well and

815
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:09,549
and the one thing is that and and this

816
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:11,650
will feel bit shameless their public

817
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:13,269
comment period is always you know those

818
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:14,920
are always times for public to weigh in

819
00:37:13,269 --> 00:37:17,139
and you'll try to do a mass-market

820
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:20,559
approach and where they are required to

821
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:23,858
review and respond to comments I'm a

822
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:26,079
registered lobbyist it's my job as a

823
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:28,779
lobbyist to go and talk to an heir faced

824
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:30,759
with regulators and have private

825
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,680
discussions and try to go work on these

826
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,869
questions during the times that aren't

827
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:37,239
the public comment periods I know that

828
00:37:34,869 --> 00:37:38,920
my attorney friends here also go and

829
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:40,659
have these private conversations too and

830
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,849
a good attorney will be able to go and

831
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:45,069
have that engagement but the public

832
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:47,650
comment period is important but also

833
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:50,320
having whether it's lobbying or

834
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,088
consultant or legal counsel that is

835
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,070
actually going to work with you on

836
00:37:52,088 --> 00:37:56,409
talking to and engaging with the

837
00:37:54,070 --> 00:38:00,838
regulator's on your questions is

838
00:37:56,409 --> 00:38:04,118
critical as opposed to because because

839
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:05,559
you know anyone can go and submit public

840
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:07,630
comments but it's about following

841
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:10,358
through between the pot comment periods

842
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:12,039
to hammer your point home is really you

843
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:15,039
know how to go move the needle we I

844
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:17,829
think we've all think folks remember the

845
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:20,920
disappearance of the acreage cap between

846
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:22,598
the sequent and the regulations that

847
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:25,030
came out the emergency regs that came

848
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:27,010
out two days later Monday was their

849
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:31,019
Thursday it was gone

850
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:31,020
that's lobbying and so

851
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,809
[Music]

852
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:45,180
when you can make a delivery order out

853
00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:48,929
of your trunk in a car anywhere in

854
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:51,480
California that's lobbying yeah I got

855
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:54,239
the drive-through licenses a bead for

856
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,280
that so you can do it what makes our job

857
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:59,639
easier sometimes is to see that ground

858
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,019
swelling of support but it strategically

859
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:02,819
you want to be working with your

860
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:04,650
consultants with your attorneys and then

861
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:08,190
also making public comment because it's

862
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:10,980
the trifecta of not coming together that

863
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:14,150
that forces action I personally see you

864
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,150
Courtney how would you on time

865
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:41,449
