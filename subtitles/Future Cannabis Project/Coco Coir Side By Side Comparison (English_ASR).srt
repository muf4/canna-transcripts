1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,839
okay so we're preparing to transplant a

2
00:00:05,878 --> 00:00:11,839
whole bunch of clones into

3
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:14,080
cocoa the

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:17,439
coy and

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,679
so what do we have going on over here we

6
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:24,278
have a Thrive alive

7
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:27,118
kelp uh fertilizer that is high in B

8
00:00:24,278 --> 00:00:29,559
vitamins to help transplant shock so

9
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:32,479
that the plants can transplant smoothly

10
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:33,799
into their new homes okay um we're also

11
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,000
going to add a little bit of sulfur to

12
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:37,799
this and we're going to add some

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,399
tricoderma fungus as well which will

14
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:46,280
help fight off any uh fungal root

15
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:48,558
diseases as well as any um mil Andor um

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,960
small delicate sucking insects like

17
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,959
russet mites

18
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:02,239
um and then today we're uh we're testing

19
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:04,399
two different types of uh or two

20
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:08,759
different brands of cocoa Coy right

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,560
correct yeah um we're testing one brand

22
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:13,400
from Global Horticulture Industries

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,159
they're a local provider here in the

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,080
Carpenteria Valley they provide to most

25
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,840
of the flower farmers in Santa Barbara

26
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:23,319
County in general in general um and then

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:27,000
we're testing out California substrates

28
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:29,478
uh which is a pH buffered um that has

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,118
calcium magnesium added into the cocoa

30
00:01:29,478 --> 00:01:33,519
as well as it's been washed so that it

31
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:36,000
won't have any dust and um the claim

32
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:37,679
with California substrates is that you

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,879
can plant into it without needing to

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:45,640
pretreat your

35
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:45,640
cocoa and then over

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,759
here so what is it on the right is the

37
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:53,759
California substrates

38
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,759
right

39
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:02,520

40
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,599
of California substrates and one row of

41
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:05,798
what was the other

42
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:10,680
