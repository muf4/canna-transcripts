00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,678
i'm steve campbell with greenlight

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,519
productions um we're here to walk around

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:09,599
liberty talk shop

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:11,359
retro facility here in pahrump nevada

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,240
and it's amazing we haven't even really

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:16,719
cracked the the real secrets or that

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,359
yeah so uh well actually maybe we have

8
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,879
because we're

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,199
starting to talk about the compost and

10
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,679
what makes the the plants grow so yeah

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,519
so we're

12
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:24,640
about to step into that area are you

13
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:26,159
guys good over here this is the

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,839
greenhouse project future greenhouse

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,480
project by the startup again

16
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,359
well um i can see it because we've been

17
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,640
talking

18
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,520
but we're talking next year three years

19
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,200
out

20
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,719
so we've actually been planning this for

21
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,399
about two years um

22
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,399
we really were gonna hit hard early this

23
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,200
year but then the covet thing hit

24
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,039
so we pumped the brakes um now that that

25
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,120
hype is kind of settling down

26
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,160
we're confident to start this project

27
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,000
back up again

28
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:53,198
uh so we're hoping to start getting

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,759
things ordered here the next several

30
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:55,759
weeks

31
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:57,359
oh excellent yeah hopefully yeah it

32
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,759
looks like you guys already

33
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,719
prepared the slab so it's just pouring

34
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,719
steel structure

35
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,239
like the rest so that goes up quick yeah

36
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,920
it's it'll be really relatively quick i

37
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,880
think about six months time period from

38
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,040
start to finish

39
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,478
uh so by next summer we should be um if

40
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,960
everything goes right we should be

41
00:01:10,478 --> 00:01:15,438
having our first sun ground crop by late

42
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,438
next summer

43
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,640
perfect timing it'd be nice

44
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,280
uh this uh all right so this is

45
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,719
basically this is the the

46
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,478
we're currently operating again it's

47
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,640
about 12 thousand square foot

48
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,719
uh indoor space and then over here to

49
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,840
the right this is just our storage space

50
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,959
this is where we just kind of store all

51
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,880
of our amendments

52
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,640
um i have a little pad over here where

53
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,798
we do most of our compost not most we do

54
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,320
all our composting

55
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,920
is your compost over here can we take a

56
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,959
look i don't have any compost right now

57
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,118
because we just got through

58
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,478
well i have some indoors but we're not

59
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,399
composting right now because the summer

60
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,078
time the summer heat

61
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,359
so talk a little bit about your compost

62
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:55,279
what you were talking about the timing

63
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,840
of it when you do do it and what your

64
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,359
process

65
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,040
is so over here it looks like you have

66
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,840
some of your feedstock uh

67
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,200
probably some biochar some alfalfa looks

68
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,759
like some straw

69
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,680
yep i'm not sure what's in the other um

70
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,280
so that's a couple totes that peat moss

71
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,039
left over from when we did that big soil

72
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,800
mix and then we have a couple totes or a

73
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,958
couple of soil bags of a pumice

74
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,680
from that same soil mix but then you're

75
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,080
right we have uh both alfalfa and straw

76
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,840
uh and then uh yeah just trying to store

77
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,280
distorted various amendments dry and

78
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,239
you're right biochar is a great black

79
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,640
one great

80
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,560
space like honestly you've got to have

81
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,759
space because when you need it

82
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,199
that's that bulk 100 yeah yeah

83
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,479
uh i mean it's a little messed up here

84
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,958
now i got to clean up a little bit we've

85
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,439
got a

86
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,120
looks like trim which is being dried so

87
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:40,000
you can add to the compost as well so

88
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,519
yeah so this is our

89
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
official composting area this is where

90
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,519
we start we store all our dry amendments

91
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,120
um so any of our cannabis leaf stem

92
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,800
uh we actually get a little bit of

93
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,840
manure we store dry

94
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,120
oak um for for our brown um

95
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,519
and then we basically store it all here

96
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,560
and then you see some of our pallets

97
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,920
with meshes

98
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,360
um some of our compost fences uh our

99
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:07,759
cages and then uh yeah

100
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,680
do you it looks like uh these are

101
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,000
movable you got a forklift

102
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,080
do you utilize that in the composting

103
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,639
process the turning or is it just in

104
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,000
finish no we don't really use a forklift

105
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,279
form to be honest we just use that to

106
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
get them off the ground so we just build

107
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,280
our little pallets

108
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,719
yeah for the bottom yeah uh

109
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,158
but yeah this is our leaf system at

110
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:26,878
least we've been storing and drying all

111
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:28,239
summer

112
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:29,759
um again we're about to fire up the

113
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,640
composting process so about to burn

114
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:32,878
through all these

115
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,199
and this uh how much are we looking at

116
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,439
this this is the product i mean this is

117
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,679
not much is it or and what are we

118
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,039
looking at um this is the the water leaf

119
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,840
uh i couldn't tell you

120
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:47,919
uh you got a little swarovski pack yeah

121
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,840
uh yeah i couldn't tell you but we had

122
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,598
the paperwork that i pointed to though

123
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,039
so you have to are you gonna put it in

124
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,919
the compost you don't have to destroy it

125
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,598
you have to

126
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,199
so this is just drying out this is about

127
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:58,000
to get all scooped up and put in a bag

128
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,839
like this

129
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,840
and if you look at this this is

130
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,878
so we store everything dry just like

131
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:10,479
elaine it teaches in her classes

132
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:12,878
um so now this is just like the leaves

133
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,479
and the fall right you collect them you

134
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,399
have them stored dried

135
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:17,918
they're prepped and waiting to be then

136
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,959
utilized in your compost when you're

137
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,439
ready to build it

138
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,959
pretty much and then here yeah again

139
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:24,560
usually this corner back here would be

140
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,599
filled with oak or some type of brown

141
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,360
material

142
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,639
inside those trash bags just unused

143
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,080
cannabis stem

144
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,439
a lot of this stuff gets chopped and

145
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,279
dropped on our beds but our beds can

146
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,600
only take so much at once

147
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,439
without smothering them so that's why we

148
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,360
have to take some of this stuff out here

149
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,120
and dry it out here and incorporate it

150
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,240
in the composting process

151
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,759
um but overall this is where this is

152
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,879
probably one of my funner places of the

153
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,240
whole facility

154
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,839
especially this time of year when it's

155
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,639
starting to cool off we can actually get

156
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:52,079
going out here

157
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,400
with composting you'll see me out here

158
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,879
quite a bit so when you are flipping

159
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,039
your

160
00:04:54,879 --> 00:05:02,319
your pillars is it more of a uh

161
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:06,240
aggro style or is it more

162
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:08,000
like here you go floppy over my

163
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,439
my first couple piles i was more

164
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,160
crossfit in my

165
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,279
in my methods uh it definitely went a

166
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,039
little hardcore

167
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,279
uh hurt my shoulder at one point yeah i

168
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,918
blew out my freaking rotator cuff yeah

169
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,519
you have your uh your bandages off yeah

170
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:24,560
and i'm gonna air out today

171
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:26,319
yeah yeah that hair out um but now i i

172
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,160
i actually have a style of flipping it

173
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,759
now inside out top to bottom

174
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,199
that really turns it nice you got to

175
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,840
take her too it's a flow

176
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,759
yeah um i noticed too that there's a

177
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,839
down pressure like when you're going in

178
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,120
so it doesn't just fall apart yeah like

179
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,159
you come in and you push

180
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,319
down not just lift yeah and so

181
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,680
because you're really just trying to

182
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,519
you're not making a mess

183
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,959
you know you're literally just creating

184
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:50,799
oxygen and aeration

185
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,239
and i'm real big on getting that outside

186
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,680
in the inside out

187
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,879
you know so i'm always trying to

188
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,519
separate the pile when i re-flip it

189
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,079
but yeah smart you got to work it all in

190
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,680
working

191
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,359
dude this looks great and uh excellent

192
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,800
work area looks like some river rock and

193
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,879
this is probably for the new beds coming

194
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,439
in so you boil this access river rock

195
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:10,800
in all my beds inside i have uh we throw

196
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,319
various piles of rock

197
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,919
in in the corners or the middle of the

198
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,720
beds just to create like a rock mulch

199
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,120
environment

200
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,880
um the the the consistency the moisture

201
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,439
consistency under the rock stays the

202
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,038
same

203
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,439
it doesn't dry out as fast it doesn't

204
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,360
get as wet um so you tend to see more

205
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,240
worms and just more biology right into

206
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,520
the rocks but

207
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:33,759
they're diverse ecosystems within within

208
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:35,198
an isolated island yeah have their

209
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,639
little rock mole show yeah it just gives

210
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,560
a different environment for things

211
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,400
and because it's not organic it doesn't

212
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,240
actually contribute to

213
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:43,679
like pill bugs or you know something

214
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,918
like that yeah

215
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,199
so which we have which i love i don't

216
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,198
think that it lasts for years

217
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,038
they're here well you just got to feed

218
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,879
them enough yeah you know or or they'll

219
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,519
start eating other things yeah yeah

220
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:59,360
so excellent man well thank you so much

221
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:03,839
for sharing outside let's go inside

222
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,840
you got it

223
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,918
so you guys are going to have to uh you

224
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,160
guys got your ids yep

225
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:14,159
now we will figure out the whole process

226
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:20,239
yeah

227
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,519
so what's your uh process um you guys

228
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,280
gonna put booties on

229
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:24,799
and then i'm gonna go in here and hang

230
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,079
out for me and i'll get you guys some

231
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,560
scrubs and i'll get you guys all

232
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,560
scrubbed up

233
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,598
so i can feel the air coming out this is

234
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,079
part of

235
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,759
your hvac but we were talking about you

236
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:40,639
you don't actually use much

237
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,439
like you're very efficient system uh

238
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,360
you'll see

239
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,719
how how use this is its own unit in here

240
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,080
everything has controlled air no we

241
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,080
don't share air in any of our rooms

242
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,479
so yeah this is just the office space so

243
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,039
the big thing here is just make sure you

244
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:55,359
have

245
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,079
clean filters obviously high grade

246
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,479
filters

247
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,399
and then purification so have to some

248
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,639
type of ubc light in your duct work

249
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,598
make sure that you're cleaning the air

250
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,840
all right so this

251
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,279
this is the uh basically the kind of the

252
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,638
beginning of a tour i guess this is our

253
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,318
open locker room

254
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,478
um so we kind of did like an open locker

255
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,720
room to try to avoid theft and

256
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,560
and uh things like that so open locker

257
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,199
room with clear lockers really

258
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,079
makes that kind of hard to no pushback

259
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,919
by anybody

260
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,680
no that was just dressing room so open

261
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,318
locker room was with private dressing

262
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,240
rooms was it

263
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,759
was the idea here employee break room

264
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,478
down there some offices from

265
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,320
for my wife um nothing too fancy then we

266
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,199
got our security booth right here

267
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,200
uh he has access

268
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,080
food very nice break room by the way and

269
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,838
you have pastries there

270
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,200
for your saturday crew which is like

271
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,040
really so nice

272
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,160
so it's usually they take care of some

273
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,719
will bring them and take care of each

274
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,639
other

275
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,000
uh but in a security booth here he's all

276
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,039
behind ballistic glass

277
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,639
um ballistic walls access to all the

278
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,039
cameras uh

279
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,720
requirements he's all he's all legit um

280
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,159
over here is our sally port we're just

281
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,278
pretty much just saw our materials

282
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:07,039
nothing really to see there um

283
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:08,159
i know uh this is our trim room uh we'll

284
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,958
we'll go to the sink right here and

285
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,159
we'll wash up

286
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:16,239
hey everybody what's up guys

287
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:23,838
hi good morning

288
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,839
i'm just wash up right here

289
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,000
so talk to you about your trimming

290
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,120
everything's hand trimmed yeah all hand

291
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,360
trimmed um in a nice

292
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,320
environmentally controlled room so we're

293
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,159
not

294
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,920
we're not deteriorating our product as

295
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,838
we're trying to clean it up so

296
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,679
are they like do you have trim days are

297
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,920
they busy is it like every day

298
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,519
no we typically run five days a week um

299
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:55,120
then if we're backed up we'll have a

300
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,720
an excess of strain or something like

301
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,278
that we'll offer overtime on the

302
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,278
weekends

303
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,559
i think it looks like we had a crew take

304
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:01,919
us up on the offer this weekend so we

305
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,278
got the whole crew showed up

306
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,879
or at least a lot of them um

307
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,519
yes this is it sounds like a real quick

308
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,759
turnover from your processing

309
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,560
um from pulling down the flour to in the

310
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,639
jar

311
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,919
not not pulling down the flour but out

312
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,879
of cure

313
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,078
like how long before it's on this shelf

314
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,200
um typically for us

315
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:25,759
uh i would say roughly four weeks four

316
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,759
or five weeks

317
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,159
so it really it's a 14 day drive period

318
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,679
uh then we trim it up

319
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,919
takes about a week to trim it up before

320
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,519
it gets tested then a week for testing

321
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,958
uh so that puts us in about four weeks

322
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,959
before we can package it and then on the

323
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:42,319
fifth week it's packaged and sold

324
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,599
uh yeah so and depending on strains some

325
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,120
trains you hold back on

326
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,560
i mean they need more time some training

327
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,799
to try to put out in a hurry because you

328
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:51,919
know those chirps don't last as long

329
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:54,479
so fruity stuff goes out first it's kind

330
00:10:51,919 --> 00:11:01,199
of the rule of thumb

331
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:03,600
fruity goes first there you go

332
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,440
yeah that that sweet tone is lost and

333
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,879
then it gets that tartness yeah which i

334
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,959
kind of like sometimes and spicy they

335
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,879
taste a little spicy sometimes too

336
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,639
so so one thing we had to recently do is

337
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,078
we actually expanded our trim room um

338
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,439
where you see that wall cut out that was

339
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,838
actually a wall at one point

340
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,440
uh and then and then we have another

341
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,720
four thousand square foot beyond that

342
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,839
wall that we're gonna expand into for

343
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,680
more dry space

344
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,760
um with our future greenhouse and our

345
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,479
future uh flower room indoor flower

346
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,078
rooms

347
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,920
but for now we just did this little pop

348
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:31,679
out um what happened was

349
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,439
we changed our lights out got some new

350
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,239
leds some new focus leds and we had

351
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,959
almost

352
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,240
a 50 to 100 increase on some strains so

353
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,078
basically we had to build a whole new

354
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,519
dry room and hold more trim space

355
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,159
just to be able to handle the extra

356
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,039
weight so now weight

357
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,399
in bud set or weight in like biomass

358
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,719
growth

359
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,600
overall bud set and and just overall

360
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,120
pre-roll

361
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,320
all every every part of the plants

362
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,839
volume when that both are pre-raw

363
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,839
material our durable material

364
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,479
so yeah we had we had uh like i said a

365
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,839
100 increase on some trains um

366
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,200
minimum 50 increase across the board uh

367
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,880
but anyway so yeah we did that and we

368
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,000
have our little trial hash station over

369
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,360
there that we're building out right now

370
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,039
just got all our final little

371
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,720
tools in tell us about the next

372
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,399
adventure yeah you guys can go check it

373
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,720
out

374
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,440
take it by real quick guys hey jason my

375
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,440
name is real quick

376
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
sorry

377
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,639
so this is uh this is just a temporary

378
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,799
little area this isn't a hash

379
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,000
lab that we're content with but you're

380
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:35,679
gonna transition

381
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,679
or at least use some of your your

382
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:40,000
produce right

383
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,439
and turn it into hash so the idea is

384
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,839
right now we don't have a very big

385
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,639
volume to work with for to launch a hash

386
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,920
line

387
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,440
but what we're going to use the little

388
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,919
bit of volume we do have with is to do

389
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,240
the r

390
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,759
d in preparation for our greenhouse

391
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,120
project and the rest of our indoor so

392
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:54,879
when that time does come

393
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,320
now we have some experience we know how

394
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:58,000
to make it the most efficient

395
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,440
the best hash we can with what we had to

396
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,440
work with

397
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,720
and scale up from there perfect so

398
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,519
that's what this is we went with the

399
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,639
bruteless

400
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,399
washing vessels we got the the

401
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,240
sasquatch ross and press with the

402
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,360
harvest right freeze dryer

403
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,680
so we got all the cool tools got some

404
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,879
big freezers in the sally port um so we

405
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,879
should be able to make some

406
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,919
some nice stuff here here we got another

407
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,919
dry room check this out

408
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,000
that looks new yeah this is none of this

409
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:25,759
has been used yet this is all

410
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:31,200
just installed fresh fresh

411
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:31,200
toys pretty much this oh you got it

412
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,278
so do you do your like the pre-rolls in

413
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,639
here you have a pre-roll day and then

414
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,320
everything that type of stuff is done

415
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,440
yeah right now we just have a handful of

416
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,519
people trimming

417
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,120
um but usually usually during the week

418
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,399
we have a full staff out here we have

419
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,120
trimmers pre-rollers

420
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,559
packagers uh we'll have 20-plus people

421
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,959
in here so this is like your

422
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,319
production room for that yeah this this

423
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,078
was just a weekend crew who wanted it

424
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,720
who wanted the overtime kind of thing

425
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:57,919
uh you know so uh typically there's a

426
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,480
lot more people in here though usually

427
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,599
there's

428
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,039
a there's an ask in every seat uh this

429
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,480
is our new dry room that we just built

430
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,000
out we've yet to use it

431
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,560
um but to give you guys an idea what

432
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,559
we've got going on

433
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,000
okay yeah

434
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,198
so completely all controlled through our

435
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,320
iponics

436
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,759
um we have uh intake we've got

437
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,839
our fans not on there but we have an

438
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,399
intake fan exhaust fan

439
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,519
through us through a carbon filter ozone

440
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,240
generator

441
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,078
when needed carbon filters in here to

442
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,600
filter out any contaminants um

443
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:37,278
ac unit humidifier dehumidifier

444
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,159
um so we can keep all those parameters

445
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:42,879
that we're aiming at

446
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,240
the green lights green lights help help

447
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:46,639
keep down the uh

448
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,000
the degradation of the plant so that way

449
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,360
when we put the plant in here it's it

450
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,600
stays sleek enough to not

451
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,720
degrade yeah uh 14 days

452
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,079
that's our desired time and this will

453
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,519
clear out

454
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:03,439
is this for each bay like like a cycle

455
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,560
so basically um there's two dry rooms

456
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,880
per bay

457
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,239
um so i'll fill this is each one of

458
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,559
these i have two dry rooms they each

459
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,320
represent a week

460
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,599
so i fill one one week i feel one the

461
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,560
next week and then the third week this

462
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,320
one's empty again

463
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,159
and this room looks like it's super easy

464
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,519
to

465
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:22,879
reset to to sterilize and break down is

466
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,639
a huge part of the design

467
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,559
um the only real issue that we had that

468
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,480
i didn't like was where the car the

469
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:29,838
placement of this fan filter is

470
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,120
but the reason we had to do that the

471
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,519
reason it's upside down like that is

472
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,360
because

473
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,159
the other side of this wall is the ac

474
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,680
unit so we had to work around it

475
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:38,719
so that that's the only pain in the butt

476
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,679
in this room that's going to be able to

477
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,600
clean it and change

478
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,758
that filter up there uh but other than

479
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,360
that uh it's meant to just be able to be

480
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,360
sprayed down and washed down easily

481
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,078
oh you gotta agree degrees are cool

482
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,839
agreed

483
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,759
so um so does the whole place close down

484
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,399
by

485
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,000
by five is that like typically we run

486
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,120
five days a week i try to we try to run

487
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,559
this place like a regular business give

488
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,519
people their lives we were talking about

489
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,919
the light cycle

490
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,679
that that was yeah yeah because of the

491
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,240
light bulb okay but that was just

492
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,919
the yeah that's just the driving room so

493
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,759
our flowering rooms are typically

494
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,198
our lights are off to five that's why

495
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,720
you guys are limited yesterday

496
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:26,399
uh actually one of my rooms is off at

497
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,120
four um it's a little further in the

498
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:37,839
cycle so we

499
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:37,839
knock another hour off

500
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,480
oh this is this is just a light eagle 20

501
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,919
avid mix just to make sure we kill

502
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,560
anything that you guys could be bringing

503
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,360
in

504
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,319
uh just to be safe you know safety

505
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,720
tasted first

506
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,480
it's just a dr bronner's and essential

507
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,959
oil from build a soil so it says

508
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,920
pretty much in a smell lemongrass and

509
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,439
i'm mainly spraying

510
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,198
i'm just spraying your legs just in case

511
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,318
you walked in with anything

512
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:06,399
uh because you guys usually have same

513
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,838
shoes on

514
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,759
um let's just do a quick rinse right

515
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,119
here or

516
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,078
we're supposed to wash our hands again

517
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,078
so i'd use the alcohol

518
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,078
so for your sops it's

519
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,119
enter every room wash your hands usually

520
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:24,720
we'll skip the vent

521
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,879
the the trim room so my growers will

522
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,880
skip that and just come right to here

523
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,600
but we walked the trim room so we had to

524
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,760
wash there and wash here so examination

525
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:37,439
vector yeah this is listen i really

526
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,440
appreciate this this is actually amazing

527
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,559
so tell me about the little ones oh yeah

528
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,160
welcome to our bedroom

529
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,160
uh so yeah these are just planted a

530
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,200
couple days ago out the clone dome so

531
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,200
they're just kind of working through

532
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,240
their stress of

533
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,759
of getting into their new environment

534
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,038
uh this is just one round this is

535
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,798
actually in preparation for one of our

536
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:58,720
we have a slightly smaller room out of

537
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:01,918
our three rotation rooms

538
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,558
so this is for one of our smaller rooms

539
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,520
so let's talk about what's in the in the

540
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,000
pot

541
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,119
these are a transition from clone are

542
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,599
you you're not growing out

543
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,798
would you like to no okay you're not

544
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,839
growing out of rockwool

545
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:17,599
are you no um we do unfortunately

546
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,480
currently use that's one of the only

547
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,759
limiting factors that

548
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,919
are not limiting factors but then one of

549
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,919
the variables we have is that we're

550
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,120
using um

551
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,799
uh riot router type plugs

552
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,479
so we were using which is a peat moss

553
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,319
base with some type of adhesive

554
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,160
um so it still breaks down in the system

555
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,960
not very fast and it's not something i

556
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,919
want to use but

557
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,679
they it implies a lot quicker yeah i

558
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,559
actually have some that i'm testing like

559
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,798
literally just

560
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,160
put into worm bins where there's so much

561
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,079
life it's crazy

562
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,360
and they're still there the best thing

563
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,678
i've seen to break them down

564
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,599
is the bird's nest mushrooms so if you

565
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,720
ever see birds nest mushrooms collect

566
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,879
those little seeds

567
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,798
and put those in your beds they love

568
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,760
riot rooters dude see how

569
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,160
beautiful thank you all right so we have

570
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:02,640
those

571
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,000
put into a living soil or uh so what

572
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,600
these are is basically

573
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,038
when we when we plant our beds the

574
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,639
little bit of soil that we take out of

575
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,319
our beds to make room for these

576
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,640
we take back and then those go back into

577
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:13,599
the pots so and we just rotate our holes

578
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,440
every cycle so

579
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,599
we never dig we never pull the root ball

580
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,960
we plant right we dig right next to it

581
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,879
and then we let the root ball break down

582
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,160
then the next cycle that's what we take

583
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,640
um but yeah so these plug then is used

584
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,640
to

585
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,320
foster the growth and then it allows you

586
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,679
that transition back into

587
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,519
so this is the same soil that's in our

588
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,320
bed so this is 20 second cycle living

589
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:34,720
soil

590
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,639
um this is off the top of the soil so

591
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,640
this is a high concentration of

592
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,320
of uh worm castings in this in this mix

593
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,080
here which is nice at this

594
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,000
because these are still shocked they

595
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,519
they that helps with the shock stress

596
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,679
are you seeing the shock stress

597
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,879
right this is about it right now you

598
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,798
again they're planted

599
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,240
three days ago so this is we're

600
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:53,200
literally in the heat of the stress

601
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,880
right now

602
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,080
uh so in about three days they should

603
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,200
start coming back to normal and start

604
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:58,960
showing some growth

605
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,960
um right now they're just adjusting to

606
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,558
their new environment um and like you

607
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,319
said

608
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,158
that's totally i'm talking about when it

609
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:09,119
transitions to the beds oh

610
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,559
because this ecosystem is so similar to

611
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,479
what they're going into because it's

612
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:14,399
just been removed for a short time yeah

613
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,640
are you seeing the heat the transition

614
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,440
stress is there um and you'll always see

615
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,360
some because you're

616
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,960
cutting off the root hair yeah there's

617
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,079
there's there's other variables that

618
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,759
we've we've ran across

619
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,599
um like recently we changed our lights

620
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,200
up so we planted into rooms

621
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,959
with that new variable that we had to

622
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,159
adjust to like oh too much light too

623
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,880
little light because it's a whole new

624
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,039
system

625
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,039
um so we've had to adapt that fine

626
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,439
we're refined tuning now after after uh

627
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,440
five plus years we just

628
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,640
changed the biggest uh input the whole

629
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,240
facility the lights

630
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,000
so now we have to kind of re-figure

631
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,519
things out again and kind of refine tune

632
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,480
but for the most part yeah we love in

633
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,599
every part of it

634
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,038
uh and these beds here uh from my

635
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:54,879
understanding this is part of what

636
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,038
you're using for your cloning process

637
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,280
yes sir all right so tell us tell us

638
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:02,879
what's happening so yeah so we try to

639
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,720
we try to not or try to grow as much of

640
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,640
the inputs that we use as possible

641
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,759
so aloe is one of the things that we use

642
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,679
the most um

643
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,279
as you guys know as high in salicylic

644
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,200
acid um good sapping

645
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:14,319
so it's uh it's just a good thing to

646
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,200
both feed the

647
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:18,639
the plant get yeah you're fine yeah and

648
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,159
it's good for foliar feed it's good for

649
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,679
the cloning process

650
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,360
uh so it's just a good plant to have

651
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,640
around super easy to grow so

652
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:27,519
the fact that it's good for the people

653
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,880
too yes it's good yeah uh honestly as

654
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,639
it should be in everybody's garden if

655
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,000
someone was fair skin to get sunburned i

656
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,038
definitely had my fair share of aloe

657
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,159
rubbed on me

658
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:39,038
uh so what is happening with these beds

659
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,559
are plants going in here so this is a

660
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,839
mother bed that we just cleared out

661
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:45,918
we're about to plant another cycle of

662
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:47,038
basically this is kind of our our worm

663
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,038
bin really

664
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,400
all of our excess organic material that

665
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:51,599
our beds can't take that we don't feel

666
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,038
like taking outside

667
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:56,079
um kind of gets thrown right here and

668
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,079
the worms just devour it

669
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,759
so this is kind of our it's really our

670
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,038
mother bed slash worm bin

671
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:06,000
right um it's hard to describe sometimes

672
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:08,079
and and this because it's an ecosystem

673
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,359
like this is a perpetuation of the

674
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,678
nourishment that is

675
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,879
like if you needed something well where

676
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,080
do you go get it

677
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,280
right here right and so in my garden the

678
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,000
whole garden

679
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,879
ecosystem like you literally go into the

680
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,038
trail

681
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,000
and pull up your material for your

682
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,079
potting plank

683
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,759
right so and that's what this allows you

684
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,119
to do too what this did one thing i've

685
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,400
been doing with this motherbed that's

686
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:31,439
been i haven't really talked much about

687
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,960
online yet

688
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,120
but i've been seeing really good results

689
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,038
with is when i'm done with the mom

690
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:38,558
i'm pulling that root and i'm putting in

691
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:41,038
a tea brew

692
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:42,798
immediately and i i'm getting much

693
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,319
shorter brew times because i'm working

694
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,119
with active microbes now it's an

695
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:47,439
extraction

696
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,639
yeah they're not dormant so the whole

697
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,320
rhizosphere boom

698
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,679
boom right there so i'm not wasting

699
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,519
these moms at all now

700
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,679
um so i've been doing that for the last

701
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,200
i would say almost this last year really

702
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,480
and i've been really enjoying that

703
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,000
because i'm really getting i'm getting

704
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,679
something out of this bed now as well it

705
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,079
also allows you to really

706
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,440
i do that as well and that allows me to

707
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,240
see the

708
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,679
the root growth like especially in a

709
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,480
no-till situation i

710
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,600
never dig up the whole root system to

711
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,360
see what it looks like

712
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:19,199
but if i can shift that out and go

713
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,199
this is what i'm really working with

714
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,640
underground it's really kind of a cool

715
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,080
perspective yeah it can open your eyes

716
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,400
to you to some of those

717
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,000
the problems problems or successes yeah

718
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,640
good point like where's your root depth

719
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,640
going

720
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,480
yep this is something cool i saw him

721
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,960
look at this is something beautiful

722
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,720
this this is from home this is a it's an

723
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,640
african boa bab tree this is the

724
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,558
madagascar trees that's the

725
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,880
the tree of life uh some of the oldest

726
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,399
trees on the planet um i had one but

727
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,679
dude it's a tropical tree and it gets

728
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
cold out here so i didn't want to plant

729
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,360
it outside

730
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,278
so i bonsaied it um several months ago

731
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:53,359
and brought it to geo to hear the glp

732
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:54,400
and it's blowing up it grows like a half

733
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,038
an inch a day

734
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,798
uh i actually broke a branch off at one

735
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,240
time and had a mirror trip back i i

736
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:01,759
wrapped it up with some aloe

737
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,558
um re-healed it what does it mean when

738
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:06,640
you bonsai um basically you

739
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,158
you can you cut the root and you stunt

740
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,240
its growth you stifle its growth

741
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,840
so why is it still growing because you

742
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,720
didn't kill it because i didn't kill it

743
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:14,720
and

744
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,120
it's that gop and it's getting the best

745
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,600
compost teas and the best extracts

746
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:21,038
because it's grown with this life

747
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:22,719
does that mean it just doesn't get as

748
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,558
big as it would yeah

749
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,159
you're holding it back um once a year

750
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,000
what i'll end up doing is

751
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,360
there's wires that are actually holding

752
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,359
it down to that pot

753
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,639
um once a year i'll cut those wires i'm

754
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:34,719
going to um

755
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,960
pot it cut the roots and then repot it

756
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,919
in the same pot is that how they get the

757
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,079
bonsais to bend with those wires that's

758
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,960
just manipulation over time

759
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:45,678
the the real bonsai is what how you deal

760
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,440
with the roots

761
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,480
most people only think of how the little

762
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,798
tree is shaped but the real shaping goes

763
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,759
as above as below uh so you got you got

764
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:55,519
up down below

765
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,599
it's just like you would the top um and

766
00:24:55,519 --> 00:25:01,038
the bonsai is actually more important

767
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:02,158
is the root zone so anyway so this is my

768
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:02,960
mom man it's about to get freshly

769
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,559
planted again

770
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,919
with a new run of moms so let's talk

771
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:07,038
about what we're seeing a different kind

772
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,080
of aloe smaller

773
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:11,038
um but what else is happening lifewise

774
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,038
in the bed

775
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:14,640
and by lifewise we'll talk about the

776
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:15,038
microbes and the worms and stuff but

777
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,480
also

778
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:19,119
the green you know the other than

779
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:23,120
cannabis life uh so

780
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:24,639
we use various companion plants um

781
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,399
they're getting they're breaking it down

782
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,480
uh

783
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,519
but for the most part um the the most

784
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,440
two that we use

785
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,119
um we use them for ground cover purposes

786
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,120
is just dichondra

787
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,798
uh and then uh chickweed i'm a personal

788
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:37,759
fan of chickweed it actually helps with

789
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,079
the peel bugs

790
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:42,000
uh i feel like uh our beds that have

791
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,319
high concentration of chickweed

792
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,240
um have the lowest population of peel

793
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:46,720
bugs so this right here is a dichondra

794
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,720
it's just

795
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,640
it sure is a really good ground cover we

796
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,679
don't have to reseed it it grows back

797
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,120
all on its own

798
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,440
i've never seen it go to flower

799
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,719
unfortunately but it's a super low

800
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,240
maintenance all you got to do in the

801
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,079
beds if it gets out of hand

802
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,359
it's just got to chop and drop it um

803
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:04,639
before it gets too bad

804
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:06,399
the the the mealy the peel bugs

805
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,080
and it doesn't have such an aggressive

806
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,840
root like a mint

807
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,798
like that you know that penetrates and

808
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:15,839
spreads how's the root system on this

809
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:17,359
if you over seed it it's a nightmare um

810
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:18,959
and that's the big thing people have

811
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,199
problem with with dicondra is they'll

812
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,278
either overseed it or under manage it

813
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,400
uh and or both they'll oversee it and

814
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:25,919
under manage it and then they'll just

815
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,038
have this jungle mess of

816
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:31,038
a of a cover companion plant growing um

817
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,599
but so if you don't overseed it and you

818
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:36,240
and you maintain it and you keep it down

819
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,639
um you're it's fine it's 100 manageable

820
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,839
um

821
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,759
and you know again you don't have to

822
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:42,079
waste energy and time reseeding it

823
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,759
uh it's just not pop back up on its own

824
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,759
i like this over clover

825
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,839
we started the facility off the clover

826
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:51,038
um clover had this place in some places

827
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:54,240
sub-alpine or not white dutch or

828
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:55,919
more crimson clover um than anything uh

829
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,079
and then uh it was a mix of some other

830
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,480
things red clover crimson clover

831
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:02,000
large yeah they again you gotta maintain

832
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,880
them um but the problem with the clover

833
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,599
is those high-end

834
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,559
uh plants those those legumes is that

835
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,759
they attract past

836
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:12,000
a lot of uh pests so a lot of thrifts

837
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:13,119
uh aphids uh anything you can imagine

838
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,720
that like high-end

839
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,239
uh they're just they're just a breeding

840
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,919
ground for them so it kind of became a

841
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,240
problem after the years of just kind of

842
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,679
having to re-deal with that um i mean

843
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,960
there's also plus side certain things

844
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,080
like the clover more than the cannabis

845
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,360
so having the clover

846
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,519
would keep things off your cannabis as

847
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:29,678
well so i mean there's really some pros

848
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,918
and cons and ways to look at it but

849
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,840
we got rid of the clover your variables

850
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,520
is where you go this one works for us

851
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:36,319
super low maintenance it does its

852
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:38,319
purpose

853
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:40,158
it's adding exudates into the soil

854
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,119
structure i don't need nitrogen is an

855
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,039
easy

856
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:45,439
building block to replace i can always

857
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,359
top dress with some alfalfa

858
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,360
so so it's not something i need to grow

859
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:51,199
in the beds if it's causing that much of

860
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,158
a problem like what like the alpha like

861
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,200
a clover does

862
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,360
so that conju what's that how old is it

863
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,558
this bed um this this big we didn't

864
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,798
start with this bed so this bed's a

865
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:03,200
little newer but it's old potting soil

866
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:04,319
dumped in um

867
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,480
i want to say this one's like two or

868
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:09,918
three years old i would say yeah

869
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,880
uh but yeah so chickweed and dichondra

870
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,240
are the most um

871
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,760
popular ones we use but we have other

872
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,798
companion plants we use different i use

873
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,798
a lot of trap planting

874
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:18,639
so i'll plant specific plants just to

875
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:19,679
attract a pest i use clover for a trap

876
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,559
plant actually

877
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,440
um and then another thing i do is uh we

878
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:25,759
plant a lot of

879
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,759
banker plants like pepper plants um so a

880
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:30,079
lot of sweet sweet peppers purple

881
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,359
sweet purple flash peppers um things

882
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:33,199
like that you'll see in various

883
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,439
throughout the rooms so what about your

884
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,000
choice of uh container

885
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,200
is uh was that uh what is this the

886
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,200
grassroots

887
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,798
yeah yeah so i love the guys over at

888
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,240
grassroots we started off before i think

889
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:46,480
they were actually open though so in my

890
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,200
rooms we actually have old geo planters

891
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,440
um the older style fabric beds but what

892
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,038
do you like about the fabric

893
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,558
um this is more breathable they're just

894
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:55,359
they're really good easy affordable

895
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:56,960
setup

896
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,479
nowadays they make the no-till one which

897
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,798
i kind of help inspire

898
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,558
uh with the the less penetratable sides

899
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:03,918
so you can actually sink the water

900
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:05,599
i played a really big role in the

901
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,440
development of that um

902
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:08,798
so even though you don't see it here

903
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,200
what you're gonna see here is

904
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:14,158
old beds wrapped with saran wrap that

905
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,798
basically uh ushered out fired the next

906
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,240
next generation but no what i like about

907
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:18,720
grassroots is they're they're an awesome

908
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,319
team

909
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,319
their product speaks for itself um they

910
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:22,879
beefed up their piping um so you don't

911
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:24,879
have this

912
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,120
flimsy weak piping and fittings are

913
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,480
breaking uh they went with the tan so

914
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:29,839
it's not attracting heat

915
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,440
uh especially when you're in the outdoor

916
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:33,038
environment and you'll be able to

917
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,000
maintain this environment

918
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:36,720
in this bed for as long as you want as

919
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,398
well

920
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,000
we're testing that theory out right now

921
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,959
seeing how far we can push it right

922
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,919
22 cycles um deep and uh and going

923
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,519
strong

924
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,000
we were thinking about that we thought

925
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,000
that would be like 40 years or something

926
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,798
but it not but it's

927
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,640
yeah five minutes and change um so so i

928
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:56,639
basically get four and some change at

929
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,880
four and a third cycles a year

930
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,159
uh at each room i have three rooms so i

931
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,760
get roughly 13

932
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:06,720
13 um harvests a year

933
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,519
when when some people hear that they say

934
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,079
oh

935
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,200
he's almost burned out of his newts he's

936
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:15,599
gonna have to flip

937
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,759
you know it's a five year cycle or soil

938
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,759
you're saying this is how far we've run

939
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:20,319
but we're continuing to run we're going

940
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:22,000
for

941
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:23,918
yeah i know my news is quite the

942
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,440
opposite man honestly the only problem i

943
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,320
have right now at my soil is that it's

944
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,480
too rich

945
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:30,158
uh so now i can't top-dress anything

946
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,640
just maybe a little bit of alfalfa for

947
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,440
the

948
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,038
to make up for the for the nitrogen

949
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,480
there's a weird bounce where the

950
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:40,480
beautiful worm activity in nature that

951
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,599
would be separated and moved around and

952
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,159
you know but in a bed

953
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:45,519
it gets really concentrated super rich

954
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,440
and it's hard to like

955
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,798
bump the carbon up without it being a

956
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,440
sink at that point

957
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,158
yeah it's tough it's tricky you're right

958
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,038
uh

959
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,159
but anyways so yeah this is veg this is

960
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:57,839
kind of where you get everything big

961
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,519
before loading into the rooms

962
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,079
uh you see some of our extra clones that

963
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,440
we didn't plant yet just backups

964
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:04,558
that's our other little cloning area

965
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,278
right here they're getting burped out

966
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:08,960
right now

967
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,679
um uh let's go and check out your

968
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,440
t-brewer

969
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,120
and uh this looks like how you move it

970
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,120
around and then disperse

971
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:19,839
this is kind of a mess right now we

972
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:19,839
don't have to see it

973
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,120
liquid is the difficult thing to move

974
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,240
and so

975
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:32,479
have an efficient yeah and yet still not

976
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,240
killing the organisms because the liquid

977
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,480
is really the transport medium

978
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,319
right yeah and so well then you use a

979
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,079
pump that kills everything what the heck

980
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:40,480
have you been doing you know it makes no

981
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:42,879
sense

982
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,000
we have diaphragm pumps so it's exactly

983
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,039
perfect it

984
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,519
kills less we test the t both in the

985
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,200
brew

986
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,278
and out of the hose to see the

987
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,558
difference um you see a little bit

988
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:54,159
different you might not see as big as

989
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:55,278
strands of fungi but they're still there

990
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,360
they might get beat up a little bit but

991
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:59,919
they're still there um

992
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,359
this is exactly just two little t-birds

993
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,559
compost tea brewer

994
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:05,918
yeah that's why i turned it but the

995
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:09,519
important part that he shared was

996
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,519
actually the diaphragm pump

997
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,440
instead of it being a propeller impeller

998
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:18,558
that's spinning and chopping and

999
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,440
forcing it's just

1000
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:22,240
doing this motion and so you you're not

1001
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,080
shredding

1002
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,880
the life yeah that you're just blending

1003
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:26,879
it you're not putting it through a

1004
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,480
blender

1005
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,039
yeah these are some of our so one cool

1006
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,960
thing is uh we designed this facility uh

1007
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:34,798
i was real big into permaculture and

1008
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,399
capturing and storing energy and whatnot

1009
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:37,839
um so we actually designed the whole

1010
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:39,759
every single room

1011
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:41,278
this pipe right here that recycle water

1012
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:43,038
that's the feed line off of all of our

1013
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:44,720
dehumidifiers from each room

1014
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:46,480
and then it goes into a catch tank and

1015
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,120
then from that catch tank we put it

1016
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,720
through a uv

1017
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:51,199
light and through heavy sediment

1018
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,200
filtration no no ro we're not wasting

1019
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,038
so it goes into the tank and in the

1020
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,720
process it gets ultraviolet

1021
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:58,398
then then from that tank it gets pumped

1022
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,240
out of that tank through an ultraviolet

1023
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:00,959
and heavy heavy sediment filters carbon

1024
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,319
filtration

1025
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,000
and then it gets put to our storage

1026
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,240
tanks that feeds the rooms

1027
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,319
um so we're basically catching at this

1028
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,798
point i would say up to like 67 of our

1029
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,000
water

1030
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:11,759
the only water that we're losing is

1031
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,599
through our ac units which we're going

1032
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:15,200
to eventually catch as well

1033
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:18,240
uh and and do the same thing so if you

1034
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,038
ever tested before you ultraviolet it

1035
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,558
no you ever have uh it could be fun to

1036
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:23,440
look at though because you're actually

1037
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:25,599
pulling right

1038
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,798
the moisture the micro literally stuff

1039
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:28,398
in the air

1040
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:30,240
i'd be curious to see where it's more

1041
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:31,038
it's not it's more it's not or is it off

1042
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,720
the machine

1043
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:34,319
it's not so much the air chemicals or

1044
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,240
the air um pulling that we're worried

1045
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,000
about in the water which we are

1046
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,519
but also the the shit that's in the

1047
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,240
pipes algae and all that stuff growing

1048
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,679
in the pipes

1049
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,679
um that we also want to kill water

1050
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:46,558
to see what that looks like too because

1051
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:49,759
that's where a lot of people end up with

1052
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:49,759
a cerium issue or

1053
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:55,918
so this uh these are light controllers

1054
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:59,200
pretty sweet

1055
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,159
compost um this room was just planted so

1056
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,360
plants are a little small a little

1057
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,360
stressed out don't freak out

1058
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,719
it's crazy to be going into an led room

1059
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:13,199
and not have it be purple either way

1060
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,559
not be purple oh yeah yeah this place

1061
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,598
was purple for a long time like

1062
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:18,559
for for reals like so this it was just

1063
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,838
planted uh

1064
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,679
make them look green but they already

1065
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:24,000
looked green it was planted last

1066
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,280
last week so we're about seven no

1067
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,159
actually eight days into planting in

1068
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,519
this room

1069
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,878
so they just got through their stress

1070
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:29,918
they're actually just starting to grow

1071
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:31,199
yeah keep going

1072
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,719
i mean we're still cleaning this room

1073
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,000
still breaking it down so fast i just

1074
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,918
want to look out because we're talking

1075
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,918
about where the rock placements and how

1076
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,279
these ecosystems are set up

1077
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,878
yeah or if we can do that in another

1078
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,440
investment too oh you're doing this for

1079
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:45,039
fine i mean

1080
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:46,480
you're in that room i'm not sure uh yes

1081
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,838
but this room was just planted this is a

1082
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,838
20 second cycle

1083
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,639
how many plants in there it depends on

1084
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:03,838
strain

1085
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,880
so light barrier on the exterior of the

1086
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,118
door

1087
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,800
yeah we still we still seal them but

1088
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,480
this is just fool proof

1089
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,240
that way if one of these pops off or

1090
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:31,838
something happens we don't we don't see

1091
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:31,838
the whole fucking room

1092
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,760
what's happening all right guys uh

1093
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,880
welcome to our 30 our

1094
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,280
second cycle sorry

1095
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,358
so this is a this is a part of your 22nd

1096
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,680
site yep first this is our first room

1097
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:56,639
our 22nd cycle

1098
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:58,078
they're looking great man uh this whole

1099
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:59,838
row right here is all black

1100
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,599
triangle um in the middle there's some

1101
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:04,719
potted plants just from thailand

1102
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,838
uh to our right we have some grape pie

1103
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:08,239
number five

1104
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:09,920
um this isn't our this isn't the winning

1105
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:11,439
phenotype this is actually the thino

1106
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,400
that i breed with

1107
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,838
it's super grapey um so i use it because

1108
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,200
it's the grape that i want the breeding

1109
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:18,239
project the other female we have is

1110
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:20,239
higher testing

1111
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:21,759
still grapey not nearly as grapey as

1112
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:23,679
this now when you're talking grapey are

1113
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,920
we talking like a

1114
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:26,799
grape bubble gum grapey are we talking

1115
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,599
great candy

1116
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,320
yeah like i showed up grape candy um

1117
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,400
delicious

1118
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,359
absolutely the the smell and the flavor

1119
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,760
um bait

1120
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,759
are translates very well

1121
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,440
overall though this one is my favorite

1122
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,720
finger to smoke just for flavor that's

1123
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,240
why i'm using the breeding

1124
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:46,000
um but the other one is gonna sell

1125
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:47,919
better because it has a higher testing

1126
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,880
in this market

1127
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,240
tell them how better this one is this is

1128
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,320
part of shifting that

1129
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:56,078
conversation because we smoked some

1130
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,240
great flour last night

1131
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,119
but i'm but it's about what you're

1132
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,358
growing

1133
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,320
you know and when you say this one holds

1134
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:05,358
a note

1135
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,359
that it cuts through that has value

1136
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:08,960
well until and where the thing is too

1137
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,639
though is that

1138
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,320
the people don't value terpenes as much

1139
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,159
as cannabinoids yet even though this one

1140
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,079
has a higher chirping profile on paper

1141
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:17,358
yes okay and oh and they don't test for

1142
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,839
flavonoids yet so like

1143
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:22,078
this might have that like i don't see

1144
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:23,519
the grape in the terpene profile i

1145
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,839
the grape must be a flavonoid in my

1146
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:28,000
opinion um because this terpene profile

1147
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:29,838
doesn't differentiate between other

1148
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,159
profiles that don't have grape i know

1149
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,920
it's all word of mouth at that point and

1150
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:35,519
so if you can't smell the product you

1151
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,440
can't touch the product you can't

1152
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,358
you know anything the product before you

1153
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,920
pay for it

1154
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:42,480
you have to see it on a piece of paper

1155
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,800
or

1156
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,079
beautiful labeling or jars or yeah that

1157
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,800
helps yeah attractive

1158
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,800
pretty flowers

1159
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:53,358
this is fire angel this is cbd strain

1160
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:56,880
right here um

1161
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:58,319
it's 50 i think uh two to one

1162
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,480
they're my sativas they're they're

1163
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,039
blowing up a little yellow leaves on the

1164
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,838
bottom nothing too bad

1165
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:05,838
a little yellow

1166
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,240
uh so so this is actually

1167
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,559
one of the great things of the living

1168
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:17,279
soil bed is that process

1169
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:19,119
makes sense if you don't have the

1170
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,359
roly-polies and the pill bugs

1171
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,039
to eat that it makes no sense because

1172
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:25,440
that's now a vector for bacteria and

1173
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:27,440
fungi and other things to break it down

1174
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,639
you got to have the breakdown processed

1175
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,679
or it's a problem

1176
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,960
and that's why that's why the

1177
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:32,159
relationship with mealybugs is it's a

1178
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,920
love hate man i i

1179
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,639
love them gotta feed them but you just

1180
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,639
gotta feed them man

1181
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,838
and tom if if it's okay i don't know how

1182
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:43,519
you mess with your beds like i usually

1183
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:45,279
am just hands in and looking

1184
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:46,719
but i'd like to roll the stone over just

1185
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,800
see and you can take a video

1186
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:50,399
yeah describe a bigger one yeah yeah

1187
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,839
find one that usually is active

1188
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,519
we don't have to this is this is a small

1189
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:55,679
basement

1190
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,119
we'll we'll find a big flat one but this

1191
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:58,960
this is that importance of showing that

1192
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,720
life too

1193
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,000
steve have you water in here where's

1194
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:04,719
your watering system

1195
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,760
is there is it what about your water

1196
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,000
you're watering

1197
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,040
a hand water you had water and water

1198
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,880
yeah

1199
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:12,800
i have uh three rooms like this um

1200
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,760
they're all hand watered um and i have

1201
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,280
two two growers on schedule on schedule

1202
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,640
yeah the schedule changes throughout

1203
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,440
this one cycle

1204
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:23,039
um but yeah we have a a very very strict

1205
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,720
watering schedule that we follow

1206
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:26,159
um obviously depending on what the

1207
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:29,838
plants are telling us as well as telling

1208
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,838
us but um

1209
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,480
hey if you see this

1210
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:42,480
yeah they eat that better than this no

1211
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:44,078
no that's a chipmunk we have a chipmunk

1212
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,440
or a rat that got in we've been hunting

1213
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:47,440
we've been hunting up for six months

1214
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,039
he loves he loves our uh our predator

1215
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:53,519
packs

1216
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:55,119
yeah what are these they're predator

1217
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:58,159
packs they're swarovski mites

1218
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:01,358
so it's a beneficial insect

1219
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:01,358
there is little pops

1220
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:10,559
yep we've been hunting for a minute

1221
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:13,519
let's go to the other side

1222
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:15,519
hey you know what elaine would say throw

1223
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:18,400
a bird in here and you have the complete

1224
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:18,400
soil food web

1225
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,440
he actually um eats the cover crop the

1226
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:25,440
the we'll come in here and see how the

1227
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,079
the the the sides

1228
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,599
he mows it down like we've actually done

1229
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,599
less cover crop management since it's

1230
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:33,519
been in here though

1231
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,920
in the weirdest of ways i kind of want

1232
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:38,480
to eventually get to the fact that

1233
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,280
you bring your rabbit to work with you

1234
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,358
and then you put him in the bed

1235
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,720
he mows he poops because it's cold

1236
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,078
compost it's not even hot

1237
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:48,159
yeah that would be cool that would be

1238
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:49,280
cool you take your little support animal

1239
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:53,679
home

1240
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:56,400
so that's just another row um

1241
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:58,239
yeah basically just this is all happy

1242
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,800
praying plants this is our miss x right

1243
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:00,399
here

1244
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,640
this x right here is uh one of our

1245
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,240
highest testing highest yielding strains

1246
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:06,239
she's won all the awards for the best

1247
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:08,399
sativa in the state uh

1248
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:09,559
she's uh even though she's expressing

1249
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,880
more of a

1250
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:14,880
indicator she's a uh half of her as ac

1251
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,440
dc cbd and doesn't even show up

1252
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,480
um so she's a weird one man it's when we

1253
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,400
say sativa

1254
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,920
we're more associating we're not we're

1255
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,200
not and that's the thing about the old

1256
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,119
style so back in the day if you said

1257
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:26,318
indica sativa and you it depends who you

1258
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,920
ask if you ask a grower

1259
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:29,838
they're going to talk about how tall or

1260
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,119
short or stout or how quick it finished

1261
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:32,480
or how long it finished

1262
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,318
um but nowadays if you have something

1263
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,920
indica sativa they're strictly

1264
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:37,599
asking you about the effects is it going

1265
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,639
to make me sleep or is going to make me

1266
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,800
up or down

1267
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:42,400
um so that when i said sativa i was more

1268
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:49,839
or less referring to

1269
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:49,838
the uh the effect okay

1270
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:54,239
this is why there's so much confusion on

1271
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,719
the customer base

1272
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:58,879
because well what are you talking about

1273
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:03,679
and there's no time to explain

1274
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:06,480
yeah but the effect

1275
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:07,440
is often confused by other like flavor

1276
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,280
profiles and

1277
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:14,559
and what are you looking at it's a uh

1278
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:18,160
ice wing barber just

1279
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:20,559
needing some love yeah

1280
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:20,559
there you go

1281
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:26,559
anyway i mean that's pretty much oh this

1282
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,559
is the other great pie female right here

1283
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:30,880
this is the winner great pie fino

1284
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,599
technically this is a

1285
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,280
mid 30s total cannabinoid um it does

1286
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,800
have the great profile

1287
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,319
the grape just isn't as loud as the

1288
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,640
other one the number five this was the

1289
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:42,000
number uh

1290
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:44,318
i came here my number this one i think

1291
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,400
it was number nine uh

1292
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:47,358
yeah number nine uh no number twelve

1293
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,880
that's number twelve

1294
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:50,159
uh the other one's number five the

1295
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,200
number twelve is the third mid thirty

1296
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:53,358
percent the number five

1297
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:56,318
is a twenty percenter um but holds the

1298
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:57,759
stronger the stronger now yeah

1299
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:00,318
yeah this is this is pretty much our

1300
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,480
rooms man this is a 20-second cycle

1301
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:04,159
three rooms so we've done this at this

1302
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,920
point 65 times now

1303
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:07,679
i'm so impressed with how you keep the

1304
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:10,480
consistency of your plants

1305
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,279
i just it's so i don't know i don't know

1306
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,838
how you do it

1307
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,119
this is a and multiple strains yeah oh

1308
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:17,119
no multiple strains

1309
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,119
i mean so this is a good example of

1310
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,519
where this was

1311
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:27,119
last cycle yes which was left in place

1312
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:29,599
just harvested that next to it

1313
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:31,119
in the void that's where the new plant

1314
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,079
goes and you'll see it in every single

1315
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,358
one here there's already this one's

1316
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:36,079
already been broken

1317
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:36,880
down so this is the natural progression

1318
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:39,200
right here

1319
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,119
broken down and falling apart but if you

1320
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:43,759
look they're in every single bed

1321
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,640
right there yeah exactly right there and

1322
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,760
so this is

1323
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,639
how you can still maintain the system

1324
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,680
while using

1325
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:53,838
pots to transfer in because you're

1326
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,919
you're only disturbing it as little as

1327
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:57,679
oh so so these are in pots that you

1328
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,440
transplanted no these were this was

1329
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,358
where our last plant was last cycle

1330
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,960
right it was planted right here then the

1331
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:04,159
plant got cut down harvested and then

1332
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,000
when it was time to replant

1333
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:07,519
we went right next to it because what we

1334
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,679
didn't want to do is that's where

1335
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:10,880
all the active biology was last cycle

1336
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:12,078
was right there in their rhizosphere

1337
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,480
right there in their root zone

1338
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,920
and if we harvest that we what we end up

1339
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,079
doing is harvesting 90

1340
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:20,318
of our worms and all the biology out of

1341
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,318
the bed so leave that in place let that

1342
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:23,119
start the next cycle off um and then

1343
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:25,199
just move over

1344
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,800
move over right next to it you get the

1345
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:28,799
benefit of all that biology

1346
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,920
anyway don't you yeah now we're tapping

1347
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,519
into it the other way

1348
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,159
so basically we just shift grid every

1349
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:34,159
single cycle

1350
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:37,759
so but i mean they're they're planted

1351
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:38,559
and you transplanted they're not like

1352
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,119
you didn't

1353
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,719
yeah okay yeah well we were in the room

1354
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:44,079
now let me ask you one question were all

1355
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:46,000
of these in this room

1356
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,599
transplanted over at the same time or

1357
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,358
were different strains brought over at

1358
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,800
different times this room gets cut

1359
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:52,559
they get harvested at different times

1360
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,960
but they all get planted the same day so

1361
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:54,960
they're

1362
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,000
all at the same stage in their

1363
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,079
development

1364
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,239
but just expressing it differently it's

1365
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,839
so fascinating i love it

1366
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:06,799
great um and then you design

1367
00:45:03,838 --> 00:45:07,759
everything specifically to them these

1368
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,440
are the ones

1369
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,440
these are the sativas that i'm rotating

1370
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,280
from room to room so were they trying to

1371
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,880
get 20 weeks out of these

1372
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,880
remember last night these are the plants

1373
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,000
that take longer but his rooms are on a

1374
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:21,920
10-week cycle

1375
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,960
so he's got to move these plants yeah

1376
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,480
well let's take a look at these beauties

1377
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,679
what can you tell it these are the top

1378
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,400
these are this is an authentic original

1379
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:33,199
thai sea out of thai sea right yep it's

1380
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,240
a

1381
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:37,519
a land raised seed brought indoors

1382
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:39,679
and this is uh it looks like some

1383
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:42,639
marigolds or

1384
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,358
um here yes yeah i love marigold did a

1385
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:45,358
terpes

1386
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:46,400
and they actually we did a study on root

1387
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:48,960
feeding nematodes

1388
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,920
and the marigolds create a biotoxin that

1389
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,480
appears to

1390
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,920
deter or kill the root feeding nematode

1391
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,280
we did different control methods in

1392
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,559
several different pots and we studied

1393
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,040
over several cycles

1394
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:00,239
and at the end of it the marigolds had

1395
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:01,679
the best results

1396
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:05,519
after three cycles they're multiple

1397
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,519
species and this is french yep

1398
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,318
yeah but those thailands i i do believe

1399
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,039
they are a wild

1400
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:19,119
um variety um i don't think it was bread

1401
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:19,440
i i do think it was whatever is floating

1402
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:23,039
around

1403
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:26,159
out there still they're exotic

1404
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:29,838
yeah i don't think there's a

1405
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:29,838
selection that was what i'm getting at

1406
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,519
those are peppers i know i think they're

1407
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:36,000
purple flash or those might be the spicy

1408
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,920
joes

1409
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,838
oh no those are the new mexico uh joe

1410
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:42,800
parker yeah can we talk about

1411
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:43,519
this this environment is it the same how

1412
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,880
i

1413
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:47,679
what is the plans for so what's the

1414
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,280
question

1415
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:54,078
yeah uh lifespan like what can you like

1416
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,560
no it's a creature that as long as he

1417
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,240
feeds it and loves it could grow forever

1418
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:00,480
and and that's what we're trying to

1419
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:03,519
prove yeah is that hey

1420
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:04,800
done correctly we're gonna hit 100

1421
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:06,880
cycles plus out of this

1422
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,760
and and i really want to show that that

1423
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,079
works has it been done yet no i

1424
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,240
this is five there's 20 cycles we'll say

1425
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,519
20 is five years 20 is five

1426
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:18,879
and so a hundred cycles is longer than

1427
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:22,559
most businesses

1428
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,680
right with the same consistency and

1429
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,079
maturity

1430
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:28,318
is the expectation as a grower that the

1431
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,960
cannabis you grow in the 100

1432
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:32,079
cycle environment will be the same as

1433
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,720
that that was grown

1434
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:36,880
in the 22nd how will that have changed

1435
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:39,679
technically it's supposed to get better

1436
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:42,000
with each cycle as that soil matures as

1437
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:42,639
as as that soil gets broken down and

1438
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,159
worked and

1439
00:47:42,639 --> 00:47:48,719
the fungi ratio changes

1440
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:50,399
some of these fungi take years to

1441
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:51,199
literally just be like okay there's

1442
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,200
their environment

1443
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:54,960
yeah well remember everything in this

1444
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:58,000
ecosystem is all about

1445
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:59,679
it has to be conducive for growth and

1446
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,039
the bacteria grow fastest

1447
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:03,759
boom after a while no no like literally

1448
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:07,440
it can take

1449
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:09,599
years for a fungal spore to be like okay

1450
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,358
this environment is healthy long enough

1451
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,480
that i feel safe enough

1452
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:16,318
comfortable enough to now do my job

1453
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,519
because it's part of that relationship

1454
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:21,119
with whoever's on this

1455
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:25,280
above and below part so

1456
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:28,240
15 20 years from now you know

1457
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,280
what a crazy thought i mean i don't know

1458
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:32,399
anybody who's gone

1459
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,440
this far with a living soil indoors um

1460
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,000
but we definitely want to push the

1461
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,519
envelope see how far we can take it

1462
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,199
i mean it's already paid for itself 10

1463
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:40,639
times over um so i mean there's no

1464
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:41,838
reason let's talk about that because

1465
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:44,480
most people

1466
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:46,000
it's always the the price tag which is

1467
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,199
why they don't want to

1468
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,639
do new things but there is an initial

1469
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:51,759
price egg but it's actually not that

1470
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:53,838
much

1471
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,440
mostly in the fact that you've got to do

1472
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:58,159
more than just fill a bed with

1473
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:59,599
bulk peat filler right you that costs

1474
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:02,159
more

1475
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,440
but after that it it's not the same

1476
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:06,480
nutrition cycle

1477
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,440
because the life is actually utilizing

1478
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,679
what's in that

1479
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,318
pot a lot it's it's more it's similar to

1480
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,719
leds

1481
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:16,800
it's a more upfront purchase when you're

1482
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:20,399
getting into a soil system

1483
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,880
it can be but that's it it's a one-time

1484
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,880
purchase

1485
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,480
you're not using as well as the hands-on

1486
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,160
requirement

1487
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,920
you know you're out there making compost

1488
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:28,480
you got to commit to making a compost

1489
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,880
though yeah

1490
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,000
it can be there are some aspects of it

1491
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,960
that require work

1492
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,159
no doubt um uh obviously it's more

1493
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,039
farming than

1494
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:39,358
than uh than playing video games um but

1495
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:41,838
uh

1496
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:43,199
it's definitely it's not as labor

1497
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:44,719
intensive

1498
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:47,118
as people think once you really

1499
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:48,719
streamline it make it efficient process

1500
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,480
like again i have three rooms like this

1501
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:52,480
i run with two growers

1502
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,760
um three three of these rooms so every

1503
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,920
plant you see

1504
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,599
at this scale at this scale with two

1505
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,720
people with two people and a harvester

1506
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,000
so i guess three people

1507
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:02,000
but that's all that's a different part

1508
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,039
of the cycle right that's that's

1509
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,039
two weeks out of the month i have a

1510
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:06,480
harvester come in and harvest um but for

1511
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:08,719
the most part

1512
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,639
two people grow plant clones i didn't

1513
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:12,959
all blue maps i didn't see irrigation

1514
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:14,879
run everywhere all hand watered

1515
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,880
which for most people is like oh you

1516
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,680
never get the consistency so how do you

1517
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:21,280
train your staff to not just stand there

1518
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:23,039
and gossip and flood your bed

1519
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,280
no they're they're water ninjas man they

1520
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:28,880
know water they know what to do

1521
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:30,960
uh we have we have uh

1522
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,039
hey while we're here are these your new

1523
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,720
lights yes these are the

1524
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:36,639
my opinion and i'll fight anybody who

1525
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:38,558
says otherwise uh these are definitely

1526
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:41,199
the best lights on the market i feel

1527
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,640
um they're the fos a3i it's their

1528
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:46,960
flagship light

1529
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:48,719
uh it's the most over built

1530
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,480
awesome piece of grow equipment on the

1531
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:53,039
market it's

1532
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,039
super solid they're 1500 watt led

1533
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:56,400
they're spectrum controllable

1534
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:58,079
they have a program where you can do a

1535
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:00,079
sunrise sunset

1536
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:01,440
uh they're just a trick and slice on the

1537
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,880
market they did a really good job

1538
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,800
engineering them

1539
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,280
and then thinking this light through

1540
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,480
example if i get a diode out or a bar

1541
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,119
out i don't gotta change the whole

1542
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,679
fixture

1543
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,200
they come in they swap a bar out uh just

1544
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:14,239
little things like that are just super

1545
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:16,960
efficient for me as

1546
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:17,679
a cultivator thing i'm noticing is like

1547
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,440
unlike

1548
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:20,879
some other brands where there's kind of

1549
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:22,720
you really have to have a

1550
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,240
place them really specifically you have

1551
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:25,439
to have a bridge to place your life

1552
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:27,759
these are pretty

1553
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,960
it's like pretty straight forward so

1554
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,960
what these direct

1555
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,079
angles yeah they they had they can

1556
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:33,440
direct an angle but what's really

1557
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,400
important is the beam angle that they

1558
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,639
went with

1559
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,240
some people go too wide like a lot of

1560
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:40,318
the newer led lights like the the

1561
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:42,078
non-tortoni brands and the underbust

1562
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:43,759
but a lot of the newer leading led

1563
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,240
companies they use a really

1564
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,520
wide beam angle which which forces you

1565
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:49,838
to throw the plants

1566
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:51,199
or the lights um six six inches to a

1567
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:53,039
foot above your plants

1568
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:54,480
um which doesn't leave space for air to

1569
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:56,639
move uh which is

1570
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,679
which crates in my opinion less

1571
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:59,358
consistency

1572
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:00,719
and with these lights they have the

1573
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:02,318
power and the beam angle

1574
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:03,838
to where you can set them and forget

1575
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:05,679
them which is great for commercial

1576
00:52:03,838 --> 00:52:07,440
applications there's so much space

1577
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:10,159
between the lights and the plants

1578
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,440
there's easily outside but it's really

1579
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:13,358
good for commercial applications because

1580
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,358
i don't have to chase the stretch now

1581
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:17,039
with the beam angle i'm not throwing

1582
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:19,519
light on that wall over there

1583
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:21,039
unless i want to uh so i'm actually what

1584
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:22,639
i was wondering because people would say

1585
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:24,318
the side of the plant's not getting

1586
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,000
light so that's why they're reflecting

1587
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:27,920
so what i did with these lights is if

1588
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,400
you look i put the outside um

1589
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,920
bar on the row across from it i forced

1590
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,519
it out so i'm getting that to penetrate

1591
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,440
and slice underneath the leaves

1592
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:38,000
um so we're getting we're getting tons

1593
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,358
of penetration with these lights

1594
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,280
well yeah and you can see that in your

1595
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:43,759
other plant growth too

1596
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,720
you wouldn't have the the cover crop or

1597
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,720
understory

1598
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:49,358
you know penetrating as well it's it's

1599
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:52,078
very well done

1600
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:52,719
your your soil is going to outlive your

1601
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,359
your

1602
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:56,239
your beds all right it is 100 we have to

1603
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:59,519
figure that out

1604
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:01,439
it's it's on the network yeah because

1605
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:03,440
that's the reality of going no no if you

1606
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:05,440
really do this

1607
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,119
that that's temporary you understand so

1608
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,960
far that's that's to be a testament

1609
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,358
ultimately is that so far our soil is

1610
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,599
out

1611
00:53:09,358 --> 00:53:12,558
outrun our lights are all our first

1612
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,559
original fans

1613
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,760
okay tom did you hear that because when

1614
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,680
we talk about return and

1615
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,880
investment we talk about costs and

1616
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:20,799
expenses

1617
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,400
most people see it as when do i have to

1618
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,039
replace right

1619
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,880
and what he's just said is that what is

1620
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:28,800
actually growing his plant

1621
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,480
has been consistent longer than the

1622
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,519
lights because you've changed those out

1623
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,719
even the type

1624
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,920
right sap right like every all the

1625
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:37,919
consistency

1626
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,200
of that the most important point here

1627
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,000
this may look

1628
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,879
like you know any grow room you've seen

1629
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,199
this it doesn't mean

1630
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,318
this looks way better this is unlike

1631
00:53:45,199 --> 00:53:48,639
most almost

1632
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:49,440
almost any other group that you will

1633
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:52,558
find

1634
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:57,838
and that is really unique that's so

1635
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:57,839
true at this scale this is

1636
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:04,000
continue to reap like financial benefits

1637
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,200
from working with this type of

1638
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,760
environment and that's how you

1639
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:09,838
become a successful farmer yeah no i

1640
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,440
mean we're highly successful businessman

1641
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:12,880
we really want to be able to to take our

1642
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,119
success and share with

1643
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,800
with with good product to the customers

1644
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,800
with good jobs for our employees

1645
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,240
with a good business for the community

1646
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,280
uh we really want to fire on all

1647
00:54:20,239 --> 00:54:23,679
cylinders um

1648
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,040
well no i don't that's all great you got

1649
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:25,838
your big you know you have a great

1650
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:27,358
product so

1651
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:29,279
thank god you have a great product you

1652
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:31,199
know out there but i mean when you go

1653
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,119
apply you're like wait a second man i'm

1654
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:35,679
not gonna have to invest as much in it

1655
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,358
because i'm working with this

1656
00:54:35,679 --> 00:54:39,118
you know so and that's the big thing is

1657
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:40,159
people look at how much can they get per

1658
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:41,920
pound

1659
00:54:40,159 --> 00:54:44,000
the question i ask myself a lot is how

1660
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,599
much am i putting in per pound

1661
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,199
uh and that's a lot of people that's a

1662
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,079
question they don't ask themselves one

1663
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:51,118
of the things that

1664
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,960
that we that keeps us so competitive is

1665
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,358
how little money we spend

1666
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,599
turning these rooms over so when i come

1667
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:59,920
in i clean this room i replant

1668
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:02,640
i probably spend fifty dollars in

1669
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,559
materials to restart this room

1670
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:06,078
a hundred dollars in materials to

1671
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:07,680
restart this room yep

1672
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:09,359
i mean if you include compost if i hit a

1673
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:10,719
heavy compost yeah that might compost

1674
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:11,598
but i make it in house so technically

1675
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:14,318
it's free

1676
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:16,880
but it would cost about 500 bucks a yard

1677
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:19,838
so yeah and even then you're looking at

1678
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,720
hours versus days or weeks of labor also

1679
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:22,558
requirements

1680
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:24,000
so i mean it cost me a thousand bucks to

1681
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,240
flip this room per cycle

1682
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,079
not including the power bill but yeah so

1683
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:28,719
i mean that's a huge cost savings that

1684
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,640
keeps us

1685
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:32,159
competitive um that we couldn't do

1686
00:55:30,639 --> 00:55:33,759
without the living soil system

1687
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:35,279
and you and that competitive is not just

1688
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,720
on the market with with

1689
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,240
other products it's also with the

1690
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:39,279
customer base you're trying to actually

1691
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:41,759
interact with

1692
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,680
if if you're just having to cover your

1693
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,440
costs and you've out

1694
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:47,199
costed most of the people who would

1695
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,838
really appreciate your product

1696
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:51,199
just because you're being inefficient

1697
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:53,119
right

1698
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:54,798
we're penalizing the people who are so

1699
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,440
grateful to us like a park

1700
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:59,759
down here you want to go have a picnic

1701
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,240
down here

1702
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,079
that's where the fairies have the picnic

1703
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:05,279
so yeah i mean the idea is to drive it

1704
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,119
to drive the cost down

1705
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,480
uh how much to put into the plant to

1706
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:10,880
drive the quality up

1707
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,880
uh and to drive the yields up um and so

1708
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,440
like so far we've done it our quality is

1709
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,519
is

1710
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,000
has always been top shelf um our we've

1711
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:18,798
we've actually just this last year broke

1712
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,798
into

1713
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:22,960
those dream number yields that we've

1714
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:23,759
been striving for for the last five

1715
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,519
years

1716
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,520
so what's the downside man there's got

1717
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:29,519
to be something

1718
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:31,280
no i mean we it's we're in a regulated

1719
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:34,000
market so i mean

1720
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,119
we could fail at any minute for anything

1721
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,880
we could uh

1722
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,160
ac could go down there's there's always

1723
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:39,920
a risk there's always

1724
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:41,598
there's always rainy days you know i'm

1725
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,318
saying we still have our issues it's not

1726
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:45,440
uh

1727
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:47,358
it's not all smiles able to tap into the

1728
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,920
local power grid or you have generator

1729
00:56:47,358 --> 00:56:49,440
backup

1730
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,358
we have a generator backup right now

1731
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,079
that handles our security system

1732
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:54,480
um but not that wouldn't run our lights

1733
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,079
um

1734
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:58,719
but we are currently looking at a

1735
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,280
generator that will run our hvac and

1736
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:01,118
lights

1737
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,880
um if needed well that's a great

1738
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,599
question because there have been rolling

1739
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,358
block out

1740
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:07,359
but luckily our placement we're in

1741
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:08,239
between two power grids so usually when

1742
00:57:07,358 --> 00:57:10,318
one shuts down

1743
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:12,318
they transfer power from the other so

1744
00:57:10,318 --> 00:57:13,519
we're actually one of the best locations

1745
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:15,199
um to have a grow

1746
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:17,119
i don't think we've we've only actually

1747
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:18,078
known we had one for i think less than

1748
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,240
an hour

1749
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,280
uh blackout uh how much do you pay for

1750
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:22,639
it

1751
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:25,119
yeah i don't know like quite things on

1752
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:29,199
the top of my head that is well you know

1753
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:30,960
yeah hey be respectful tom

1754
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:32,558
it shouldn't be an embarrassing question

1755
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,280
but it's really important when we have

1756
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:35,280
costs

1757
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,200
you think of the costs differently

1758
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,760
because it's part of what keeps it

1759
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:40,239
everything

1760
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,760
fed right when you go at that point

1761
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:42,798
you're like actually it's not a cost i

1762
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,640
just have to

1763
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:45,838
take care of my people right i went to a

1764
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:48,798
massive grow in

1765
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:49,759
eastern washington state where they the

1766
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:52,318
energy is like

1767
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,520
two cents a kilowatt i mean they pay

1768
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:55,920
nothing because there's

1769
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:57,920
that's where they produce like all the

1770
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,720
energy for the country and so they're so

1771
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,240
lucky

1772
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:01,838
but they're you know so yeah but that

1773
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:03,679
often breeds in efficiency

1774
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:05,599
because it's so cheap they're like oh

1775
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:07,440
don't worry about it it's just 20 bucks

1776
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:08,960
but the reality is is the one thing that

1777
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:10,079
we have good here going for us though is

1778
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,679
that we don't pay

1779
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:13,119
uh i just torched that the other day i

1780
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:15,279
brought it in here no no i'm looking at

1781
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:18,318
the worms already caught up and say hi

1782
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:20,720
is that we don't have um peak hours so

1783
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:22,318
we have a private uh power company and

1784
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:24,000
and they don't do peak hours so during

1785
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:24,798
the day like in vegas during the day

1786
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,880
mid-day

1787
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:27,920
you're paying more for power um then we

1788
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,480
don't do that out here and so that's

1789
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,159
nice

1790
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,240
that forces people in vegas to make

1791
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:33,920
their their crews work at night

1792
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:36,078
and all these ridiculous things to try

1793
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,680
to save pennies uh so it's kind of yeah

1794
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,640
the road crews are out at one o'clock in

1795
00:58:37,679 --> 00:58:41,039
the morning just be

1796
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:42,400
yeah it there's weird little things

1797
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:44,719
because

1798
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,639
the infrastructure doesn't support what

1799
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:48,719
everybody has to do to get done

1800
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:50,879
can let's pull that pot i'll just lift

1801
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:52,239
the pot over and so these have just

1802
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,400
don't don't do it yet

1803
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:55,519
so tom why don't you get the camera just

1804
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,440
close enough

1805
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:59,119
and all we want to do is just a reality

1806
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,960
that the soil in here is actually

1807
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:03,440
already so close to what's in here that

1808
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,280
the life just transfers between them

1809
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,440
right and you can see worms literally

1810
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:09,599
hanging out the bottom

1811
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:11,039
these are different various mites you

1812
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,400
see some springtails

1813
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:14,400
uh you see some snails

1814
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:19,838
that's the only pot flipping you do

1815
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,679
you guys want to talk i think we should

1816
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,599
probably have a little bit of

1817
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:29,118
conversation outside the rooms too just

1818
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,119
in case the fans become a problem

1819
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:33,440
and it's exciting oh real quick check

1820
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:37,119
this out though check these lights out

1821
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:39,200
yeah so just to give you guys an example

1822
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:41,358
spring look at this little row right

1823
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:44,879
here

1824
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:46,798
so that's all balloona there you go

1825
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,160
summer bring it back to the the

1826
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:51,199
spectrum's arrested room

1827
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:52,558
boom if i wanted to i can go autumn and

1828
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:54,719
it really hit the heart they're heavy

1829
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:54,720
red

1830
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:58,239
so that's pretty cool light man

1831
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:02,639
and then they have this feature here

1832
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,798
where you can do a scheduling sunrise

1833
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:06,000
sunset so basically the lights they

1834
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:07,440
don't start off at a hundred percent

1835
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,039
they'll start off at

1836
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,559
at the minimum yep and they'll let the

1837
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:11,358
plant wake up before they hit him with

1838
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,839
that ppfd

1839
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:15,279
on the tail end you know resting yeah

1840
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:16,400
you start to think you're god or

1841
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,519
something

1842
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,599
but they're really they're really nice

1843
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:20,798
hissing man i highly recommend folks

1844
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:22,079
if you guys know anybody who's

1845
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:23,440
interested in lifetime hit me up y'all

1846
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:26,079
hook them up with the 18 from post and

1847
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,079
get them dialed in

1848
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:31,680
uh and i like that you're a combination

1849
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:33,519
of technology and old school

1850
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:34,960
yeah that's good definitely yeah i can't

1851
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:36,159
go wrong with those uh

1852
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,400
it's one of our original things i was

1853
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:43,358
trying to accomplish kind of says it all

1854
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:45,119
we're going for old growth for us

1855
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:48,000
anyways that's a different perspective

1856
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:49,440
right of what a cannabis grow is

1857
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,760
that that's what i'm going for today

1858
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:55,838
that's our that's our mission

1859
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:58,319
cycles any other question before we take

1860
01:00:55,838 --> 01:01:00,480
off we got i mean

1861
01:00:58,318 --> 01:01:01,838
you gotta have more no well i was just

1862
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,838
saying we'd get out of the fans

1863
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:05,358
no i don't have any questions my basic

1864
01:01:03,838 --> 01:01:08,400
feeling is

1865
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:08,400
first it's really

1866
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:14,480
it's clean it's organized so nicely

1867
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:15,358
and i can see how you have complete

1868
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:19,119
control over

1869
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:21,039
everything and it's like coming along

1870
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,559
and i just asked myself it's like it's

1871
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:24,079
like you were saying it's like you can't

1872
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,480
be everywhere at once and

1873
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:27,680
because you you know you do want to get

1874
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:30,880
bigger so

1875
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:34,000
it's like it's so nice at this size

1876
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,760
and uh it's so nice you know i know when

1877
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,400
we do expand i'm gonna miss it

1878
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,040
i know i know that i know your expansion

1879
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,400
is

1880
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:42,400
a different type of growth with the

1881
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,079
greenhouse part

1882
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,838
so there's that but are you going to put

1883
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:48,318
more bays like this as well

1884
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:49,838
so the 35 square foot building in front

1885
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:51,519
the goodwill that you guys saw

1886
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:52,960
that will all be built out for more

1887
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:55,199
indoor so we'll have

1888
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,318
we'll have six more rooms the green

1889
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:57,679
light goodwill

1890
01:01:56,318 --> 01:01:59,279
and i do want to talk about this maybe

1891
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:01,440
we could talk about it in the other room

1892
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:04,000
but we were talking about do

1893
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,880
relatively smaller businesses right now

1894
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,719
in cannabis

1895
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,000
have an advantage because not they're

1896
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:10,078
not over leveraged

1897
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,519
they don't have too many things and so

1898
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:13,280
you know it's sort of like what's wrong

1899
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:14,559
with running a small business

1900
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,920
in the scheme of things why does

1901
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,760
everyone have to go huge so maybe we can

1902
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,680
talk about that a little bit i mean

1903
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:22,559
i got caught up in the rat race at first

1904
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:24,798
i thought i wanted a 100 000 square foot

1905
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,240
we get through the science most people

1906
01:02:24,798 --> 01:02:28,559
that's intimidating

1907
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:30,239
right we've talked about finances most

1908
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:30,880
people that's too intimidating we talked

1909
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:33,199
about

1910
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:36,640
dude i'm not a farmer i just grow plant

1911
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:38,719
you know that's intimidating

1912
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:39,679
how how do you deal with going but i'm

1913
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:42,798
still going to try

1914
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:44,879
something that no one else is doing

1915
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:47,119
when when you're really just trying to

1916
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,519
meet the medical needs of a community

1917
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:48,880
too

1918
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:50,798
you know what i mean there's a different

1919
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:53,358
agenda where

1920
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:54,559
the quality is the focus and guess how

1921
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:57,440
much our yield is

1922
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:59,200
versus no no we don't care we just got a

1923
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,798
push to get this number

1924
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:02,879
i was kind of personally i was kind of

1925
01:03:00,798 --> 01:03:06,480
blessed with the fearless nature

1926
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:08,798
so to me it was challenge accepted

1927
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,760
you know it kind of state of mind but

1928
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:11,519
for the most part

1929
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:13,839
when you know what you're doing is so

1930
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:15,038
right it's hard for anybody to tell you

1931
01:03:13,838 --> 01:03:16,159
you're wrong

1932
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,760
and that's just something that you just

1933
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:19,358
gotta and the confirmations are

1934
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:22,240
literally the plants

1935
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:23,598
they're all about the worm the the

1936
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:26,078
finance book

1937
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:27,760
the satisfaction of your employees the

1938
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:30,480
efficiency of your your

1939
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,839
the flow like when you go to work people

1940
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,639
like to go to work

1941
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:36,239
versus a drudgery because of all the

1942
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:37,838
managed problems they have to deal with

1943
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:39,199
i've never said this is a living system

1944
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:40,639
that we just walked in i'm not sure if

1945
01:03:39,199 --> 01:03:42,960
you guys felt it but

1946
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:44,879
there's energy in these rooms there's a

1947
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,199
living energy and when you walk into

1948
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,200
them

1949
01:03:45,199 --> 01:03:48,639
the air is fresh it's not stale it

1950
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:52,318
doesn't smell like water

1951
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:55,358
it smells like like air

1952
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:58,239
like supposed to smell so it's just

1953
01:03:55,358 --> 01:03:59,358
it's a good clean energetic environment

1954
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:01,358
like when i come here

1955
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:03,279
i i i drink coffee in the morning don't

1956
01:04:01,358 --> 01:04:05,038
get me wrong but just walking through

1957
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:06,880
those doors that door right there

1958
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,880
gives wakes me up gives me energy makes

1959
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:12,079
me feel alive so i

1960
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,480
i'm thankful for that and that right

1961
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:14,079
there

1962
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,000
should give the person who feels like

1963
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,680
crap some courage

1964
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,599
right to try something a little

1965
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:21,598
different that

1966
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:23,440
actually helps lift you up like the

1967
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,079
plant reaching out to lift you up

1968
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,358
because it's

1969
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:28,640
it's a nurturing environment you know

1970
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:31,038
you can talk about this a little bit

1971
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:34,719
more when it's quieter there are so many

1972
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:35,359
arguments to transform over to a living

1973
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:37,199
soil

1974
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:39,038
and if you can say to someone and you

1975
01:04:37,199 --> 01:04:41,519
should really really

1976
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:43,280
nail this one down with people you would

1977
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:43,838
have to replace your system every year

1978
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,400
yeah

1979
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:48,400
it's like i don't understand why that

1980
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,440
really would not resonate with someone i

1981
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,200
really don't know what i've heard

1982
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:52,559
what i've heard and and i think this is

1983
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,480
what we should talk about the house is

1984
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:56,000
actually what i've heard so i agree

1985
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,880
there are actual reasons why i want to

1986
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,239
get to what like

1987
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,000
someone's starting a business they're

1988
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:00,719
doing is the thing that should matter to

1989
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,920
them

1990
01:05:00,719 --> 01:05:03,919
yeah it's costs

1991
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:10,000
no matter what

1992
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:12,399
dude i think we'll make it that picture

1993
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,400
come on yeah it'll be happen

1994
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:17,280
it'll get there once i get those

1995
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,200
hand-caught sharks in it

1996
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,720
you gotta make the grotto see so you're

1997
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:22,960
gonna that's how you'll end up changing

1998
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:22,959
you'll be

1999
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:30,079
we'll get some some jade from the

2000
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:31,838

i am so grateful to be here who are you

2006
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,039
steve campbell with green life

2007
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:50,879
productions

2008
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:53,039
steve campbell i've heard that name in a

2009
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:54,640
lot of different places but guess what

2010
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,520
i'm really happy to hear it right now

2011
01:05:54,639 --> 01:06:01,199
because today we went to his facility

2012
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:03,119
which total grow footage

2013
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:04,558
what's that what's the facility's total

2014
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:05,440
growth space currently because i know

2015
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,559
you're expanding but

2016
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:08,720
uh currently we're operating about

2017
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:10,240
twelve thousand square foot okay

2018
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:12,719
uh with the potential to grow out to

2019
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:13,358
about another forty thousand plus

2020
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:15,118
greenhouse

2021
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:18,798
twenty thousand foot greenhouse the next

2022
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:22,000
phase is

2023
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:22,000
um it is

2024
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:28,078
it's really great to have been to a

2025
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:31,199
facility that sees how the life

2026
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:35,280
translates through its process

2027
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:39,358
and this is what i want to talk about

2028
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:43,119
it's not only part of

2029
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:45,358
the bed it's part of the cloning process

2030
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:46,318
it's part of the up potting process it's

2031
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:49,838
part of the

2032
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:53,038
composting post growth process

2033
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:54,639
it's part of your r d process

2034
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:55,920
i'm not talking about structure facility

2035
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:56,639
which by the way the efficiency is

2036
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,318
amazing

2037
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:00,159
and and the lighting i'm specifically

2038
01:06:58,318 --> 01:07:03,519
talking about soil

2039
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:07,038
that that life

2040
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:07,838
process is a complete cycle and because

2041
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:12,720
of that

2042
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:15,759
there's no misuse of the resource

2043
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:18,318
in nurturing your plants yeah

2044
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,280
which is loss either found in the plant

2045
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:22,480
growth

2046
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:25,039
yield the accountant right

2047
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:26,159
your wallet like that's that's where

2048
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:28,720
that cycle

2049
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:30,078
of waste or misuse starts kicking out

2050
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:30,719
and you're like oh i feel it in this

2051
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:32,640
area

2052
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:34,159
time you know because i got all these

2053
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:36,159
messes to clean up

2054
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:38,239
i didn't see one mess in the entire

2055
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:41,598
place keep a clean shot

2056
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:43,679
no i okay good it wasn't yeah

2057
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:46,000
it's a clean shop but you didn't say it

2058
01:07:43,679 --> 01:07:48,798
wasn't it's not an unmessy shop

2059
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,920
right mess is is the projects that are

2060
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:52,960
half finished

2061
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:55,358
that you step over that ruin the flow

2062
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,000
all right it's a shit you gotta clean up

2063
01:07:55,358 --> 01:07:58,719
yep

2064
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,760
and there was no messes and even the

2065
01:07:58,719 --> 01:08:01,759
messy room

2066
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:04,160
was really because you had to move them

2067
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:04,880
like hold on once again it's so messy in

2068
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:06,798
here

2069
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,480
like three feet of adjustment on

2070
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:11,519
something on wheels

2071
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:15,519
is not a mess right true okay

2072
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:19,198
so most places

2073
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:21,600
there's a mess somewhere and that's what

2074
01:08:19,198 --> 01:08:24,079
is taking all the energy

2075
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:26,159
you know we uh we definitely run a tight

2076
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:27,519
ship uh

2077
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:28,960
early on one of the things that we

2078
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,920
didn't really have a lot of experience

2079
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,679
in was a cul-de-sac

2080
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,920
there was no other cult-based facilities

2081
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:36,960
so what we tried to model after was

2082
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:38,640
either a restaurant and or a hospital

2083
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:40,000
try to keep it clean try to keep it

2084
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,600
sterile try because that's who was

2085
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,158
inspecting our facility was restaurant

2086
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,480
people

2087
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,679
yep um so their rule set so we had to

2088
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:46,798
keep in mind that people who were coming

2089
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:47,279
in that were gonna write us a ticket

2090
01:08:46,798 --> 01:08:48,798
what's their

2091
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:50,480
favorite what was their pass where they

2092
01:08:48,798 --> 01:08:52,479
were coming from restaurant the majority

2093
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:52,879
of them so that's why we are so uptight

2094
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:55,039
with our

2095
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,000
clean walls clean every day we clean our

2096
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:57,679
floors every

2097
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,198
every cycle we break our rooms down and

2098
01:08:57,679 --> 01:09:00,880
clean our rooms from top to bottom

2099
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:02,158
um our trim room gets broken down once a

2100
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,039
month i drive them to get broken down

2101
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:05,679
every cycle

2102
01:09:03,039 --> 01:09:06,719
or every every harvest um so i mean the

2103
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:08,239
whole place is just

2104
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:10,798
we're really at the end of the day every

2105
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:13,039
single position is a glorified janitor

2106
01:09:10,798 --> 01:09:15,439
uh but you know it's it's it's what we

2107
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:15,439
got to do

2108
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,560
what do you mean by janitor because i

2109
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:21,519
know you're not just meaning toilet

2110
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,960
cleaner

2111
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,199
no i just mean we clean that messes you

2112
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:27,039
know and we but we don't step over them

2113
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:28,238
our job is to clean them up and to to

2114
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:31,359
make sure the place is

2115
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:33,198
is looking sharp and that at any one

2116
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,719
point in time

2117
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:36,238
someone a state official could walk

2118
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:37,600
through it a patient can walk through it

2119
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,959
and feel comfortable a state official

2120
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,759
can walk through it not be writing up

2121
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:41,920
tickets

2122
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,960
this wasn't a surprise but i have no

2123
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,239
doubt if i showed up

2124
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:47,759
next whatever at whatever time during

2125
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:50,079
legal business hours a week

2126
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:51,279
like honestly it would look exactly the

2127
01:09:50,079 --> 01:09:55,039
same i don't do tours

2128
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:56,800
and you've been here so yeah

2129
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:59,359
did you just do all this yesterday and

2130
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:02,079
just show up

2131
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:04,319
but you never know honestly usually i

2132
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:06,079
see but that's why it's done in a day

2133
01:10:04,319 --> 01:10:07,679
you don't leave it to tomorrow you don't

2134
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:09,359
j yeah and it stacks

2135
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:11,600
yes it's it's not you guys that i'm

2136
01:10:09,359 --> 01:10:13,839
always in preparation for it exactly

2137
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,600
okay it's it's honestly the state they

2138
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:18,960
have their regulation their rules

2139
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:20,239
you you're playing the game um so

2140
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,920
it's not worth it i want to keep them

2141
01:10:20,238 --> 01:10:23,279
happy they come to make a recommendation

2142
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,560
whether i have to it or not i'm going to

2143
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:27,198
listen i'm going to do it because

2144
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:30,719
it shows that i listen um and part of

2145
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:32,559
that is

2146
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:34,800
part of the effect of listening that you

2147
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:37,920
did for them the understandings

2148
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,800
two ways is that and that second way

2149
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,279
back and forth

2150
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:42,400
allowed you when i got there to go hold

2151
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:44,559
on different rule set

2152
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:46,559
new state different facility license

2153
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,719
here are our rules and structures this

2154
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,679
is what i'm expecting of you

2155
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:53,198
no negatives no weird lala hey man can

2156
01:10:51,679 --> 01:10:56,800
we just

2157
01:10:53,198 --> 01:11:00,000
this is the rules the role right

2158
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:02,880
and if very clear-cut

2159
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,679
and so having that knowledge walking

2160
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,400
into it

2161
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:07,359
we didn't have one issue the whole day

2162
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:09,198
versus

2163
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:10,639
right going on a tour and somebody doing

2164
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:12,238
this and somebody doing that messing

2165
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,560
stuff up here and oh what are you doing

2166
01:11:12,238 --> 01:11:13,919
i

2167
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,679
was supposed to do that yesterday you

2168
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,840
know it's like yeah that's

2169
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:19,920
the messes and so i really appreciate

2170
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,480
that it's rare to actually have somebody

2171
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,119
so clear

2172
01:11:20,479 --> 01:11:23,919
like this is how you can best experience

2173
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:27,519
what i've

2174
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:30,880
worked so hard at you know again it's a

2175
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:33,040
we're on our 22nd cycle so times three

2176
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,760
we've done it 60 we're on our 66th time

2177
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:37,920
now

2178
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:40,480
uh around the led 66 times

2179
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:41,440
but when we were looking at the bed it's

2180
01:11:40,479 --> 01:11:44,079
over here

2181
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:44,479
and then over here right yeah then over

2182
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:47,519
here

2183
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:50,000
but to be honest over here

2184
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:51,360
yes but even that though that wasn't a

2185
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,640
technique that we learned until several

2186
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:55,759
cycles in that we noticed

2187
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:57,600
so how did that cycle shift like you in

2188
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,199
in working with these creatures these

2189
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,960
beds right

2190
01:11:59,198 --> 01:12:02,799
you were like oh there's a better way

2191
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,880
there's more efficiency we used to

2192
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,560
remove the root ball and what we what we

2193
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,159
did was over time what we learned was

2194
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,560
we're harvesting our worms when we do

2195
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:09,839
that

2196
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,760
and not only worms but all the other

2197
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,840
biology behind them the entire arousal

2198
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,119
yeah the whole plants actually

2199
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,319
everything you've been building pretty

2200
01:12:15,119 --> 01:12:16,640
much or the plant's been building i

2201
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:19,679
guess

2202
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:20,320
you could say so that's true we're

2203
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:23,440
really

2204
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:24,799
doing a uh not doing a service to the

2205
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:26,479
soil by doing that we were taking the

2206
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,400
most valuable part out of it every time

2207
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:30,158
so that the soil wasn't advancing

2208
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:32,079
uh and we were actually seeing less and

2209
01:12:30,158 --> 01:12:33,679
less warm population in our soil

2210
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:34,719
um so then all we did was we just moved

2211
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:36,399
over 60 that's where you're going to

2212
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:39,039
have a higher concentrations of your

2213
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:41,359
cocoons and egg casings

2214
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:42,960
which proportionately everything is

2215
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:44,639
exponentially going the wrong direction

2216
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:46,319
so we just shifted whole over we created

2217
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:47,600
this great pattern style where we just

2218
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:49,599
go north hole let's hole

2219
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:50,719
our north hole south hole um between

2220
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,600
cycles um

2221
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:54,640
and uh yeah it allows the root ball to

2222
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,440
to break down and

2223
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,960
it allows that that biology to transfer

2224
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:01,198
to other parts of the soil

2225
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:02,960
uh because at the time needed to spread

2226
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:04,158
and uh yeah we're not harvesting the

2227
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,000
biology we're

2228
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:07,198
we're just taking the soil needed to to

2229
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:09,198
plant the next corn

2230
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:10,319
you're you're not even harvesting the bi

2231
01:13:09,198 --> 01:13:13,759
or

2232
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:15,198
when when your clones transition and are

2233
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,600
up potted

2234
01:13:15,198 --> 01:13:18,960
it's the same ecosystem on a smaller

2235
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,400
scale so there's a little bit of

2236
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,640
isolation a little bit of

2237
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:24,719
you know decrease of the diversity

2238
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:28,800
because of that smaller scale

2239
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:30,800
but the reality is is the transition

2240
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,560
there's always stressors you can add to

2241
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:35,279
the transition but

2242
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,560
on the soil micro you know rhizosphere

2243
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:39,119
level

2244
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:40,960
is as seamless as possible yeah even the

2245
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:43,359
moisture content like you know

2246
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:45,039
i don't see you taking that ecosystem

2247
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:46,639
and then having to really drench it in

2248
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:48,079
good because you're going to saturate

2249
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,679
the whole medium

2250
01:13:48,079 --> 01:13:51,198
it's not it literally is going it's a

2251
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:53,440
transition

2252
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:54,879
you're just moving it from one equation

2253
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:56,479
one group to yeah it's a tourist

2254
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,000
and like you said it's less shock to

2255
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:59,599
plant it's the same yeah it's on a

2256
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,640
smaller in a smaller pot but it's the

2257
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:03,679
same soil so

2258
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:05,280
it's relatively same ph same micro same

2259
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:08,239
biology

2260
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:10,399
board worms literally in the clone pod

2261
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:11,519
there's already established fully mature

2262
01:14:10,399 --> 01:14:13,119
ecosystems on

2263
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:15,199
on that trophic level we just got to

2264
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:16,800
make sure that the environmental changes

2265
01:14:15,198 --> 01:14:19,359
are the same so that i'm not coming from

2266
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:21,440
a humid veg to a dry flower room so

2267
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:22,639
right on the operator side of things you

2268
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:24,000
got to make sure to make the proper

2269
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,600
adjustments right away

2270
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,679
um because there's a day or two of like

2271
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,280
an example the end of flower i'm running

2272
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:30,640
my rooms on the dry side so

2273
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:32,238
when i go to plant a room i want to be

2274
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:33,760
on the humid side if i if i forget to

2275
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:35,359
switch my humidity set point

2276
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:37,199
and i plant into a dry room i just

2277
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:39,439
create a huge stress factor yeah

2278
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:41,439
see and this is where the management is

2279
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:44,319
so important and understanding

2280
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:44,319
how that one

2281
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:48,320
i hear is it worth it that's what i hear

2282
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,560
people is it worth i just don't see

2283
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:52,319
how you know what's it worth right you

2284
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,719
go wait

2285
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:56,079
that five seconds to turn around and do

2286
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:58,960
it because you know you

2287
01:14:56,079 --> 01:15:00,559
should right what's it worth well you

2288
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,399
just paid some guy thirty thousand

2289
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:04,159
dollars to fix up the plumbing

2290
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:05,920
issue and this and you lost your entire

2291
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:08,799
crop because it flood you know

2292
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:10,158
it's like that's where the worth is so

2293
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:12,800
that you're not actually paying

2294
01:15:10,158 --> 01:15:13,759
the money you know that's where the

2295
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,440
farmer

2296
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:20,159
keeps go transitions from thriving

2297
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:21,759
because the real worth isn't thriving

2298
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:23,198
you know the survival mindset that we

2299
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,079
were talking about versus surviving

2300
01:15:23,198 --> 01:15:26,079
versus thriving yeah

2301
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:38,559
so we re we lifted some of those rocks

2302
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,439
we forgot to lift more of them though we

2303
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:42,159
should

2304
01:15:39,439 --> 01:15:43,439
yeah but the nice part is we still did

2305
01:15:42,158 --> 01:15:48,559
and what the point was

2306
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:48,559
is that when you lift the rock um

2307
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,079
that's how you it's a window it's a

2308
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:54,158
portal

2309
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:55,439
and you can do it if you have plexiglas

2310
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:58,079
and you just put plexiglas

2311
01:15:55,439 --> 01:15:59,759
down and then you cover it with uh

2312
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:01,359
cardboard and then put something over

2313
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,360
top of it so it doesn't move

2314
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:04,719
they'll just turn that like like the

2315
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:06,880
underside of the rocket so you'll see

2316
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:08,158
the worm channels and the insect paths

2317
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,400
and it's really great for outdoor

2318
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:12,399
growers to do that as like what's going

2319
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,920
on under here we got to put in a window

2320
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:16,719
there you go that's good it's kind of

2321
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:19,600
fun how do i get on my beds now

2322
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:20,960
yeah and so when you remove that rock we

2323
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,520
did get the video of us

2324
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,319
lifting or just leaning over yeah that

2325
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,840
was cool

2326
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:28,639
and literally the bridge what was the

2327
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:31,520
bridge the body of a worm

2328
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:31,520
like coming through

2329
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,158
now the rock mulch has been a great idea

2330
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:38,159
man it just creates that the more

2331
01:16:36,158 --> 01:16:39,920
consistent moisture so in between waters

2332
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:41,439
if the soil does tend to dry

2333
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:43,039
too much or whatever the the worms

2334
01:16:41,439 --> 01:16:46,839
always have that it's a good

2335
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:48,079
base to run to that moisture zone to run

2336
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:50,800
too

2337
01:16:48,079 --> 01:16:51,600
it also creates these almost like little

2338
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,679
windows

2339
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:55,039
where you're not getting that same green

2340
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:58,239
growth

2341
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:58,719
um from your cover crop yep yep almost

2342
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:00,718
you know

2343
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:03,840
little snorkels because those roof mats

2344
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:03,840
can get real thick

2345
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,319
yep but in the flowering room the

2346
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:08,880
consistency of coloring and everything

2347
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:11,599
was

2348
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:13,039
really something to behold to me it

2349
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:16,480
looked really

2350
01:17:13,039 --> 01:17:19,359
nice thank you great yeah

2351
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:21,279
we're uh we pretty much i mean we rarely

2352
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:23,519
see unhealthy plants in our facility

2353
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:25,599
um just recently with these new lights

2354
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,520
pushing the beds as hard as we can

2355
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:29,520
um now we've actually seen until we've

2356
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,880
actually reached our limitations finally

2357
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,320
um before lights are the big were the

2358
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:34,159
biggest limiting factor and we couldn't

2359
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:36,559
even push our system hard enough to ever

2360
01:17:34,158 --> 01:17:38,879
see the limitations so now you're seeing

2361
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:40,480
where's the limitation with the soil

2362
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,960
okay i was never able to reach that

2363
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:42,839
before

2364
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,000
okay and so how are you seeing the

2365
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,480
limitation

2366
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,198
no i i could just see where or where it

2367
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:50,639
potentially your deficiency is yes

2368
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:52,479
it's hard to see these efficiencies not

2369
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,480
that it is a problem but you can see

2370
01:17:52,479 --> 01:17:55,678
that because of this extra demand

2371
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:57,198
you're going to see like it's hard to

2372
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:58,158
see the trends that we're going from

2373
01:17:57,198 --> 01:18:01,519
sorry i can start something

2374
01:17:58,158 --> 01:18:03,039
tending to mining right so so this is

2375
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:05,040
really fascinating because i look at

2376
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:07,279
this i go you know we talk all the time

2377
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:09,600
about the living soil how like paramount

2378
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:13,198
that is but here's a technology

2379
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:14,800
that's made like a huge positive

2380
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:15,839
difference so it's the marriage of the

2381
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,239
two

2382
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,360
that you know because that is not

2383
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:20,799
negligible

2384
01:18:19,359 --> 01:18:23,279
the difference that these lights have

2385
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:25,119
made it's not it doesn't sound like it

2386
01:18:23,279 --> 01:18:27,198
would you i don't need to know the price

2387
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:30,399
but would you say it's a

2388
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:32,639
double what a high-end price

2389
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:34,158
light already is like you're talking

2390
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,560
about it's a more cost but that's fine

2391
01:18:34,158 --> 01:18:36,399
because

2392
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,080
the benefits are we're talking about

2393
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:40,960
folks right now the lights wow okay if

2394
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:44,399
you want to oh

2395
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:46,880
no by the way a good led now that we are

2396
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:48,960
uh they're face lights post lights led

2397
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,520
led a3i is their mothership light but

2398
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,198
they make

2399
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:53,040
several models of lights that are all

2400
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:54,639
extremely spectacular i've worked with

2401
01:18:53,039 --> 01:18:55,359
all pretty much all of them at this

2402
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:57,920
point

2403
01:18:55,359 --> 01:19:00,158
um no it's a really good led company

2404
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,840
they make really high-end led fixtures

2405
01:19:00,158 --> 01:19:04,000
that are just super well built the

2406
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:06,079
reason i like them is because

2407
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
in the last five years the trend that

2408
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:10,399
i've seen in the led industry

2409
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,198
is that the biggest hang up for

2410
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:13,439
purchasers

2411
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:15,439
was the price point so what led

2412
01:19:13,439 --> 01:19:18,479
companies did was they did they

2413
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:20,960
they solely went to uh

2414
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:22,000
lower the price point they try to yeah

2415
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,880
attend to that

2416
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,439
so versus focusing on building the best

2417
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,880
light

2418
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:28,639
they just try to build the cheapest

2419
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,679
light so they all try to build a cheaper

2420
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:31,920
price point light

2421
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:32,880
and they all ended up building cheaper

2422
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:35,840
lights

2423
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,359
um folks did not froze exactly so folks

2424
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:38,319
did not do that they were the first id

2425
01:19:37,359 --> 01:19:39,039
coming we were trying all these new

2426
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:41,279
lights out

2427
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:42,319
that brought a light it was like whoa

2428
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:44,000
this isn't a tin foil

2429
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:45,439
it's a tool like when you look at it

2430
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,238
you're like this thing is fully

2431
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:49,279
adjustable

2432
01:19:46,238 --> 01:19:51,039
and i'm looking at it and you literally

2433
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:52,719
just allen rich okay that whole thing

2434
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:53,439
just comes off and snaps back in it's

2435
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:55,920
like

2436
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:57,039
this is a functional tool it's like a

2437
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:00,239
multi-tool right

2438
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:02,158
like i need it to be over here and yet

2439
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:04,319
it's not just a plastic snap

2440
01:20:02,158 --> 01:20:05,679
that's gonna eventually snap right now

2441
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:06,799
they shouldn't be well built so that

2442
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:09,760
that's one of the things they've really

2443
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:11,360
um sold me on on the company um and just

2444
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:13,039
the way they future built them um

2445
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:14,719
they're extremely versatile from

2446
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:16,639
spectrum to

2447
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:18,079
to the ramp up ramp down mode you

2448
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:19,359
totally played with that how long until

2449
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:21,279
you found you're like hey look this is

2450
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:24,399
like sunrise and sunset

2451
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:25,920
and here we go no it's fun and uh

2452
01:20:24,399 --> 01:20:27,519
i noticed the plant's less stressed out

2453
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,279
though by doing that so

2454
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,880
to transition into those rooms and when

2455
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:31,759
it's hard to increase the ppfd on the

2456
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:34,400
plants

2457
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:36,079
i'm not just hitting them all at once so

2458
01:20:34,399 --> 01:20:37,439
we're just seeing happier plants in

2459
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:39,840
general

2460
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:40,960
i think i think this is almost shifting

2461
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:44,319
the um

2462
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:45,679
role of a bud tender right

2463
01:20:44,319 --> 01:20:47,599
it's like when you're walking then the

2464
01:20:45,679 --> 01:20:49,359
person's watering and they're just going

2465
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:52,400
you know they're not a janitor

2466
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:55,439
they're the actual bud tenders right the

2467
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:55,439
actual bud tenders

2468
01:20:57,039 --> 01:21:00,479
yeah and the whole facility was hand

2469
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:02,000
watered yeah we can't water

2470
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:04,238
and it didn't look like you guys were

2471
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,439
running anything but water

2472
01:21:04,238 --> 01:21:09,759
um the only thing we run primarily would

2473
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:13,599
just be our compost extracts teas

2474
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:15,760
um do the occasional protozoa infusion

2475
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,760
can i can i talk about that for a second

2476
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,880
the reason for that is this is an

2477
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:21,760
ecosystem

2478
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:24,319
that is populated but that population

2479
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:28,239
has to come to something called a quorum

2480
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:30,079
okay and a quorum is what takes place

2481
01:21:28,238 --> 01:21:31,519
in like the bioluminescent fish have you

2482
01:21:30,079 --> 01:21:32,399
ever seen that on some year yes yeah

2483
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:34,880
right

2484
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:36,960
that's actually a bacteria inside the

2485
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,840
fish that the fish can figure out how to

2486
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:40,960
turn on with an

2487
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:43,440
enzyme and all at the same time

2488
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:45,119
trillions of these independent organisms

2489
01:21:43,439 --> 01:21:48,399
go okay cool

2490
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:50,079
and light right like it's really trippy

2491
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:51,119
it's the same thing of like you eat some

2492
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:52,880
food and then you're like

2493
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:54,559
instantaneously you get like a film over

2494
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:56,800
your teeth the biofilm

2495
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,880
okay that's a quorum right like your

2496
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,079
compost teas brewing and then all of a

2497
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:02,239
sudden

2498
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:03,359
right you get the foam and the thick and

2499
01:22:02,238 --> 01:22:06,638
the crust

2500
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:08,238
right that's one population hit its

2501
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:12,400
quorum and then went

2502
01:22:08,238 --> 01:22:15,678
ape shit and it shifted the ecology

2503
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:18,399
right and so that's why t's are so

2504
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:19,039
volatile in comparison to an extract

2505
01:22:18,399 --> 01:22:21,359
you're just

2506
01:22:19,039 --> 01:22:22,560
adding more teammates into that

2507
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:24,559
ecosystem because

2508
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,600
everything's eating each other and

2509
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:28,480
trying to create

2510
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:29,840
the most nurtured balance and so it's a

2511
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:32,799
really cool thing to add those

2512
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,440
extracts without having to add nutrients

2513
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,440
to it

2514
01:22:33,439 --> 01:22:38,719
because you're adding there's they're

2515
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:39,039
called amino sugars and that's why your

2516
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:42,560
in

2517
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:45,600
requirements change because

2518
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:48,960
when your plant is pulling the nutrition

2519
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:53,440
out of the actual microbiology it's like

2520
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:56,158
eating a steak so but on that scale

2521
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:56,799
the creature meat is called an amino you

2522
01:22:56,158 --> 01:23:00,000
know

2523
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:01,760
uh sugar an amino sugar and which is all

2524
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,600
because of the carbon the photosynthesis

2525
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,560
sugar is going into it like that's the

2526
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:08,639
meat

2527
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:11,679
and your plant wants to be a carnivore

2528
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:14,880
and eat these biology sugars

2529
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:16,399
instead of in and even the in that's

2530
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:18,400
processed through the air is through the

2531
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:20,479
biology of that bacteria we were talking

2532
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:23,679
about on the clovers yep

2533
01:23:20,479 --> 01:23:26,799
yeah yeah and so you're just adding

2534
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:28,560
more livestock into the into the grow

2535
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,000
and for us like but as far as the teas

2536
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:32,719
and extracts go

2537
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,238
it's a process that we at times really

2538
01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:36,639
don't even need like when you look at

2539
01:23:34,238 --> 01:23:38,959
the microscope all my players are there

2540
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:39,920
but to some degree i have to use compost

2541
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,198
because it's part of our waste

2542
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,440
management program

2543
01:23:41,198 --> 01:23:44,319
um so like at some point i'm just top

2544
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:46,238
dressing just

2545
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:48,079
because i don't want to have 10 yards of

2546
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:50,158
compost building up um

2547
01:23:48,079 --> 01:23:52,559
so does this state have a requirement

2548
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:52,879
that it has to stay on site after it's

2549
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,120
been

2550
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:56,239
thermophilic so that that's something

2551
01:23:55,119 --> 01:23:58,238
you sell it

2552
01:23:56,238 --> 01:23:59,839
i i've sold compost when i can't give it

2553
01:23:58,238 --> 01:24:02,879
away

2554
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:03,520
i've given it away in small bits to to

2555
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,440
friends well

2556
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:07,360
these are all variables but if the law

2557
01:24:05,439 --> 01:24:09,119
says it has to stay on site which

2558
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:10,639
in some places i don't want to make a

2559
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:12,238
business model out of it because

2560
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:13,679
maybe there is one day but for the most

2561
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:16,399
part i know

2562
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:18,480
damn well if i make a cannabis compost

2563
01:24:16,399 --> 01:24:21,839
and the state finds out that i'm making

2564
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:23,599
compost out of cannabis cannabis

2565
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,760
instantaneously and i'm making money off

2566
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:28,079
of it forty percent we want

2567
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,920
forty percent of your compost money

2568
01:24:28,079 --> 01:24:31,359
somehow so it's that's why i don't want

2569
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:32,960
to try to sell anything right this is

2570
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:36,719
literally the absolute

2571
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:39,760
waste waste stream so we want 40

2572
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:43,119
of your waste yeah 30 tax on compost

2573
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:44,000
we want your 40 of your poo so right now

2574
01:24:43,119 --> 01:24:47,198
we just put it all back

2575
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,399
in the system um wow okay but that

2576
01:24:47,198 --> 01:24:49,839
actually is part of

2577
01:24:48,399 --> 01:24:51,439
we were talking earlier about it can get

2578
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:53,440
too rich

2579
01:24:51,439 --> 01:24:54,799
and this is where the biology gets

2580
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:58,158
almost clay

2581
01:24:54,800 --> 01:25:01,760
right like it it'll really thicken up

2582
01:24:58,158 --> 01:25:03,759
because it's missing that other scale

2583
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:05,520
because it's still in a pot and this is

2584
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:07,039
where the gopher would come and take

2585
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,679
raw minerals from the bottom of the

2586
01:25:07,039 --> 01:25:10,238
earth you know dump it on the surface

2587
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:12,560
right

2588
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:15,359
this is where vice versa then once up

2589
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:17,280
here it takes organic material

2590
01:25:15,359 --> 01:25:18,880
drives it down into the earth like it

2591
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:21,119
had a role and a purpose

2592
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,480
it still does and so do we and they call

2593
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:25,198
it hugel cultures

2594
01:25:22,479 --> 01:25:27,198
that's what we do on our scale we take

2595
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:27,678
the trees and put it into the ground

2596
01:25:27,198 --> 01:25:30,079
right

2597
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:31,359
biochar right we're just working at

2598
01:25:30,079 --> 01:25:33,840
different scales

2599
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:35,599
for sure uh yeah there's definitely

2600
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,840
certain uh aspects of the living soil

2601
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:41,199
system that we can't incorporate indoors

2602
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:42,880
some of the macro features like ground

2603
01:25:41,198 --> 01:25:46,158
squirrels and

2604
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:48,719
rabbits no rodents aren't welcome

2605
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:50,079
they're not we've been there we got a

2606
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:52,560
rodent we got one

2607
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:54,000
well and this is any business right and

2608
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:57,520
so your model of the

2609
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:59,119
restaurant or the the hospital

2610
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:01,280
they still got to deal with that too

2611
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:01,279
yeah

2612
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,560
but i will say

2613
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:10,000
you got to know who you call and what

2614
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:11,679
they use

2615
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:13,279
because if you're trying to get rid of

2616
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:15,520
something and

2617
01:26:13,279 --> 01:26:16,479
they're leaving stuff around your place

2618
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:20,159
making messes

2619
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:22,238
and it has any form of decon rat killer

2620
01:26:20,158 --> 01:26:24,079
bait all this stuff

2621
01:26:22,238 --> 01:26:25,359
because most often what happens is you

2622
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:26,880
tell someone who has

2623
01:26:25,359 --> 01:26:29,519
time which is usually someone who

2624
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:32,719
doesn't have anything better to do

2625
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:34,719
to go deal with a problem right at which

2626
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:35,600
point they go to the store and say hey i

2627
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:39,279
need some help

2628
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:41,760
what kills rats and then someone who has

2629
01:26:39,279 --> 01:26:44,800
less training than any of them

2630
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:47,119
sells them something and then you get a

2631
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:49,760
contamination violation

2632
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:50,559
so it's there's a whole process of going

2633
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,960
no no

2634
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:54,960
the whole facility runs on this

2635
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:57,039
perspective

2636
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,319
yeah 100 you gotta be uh really try to

2637
01:26:57,039 --> 01:26:58,880
take an organic approach through and

2638
01:26:58,319 --> 01:27:01,759
through

2639
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:03,279
as much as you possibly can um obviously

2640
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:05,119
you get a rodent

2641
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:06,399
you get a bird a pigeon there's there's

2642
01:27:05,119 --> 01:27:07,359
certain times you got to eradicate

2643
01:27:06,399 --> 01:27:11,439
certain things

2644
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:11,439
bb gun is organic yeah

2645
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:16,320
it's an acute amount of lead put into

2646
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:19,840
the ecosystem

2647
01:27:16,319 --> 01:27:22,319
and it fully composted it's just fine

2648
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:24,560
what about the dogs they were actually

2649
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:26,399
uh our originals

2650
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,760
no but we said when we first opened up

2651
01:27:26,399 --> 01:27:28,479
we actually lived across the street in

2652
01:27:27,760 --> 01:27:30,800
the apartments

2653
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:32,079
um for about a little over a year and we

2654
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:33,039
take the dogs at working day they run

2655
01:27:32,079 --> 01:27:34,800
the property

2656
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:36,238
um so there they they ran the property

2657
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:39,440
for i want to say

2658
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:40,638
really closer to a year and a half

2659
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:42,479
but the thing is that that's when we

2660
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:43,840
first opened up everybody saw us and uh

2661
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:45,119
the pictures were taken of them at the

2662
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:47,119
front gate and whatnot

2663
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:50,000
with barbed wire like it's a horrible

2664
01:27:47,119 --> 01:27:51,760
image with rottweilers

2665
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,520
you're a big dude kind of scared beat

2666
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:56,000
people up for a living right but

2667
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:58,000
you're through with mike there's like

2668
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,479
four years and people have been dating

2669
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,079
a big teddy bear look at you you never

2670
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:03,599
get that side out i mean they're like

2671
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:05,679
you know you don't

2672
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:06,880
primal until this day people think that

2673
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:10,399
they run that property

2674
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:15,359
uh hold up i'm not gonna wasn't here

2675
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:17,679
well you wanna go there with invitation

2676
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:20,000
see that's part of community too you you

2677
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:22,880
work with each other and you welcome

2678
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:24,238
but you have good boundaries or a lot of

2679
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:27,760
dogs

2680
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:30,799
which are good boundaries and now we uh

2681
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:34,960
they're definitely they're more of a

2682
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,960
liability as a security guard than uh

2683
01:28:37,119 --> 01:28:40,559
well i actually think you're giving a

2684
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:42,159
job to human beings is good too

2685
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,920
he's a very nice guy i've met two of

2686
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:48,559
them team team humans

2687
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:51,600
people team human see it's important

2688
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:52,239
but yeah the security factor is always a

2689
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:55,520
big deal though

2690
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:55,519
at the at these facilities

2691
01:28:55,760 --> 01:29:00,400
it is also a deterrent to have a pile of

2692
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:03,439
composting material

2693
01:29:00,399 --> 01:29:04,479
outside the front door really short it's

2694
01:29:03,439 --> 01:29:08,879
a lot of robbers

2695
01:29:04,479 --> 01:29:11,599
they're confused there's strange smells

2696
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:15,279
barbed wire we're at a farm there's a

2697
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,280
goddamn cow sound over here

2698
01:29:16,158 --> 01:29:19,920
i've been to they are kind of out of

2699
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:22,238
town and so then they do have their

2700
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:24,399
perimeters and they have security

2701
01:29:22,238 --> 01:29:25,919
you're like in town yeah we're playing

2702
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:26,799
neighbors here so that is that a good

2703
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,880
thing that might

2704
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:30,320
it's a beautiful community yeah i mean

2705
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:33,039
but you still have

2706
01:29:30,319 --> 01:29:34,158
like security concerns well i mean

2707
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:35,679
there's really i guess there's two ways

2708
01:29:34,158 --> 01:29:36,960
to look at it um

2709
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:38,158
yeah we're surrounded by a lot of

2710
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,198
traffic but we're also surrounded by a

2711
01:29:38,158 --> 01:29:41,519
lot of cops

2712
01:29:39,198 --> 01:29:43,439
uh so if we're in some rural out in the

2713
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:45,040
boonies out in the middle of nowhere

2714
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:47,198
it's gonna be a lot longer for cops to

2715
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:49,600
get there wherever the radio goes a lot

2716
01:29:47,198 --> 01:29:51,198
faster than uh so being a center town

2717
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,800
like that is kind of safer

2718
01:29:51,198 --> 01:29:54,719
position to be in and it's a smaller

2719
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,400
town so they'll react

2720
01:29:54,719 --> 01:29:58,158
faster probably and one of the weird

2721
01:29:56,399 --> 01:30:00,638
things is that they let us do uh

2722
01:29:58,158 --> 01:30:02,399
razor wire fencing out here uh you can't

2723
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:05,279
do that in las vegas

2724
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:06,158
oh so there's an actual deterrent versus

2725
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:08,479
yeah so

2726
01:30:06,158 --> 01:30:09,679
people we've never had a random person

2727
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:11,599
walking on our property

2728
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:13,359
and in all the years do you have the

2729
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:15,360
whistling over there too

2730
01:30:13,359 --> 01:30:16,719
no but we have much better security

2731
01:30:15,359 --> 01:30:19,119
cameras

2732
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:21,039
that move and track and trace what's the

2733
01:30:19,119 --> 01:30:24,319
surrounding businesses appreciate

2734
01:30:21,039 --> 01:30:26,399
there there's this a security that also

2735
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:27,920
has a presence no there is a shop next

2736
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:30,079
to us the tattoo shop

2737
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:31,440
next to that is a shop called threads um

2738
01:30:30,079 --> 01:30:33,439
they were robbed one day

2739
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:35,119
and the dudes ran across our security

2740
01:30:33,439 --> 01:30:36,399
cameras and uh the cops came

2741
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:38,238
and took our surveillance camera and

2742
01:30:36,399 --> 01:30:38,559
we're actually yeah able to help with

2743
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:40,238
that

2744
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:42,400
yeah yeah yeah they use dispensary

2745
01:30:40,238 --> 01:30:43,519
cameras a lot yeah for traveling another

2746
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:44,799
service of the cannabis

2747
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:46,560
community i think i think it's happened

2748
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:47,760
for us once if not twice already that

2749
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:49,520
that's what they've been able to use our

2750
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:52,079
cameras to to help excellent

2751
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:54,400

right now we got two things in motion

2773
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:40,400
um we're doing some r d some small skill

2774
01:31:39,279 --> 01:31:43,519
um hash

2775
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:44,638
uh rosin that's right uh bubble yeah

2776
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:46,000
some just playing with some different

2777
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:48,239
techniques there

2778
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:49,359
all all solventless um so we'll be

2779
01:31:48,238 --> 01:31:50,718
playing with some things there coming

2780
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:52,238
out some different products

2781
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:54,158
uh and that's just a lead up into our

2782
01:31:52,238 --> 01:31:55,519
greenhouse project our sungrown line

2783
01:31:54,158 --> 01:31:57,039
so we'll be having a completely

2784
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:58,080
different stream a completely different

2785
01:31:57,039 --> 01:32:00,238
line of gop

2786
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:01,279
still living root soil um still done

2787
01:32:00,238 --> 01:32:04,000
with our standards

2788
01:32:01,279 --> 01:32:05,840
um just using the sun uh in a state of

2789
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:07,198
our greenhouse versus indoor building

2790
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,880
uh so that'll be coming up hopefully

2791
01:32:07,198 --> 01:32:10,079
next year we postponed it this year

2792
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:11,600
because of covid but we're hitting it

2793
01:32:10,079 --> 01:32:12,639
hard again and i hope to have it next

2794
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,880
year nice

2795
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:16,719
look forward to it man you're well on

2796
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:20,239
