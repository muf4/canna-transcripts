2
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:26,459
so I'll do a quick history thing here

3
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:29,368
all right really really it starts with a

4
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,710
gentleman named EJ gold back in the 70s

5
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:34,350
he had the ISO two that he sold in high

6
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:37,380
times and that was only in there for a

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,460
brief time because the DEA came after

8
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,100
him and shut him down because he was

9
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,810
openly promoting it as a cannabis

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,570
extractor he was also promoting it for

11
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:47,760
extracting hallucinogenic cactuses and

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,820
so they didn't take kindly to that so

13
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:56,609
after the ISO 2 was gone in the mid 70s

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:59,850
there was like a 20-year gap and then in

15
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:01,500
the mid 90s I started getting into

16
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,129
herbal extraction we came out with our

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,140
coldfinger units and a friend of mine

18
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,120
lathe adat he talked me into starting

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,519
eating labs and he he started selling

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,730
our cold fingers and high times but we

21
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,789
consulted lawyers and they said you

22
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:19,140
cannot advertise it to do anything

23
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:21,240
illegal in fact you need to have a

24
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,340
disclaimer so we came up with a

25
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:25,709
tongue-in-cheek marketing campaign where

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,540
the top of the ad said warning not to be

27
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:28,919
used for your legal purposes which it

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,300
was kind of a tongue-in-cheek way of

29
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,670
saying you can make hash oil with this

30
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,929
thing and they sold like crazy and high

31
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,480
times and that's kind of where it

32
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,130
started with our little cold fingers and

33
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:43,109
then we just started making them bigger

34
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:47,158
after that all right so the whole idea

35
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:48,930
the cold finger was in 1995 there you

36
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,150
couldn't really buy an herbal extract or

37
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,880
the only thing available was the sock

38
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:56,640
slit which is you know an analytical

39
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,839
tool a distiller extractor and I looked

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,478
at the design and I didn't like it

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,310
because you had to force these vapors up

42
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:05,310
this tiny tube to get on this condenser

43
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,320
way up here and it took too much heat so

44
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,270
I came up with a cold finger which had

45
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,250
the condenser and the basket inverted

46
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,140
right above you know where you're

47
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,909
boiling the solvent and then I could I

48
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:17,549
could get a distillation cycle going

49
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:19,590
without even boiling solvent or vacuum

50
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,300
and that's why that's what started it

51
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,500
then I had a chemist friend he said well

52
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,689
if you're gonna get in the extractor

53
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,000
business you have to get into co2 that's

54
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:31,050
where everything's headed so within two

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,669
years we had a very rudimentary co2 unit

56
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,920
which I used at one of the very first

57
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:37,799
dispensaries in San Francisco and like

58
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:41,039
97 and it just kind of went from there

59
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,200
and by the time everything's started to

60
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,639
take off then we had waters on the scene

61
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,829
and that was that was my first

62
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:53,219
competitor my good friend Shawn okay

63
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:56,730
thanks so I remember moving towards the

64
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:58,800
co2 extraction side of the business not

65
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:00,719
from the ethanol or anything and from

66
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,770
that side what we've done is we had a an

67
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:08,189
automated instrument that would allow me

68
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:10,710
to take the extracted vessel and change

69
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:15,030
temperature and change pressure on the

70
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:16,379
fly through programmability and having

71
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,210
something called a flow meter which

72
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,099
allow me to know not only the pressure

73
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,780
and the dense pressure and temperature

74
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,909
but would give me a density reading and

75
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,590
I could tie that density reading right

76
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:28,349
back to the pump so rather than just

77
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,300
pumping it you know some indiscriminant

78
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:33,120
pressure and temperature I could

79
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,700
actually say I want to be at 100 milli I

80
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,159
own one to be under grams per minute of

81
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:41,099
co2 at this certain pressure and

82
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,259
temperature and so I could start to to

83
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:45,750
now start up at subcritical and take off

84
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:47,219
the terpenes and then I could collect

85
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,189
the terpenes while it's still running

86
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:53,909
and then move it up to you know to you

87
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:55,379
know 2,000 psi and in 35 degrees so now

88
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:57,359
I could change that and I could take off

89
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:59,209
the cannabinoids and then on the

90
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,220
backside we were able to have three

91
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:04,949
collectors and at that time

92
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:06,659
Eden only had the one collector and at

93
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:08,339
the time so then I could I could collect

94
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:12,180
three different things and I remember in

95
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,590
Denver Fritz coming over and saying and

96
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:15,030
since I just kind of look in the system

97
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,340
I said ah I'll tell you all about the

98
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:19,259
system and so we went through and

99
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,719
probably was a half-hour 45 minutes and

100
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,949
Fritz looked at me says I was gonna make

101
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,000
one of these and people said they would

102
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:27,990
never buy one so and from there what we

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,360
were able to do is

104
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:33,720
the early days it was moving from 2,000

105
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,360
psi and maybe 15 hours down to 90

106
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:40,620
minutes and from that time other people

107
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:43,620
took up the challenge and now 5000 psi

108
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,629
and how many grams per minute can you go

109
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,199
it's a lot faster enough and everyone

110
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:50,939
moved up in inline well I mean we do all

111
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,699
kinds of different ranges now I mean we

112
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:56,459
can we've gone up to 15,000 psi that has

113
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:59,460
no bearing on cannabis but other things

114
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:01,079
like astaxanthin and nicotine are best

115
00:04:59,459 --> 00:05:02,758
done at super high pressure and then you

116
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:08,279
have the fractionating separators that

117
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:11,400
he was talking about but so astaxanthin

118
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:14,309
is what makes shrimp pink and crab and

119
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:16,500
lobsters red it's a it's like a red

120
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:20,189
compound and usually it's extracted from

121
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,740
algae and that's that's it's algae that

122
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:24,329
gets eaten by smaller animals and then

123
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,090
it gets eaten by the shrimp and the crab

124
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:28,800
and but it's it's it's it's like a

125
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:31,019
really powerful antioxidants especially

126
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,270
good for your eyes I've talked to a lot

127
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:35,939
of people whose vision has come back to

128
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:41,939
normal form using astaxanthin it's kind

129
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:44,189
of considered a superfood right yeah

130
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:46,949
there's yep so they're there growing

131
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:49,560
this algae and pools and then drying it

132
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:51,870
and co2 extracting it yeah Hawaii and

133
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,629
Israel makes a lot of astaxanthin they

134
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,519
kind of dominate the market the market

135
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:58,189
is expanding I used an analogy last year

136
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:00,538
when I was here at this convention

137
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:03,810
speaking with a see that you know the

138
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:06,300
cannabis industry is last year kind of

139
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,459
gone from kindergarten to junior high

140
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,530
and now we're in our like awkward

141
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:12,689
adolescent about to graduate from high

142
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:15,119
school phase right as far as the tech of

143
00:06:12,689 --> 00:06:17,069
it goes and you know now that we've

144
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,718
gained more legitimacy you know John

145
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:20,460
John was crazy because he had a

146
00:06:18,718 --> 00:06:22,079
corporate gig and they were one of the

147
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:23,848
first companies that really were

148
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,109
reputable and from the pharmaceutical

149
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:27,569
industry to say hey there's something

150
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,908
here we're gonna we're gonna get you

151
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:31,169
know our funny PhD and then push this

152
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:33,000
stuff to these guys do we make a lot of

153
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:34,680
money off of them but you know as far as

154
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,019
like cannabis companies having access to

155
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,550
hire people of John Prince's caliber we

156
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,909
didn't have that until a few years ago

157
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,860
and so you know what you did is you had

158
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,140
is the advent of the internet directly

159
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,660
correlates with the explosion of

160
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:48,919
cannabis tech and the fact that in

161
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,990
California we had such a large

162
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,520
marketplace with an abundant access to

163
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,670
cheap material for people to experiment

164
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:57,289
on really allowed people to proliferate

165
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,330
different times of different types of

166
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,710
technology and then as it got regulated

167
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:02,629
now we can poach people that are

168
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:04,159
intelligent that you know have spent

169
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:06,469
years getting a scientific background

170
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,970
that aren't gonna go to federal prison

171
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,950
now to go work for a cannabis company

172
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,530
and so I think you know what while co2

173
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:15,019
was was it was a safer option because we

174
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:18,349
lived in a quasi gray zone right so I

175
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:19,819
had a company with 55 employees at the

176
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,410
time that I bought my first watters

177
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:24,290
machine that was in a major commercial

178
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:27,350
thoroughfare of Scotts Valley City and

179
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,460
you know we had the police department

180
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,020
through and the fire department through

181
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:34,009
but we had no we had no permit no

182
00:07:30,019 --> 00:07:35,959
license and so you know can doing butane

183
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:38,569
extraction or ethanol extraction was a

184
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:40,939
whole dicey ER game right now and I

185
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:42,680
think that that's been one thing where

186
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:44,420
you know recently it's not that co2 is

187
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,560
out of out of popularity anymore it's

188
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,990
that people are feeling more comfortable

189
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,879
doing alternate forms of solvents than

190
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:51,829
they used to and though there always be

191
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,879
a place for co2 100 percent just like

192
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:54,709
there's always going to be a place for

193
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,930
hydrocarbon and ethanol they all provide

194
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:59,000
different value and can help create

195
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,079
products either easier a different array

196
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,120
of products for the combustible

197
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,339
marketplace you know for a combustible

198
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,530
product like crumble which has waxes and

199
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:08,989
paraffins in it using a light aroma

200
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:11,269
aromatic hydrocarbon is a lot easier to

201
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,189
get that texture than using co2 or

202
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:16,129
something that revolves high amounts of

203
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:18,620
pressure you know co2 and ethanol are

204
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:19,610
equally good at extracting a crude oil

205
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,810
that is going to be used for

206
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:26,180
distillation but you know the the light

207
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,500
aromatic hydrocarbons usually are lend

208
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,759
themselves towards a product that

209
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,610
doesn't require a lot of further

210
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:34,639
refinement where as you know ethanol or

211
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,379
co2 are gonna be terrific but oftentimes

212
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,418
to get a consumer product you're gonna

213
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:40,639
need to do a little bit more refinement

214
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:42,590
of those products yeah I would say that

215
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,870
it's anytime I'm talking with the

216
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,879
customers more on the side of what are

217
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:48,350
they trying to make so you start off

218
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,809
with what you're trying to make and then

219
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:52,580
you back up to the ingredients and how

220
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:54,259
you need those ingredients to be able to

221
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:58,310
be able to match that form

222
00:08:54,259 --> 00:09:02,000
elation for a certain medical situation

223
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:04,069
so for example if I was to use some of

224
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,179
the lighter hydrocarbons and I would be

225
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:07,460
using propane

226
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:09,469
I might even choose propane over butane

227
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:13,310
because it's a lighter product and it's

228
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:16,009
and it's a more pure also the other one

229
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:17,989
is tetrafluoroethylene so people call

230
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:20,330
that freon it's not freon but it's

231
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,950
that's a trade name but having something

232
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,480
that's light like that is also not gonna

233
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,660
it's gonna lead the waxes behind like

234
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,340
propane it'll have less of the explosive

235
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:30,379
it won't explode because it's freon use

236
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:33,320
it in refrigerator and then as I'm

237
00:09:30,379 --> 00:09:37,220
moving forward towards some of the other

238
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:40,879
organic once it's it's co2 plus s and

239
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:42,590
all its co2 plus propane it's it's a

240
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,480
mixture the hybrids we're in the early

241
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:46,100
days with all the regulations and stuff

242
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,659
no one was doing in the experience now

243
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,899
you're starting to bring in the people

244
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:53,269
that have the years of experience of

245
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:55,429
what you can do with the plant and how

246
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:57,649
the variety changes with each one of

247
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:59,329
those components I mean how do you make

248
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:01,250
sure the watt what's the percentage of

249
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,259
waters at five percent eight percent is

250
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,480
the particle size a certain particle

251
00:10:03,259 --> 00:10:06,740
size for different things and so each

252
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,029
one of those and now you're starting to

253
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:12,950
see the non extraction so I would call

254
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:15,049
it concentration it's a big picture and

255
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,940
then you have separation versus

256
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:20,269
extraction extraction is liquid liquid

257
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:22,790
like making coffee when you pick apples

258
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:26,269
that's a separation you're not actually

259
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:27,620
doing it you're not actually extracting

260
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:30,139
the apples from the tree so if you're

261
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,750
making what some people would say bubble

262
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:36,199
hash I would say you're you're able to

263
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,580
have a trichome that's cold and you

264
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,890
would take it off and then if you have

265
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,800
the ones that are the the pure trichomes

266
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:44,330
or the different sizes and then you

267
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,339
might have something that starts off at

268
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,020
25% but when you take off those

269
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,030
beautiful trichomes and you keep them

270
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,559
intact that's a whole different product

271
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:53,089
and now you're still left with you know

272
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,829
ten twelve percent of something you can

273
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,139
extract another way so you're you're

274
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,990
actually taking different parts in doing

275
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:02,569
hybrids so I see companies now with with

276
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:04,820
three you know cold ethanol at Mightiest

277
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:07,260
60 degrees or minus 40 degrees and then

278
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,240
you see a couple of co2

279
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:12,120
a couple of propane's you see a couple

280
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,500
of tetra fluoro ethane x' and you'll see

281
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,879
a mixture of everyone because they're

282
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,559
big enough now they're making different

283
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:20,490
products starting off with a formulation

284
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:23,279
I kind of feel like I'm on a panel with

285
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:26,430
two of my ex-girlfriends too so intimate

286
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:33,659
with the machinery you peddled over the

287
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:34,949
years you know I think Fritz what one

288
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,750
things kind of cheating for me is you

289
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:38,550
know back in the 70s and 80s you know

290
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,840
you were doing herbal plant extraction

291
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:43,500
but what led you to that point and what

292
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:46,290
were you using it for back then well I

293
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,450
mean it basically started from two

294
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:49,889
things number one I had a girlfriend

295
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,560
that worked at a health food store and

296
00:11:49,889 --> 00:11:54,480
we got really into herbs and then the

297
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,729
other thing was you know my actual

298
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,440
degree is being a science journalist or

299
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,810
a science writer and I've I've had some

300
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,950
articles published and I did one about

301
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:04,799
shaman pharmaceuticals do you remember

302
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:08,070
that Dennis McKenna and all that I was

303
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:09,839
so fascinated by that that I had to have

304
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:12,270
an herbal extractor and then I couldn't

305
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:14,310
find one to buy so I made my own like

306
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:16,199
Here I am today but I I mean I guess I

307
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:18,629
kind of owe that to Dennis McKenna to a

308
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,000
large degree with shaman pharmaceuticals

309
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:23,490
was such a fascinating concept and the

310
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,200
concept in a nutshell was this company

311
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,110
would send researchers into the

312
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,030
rainforest if they found a shaman from

313
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:32,460
to two different shamans from two

314
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:34,679
different tribes that used the same herb

315
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,180
for the same thing they brought it back

316
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:39,839
to the lab and studied it and tried to

317
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:41,429
make a product out of it and two of the

318
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:44,460
people involved with that was Dennis

319
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:46,559
mccannon and dr. John Pierce oh I think

320
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,540
he's in cannabis now and he goes by the

321
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,879
handle dr. Jay I don't know if anybody

322
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:53,279
knows him but anyway they were like

323
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,740
early guys with shaman pharmaceuticals

324
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,189
and I got to know them and and you know

325
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,090
one thing led to another and Here I am

326
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,460
where do you guys see the industry

327
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,930
especially on the extraction tech side

328
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,269
of things five years from now any

329
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:07,620
predictions or any trends that you see

330
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:09,659
that are playing out that people might

331
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,730
not be aware of well I think it's going

332
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:13,529
to be driven by corporatization I mean

333
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,779
it's inevitable and it happens to every

334
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:19,470
industry so it it seems like at some

335
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:20,909
point there's going to be giant co2

336
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,279
extractors like the hops and

337
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:26,429
she has that you know that will we'll

338
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:29,579
probably make like an okay product but

339
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:31,409
it'll be super large-scale so it'll be

340
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,759
like the equivalent of Budweiser or

341
00:13:31,409 --> 00:13:35,189
something like that and then they'll but

342
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:38,399
they'll still be the micro brews the the

343
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:40,170
smaller boutique operations that make

344
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,980
the higher quality product whether it's

345
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:45,990
with co2 or ethanol or hydrocarbons I

346
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,240
mean they're all valid they all work and

347
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,769
they all have their place but you know I

348
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,210
think you're gonna see the giant

349
00:13:49,769 --> 00:14:00,779
factories and you know led by GW I guess

350
00:13:54,210 --> 00:14:03,300
I don't know so on the on the on the

351
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:05,279
things that are are unique I think

352
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:07,799
you're gonna start to move towards more

353
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,199
of the of the hybrids so in my world I

354
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:12,569
think it's a hybrid that when I have a

355
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,030
product that has rich and trichomes

356
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:17,670
and I knock off most of the trichomes

357
00:14:15,029 --> 00:14:21,240
and now I'm left so I start off at 25 or

358
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:23,839
35 percent and I have THC ve or I have

359
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,940
some of the unique ones not just the THC

360
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,040
and then from there that that's a

361
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,870
separation so now you've concentrated

362
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,839
something and then from that concentrate

363
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:36,419
you can start to make unique products

364
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,399
where you can now do an extraction and

365
00:14:36,419 --> 00:14:40,319
pull off things that you want when you

366
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,829
want them and how you want them so for

367
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,650
example I have people that I work with

368
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:48,930
that I'm pulling off the monoterpenes

369
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:51,149
and then I'll pull off the sesqui

370
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,979
terpenes and then I'll pull off the

371
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:55,259
diterpene so that I can pull them off

372
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:56,580
when I want them and what I want so I

373
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:58,289
don't have to do any a whole lot of

374
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,660
post-processing I'm doing it during the

375
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:02,129
extraction process the other part that

376
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:03,539
that we've seen

377
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:05,189
I know if Fritz and I have seen is that

378
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:06,719
when people were doing the extraction in

379
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,660
the early days they were just flowing

380
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,210
3oz co2 around and around because it was

381
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:14,850
a closed system what I found more more

382
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,310
recently is if I'm doing a static where

383
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,710
I like making a cup of tea I can hold

384
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:21,689
the pressure at a certain point let it

385
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,430
soak there like a cup of tea then moved

386
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:25,710
to flow through again and pour that

387
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:27,389
often so rather than the old days with

388
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:29,280
the where they would decarboxylate

389
00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:31,379
before because they felt that it was the

390
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,259
more greater solubility I can now take I

391
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:34,649
at them can now take that soak and have

392
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:36,688
the same

393
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:39,208
ratio of the acids and the neutrals that

394
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:42,088
come off so now you can cut the time by

395
00:15:39,208 --> 00:15:43,828
a quarter or a tenth of the time and so

396
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:46,319
then you can decarboxylate afterwards

397
00:15:43,828 --> 00:15:48,929
the other one I see is moving towards a

398
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:52,169
separation with with either Sonic so

399
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:54,628
hybrid of you know altro sonic assisted

400
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:57,360
microwave-assisted and then some of the

401
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:59,129
new water technology where you can I can

402
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,709
actually it they them can actually

403
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:03,990
modulate the pressure of the water to

404
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:05,428
knock off the trichomes and knock and

405
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:08,669
knock open the trichomes like an

406
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:10,078
eggshell but leads a plant cell intact

407
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:12,958
and so now what you're doing is you're

408
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:15,299
modulating the pressure of a separation

409
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,618
to be able to do thinking with water so

410
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:18,028
you're not doing in extraction you're

411
00:16:16,619 --> 00:16:21,300
actually doing a separation then you

412
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:23,549
then you separate the biomass from the

413
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:26,008
water and the oil by just centrifugation

414
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:28,438
so you can see use a decanter horizontal

415
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:30,119
centrifugation spins around the outside

416
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:31,938
and now you're left with the water and

417
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:34,860
the oil then you go through a vertical

418
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:36,629
centrifuge at 6g and now you now you

419
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,980
move the water from the oil so we're not

420
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:40,829
what you've done is a two-step process

421
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,800
like the oil industry or like the food

422
00:16:40,828 --> 00:16:46,409
industry or like the dairy industry

423
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:48,058
where you're able to separate the waxes

424
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:50,219
from everything without doing an

425
00:16:48,058 --> 00:16:53,159
extraction so it's more of separation

426
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,749
and back to the other point of as far as

427
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,419
which one you choose it's formulations

428
00:16:54,749 --> 00:16:59,278
to be specific so I deal in analogies

429
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:01,078
because that's how I think and so if I'm

430
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,048
making a yellow cake that's very

431
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:05,398
different from making an angel food cake

432
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:07,259
when I'm making a yellow cake I can just

433
00:17:05,398 --> 00:17:08,938
crack open the eggs into one bowl put in

434
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:10,679
sugar put in flour and now I make it a

435
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:14,610
yellow cake if I make an angel food cake

436
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:16,500
I got to keep the yolks away from the

437
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:18,928
egg white because I have to have the egg

438
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,640
white and I have to make that fluffy so

439
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:22,288
I have to separate the egg whites from

440
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,630
the yolks oh that's that's like co2

441
00:17:22,288 --> 00:17:26,759
where you're modulating or like anything

442
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,559
else you can modulate propane by the way

443
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,480
you can people are saying oh I just have

444
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,278
one thing know you can modulate propane

445
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,308
because they're all super critical fluid

446
00:17:32,278 --> 00:17:35,788
extraction so I see the the world coming

447
00:17:35,308 --> 00:17:39,058
to

448
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:41,069
formulation specific like Fritz says

449
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:45,119
there's one thousand two hundred and

450
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:47,599
fifty you know leader vessels doing co2

451
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,159
in two hours down in Kentucky

452
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,259
I mean that's that's that's a whole

453
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,890
different process and so to say the

454
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:56,538
third one and that is in line so like

455
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:59,900
Fritz and I have done for years and that

456
00:17:56,538 --> 00:18:01,940
is you do the co2 and in a multiple

457
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,500
fraction you pull out the waxes in the

458
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,710
first collection vessel then you have a

459
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:08,960
separate vessel that then cleans up any

460
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,700
remaining waxes before it goes over to

461
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,160
the second third now by the time you get

462
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,538
to the second and third vessel you don't

463
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:25,909
have any waxes so now what you're doing

464
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:31,298
is in-line dewaxing that creating

465
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:32,870
cannabinoids from yeast it's threatening

466
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:35,349
it's a menace

467
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:40,099
but yeah it's coming for sure

468
00:18:35,349 --> 00:18:42,649
everybody's wondering about that so

469
00:18:40,099 --> 00:18:44,629
there's patents out there and and the

470
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:47,330
one kind of Florida the ones out of the

471
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,650
UK also so that's called biopharma and

472
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:50,449
we've been doing that for years where we

473
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,100
we don't actually need the plant to be

474
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:55,669
able to make things an example of that

475
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:57,349
was um tax all so tax all used to be

476
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:59,480
taken from you trees we would cut down

477
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:01,449
these yew trees from small amount of tax

478
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,579
all that was used for breast cancer and

479
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,659
we were taking down forests and so what

480
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:07,189
they did is they found a way of making

481
00:19:05,659 --> 00:19:10,070
synthetic tax all and that's why you

482
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,570
have all these things breast cancer the

483
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:14,178
other one with yeast is that you can

484
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:15,950
make one specific cannabinol based on

485
00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:18,169
having the starting material see BGA or

486
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:20,330
some of the precursors for that and then

487
00:19:18,169 --> 00:19:23,960
you make th CA synthase and that makes

488
00:19:20,329 --> 00:19:26,658
THC a you have CBD a synthase you have

489
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,009
THC v synthase for something that goes

490
00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:29,480
before that so it's just a matter of

491
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:32,210
doing that yeast so you're making one

492
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,370
specific thing so Albany molecular

493
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,990
research up in Albany New York and with

494
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:38,119
some of the other people has like 20 or

495
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:39,409
30 of these things going but that's how

496
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:41,689
you would do biopharm but but you're not

497
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:43,940
gonna you're never gonna have what the

498
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,110
plant makes for partial spectrum or

499
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,519
whole spectrum you're not going to have

500
00:19:45,109 --> 00:19:48,859
that it's going to be a single component

501
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,940
that's used for an additive or it's

502
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:52,579
gonna be something else but it can never

503
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:56,690
have the same capability as the whole

504
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:58,819
plant do is be input material for a lot

505
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,160
of edible products and teachers and

506
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:02,349
topicals right like

507
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,960
it's it's threatening to a degree from

508
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:06,609
just a whole holistic traction

509
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,380
standpoint but I don't think it's not

510
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:10,089
it's not disruptive it's not wiping out

511
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:12,610
the commercial extraction market people

512
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:15,819
aren't going to want to you know light

513
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:18,209
up a dab torch full of some synthetic TV

514
00:20:15,819 --> 00:20:21,879
anytime soon or it's not going to be as

515
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:24,789
as enjoyable of a consume of consumable

516
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:26,860
experience right as as a high-grade

517
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:28,720
extraction but yeah it'll be interesting

518
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:30,669
to see as if it comes and you know

519
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,049
ultimately if with all these taxes that

520
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,460
we're facing in California if it brings

521
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:35,799
the price down on some products it might

522
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:37,390
be a good thing I think I would want to

523
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:39,069
know if I'm consuming cannabinoids that

524
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:42,360
are grown from you so let's maybe get

525
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:42,359
some new packaging regulation around

526
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:45,319
