1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,389
so the loaded question in the room the

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,699
loaded question in the room -

3
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:07,259
everybody's like now with this regulated

4
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,410
cannabis industry

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,419
this regulated cannabis industry we must

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,789
be getting some really good high quality

7
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:16,710
tested cannabis right that's those

8
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:19,079
testing facilities must be working

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:25,140
overtime well what has been your

10
00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:28,500
experience on that way there are far too

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:33,420
few labs and far too many people who

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:36,299
need to use them over the few labs there

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:40,170
are they they keep getting themselves

14
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:43,669
shut down for just like lying

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,649
about six months worth of test results

16
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:49,020
and which you know six months worth of

17
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,600
recalls that's 700 batch recalls from

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,840
one lab who screwed up I was fortunate

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,760
not to be caught up in that right - two

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,390
weeks different on when I had actually

21
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:02,128
produced that would have been my lab I

22
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:04,799
would be doing a recall right now which

23
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:06,450
would be horrible yeah for manufacture

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,540
products were screwed because we're like

25
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,460
third down the line in testing and if

26
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,830
something fails somewhere and it gets

27
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:17,849
recalled earlier like the oil that we

28
00:01:13,829 --> 00:01:20,039
use gots got later on failed then they

29
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:23,548
come and look at our audit for us using

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,290
that oil and we can get screwed twice

31
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:27,750
but something that did you know because

32
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,240
our our lab mates may have tech tested

33
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,900
it looked at the previous COAS and what

34
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:36,209
oh it must be okay and not like it I I

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,270
worry that we don't get the same quality

36
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:41,578
level testing that concentrates and

37
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:43,739
fires do because the labs are trying to

38
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:45,569
get us through so quickly at the end and

39
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:46,530
they just kind of probably look well it

40
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:48,898
passed already

41
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,780
and I'm worried that we might be getting

42
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,829
rubbers now

43
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,829
knock on wood we're not going to

44
00:01:55,998 --> 00:02:03,899
understand but you know what I mean it's

45
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:06,149
like they do hinky and if if it's a

46
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,419
profit motive for them to get more

47
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,610
people in their throughput and okay as

48
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,039
long as I get this I've done this year

49
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,660
and I made my nut and I'm gone

50
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,870
that's one reason why it looks like this

51
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:20,699
it's very difficult to do oversight and

52
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,519
regulation of labs because so few people

53
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:26,878
actually understand lab processes you

54
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:28,890
know that's a very professional job so

55
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,328
your average person going in to look at

56
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:32,429
it doesn't know what they're looking at

57
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:34,709
I'm actually surprised that the BCC

58
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,780
inspectors were able to identify that

59
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:41,069
that that one lab I was talking about

60
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,900
had a bad machine because normally they

61
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:45,268
would just take it at your word like

62
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,450
here's our equipment it all works yeah

63
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:51,599
they they defer to the professionals

64
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:53,548
within the given field so their

65
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:57,780
regulatory people they they don't they

66
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:59,790
don't know STEM methods of lab

67
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,650
procedures they don't know that so they

68
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:05,068
assume that the professionals in those

69
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:06,419
areas are the ones that do and even

70
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:08,159
though we were throwing out various

71
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:12,840
different questions like well why

72
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:15,629
doesn't the state have its own self

73
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,569
internalized you know reference frame

74
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:20,129
like a kanima so they send to all the

75
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:21,839
tests that they already have tested

76
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:24,060
themselves to be able to validate what

77
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,120
the machines should be reading times and

78
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,799
you know standardize on a cleaning

79
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,359
solvent so that all of them are using

80
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,159
the same cleaning solvent so they have

81
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:34,919
the same resolution when they come back

82
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,509
for testing so that you know one group

83
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,130
has a different doesn't have a different

84
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:39,840
resolution that testing than another one

85
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:41,729
these are all things that they're

86
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,799
unaware of that they even need to be

87
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:46,679
looking into because they just assume

88
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,969
that most of these interests trees

89
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:53,500
regulate themselves

90
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:56,590
properly and we get stuck with the

91
00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:01,090
problems the testing is also a bit

92
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:04,990
excessive right so before we ever

93
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:07,509
formulate our products the cannabis

94
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:10,810
material the regulated material that

95
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:14,590
goes into it gets tested twice before it

96
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:16,839
even gets into our hands and and then

97
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:21,069
after we make our products it gets

98
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:23,529
tested again and and where this gets

99
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:26,079
tricky especially going into phase three

100
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:30,339
which starts January first phase three

101
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:32,500
testing and junior first it's highly

102
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:35,649
likely that common ingredients like the

103
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:39,509
olive oil that we use or or the avocado

104
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:45,909
oil or even the ginger extract could be

105
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:48,399
quote-unquote contaminated in in a way

106
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:53,760
that would be harmful if you are smoking

107
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:56,310
a flower but has zero potential for harm

108
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,159
delivered on the surface of your skin

109
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:03,040
and there's absolutely no

110
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,780
differentiation in testing between the

111
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,760
actual potential for harm of some of

112
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:09,029
these ingredients they're all treated as

113
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,168
if you were going to smoke and eat them

114
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:13,869
even when that's not happening at all

115
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:17,019
and the fact that you know a certified

116
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:20,168
organic approved to be food grade on the

117
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:23,680
shelves olive oil could fail a cannabis

118
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:25,959
test because of something like lead in

119
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,129
the soil that the olive tree was growing

120
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:32,560
in arsenic in the well water it's it's

121
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:34,310
ridiculous so the sensitivity and the

122
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,160
tet on the testing

123
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:39,019
and how far that scope goes way beyond

124
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,750
just the cannabis ingredients but always

125
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:43,459
every ingredient you're using it's it

126
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,730
needs to be fixed it will be fixed

127
00:05:43,459 --> 00:05:48,169
eventually but for now we're just

128
00:05:45,730 --> 00:06:01,990
hideously over regulated

129
00:05:48,170 --> 00:06:01,990
