2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:14,370
so as I was putting together this

3
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:16,230
presentation I realized that I have a

4
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:19,890
lot to say I always have a lot to say

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:23,730
I'm very grateful to the panel before me

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,768
because I I just assumed that more

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,960
people would be talking about plants and

8
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:29,608
their responses to their environment and

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,800
there actually hasn't been that much

10
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:36,090
discussion so Corinne thank you for

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,280
introducing the concept of DLI which I

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,950
have here I have some slides here about

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,480
plant responses but I just planned on

14
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,340
skipping through them pretty quickly but

15
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:45,808
I might actually need to talk about them

16
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,469
a little bit so everybody understands

17
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:51,959
why it's so important what we're trying

18
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:57,840
to control and why it is so energy

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:01:01,530
intensive okay so why the heck are we

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,850
growing indoors in the first place right

21
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,129
it's all of these reasons right

22
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:10,798
ultimately we can grow anywhere we want

23
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:13,319
any time regardless of climate change

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,868
regardless of season we can grow in

25
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:19,319
Vermont and we can grow in San Diego and

26
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:23,640
we can grow on Mars for that matter

27
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:25,319
right so so that's a big piece of why is

28
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,680
so energy intensive because we are

29
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:31,379
literally controlling the weather we're

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,530
controlling all of the inputs that we

31
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:36,739
need to grow plants because we don't

32
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,599
necessarily have all of these resources

33
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:44,039
available to us wherever we are whether

34
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:46,048
that's good soil good air good co2

35
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,810
levels for that matter good sunlight

36
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,299
consistent sunlight and so by growing

37
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:53,879
indoors we can be very predictable we

38
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:57,450
can be very consistent we can have very

39
00:01:53,879 --> 00:02:02,759
safe food and you know and it can be

40
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:04,680
available all the time so controlled

41
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,489
environment agriculture is just like

42
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,649
what it sounds like we are controlling

43
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:13,890
the environment like I mentioned earlier

44
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,930
when I introduce the panel my aha moment

45
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:17,399
was working on a mushroom farm who

46
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,189
couldn't you know where the farmer

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,990
couldn't control his greenhouse humidity

48
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:23,669
to grow mushrooms and I was like this is

49
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:25,650
what I want to do help them control

50
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:29,250
their environment and we are controlling

51
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:32,430
all of these variables right irrigation

52
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:38,900
and nutrients lighting climate air

53
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:43,770
quality ultimately for quality control I

54
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:46,890
want to remind everyone that farming

55
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:52,280
whether it's indoors or outdoors or a

56
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:55,649
mix of the two is a business right the

57
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:59,459
productivity the the product that

58
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:02,340
farmers are growing they are selling to

59
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:06,150
us the consumer right to you the

60
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:09,180
consumer and so they have a very vested

61
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:12,750
interest in reducing their cost of

62
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,909
production so that they can have better

63
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:19,709
margins so that their bottom line is

64
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:22,680
greater right so they have to think

65
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:25,829
about their customers their markets

66
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,719
their distribution are they local are

67
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,750
they growing lettuce or tomatoes or

68
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:35,209
cannabis or berries right and what is

69
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:40,079
the market for those things right so

70
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:43,349
ultimately greater productivity should

71
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:46,920
result in greater profitability but that

72
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:48,090
depends on how many resources they're

73
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:52,018
using and what the cost of those

74
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:54,180
resources are so as markets change as we

75
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:57,000
have more market pressure in terms of

76
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,310
resource utilization if they can lower

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,459
those while they're also increasing

78
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:09,959
productivity that's a very profitable

79
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:12,569
business so common ground right so I

80
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,780
broke it into sort of three categories

81
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:17,759
the grower slash farmer the consumer

82
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,399
which is pretty much everyone whether

83
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,430
you are a grower a non grower a

84
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,250
government a utility a regulator a

85
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,150
teacher an engineer you're a consumer

86
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,759
and you care about

87
00:04:27,149 --> 00:04:30,269
although those things right so what I

88
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,069
mean

89
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:33,779
we want better yields we want an

90
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:35,399
available product higher quality it

91
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:38,788
tastes good I'm not gonna get sick

92
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:40,409
because I smoked it or ate it you know

93
00:04:38,788 --> 00:04:43,349
government of course is concerned about

94
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,240
consumer safety right we want growers

95
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,680
want fewer consumables because that's

96
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:52,139
less things they have to buy okay and

97
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,430
consumers don't want chemicals and the

98
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,590
government doesn't want pollution or

99
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,139
chemicals if they can avoid it right

100
00:04:55,589 --> 00:05:01,138
we're interested in labor markets and

101
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:03,660
jobs we want a good market price the

102
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,478
grower does in fact if they can have a

103
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,810
more consistent and predictable product

104
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:14,180
they can potentially drive the price

105
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:20,970
themselves and have a better shelf

106
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:24,418
placement okay wellÃ¶ operating costs low

107
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:27,750
prices low resource use Same Same Same

108
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:31,079
and whether we call it optimization or

109
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:35,459
we call it efficiency that's about doing

110
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:39,000
more with less we are all in this

111
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:41,098
together so I'm gonna talk about a few

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,250
plant responses again I was planning to

113
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:48,180
go through this really quickly but just

114
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:52,019
look at this slide okay light has a huge

115
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:54,000
impact on the plant right on the way it

116
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:56,399
looks on the way it produces on whether

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,430
it's fruiting flowering or vegetative on

118
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:03,000
I don't even know temperature so model

119
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:05,129
opening nutrient and water delivery I

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,250
mean the list goes on and on and on

121
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:09,810
white is there's a reason why we have a

122
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,779
lot of focus on light plants need light

123
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:18,000
period we would not have life on earth

124
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:22,679
without the Sun okay so nobody has shown

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,478
this graph either okay this is a general

126
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,069
rule of thumb in horticulture and

127
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:34,199
agriculture 1% more light is equal to 1%

128
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:37,829
more biomass or yield okay in general

129
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,000
okay we have learned that not all light

130
00:06:37,829 --> 00:06:42,560
is created equal

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,560
but this is a general rule

132
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,360
DLI

133
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,910
thank you again Corinne so this is an

134
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,990
image of what DLI looks like which is

135
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:58,200
how many photons within the par range

136
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:01,769
hit a given area a given surface area

137
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:08,459
whether that's the plant leaf or whether

138
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:14,089
that's the wall over there okay air

139
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:18,120
temperature air temperature affects

140
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:19,139
photosynthesis and it also affects plant

141
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,230
transpiration

142
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:24,659
okay plant transpiration in general has

143
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:27,270
a linear correlation with air

144
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,180
temperature and as you can see here for

145
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:31,799
tomatoes that it increases pretty

146
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,740
quickly with temperature but then there

147
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:38,550
is a limit at which now we're gonna get

148
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:40,680
a degradation in photosynthesis vapor

149
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,509
pressure deficit a term that is very

150
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,519
near and dear to my heart as a

151
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:47,779
mechanical engineer who's trying to

152
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:51,269
control both temperature and humidity

153
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:55,289
vapor pressure deficit affects quality

154
00:07:51,269 --> 00:07:57,899
it affects yield and it affects water

155
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:02,580
use a slide I don't have on here

156
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:05,489
actually shows that you can you can

157
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:09,269
train your plant from a very young age

158
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:11,819
to be drought tolerant by giving it less

159
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:14,639
water when it's young and it's

160
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:18,810
automatically going to change the way it

161
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:22,439
grows to use less water when it's old we

162
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:26,300
can literally manipulate VPD to create a

163
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:29,100
drought tolerant crop and use less water

164
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:32,750
very exciting okay

165
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:35,580
let's talk about co2 for a second okay

166
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,590
carbon dioxide the thing that kills me

167
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,750
the most about cannabis growers and just

168
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:42,210
when they pumped 1,500 parts per million

169
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,899
of co2 and then hit the break with

170
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,900
temperature Oh

171
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,800
seventy you know 70 degrees in 1500

172
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,980
parts per million okay we saw a chart

173
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:54,849
earlier right from Eric oh that yes you

174
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,819
could have a lower temperature lower

175
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:59,709
light level and increase of co2 and it

176
00:08:57,818 --> 00:09:02,860
will act like you have a hat it's all

177
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:05,169
more light okay but we can optimize all

178
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:08,339
of these variables all these parameters

179
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:10,240
together to really maximize productivity

180
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:13,690
okay and here's something that's

181
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:17,079
important is that every plant has a

182
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:18,699
different optimization curve I'm showing

183
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:22,719
sunflower we haven't we talked about

184
00:09:18,698 --> 00:09:27,969
sunflowers right but cannabis tomato

185
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,819
lettuce chrysanthemum whatever it is all

186
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:32,050
of these plants have different

187
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:38,139
optimization points for these three

188
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:39,729
variables combined together so we saw a

189
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:43,448
graphic yesterday that looked a lot

190
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:46,600
different than this graphic in this

191
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:48,909
graphic HVAC is using the majority of

192
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,970
the energy and if you think about it

193
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:54,309
HVAC is not just air conditioning it's

194
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:57,610
not just dehumidification it's also

195
00:09:54,309 --> 00:10:00,369
moving the air around it's potentially

196
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:04,149
using co2 burners or some other source

197
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:06,818
energy source of co2 okay it might even

198
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:11,139
be the air filtration that's affecting

199
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:19,019
fan power and the use of energy from a

200
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:22,980
fan so I'm going to talk about these

201
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:26,519
potential opportunities to save energy

202
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:29,019
other has I don't know probably five

203
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:30,730
subcategories within itself I actually

204
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:33,299
wasn't going to talk about greenhouse

205
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:36,399
glazing except that it keeps coming up

206
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:39,818
everybody wants to know my opinion about

207
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,980
greenhouse glazing so I had to I had to

208
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:44,229
bite and I want to talk about it a

209
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,000
little bit okay and I could probably

210
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:48,129
give a 45 minute talk on greenhouse

211
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,559
glazing alone I'm not gonna bore you

212
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:54,129
with that I'm gonna try and hit some of

213
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:56,799
the highlights okay first off I just

214
00:10:54,129 --> 00:10:58,750
want to say this is the appropriate time

215
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,490
to use supplemental lighting in a

216
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:03,039
greenhouse do you guys see it's overcast

217
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,930
and cloudy not good light intensity

218
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:08,558
right we're not gonna hit the DLI that

219
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:10,958
we want for this crop this maybe not so

220
00:11:08,558 --> 00:11:15,039
appropriate I walked into this

221
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:18,129
greenhouse in Colorado and it was

222
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:21,730
beautifully sunny outside and the lights

223
00:11:18,129 --> 00:11:23,379
are on for two reasons one because they

224
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,730
had horrible control and didn't realize

225
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:27,100
that the lights were on I'm like that

226
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,889
was the first thing I noticed right okay

227
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:33,159
so talking about having qualified

228
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:37,509
growers okay one story but also this is

229
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:41,438
a triple pane glazed glass greenhouse

230
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:44,528
look at all the structure you need to

231
00:11:41,438 --> 00:11:49,120
support the weight of all that glass we

232
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:51,909
just eliminated all the light so now

233
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:59,740
what are we doing for energy efficiency

234
00:11:51,909 --> 00:12:02,889
using light every plant just like it has

235
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:05,740
an optimization of co2 and light and

236
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:08,528
temperature and water and nutrients has

237
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:12,850
an optimization point for how much light

238
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:16,000
it requires lettuce very low light

239
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,500
requirement on a daily basis strawberry

240
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,639
a little higher because it is a

241
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:25,269
flowering fruiting plant Cannabis really

242
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:27,669
high bruce bugs beat Bruce Bugbee has

243
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:31,419
given presentations where he shows that

244
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:33,099
they have maxed out over 50 DLI and as

245
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:35,620
long as the co2 and temperature is

246
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,620
optimized for that higher light

247
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:41,519
intensity it keeps eating it up we have

248
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:45,250
not found the upper limit for cannabis

249
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,948
that doesn't mean we should grow at the

250
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:53,318
upper limit but it's pretty high even

251
00:12:47,948 --> 00:12:57,219
compared to Tomatoes so greenhouse

252
00:12:53,318 --> 00:13:00,250
glazing why do we want to regulate

253
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,019
energy efficiency or energy efficient

254
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,600
greenhouse glazings and what does that

255
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:06,818
mean for most people coming from

256
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,990
commercial buildings who are regulating

257
00:13:06,818 --> 00:13:13,149
windows it's about you value and our

258
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:16,870
value it's also about emissivity a

259
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:18,460
little bit but you value right so you

260
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:21,519
can see black

261
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:24,280
it's not looking so good right double

262
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:29,529
polyethylene does great okay

263
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:32,279
there's even an a sa b e what do you

264
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:34,419
call it greenhouse that is a historic

265
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:36,279
historical landmark because they

266
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:40,449
discovered at Rutgers the double

267
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:43,559
polyethylene greenhouse okay but right

268
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:49,780
with decreasing U value we also get

269
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:51,939
decreasing white maybe that's okay maybe

270
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:56,319
not I also want to point out infrared

271
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:58,360
and UV infrared is basically responsible

272
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,520
for the greenhouse effect in a

273
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:05,830
greenhouse glass is opaque to infrared

274
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,929
long wave radiation so when the sunlight

275
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:10,420
comes in and it bounces around it loses

276
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:12,099
energy turns into infrared light hits

277
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:15,370
the inside of the glazing and bounces

278
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:20,080
right back in great for winter cold

279
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:23,049
climates glass okay double polyethylene

280
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,900
and plastic maybe not so good at doing

281
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:27,699
that which is great if you're in Arizona

282
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:30,370
we don't want to try all that long wave

283
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:33,190
radiation we want it to escape but what

284
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:36,909
about UV right mark talked a little bit

285
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:39,430
I think you did did you about stretching

286
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:41,829
the par right but also stretching the

287
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:43,899
wavelength at which plants like to grow

288
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,810
and not just for photosynthetic reasons

289
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:51,279
but for quality reasons right for

290
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:54,179
pigmentation Jen from Gotham Green says

291
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:57,699
that she doesn't get red leaf lettuce

292
00:14:54,179 --> 00:15:00,099
until she opens up the windows in her

293
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,920
polycarbonate covered greenhouse because

294
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,690
now we're actually letting some UV into

295
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:09,519
the greenhouse which is what causes that

296
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:14,950
red pigmentation so let's talk about you

297
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:17,799
value wow that's a pretty big difference

298
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:23,610
right 36 percent energy savings on

299
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:23,609
cooling okay that's looking pretty good

300
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:37,739
oh my god the Sun just exploded any

301
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:42,959
savings that we thought we gained from a

302
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:46,399
you value on the envelope eleven twelve

303
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:49,170
thousand percent difference okay

304
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,750
yes I think you values are great if

305
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:54,120
you're in a cold cloudy climate Kay

306
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:56,789
there's there's gains to be had by

307
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:03,870
saving heat but if we're doing this in a

308
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:07,469
warm sunny climate please but maybe

309
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:12,029
there's another option what if we add

310
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:18,810
shading to block out the sunlight when

311
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:22,769
we want to we did this study this was a

312
00:16:18,809 --> 00:16:25,279
project in white what we demonstrated is

313
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:27,720
look at the load reduction K this is

314
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:32,009
just a glass house okay there's your

315
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:35,220
glass house envelope matter infiltration

316
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:38,429
mat son oh my god it's like a hundred

317
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:41,759
percent okay okay so now let's put

318
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:44,939
double poly on it instead we two percent

319
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,580
reduction but look at this we added a

320
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,870
thirty five percent shade and look at

321
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:53,910
how much we gained in cooling

322
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:56,250
requirements for this project that we

323
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:58,110
did in Texas we're actually going to

324
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:00,509
air-conditioned the greenhouse I am

325
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:03,180
going to talk about that later and we're

326
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:04,980
looking for ways to minimize the size of

327
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:08,819
the air-conditioner while they're

328
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:11,509
growing lettuce low DLI plant oh my god

329
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:14,369
we can like seriously do some fun

330
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:16,500
shading control so what you're actually

331
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:18,449
looking at is we say hey when the

332
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,549
outside solar radiation is between two

333
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,410
hundred and fifty watts and five hundred

334
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:25,559
and seventy watts per square meter we're

335
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:29,430
going to pull one forty five percent

336
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:31,649
shade curtain okay and this is the

337
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:34,620
result right here okay so this is

338
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,730
outside solar radiation or par and then

339
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:38,669
this is the incoming solar radiation

340
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:41,610
then we say oh now the outside is five

341
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:45,000
70 watts per square meter let's pull a

342
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:49,649
second shade and really block out the

343
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,099
light this is the result that we got we

344
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:55,080
are able okay so this is the DL I okay

345
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:57,299
our target is right in here for this

346
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:59,970
lettuce crop okay from January through

347
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:02,609
December and by having that ultimate

348
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:06,450
shade control okay that's this yellow

349
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:09,029
bar we are able to hit our DL I every

350
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:12,000
single month of the year and we're not

351
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:15,869
shading a crop in the winter when we

352
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:19,700
want to take advantage of sunlight okay

353
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:23,279
that is my piece on glazing and shading

354
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,480
okay so I mean I was really gonna talk

355
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:26,970
for about lighting for like a

356
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,259
millisecond so there's like two slides

357
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:30,299
up here I figured everyone would talk

358
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:32,670
about lighting but I'm gonna make one

359
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:37,349
case which is photo period control

360
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:40,650
this is vegetative crops only okay so if

361
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:43,889
we use a lower light intensity fixture

362
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:47,700
for a longer period of time we can

363
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:50,310
reduce the size of our lamps the energy

364
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:54,120
power requirements of our lamps and also

365
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:58,769
potentially the HVAC loads from that

366
00:18:54,119 --> 00:19:01,559
light but but we still as long as we

367
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:04,109
still have well watered crops if we make

368
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:06,809
adjustments to the temperature and even

369
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:09,990
the co2 so that the plants continue to

370
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:11,779
transpire at about the same rate we

371
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:15,299
still have to dehumanize and

372
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:18,660
dehumidification is stupidly energy

373
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:21,180
intensive so we might be able to gain

374
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:24,090
thirty five percent energy savings on

375
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:29,120
lighting but maybe only 10% on HVAC I

376
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:32,639
mean it's something okay all right so

377
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:35,399
speaking of dehumidification anyone own

378
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,980
a cat I try to cover all the pets in the

379
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,100
in this okay so this is a desiccant

380
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:44,779
wheel solid desiccant wheel and any of

381
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:47,298
you who own cats kitty litter is what

382
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:51,558
heavy

383
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:54,089
right so imagine how heavy this wheel is

384
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:56,700
it's heavy okay all right

385
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:58,949
anyway so with dehumidification and

386
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,450
humidity control in general what are we

387
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:02,220
trying to do we are trying to control

388
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:05,700
evapo transpiration and

389
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:08,669
evapotranspiration is very important to

390
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,819
the plant for a few reasons okay one

391
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:14,130
number one water and nutrient delivery

392
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:16,529
if we don't have good water and nutrient

393
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,000
delivery we get leaf tip burn blossom

394
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:22,048
end rot and a whole bunch of other

395
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,179
issues okay it also is responsible for

396
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:27,029
holding the plant up right and the

397
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,679
cellular structure of that plant when

398
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:30,750
you don't water your plant the plant

399
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,780
wilts because the cells are dehydrated

400
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:38,130
okay one of the most important things

401
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:40,168
also is it cools itself by transpiration

402
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:43,440
we are evaporating water which is an

403
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:45,020
evaporative Li cooling process and so

404
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:49,350
plants regulate their temperature

405
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:54,269
through transpiration and photosynthesis

406
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:55,469
is miniscule okay so I actually realized

407
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:57,720
I didn't talk about moisture removal

408
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,700
efficiency but I am talking about

409
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,390
moisture removal capacity for a second

410
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:05,490
kay and they're closely related but

411
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:09,210
moisture removal capacity depends on the

412
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:12,679
equipment but it also really depends on

413
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:16,380
the room conditions every single

414
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:18,870
dehumidifier is rated at these

415
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:21,210
conditions 80 degrees and 60 percent

416
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:23,399
relative humidity for all the growers in

417
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:27,179
the room any of you growing at that

418
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:29,190
condition exactly I don't care what

419
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:32,759
you're growing there's no one growing at

420
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:34,650
this condition so what are the

421
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:36,900
ramifications okay you're a grower and

422
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:40,440
you're like I need to dehumanize I I'm

423
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:42,750
in a Google right dehumidification unit

424
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,960
so you google it and you say oh okay so

425
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,909
my let's just say you know what your

426
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,529
evapotranspiration rate is and what how

427
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:53,220
much dehumidification you need and you

428
00:21:49,529 --> 00:21:57,109
say oh I need about to remove about 20

429
00:21:53,220 --> 00:22:00,630
pounds per hour of water I need to

430
00:21:57,109 --> 00:22:02,459
dehumanize but wait

431
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:05,250
in vertical farm and you're trying to

432
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:06,620
grow at 70 degrees and say 60% relative

433
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,420
humidity

434
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:13,469
its moisture removal capacities now 7

435
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:17,519
you need three not to owe you you're

436
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:19,490
operating a drying room your it like 60

437
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:25,619
degrees and 50 percent relative humidity

438
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:28,620
3 pounds per hour right you don't need

439
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:31,649
three you need six did I do that math

440
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:35,489
right three times six eight yeah I did

441
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:37,440
it right this is one of the reasons why

442
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:40,109
growers are having a hard time with

443
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,090
dehumidification it's not necessarily

444
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:44,039
because they don't know that they have

445
00:22:42,089 --> 00:22:46,439
to dehumanize it's because they don't

446
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:48,299
understand that the cut sheets that

447
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:53,490
they're looking at are not giving them

448
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:57,149
the full picture and manufacturers are

449
00:22:53,490 --> 00:23:01,200
not giving away this data readily or at

450
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:03,420
least to the public okay for a really

451
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,490
good reason I'll give them I mean it's

452
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:08,640
an okay reason they are actually doing

453
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:09,839
their own tests in facilities where

454
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,070
they're controlling temperature and

455
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:14,299
humidity but the problem is is that

456
00:23:11,069 --> 00:23:17,009
there is no standard for rating

457
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:20,389
dehumidification equipment at any

458
00:23:17,009 --> 00:23:23,490
conditions other than 80 degrees and 60%

459
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:25,590
so Keith I'm pretty sure that you guys

460
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:27,809
are involved in trying to come up with a

461
00:23:25,589 --> 00:23:30,709
different rating system a lot of the

462
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:33,359
dehumidifier dehumidifier equipment

463
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:36,299
manufacturers are working on this right

464
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:43,709
now so they can be of better service to

465
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:48,470
all of us so dehumidification there's no

466
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:51,930
way around it is just intense okay in

467
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:54,720
order to remove moisture we have to drop

468
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:56,970
the temperature to below the dew point

469
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,220
to way below the dew point the dew point

470
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:03,500
for those of you who don't know is the

471
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:07,019
temperature at which do forms okay so

472
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:09,150
typically to actually remove enough do

473
00:24:07,019 --> 00:24:12,359
from the air we have to drop the

474
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:14,220
temperature to less than 50 degrees we

475
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:19,229
have our project right now where we

476
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:21,960
a chilled water cold water system at 36

477
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:24,419
degrees because there's so much moisture

478
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,640
being pumped into the room that we have

479
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:29,130
to drop the temperature that low to

480
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,730
remove moisture well I'm not delivering

481
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:37,740
36 degree air to my plants I'm gonna

482
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:39,659
freeze them so what do I do i reheat so

483
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,210
i just used all this energy to remove

484
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:46,039
moisture and I'm gonna use all this

485
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:46,038
energy to control the temperature

486
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:55,380
well what about desiccant well desiccant

487
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,870
has the opposite problem now we heat the

488
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:00,000
desiccant to recharge it right so it

489
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:02,099
sucks out the moisture and then it's

490
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,798
holding on to the moisture and to dry it

491
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:07,889
out we heat it well now I don't want to

492
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:09,000
deliver 120 degree air to my room right

493
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:16,950
so what do I do

494
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:19,710
I cool it okay so where is the potential

495
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,690
to save with dehumidification first of

496
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,100
all heat recovery there are some

497
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:25,380
manufacturers who are doing a really

498
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:28,649
good job at doing hot gas reheat

499
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:31,730
runaround loops any way that we can

500
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:34,980
recover the energy that we're removing

501
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:37,860
from the moisture and from cooling and

502
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:40,950
putting it back in to the air without

503
00:25:37,859 --> 00:25:46,199
using practically any extra energy at

504
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:47,700
all economizers well okay no I'm not

505
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,909
economizers give me a second on that

506
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:53,610
heat exchangers okay so we can have an

507
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:56,940
air-to-air heat exchanger where we can

508
00:25:53,609 --> 00:25:59,658
recirculate back through like this piece

509
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,120
of technology over here so we removed

510
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:04,950
heat and moisture and then we're gonna

511
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:06,869
return through this return loop back

512
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:08,909
across that heat exchanger and pick up

513
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:11,250
that heat that we sucked out with

514
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:13,559
dehumidification in this case we're

515
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,659
using outside air indirectly through an

516
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:17,908
energy wheel so we're using the outside

517
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:22,549
air to pre cool and pre dehumidifier

518
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:22,549
before it goes across a cooling coil

519
00:26:23,089 --> 00:26:30,099
let's talk about

520
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:31,750
fans okay dogs dog people okay a little

521
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:37,750
less shy than the cat people go figure

522
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:39,369
okay why do we have fans okay there's a

523
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:41,230
lot of reasons we have fans we have fans

524
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:43,029
to distribute that cooling and that

525
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:45,309
heating from our various equipment to

526
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:48,430
get it into the room okay and remove

527
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:50,710
that hot wet air and send it back to the

528
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:52,750
air conditioner okay but also we have

529
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,870
air movement across the plants

530
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:58,269
themselves in the space themselves right

531
00:26:55,869 --> 00:26:59,829
for to break up the boundary layers this

532
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:02,769
little pocket of air that forms around

533
00:26:59,829 --> 00:27:06,279
the leaf remove moisture remove heat

534
00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:08,680
from the plants or from the lamps take

535
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:12,879
away the waste product called oxygen

536
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:16,810
right and deliver even co2 to the plant

537
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:19,930
air movement is very important this is

538
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:22,750
so this is the only time I directly pick

539
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:26,080
on title 24 so one of the sub measures

540
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:27,549
is fan efficiency okay which actually I

541
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:29,859
mean I'm not paying on I think I mean I

542
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:32,049
think this is still a good plan right so

543
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:34,449
they say that the circulation fan should

544
00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:38,529
have a minimum efficiency K of some

545
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:40,420
watts per square feet or CFM I don't

546
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:42,250
know how they figured out the potential

547
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:45,250
savings I'd actually like to know the

548
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:47,500
answer to that Kyle perhaps just so that

549
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:48,759
I can in the next slide I could do the

550
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,740
same analysis or I'll just give it to

551
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:52,750
you and you can do the analysis okay but

552
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:56,500
the incremental cost is fifty to five

553
00:27:52,750 --> 00:28:00,490
hundred dollars let's talk about a

554
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:04,960
bigger issue air filtration do we have

555
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:11,849
any air filtration people in the room no

556
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,850
really do we perfect snake oil salesmen

557
00:28:13,628 --> 00:28:20,209
mmm-hmm no it's fine I'm talking to the

558
00:28:18,138 --> 00:28:21,648
national air filtration Association in

559
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:24,409
Phoenix next month and I'm gonna be

560
00:28:21,648 --> 00:28:28,638
having a get real conversation with them

561
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:31,730
about this those of you who have been

562
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:35,148
duped into installing HEPA filters I'm

563
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:38,179
really sorry because you're using an

564
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:43,668
unnecessary amount of energy to clean

565
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:45,798
air that or to remove constituents that

566
00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:47,059
aren't really harmful to your plants or

567
00:28:45,798 --> 00:28:49,898
at least that you don't really care that

568
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:53,480
much about what do you care about mold

569
00:28:49,898 --> 00:28:56,418
powdery mildew botrytis well guess what

570
00:28:53,480 --> 00:29:00,980
your regular old run-of-the-mill merv 11

571
00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:04,190
filter can do that work I still

572
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:06,470
recommend more of 13 but okay can do it

573
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:12,048
you do not need a HEPA filter to remove

574
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:14,720
viruses and viroids okay there was a

575
00:29:12,048 --> 00:29:16,700
paper that was written a few years ago

576
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,399
that looked at the energy savings

577
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:22,429
potential of different air filtration

578
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:26,298
media based on fan power it also looked

579
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:28,580
at the cost of replacements and how much

580
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:31,940
more costly and labor-intensive it is

581
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:34,898
even is to have a more high efficiency

582
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:39,019
filter that you don't necessarily need

583
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:42,109
so ultimately if you can reduce the

584
00:29:39,019 --> 00:29:46,429
pressure drop across this filter by

585
00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:50,058
having a larger screen basically you are

586
00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:52,788
going to gain a lot and fan efficiency

587
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:55,599
so I did a little back of the envelope

588
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:59,269
calculation for a project that we did

589
00:29:55,599 --> 00:30:03,980
okay and we had in this indoor facility

590
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:08,509
K requires 630 ton air conditioning

591
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:11,419
units if we use a HEPA filter it will be

592
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:18,769
equivalent in fan power to 250,000

593
00:30:11,419 --> 00:30:22,499
kilowatt hours Merv 1395 that's some

594
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:28,588
real fan savings

595
00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:34,419
and guess what the incremental cost

596
00:30:28,588 --> 00:30:37,418
maybe actually there's a savings okay so

597
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:41,469
now on to my other opportunities all

598
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:44,589
right let's talk about equipment sizing

599
00:30:41,469 --> 00:30:47,199
and VPD control BP again really near and

600
00:30:44,588 --> 00:30:50,818
dear to my heart this next section is

601
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:53,558
especially for my growers in the room

602
00:30:50,818 --> 00:30:55,509
VPD by the way for those of you who

603
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:59,348
don't know and are not familiar with my

604
00:30:55,509 --> 00:31:01,449
favorite tool in the toolbox this is a

605
00:30:59,348 --> 00:31:04,388
psychrometric chart and VPD is the

606
00:31:01,449 --> 00:31:06,909
difference between the saturation vapor

607
00:31:04,388 --> 00:31:10,658
pressure at the plant leaf at the

608
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:13,719
stomata versus the vapor pressure at the

609
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:16,539
room temperature and humidity the longer

610
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:23,199
this line the bigger the VPD the drier

611
00:31:16,538 --> 00:31:25,269
it is okay so you have a room okay and

612
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:27,909
you have a good engineer who has figured

613
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:29,828
out that this is your sensible and

614
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:31,869
latent load sensible load is managing

615
00:31:29,828 --> 00:31:37,028
temperature latent load is managing

616
00:31:31,868 --> 00:31:39,788
humidity so your contractor or engineer

617
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:41,199
doesn't really know what they're doing

618
00:31:39,788 --> 00:31:42,338
they're not familiar with indoor plant

619
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:46,239
environments and they're like you know

620
00:31:42,338 --> 00:31:47,469
what I don't really trust myself I don't

621
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:49,919
really know what's going on so I'm just

622
00:31:47,469 --> 00:31:53,558
gonna double the size of the equipment

623
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:59,379
right and just cross my fingers that

624
00:31:53,558 --> 00:32:02,259
we're gonna get there well and so they

625
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:08,078
picked this unit and this is the airflow

626
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:10,328
is 4,000 CFM to meet there's 4.7 latent

627
00:32:08,078 --> 00:32:12,368
tons but look at how much sensible we

628
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:13,928
have we almost have three times the

629
00:32:12,368 --> 00:32:16,749
amount of sensible load which means

630
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:22,059
we're gonna really over cool and really

631
00:32:16,749 --> 00:32:24,818
have to reheat okay this is so common in

632
00:32:22,058 --> 00:32:26,528
the industry to oversized equipment

633
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:30,459
because hey you don't know what's going

634
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:33,788
on or be because you don't have good

635
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:35,389
conditions to start with okay so I mean

636
00:32:33,788 --> 00:32:38,239
these are some of the options I put up

637
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:40,008
you can upsize the equipment you can add

638
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:42,528
stand-alone dehumidifiers between old

639
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:44,479
water growers or band-aiding right you

640
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:47,239
can reduce the temperature of the coil

641
00:32:44,479 --> 00:32:49,399
so from 42 degrees down to that 36

642
00:32:47,239 --> 00:32:51,619
degrees okay squeeze more moisture out

643
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:53,088
you can increase the thickness of the

644
00:32:51,618 --> 00:32:59,569
coils but that's gonna increase fan

645
00:32:53,088 --> 00:33:04,219
energy what else can we do let's change

646
00:32:59,569 --> 00:33:07,368
the conditions in general when we have a

647
00:33:04,219 --> 00:33:08,959
higher VPD as I talked about before we

648
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:11,868
have higher transpiration rates your

649
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:14,209
plants use more water which means we

650
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:17,178
also have to remove warm moisture from

651
00:33:14,209 --> 00:33:19,369
the air if you have a lower VPD it's

652
00:33:17,179 --> 00:33:21,109
more humid your plants don't use as much

653
00:33:19,368 --> 00:33:26,868
water and there's less moisture to

654
00:33:21,108 --> 00:33:29,208
remove plus okay so this is the chart

655
00:33:26,868 --> 00:33:31,699
that we have on our website for cannabis

656
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:33,709
we have it also for strawberries lettuce

657
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:38,598
tomatoes okay if you guys are interested

658
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:41,089
in calculating your VPD so this was your

659
00:33:38,598 --> 00:33:43,189
original condition 75 degrees and 50

660
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:46,519
percent relative humidity okay

661
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:49,249
and I've been able to convince you or

662
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:53,959
you've convinced yourself that we could

663
00:33:49,249 --> 00:33:56,298
do 75 and 675 degrees in 65 percent

664
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:59,389
relative humidity and rather than having

665
00:33:56,298 --> 00:34:02,450
a VPD of 1.5 I'm gonna have a VPD of one

666
00:33:59,388 --> 00:34:07,788
which is much more standard for most

667
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:09,980
horticultural crops we are closer to the

668
00:34:07,788 --> 00:34:14,449
saturation curve with our new system

669
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:17,240
which makes it easier for our equipment

670
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:18,739
to D humidify there's also going to be

671
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:22,668
less moisture in the room because the

672
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:28,278
VPD is lower so what is the result

673
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:30,408
oh my god now we have a 12 ton unit we

674
00:34:28,278 --> 00:34:32,028
are right size we're right there for the

675
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:37,039
sensible and latent loads and look at

676
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:42,168
the fan though 2500 CFM

677
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:45,800
we saved saved saved and your plants

678
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:50,608
I bet are also going to be happier

679
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,480
happy plants happy HVAC what about an

680
00:34:50,608 --> 00:34:55,019
economizer

681
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:57,148
okay again another 45 minute lecture I'm

682
00:34:55,019 --> 00:35:00,358
gonna talk about it for like 30 seconds

683
00:34:57,148 --> 00:35:02,400
okay because this is whoa this is a lot

684
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:04,799
of data okay a lot to get through we

685
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,809
looked at I think 10 different locations

686
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,210
I'm only gonna present three here very

687
00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:10,259
quickly just to show you what the

688
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:13,769
opportunity is

689
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:16,500
okay so here's climate zones that ASHRAE

690
00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:20,599
has defined okay there's hot humid hot

691
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:22,889
dry cold humid cold dry temperate and

692
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:24,900
everything in between very hot very

693
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:27,960
humid did you know ASHRAE created a new

694
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:33,990
climate zone 0-4 very hot very humid

695
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:38,670
well okay sorry and it's probably gonna

696
00:35:33,989 --> 00:35:44,219
get worse okay so dry and cool okay so

697
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:47,400
this is Denver okay so I'm in Denver

698
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:49,889
this is where your temperature and

699
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,608
humidity set points are to hit a one

700
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:53,549
kilopascal

701
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:56,098
okay so this is a tomato or cannabis

702
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:58,050
this is your lettuce okay and this is

703
00:35:56,099 --> 00:36:02,430
strawberry maybe they like the

704
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:05,130
temperatures kind of low and dry during

705
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:07,949
the daytime so as you can see the dew

706
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:10,320
point okay so this is the hourly bendata

707
00:36:07,949 --> 00:36:12,689
this is how we read the dew point as

708
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,750
this horizontal line look at how many

709
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:17,250
hours are below the dew point the reason

710
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:20,039
this is important is because even if

711
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:22,530
it's cool but there's moisture in in the

712
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:24,719
air what are we gonna do we're gonna

713
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:27,269
cool yes but we're also going to

714
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:30,358
humidify a space that we want to

715
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:32,969
dehumanize so if all of these hours are

716
00:36:30,358 --> 00:36:34,889
below that dew point temperature that

717
00:36:32,969 --> 00:36:39,959
means we get to dehumidifier and that's

718
00:36:34,889 --> 00:36:43,409
the energy intensive process okay what

719
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,929
about Orlando whoo it is tough in Miami

720
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:49,529
and Florida and Hawaii and Abu Dhabi

721
00:36:45,929 --> 00:36:52,289
right to dehumidifier use the outside

722
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:56,089
air to conditioned our space why because

723
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:56,088
look at how high this dew point is

724
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:02,578
we should not be using economizers maybe

725
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:04,200
some mixed air but really if we were

726
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:08,369
gonna mandate economizers I would say

727
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:11,368
don't do it to poor Florida so can we

728
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:13,289
use the outside air to D humidify so

729
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:15,210
just quickly looking at lettuce versus

730
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:20,159
tomato in Denver the answer is a

731
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:25,068
resounding yes it's nice and dry but in

732
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:25,068
Orlando probably not okay

733
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,190
I'm so glad that Katelyn talked about

734
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:34,019
odor control yesterday I feel like I'm

735
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:39,990
the only person that ever talks about

736
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:44,869
this so a little story a couple years

737
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:48,088
ago I got a phone call from a grower a

738
00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:51,170
potential grower new grower in Boulder

739
00:37:48,088 --> 00:37:54,420
and he calls me up and he says hey Nadia

740
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:57,108
I'm building a new 30,000 square foot

741
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:59,760
greenhouse in Boulder and the greenhouse

742
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:01,858
costs half a million dollars but I'm

743
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,890
being told the air conditioner is gonna

744
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:07,098
cost two and a half million dollars does

745
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:11,519
that make sense to you

746
00:38:07,099 --> 00:38:14,490
so pull out my calculator and I just

747
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:17,759
real rough back-of-the-envelope thousand

748
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:22,679
watts per square meter right a 30,000

749
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:26,670
square feet oh my god yeah 800 tons of

750
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:29,779
cooling right multiply that bake just

751
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:31,769
three thousand dollars for ton and yeah

752
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,920
two three million dollars this sounds

753
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:38,298
right to me

754
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:43,559
why did you do that

755
00:38:38,298 --> 00:38:47,309
odor control the city of ball and one

756
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:48,750
from the city of Boulder do you really

757
00:38:47,309 --> 00:38:50,040
want to talk to you about this I want to

758
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:52,469
know what's happened since our

759
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:56,369
conversation a couple years ago County

760
00:38:52,469 --> 00:39:00,058
so Boulder has a very strict odor

761
00:38:56,369 --> 00:39:01,920
control ordinance these growers were

762
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:04,980
smart enough to know that a greenhouse

763
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,338
in Colorado is an awesome idea we have

764
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:10,820
plenty of sunlight it's dry it's cool

765
00:39:08,338 --> 00:39:13,940
they should be using conventional

766
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:15,769
greenhouse technology but they got a

767
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,750
complaint from a neighbor down the road

768
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:19,849
who happens to be an organic farmer

769
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:23,269
putting shit on his field that they were

770
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:28,549
concerned about odor so Boulder told

771
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:31,489
them you have to seal it up sealing the

772
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:39,769
greenhouse for odor control created an

773
00:39:31,489 --> 00:39:43,819
energy monster why we're air

774
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:46,009
conditioning the Sun this is nuts

775
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:48,860
and there's so many people out there who

776
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:50,660
are looking at true-blue sealed

777
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:53,599
greenhouse not semi-closed greenhouses

778
00:39:50,659 --> 00:39:56,299
but sealed greenhouses to prevent odor

779
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,849
from leaking out and air conditioning it

780
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:03,860
like it's a well insulated warehouse

781
00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:06,650
building so when people say do

782
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:10,269
greenhouses use less energy than a

783
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:13,550
warehouse I mean I'd like to think so

784
00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:15,320
but not if you're gonna do this right

785
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:17,870
you might as well just go into a

786
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:20,720
warehouse maybe add some solar tubes or

787
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:27,429
find a way to introduce outside light I

788
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:31,099
don't know but it's not black and white

789
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:35,000
and just for a moment because Caitlin

790
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:37,279
did talk about measuring VOCs this was a

791
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,340
study done out of Iowa State a few years

792
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,690
ago looking at harvested flower and we

793
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:45,260
have known for a long time that there's

794
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:50,059
about 20-25 VOCs right Mersin limonene

795
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:51,950
pining blah blah Blee okay that produce

796
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:56,809
odor what they I determined is that

797
00:40:51,949 --> 00:41:01,279
there's actually 220 VOCs and what was

798
00:40:56,809 --> 00:41:02,960
shocking is that the VOCs that were the

799
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,080
most offensive to our nose that we were

800
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:11,510
most sensitive to they could barely

801
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:15,380
detect with mass spectrometry we are so

802
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:17,150
tuned in to the smell of cannabis that

803
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:22,369
they're brilliant has to be any there

804
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:24,119
and we find it right it finds us so how

805
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:28,409
do we control something that we

806
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:31,230
can't even measure what do we do right

807
00:41:28,409 --> 00:41:33,539
we had all these act you know that all

808
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:36,269
these carbon filters with recirculating

809
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:38,759
fans which there is literally no logic

810
00:41:36,269 --> 00:41:41,159
whatsoever to how many you have how many

811
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,260
you install you talk to a different

812
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:44,549
manufacturer or a different person with

813
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:49,800
the same manufacturing they're all gonna

814
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:54,300
give you a different recommendation so

815
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:56,970
here's this greenhouse 450,000 cubic

816
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,080
feet okay in Boulder because I'm

817
00:41:56,969 --> 00:41:59,549
guessing that they're not just air

818
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,900
conditioning they really want to make

819
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,060
sure that they don't get a complaint

820
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:05,400
from their neighbors so they're also

821
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:08,210
doing activated carbon filters and look

822
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,800
at how much energy they're using

823
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:14,250
everything we just saved by switching

824
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:17,070
from HEPA to Merv we just lost through

825
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:18,449
odor control and then I have to show

826
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:21,600
this video because one of my favorite

827
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:26,000
videos odor-neutralizer I'm asking

828
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:29,039
people in the room okay they say that

829
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,500
the the essential oils are non-toxic

830
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:37,519
they will cure the MSDS reports with you

831
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:43,409
but I always say this is also 24/7 I

832
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:45,239
know I mean there is too much of a good

833
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:46,949
thing right I just keep thinking about

834
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:50,389
all these oils getting sprayed into the

835
00:42:46,949 --> 00:42:53,279
environment a slipping hazard walking by

836
00:42:50,389 --> 00:42:57,299
all getting flushed down into our

837
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,310
waterways like and by the way privately

838
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,539
neighbors will tell me that they

839
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:03,329
probably think maybe the smell of

840
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:05,400
cannabis would have been less disgusting

841
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:07,219
than the smell of Febreze being sprayed

842
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,539
over their neighborhood all the time

843
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:11,969
they won't say that to the County Board

844
00:43:09,539 --> 00:43:14,119
of Supervisors but they'll say it to me

845
00:43:11,969 --> 00:43:16,139
in a phone call okay

846
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:18,269
monitoring and control it's just real

847
00:43:16,139 --> 00:43:21,690
quickly there is a problem in this

848
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:23,429
industry with good control systems we

849
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:25,920
have horticultural control systems that

850
00:43:23,429 --> 00:43:28,649
can't communicate with commercial HVAC

851
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,710
systems we have commercial control

852
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:36,900
systems that are like irrigation what's

853
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:39,840
that right I love this picture this

854
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,700
and a facility in Michigan and we

855
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,920
literally were looking at six different

856
00:43:41,699 --> 00:43:48,029
sensors in the same exact spot giving

857
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:51,480
different readings okay what are we

858
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:54,720
controlling which one's right we need

859
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,599
more research right engineers and

860
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:58,859
manufacturers let's face it

861
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:02,369
regulators utilities a lot of people

862
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:05,940
don't understand plants they don't

863
00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:08,849
understand the occupant of the room it's

864
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,970
not a person it's a green thing and it's

865
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:13,920
not an alien I guess it feels alien

866
00:44:10,969 --> 00:44:16,369
growers don't understand energy balance

867
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,710
they don't understand psychometrics VPD

868
00:44:16,369 --> 00:44:23,699
HVAC HVAC operation is very complex and

869
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:25,500
plants are living dynamic organisms that

870
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:27,839
don't have feet in hands and can't walk

871
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,969
over to a thermostat and change the

872
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:32,400
temperature we have to be able to

873
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:36,269
respond and predict to what the plants

874
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,430
need when they need it right and we need

875
00:44:36,269 --> 00:44:40,769
better help defining the metrics into

876
00:44:38,429 --> 00:44:44,339
finding baselines and benchmarks and

877
00:44:40,769 --> 00:44:46,259
there are a lot of different metrics

878
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:47,850
that I hear getting thrown around I

879
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,920
actually realized yesterday I didn't

880
00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:54,230
include a big one which is like watts

881
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:58,349
per gram right or energy input / output

882
00:44:54,230 --> 00:45:00,210
but I mean it's pound per light dead do

883
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:03,960
we have to keep using this one is it

884
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:07,019
going away no okay I see some giggles

885
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:09,240
some smiles but remember again this is a

886
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:12,449
business and we have to be focused on

887
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:15,389
profitability and the cost of the

888
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:16,889
resources and the cost of production who

889
00:45:15,389 --> 00:45:18,329
talked about footprint yesterday I was

890
00:45:16,889 --> 00:45:24,259
so excited you talked about it

891
00:45:18,329 --> 00:45:24,259
kale ah okay anyway

892
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:31,410
floor area of this greenhouse is 9,000

893
00:45:28,769 --> 00:45:35,130
square feet we go vertical and now we

894
00:45:31,409 --> 00:45:37,980
have a canopy area of 35,000 square feet

895
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:40,650
when we ask for an energy use intensity

896
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:43,349
and we have a limit are we talking about

897
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:45,809
canopy area are we talking about floor

898
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:48,599
area are we talking about illuminated

899
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:49,699
area are we because guess what you can

900
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:51,469
stick the light

901
00:45:49,699 --> 00:45:53,599
right over the plant and that's your

902
00:45:51,469 --> 00:45:55,759
illuminated area awesome

903
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:59,769
my HVAC system is conditioning the

904
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,770
entire volume of the room Oh

905
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:05,059
so you look at this floorplan you're

906
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:10,280
like oh that's easy and then you realize

907
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:12,469
oh crap these things are stacked 30 feet

908
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:17,930
up in the air and they're just packed

909
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:18,949
with biomass again is this our footage

910
00:46:17,929 --> 00:46:23,379
or square footage

911
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:28,730
our footprint or is this our footprint

912
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:30,470
so research that's going on active

913
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:32,780
groups we've met all of these have been

914
00:46:30,469 --> 00:46:34,939
mentioned today actually which is so

915
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:37,190
awesome I'm so glad that there's so much

916
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:39,440
awareness in this room about the

917
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:40,970
research going on about people who are

918
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,950
trying to define these metrics these

919
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:46,179
benchmarks these baselines and trying to

920
00:46:42,949 --> 00:46:47,329
help growers optimize what they're doing

921
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:51,919
scri

922
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:53,630
is the Optima a group that is led by a

923
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,130
bunch of academic researchers and

924
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,690
they're going into vertical farms

925
00:46:55,130 --> 00:47:00,019
specifically define the optimization

926
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:03,470
points for light co2 temperature water

927
00:47:00,019 --> 00:47:06,170
air flow and then of course thank you

928
00:47:03,469 --> 00:47:08,059
Derek for all your guys's work ASHRAE is

929
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:10,039
trying to fund a bunch of research and

930
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:14,119
then we have this standard that we're

931
00:47:10,039 --> 00:47:17,750
developing so ultimately energy

932
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:21,109
efficiency comes down to optimization

933
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:25,489
for the growers and it all comes down to

934
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:29,079
being able to control our inputs and our

935
00:47:25,489 --> 00:47:34,549
outputs all of these things are about

936
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:36,920
control one way or the other control

937
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:39,200
control control control I don't know

938
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:44,829
there's ten controls out there what can

939
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:47,719
we all agree on it's complex right it

940
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:49,699
depends grateful again for all the

941
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:51,739
speakers who have come up here and said

942
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:54,019
it depends on the crop it depends on the

943
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:57,469
location location meaning of the climate

944
00:47:54,019 --> 00:48:00,289
the market all sorts of things right the

945
00:47:57,469 --> 00:48:02,269
facility we can't increase the bottom

946
00:48:00,289 --> 00:48:03,289
line we need more research and

947
00:48:02,269 --> 00:48:05,809
ultimately I

948
00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:08,599
do believe that it's possible to

949
00:48:05,809 --> 00:48:12,769
optimize and be more efficient while

950
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:15,610
also increasing profitability for the

951
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:18,420
people growing our crops

952
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:21,679
the end

953
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:21,679
[Applause]

954
00:48:25,929 --> 00:48:30,199
sorry I went over I knew I would but I

955
00:48:28,608 --> 00:48:30,769
feel like I went through it pretty

956
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,449
quickly

957
00:48:30,769 --> 00:48:38,000
you are amazing how about one more round

958
00:48:32,449 --> 00:48:40,399
of applause for Nadia what what an asset

959
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,170
not only not only does she have the best

960
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:45,019
information she also can deliver it in

961
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:46,789
an insightful way and help the process

962
00:48:45,019 --> 00:48:49,730
at the right time and get us all on the

963
00:48:46,789 --> 00:48:50,869
same page thank you thank you Derek

964
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:53,500
thank you for putting this together in

965
00:48:50,869 --> 00:48:53,500
the hospital
