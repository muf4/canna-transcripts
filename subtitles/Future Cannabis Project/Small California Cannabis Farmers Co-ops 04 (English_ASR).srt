1
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,000
benefits in the meantime we have a lot

2
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,560
of partners you know Patrick Basil's

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,570
several of you guys out here that are

4
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:25,699
building businesses that are

5
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,289
cooperatively minded that can fill in

6
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:29,539
those supply chain gaps and you know

7
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:31,009
going forward just as with the seeds and

8
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,329
supporting the diversity of plants we

9
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,190
also want to support the diversity of

10
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:36,619
businesses and business owners we don't

11
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:38,179
want a homogenized cannabis community a

12
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:40,820
homogenized cannabis culture or

13
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:42,679
homogenized cannabis so those are you

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,230
know some of the benefits that being a

15
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,530
member of a co-op and working with in

16
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:50,058
the Emerald grown structure can provide

17
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:52,189
so I know a lot of people you know

18
00:00:50,058 --> 00:00:54,259
really fret the large-scale growers

19
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:57,199
because of what they're doing to the to

20
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:59,929
the prices but they're two different

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,359
markets if you will you know and from

22
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:04,819
what I hear you saying that there may

23
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:07,759
even be more opportunity for a lot of

24
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:09,709
craft small farmers because there's a

25
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,989
certain market share that will never be

26
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:14,269
touched by large scale and so again

27
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:16,549
nothing wrong with large scale it's it's

28
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:20,989
a different it's a different approach to

29
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:22,939
the same game and so one last question I

30
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:24,530
have for you guys you know I know

31
00:01:22,939 --> 00:01:27,140
there's a lot of conversation going

32
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,569
around about certain organizations that

33
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,659
are entering into the market with a

34
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:34,368
certain loss planned on bringing their

35
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:37,429
product to market in order to gain

36
00:01:34,368 --> 00:01:39,500
market share and and that strikes a lot

37
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:41,420
of fear and a lot of growers as well

38
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,368
because they're not able to even jar up

39
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,049
their product for what these other

40
00:01:43,368 --> 00:01:47,978
companies are able to retail or

41
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:51,289
wholesale it for how do you see a co-op

42
00:01:47,978 --> 00:01:53,780
lending again resiliency in that level

43
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:55,489
you know I think there there there are

44
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,439
some companies that I think are

45
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:59,629
observantly selling for less than

46
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,310
they're acquiring for but I also think

47
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:03,049
there's a bit of a misunderstanding of

48
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,868
what the aggregation supply chain looks

49
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:08,359
like and so if you buy a bulk lot of 30

50
00:02:05,868 --> 00:02:10,368
pounds and you channel some of it into a

51
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,020
60% margin because it's really

52
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:14,000
high-quality and you sell some of it at

53
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,159
a 10 percent loss you're still net

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,289
positive on that batch and so you are

55
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,049
seeing some things go into jars that's

56
00:02:18,289 --> 00:02:23,269
sort of the the mids that came out once

57
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:26,150
you've once you've refined the the highs

58
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,890
out of it you're you're able to sell a

59
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,030
little bit under your price and still

60
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:30,889
remain in

61
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,539
and I think a fair market position there

62
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:34,549
are absolutely companies that are

63
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:36,439
selling at a loss I mean when you see

64
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,420
some venture funded companies that are

65
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:41,629
burning way too much to not be selling

66
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:43,459
at a loss power to everyone for trying

67
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:45,469
to survive right now I'm not here to

68
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,300
knock anyone but I think what the coop

69
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:49,340
does and especially what the the

70
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,189
Federation model does is allows us to do

71
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,140
the same thing if we can buy bolt pounds

72
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:56,180
at twelve and route some of it into a

73
00:02:54,139 --> 00:02:57,679
wholesale twenty five dollar eighth we

74
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,540
can sell some wholesale seven dollar

75
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,819
eights and still you know still make

76
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:03,979
that sales price work and so it's really

77
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:06,859
about being able to channel products to

78
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:09,469
their highest value outlet the the

79
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:12,290
marketplace is both brand spankin x' and

80
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:13,280
just emerging and also 60 years old and

81
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:15,289
entrenched you know I've got

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,479
grandparents that still smoke the same

83
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:20,179
thing and they are reliable consistent

84
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:22,729
consumers and so I think the the other

85
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,560
thing that the the coop the coops don't

86
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:27,229
inherently bring this but our approach

87
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,509
to coops do because of the limitations

88
00:03:27,229 --> 00:03:32,449
that Kacie talked about our co-op also

89
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:34,159
brings a focus on that we are the

90
00:03:32,449 --> 00:03:36,379
existing market you know that free

91
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,819
market that's booming that's all the

92
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:39,560
small growers and all the people that

93
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:42,229
love them that couldn't get in and so

94
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,150
there's a lot of companies trying to buy

95
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:45,949
their way into the new market share the

96
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,650
new consumers trying to buy a slice of

97
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:50,509
that we've got a whole pie we need to

98
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,310
figure out how to bake it and get it

99
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:53,810
into regulation and compliance and

100
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,209
that's why we're figuring out how to

101
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,650
reduce these costs how to make this more

102
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:00,620
efficient how to create the most

103
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,140
welcoming system possible you know to

104
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,969
bring I'm a pretty skittish grower I am

105
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:06,768
skeptical of everything and at the end

106
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:09,109
of the day we're here now because we

107
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,840
need to be and and it's worth it's worth

108
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,310
taking a second look I think but we

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,900
could do the same thing not that we're

110
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,910
going to sell it a loss but we'll be

111
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,829
able to check you know to route to grade

112
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:23,479
to sort to be able to behave as scale

113
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,930
selling at a loss is not a great

114
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:25,930
practice

115
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,759
you know it's interesting one of the

116
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:35,180
things that I've been reflecting on a

117
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,159
lot lately is that four or five years

118
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,389
ago the community went through the

119
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:43,040
transition to regulation and that was a

120
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:45,229
philosophical transition that was a

121
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,910
socio-cultural transition and it was

122
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:49,430
exceptionally difficult and there was a

123
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:52,010
lot of vitriol around it

124
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,400
and the reality is that we're going

125
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:57,319
through the same transition now in the

126
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:01,099
economic sphere in the marketplace in

127
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:04,129
which the way the state has built the

128
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,450
marketplace like you know me and amber

129
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:07,819
are not driving weed to dispensaries

130
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:11,509
anymore it just isn't gonna happen for

131
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:14,060
us and so you we're all grappling with

132
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:16,399
like the the emergence of capital in the

133
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,800
marketplace and what does partnership

134
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:21,439
look like and how do we move forward and

135
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,449
the hard reality is that for the most

136
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,240
part without some form of either strong

137
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:28,610
partnership or capital infusion it gets

138
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,329
really really difficult you know if you

139
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,370
started off as a subsistence farm and

140
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:35,750
they pile on a whole bunch of capital

141
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,699
requirements for you to get through the

142
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,529
process there's there just isn't any

143
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:41,870
leeway there and so that's been one of

144
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:43,579
the most difficult things you know for

145
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,300
my farm to try to figure out is like we

146
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:45,620
don't have the money to build a

147
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,050
commercial building we don't have the

148
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,329
money to get a distribution license or

149
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:53,418
to have a retail license like we just

150
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:54,978
were tapped out and so you you figure

151
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:56,719
out like who you're gonna partner with

152
00:05:54,978 --> 00:05:58,879
how is it gonna work what does the

153
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,560
future look like and you know the same

154
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,110
thing with you know in this process of

155
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,389
emerald grown and then the management

156
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,430
company eg M&amp;S is a partnership with

157
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:10,099
capital to be able to have capital to

158
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:12,829
operate because the reality of it is to

159
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,720
do to operate in a statewide perspective

160
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:16,519
like I'm even in the old days I wasn't

161
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,410
driving cannabis to San Diego

162
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:19,939
like you know we're going to the Bay

163
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,400
Area dispensaries but like I'm not

164
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:25,100
getting my way to Southern California so

165
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,269
you know it's it's that that question of

166
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,220
like how do you partner who do you

167
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:30,769
partner with what are the values that

168
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,840
that I think is what it really comes

169
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:35,329
comes down to because capital is

170
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:38,239
becoming a requirement within the state

171
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:39,680
because it's so expensive and I'll just

172
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,598
say you know you weren't driving it to

173
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,780
San Diego you literally couldn't drive

174
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:45,259
it

175
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:47,029
to Osaka and this is going to emerge

176
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:49,670
very quickly and so we're all thinking

177
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:51,769
about state market but cooperative

178
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,990
cannabis is also about our global

179
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:55,849
community it's also about the network

180
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,720
that we've built in resistance to this

181
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:59,450
injustice

182
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,210
you know from Afghanistan to San Juan

183
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:04,668
Ridge to so many amazing communities

184
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:07,609
there is that Network and and working

185
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:09,680
together we can bring more of that to

186
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,759
the mainstream I think we are the

187
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,530
mainstream I just think we've been

188
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:15,110
tricked into thinking we're not but I'll

189
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:17,209
concede that we're not but we can bring

190
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:21,860
more of it to the mainstream if we

191
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:24,620
cooperate as Akaya Alan
