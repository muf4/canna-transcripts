1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:05,669
I mean as a rush maker I wouldn't trade

2
00:00:02,959 --> 00:00:08,099
this place for anywhere else in the

3
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:18,689
world ever I mean I would go back to

4
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:23,759
India for a spell but you the plants as

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:26,250
hash like its flower because everyone

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,849
smokes flower but if you go to producing

7
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:31,920
countries they don't see the plants or

8
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,058
something to dry everyone's talking

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,030
about hash ashes in the culture you have

10
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:41,250
kids from the age of three or four

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:44,070
helping and robbing and caring plants or

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,259
at least going up to the beaches to the

13
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:51,719
oldest grandmother and it's like they're

14
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:55,320
all working and they all know it I mean

15
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:58,230
the adversity harvesting the mountain of

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,439
the Himalaya is not quite the same than

17
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:03,238
just race of the Unversed

18
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:06,149
here in the mountain I hear it's like

19
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,978
fuck it's so fucking an Elsi that

20
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,780
sometimes you don't really want to be in

21
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:13,260
the middle of your office when it should

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,849
be the most amazing time of the year in

23
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,830
in producing country actually it's

24
00:01:16,849 --> 00:01:22,649
because of the people coming to rip you

25
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:25,650
of the police there is a lot of stress

26
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:29,520
and gun and people lock sheep a on edge

27
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,320
because it happens then on top of it if

28
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:35,158
you have bad weather and you don't want

29
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:37,739
to be around it like it is for there is

30
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:42,000
no joy into it it's not until I came

31
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:44,669
hard cap let beepers out to relax and

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,769
they tackle kids done because it has to

33
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:52,909
be done there is so much on the cap

34
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:52,908
let's say
