1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,859
okay so we have some audience chatter so

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,990
Dean link he says my fear with many

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,120
multi-state operators is that they have

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,730
invested so much into expensive means of

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:13,829
production with a commodity expected to

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,990
fall in price and an eventual interstate

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,560
trade brand equity on the consumer level

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,750
feels like a far safer bet

9
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:24,809
first of all Dean thank you I appreciate

10
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:26,698
your sentiment there because look from

11
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:28,049
the from the the commodity side I mean

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,250
when you talk about cultivation as a

13
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,109
commodity and you talk about what's

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,439
gonna happen with price compression and

15
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,760
commodification you know certainly

16
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,640
investing or over investing right now in

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:40,769
your infrastructure is probably a dicey

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,329
way to look at it especially when people

19
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,539
right now aren't you know incrementally

20
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,920
building - as you know supply matches

21
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,840
demand you're not sort of working the

22
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,950
equilibrium curve up when you're

23
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,600
thinking about from the standpoint of a

24
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,420
lot of these newer markets and Canada's

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,579
a prime example they're all trying to

26
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,890
you know race past to be the biggest

27
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,480
operator California is a prime example

28
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:02,250
where you know called a year from now

29
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,419
you know even though there's a dearth of

30
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,400
available product in the marketplace

31
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,560
there's about to be such an oversupply

32
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,030
and when that happens you know this

33
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,379
price compression happened in our own

34
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,790
son you're gonna look at this investment

35
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:13,679
you made into expensive means some

36
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,439
production and kick yourself for it yeah

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,549
and it's inevitable but the guys that I

38
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:19,289
really think about this and in a

39
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,090
meaningful and smart way or saying okay

40
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,280
let's only build what we know we can

41
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,509
sell through then let's take a look at

42
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,129
it and say okay do we have a customer

43
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,420
base whether its distribution you know

44
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:28,709
companies that want more product or

45
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,629
directly store accounts a lot more

46
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:32,399
product and can we build you know our

47
00:01:30,629 --> 00:01:34,199
infrastructure so we're not the the

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,180
expensive guys you know can we actually

49
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,060
build it so we're you know producing at

50
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,170
a really low cost per gram and if you

51
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,840
are then you're probably thinking about

52
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,820
this the right way but the second part

53
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:52,079
of your his question was with relation

54
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:54,750
to falling commodity prices basically

55
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:57,839
creating brand and brand equity is the

56
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,938
safer play yeah so then it's like you

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,829
know are you a real estate doing a real

58
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:05,069
estate play are you doing a brand play

59
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:08,579
because I know I talked to the chairman

60
00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:09,750
of a very large well-known brand who is

61
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,430
basically talking about we're just

62
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,159
trying as hard as we can to build our

63
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:17,550
brand and and not get distracted in

64
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,469
other parts of the market because of and

65
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:20,910
then they're creating the CBD only line

66
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:22,979
of their products so that they can be

67
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:25,680
national right so they can be in

68
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:28,169
California with the THC they can slowly

69
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,500
go into other markets you know market by

70
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:33,568
market but with CBD with their brand

71
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,419
name they can be basically a global

72
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:38,369
brand like a Nabisco a Kraft coca-cola

73
00:02:36,419 --> 00:02:39,479
whatever yeah and there's certainly a

74
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:40,860
lot of people are trying to do the dual

75
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,079
use with that because they think they

76
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,510
can get in the the Whole Foods is in the

77
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,370
GN C's and none of the other shops with

78
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:48,449
their CBD brands so the brands recognize

79
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,920
well know when people walk into a

80
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:52,049
dispensary they recognize the same thing

81
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:53,969
for their flower brand or their consumer

82
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,500
branded product side and so without a

83
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:57,628
doubt you know I think long term that

84
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,489
brand equity is is really going to be

85
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:00,840
important I think everyone right now is

86
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:03,689
identifying that as kind of the next

87
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,310
frontier of you know how do i how do I

88
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:06,449
make sure I've got longevity in this

89
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,219
space and it's not going to be from

90
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:09,479
something that just has downward

91
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:12,750
pressure on the whole time because of an

92
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,799
oversupply but having said that I'm a

93
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,449
firm believer that there's gonna be

94
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,739
boutique craft canvassed suppliers that

95
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:17,969
will always hold price the same way

96
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,360
there is you know fine wine and fine

97
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:22,889
Coffee fine cigars you're gonna have you

98
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,319
know the discount brands that largely

99
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:27,598
will be our discount producers I'll

100
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:28,560
largely be for extraction and then

101
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:29,878
you'll have some really high-end

102
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,969
producers I think that will hold price

103
00:03:29,878 --> 00:03:33,959
and they'll be brands themselves I mean

104
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:36,060
regardless of whether or not the the

105
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,459
flower market goes from you know call

106
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,469
40% of the market today down to

107
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,439
ultimately like 15 to 18 percent of the

108
00:03:40,469 --> 00:03:45,180
market you know at maturity that's still

109
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,639
a large portion of what's gonna be you

110
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,439
know a 70 or 80 billion dollar-a-year

111
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,419
industry so if you think that you know

112
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,789
15 billion a year is still represented

113
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:56,458
by flower you know not everyone's gonna

114
00:03:53,789 --> 00:03:57,539
get crushed and you know the commodity

115
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,860
that we're talking about still the

116
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:01,859
backbone the powers of the rest of the

117
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,230
industry so it's it's not only about

118
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,849
brand equity it's also about you know

119
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:08,878
cost production quality of production

120
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:10,619
and ultimately I think I think we

121
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,149
touched in this lesson we spoke as well

122
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,890
is what happens when federal

123
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:15,360
legalization happens and then you know

124
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:16,709
when you talk about the over building of

125
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,840
infrastructure that's going on in all

126
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,220
these other places in my mind to every

127
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,829
state that doesn't have a great climate

128
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,060
for growing is over supplying or

129
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:25,079
overpaying for their infrastructure

130
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,560
because ultimately I

131
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:30,930
it's um you know unnecessary like I'll

132
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,449
never five years from now buy cannabis

133
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,400
that's grown in in in Illinois I'll

134
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:38,009
never buy cannabis that's grown in you

135
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:40,109
know Minnesota ultimately the place

136
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:41,370
that's gonna power the cannabis market

137
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,319
for the United States from a flower

138
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,569
perspective here and fairly inputs going

139
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,158
into every other brand as can be the

140
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:49,110
lowest cost highest quality production

141
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:50,310
largely that's gonna be California maybe

142
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,069
a little bit of Oregon a little bit of

143
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:54,569
Washington some Arizona but for the most

144
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:56,819
part it's gonna be stable climates with

145
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:58,650
tons of sunlight with great you know

146
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:00,090
without much high humidity which rules

147
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:01,918
out the majority of East Coast it's

148
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:05,598
really gonna be you know what's the best

149
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,598
place to fun and that's here

150
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,730
you

151
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,259
