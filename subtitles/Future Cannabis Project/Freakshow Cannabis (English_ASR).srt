it's kind of perfect right now

33
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,199
yeah there's a little bit of um wildfire

34
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,240
going on

35
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,640
so oh wow

36
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,839
there's a little bit of smoke smoky haze

37
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,040
in the air

38
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,759
around us we have a hat a half canned

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,880
jar of peach jam on the table and i love

40
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,118
it you got you got

41
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:01,359
yeah you're uh this is all from the

42
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:05,680
garden you got some

43
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,680
some flowers some peaches you're

44
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,199
making some jam does everybody get to go

45
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,959
home with jam at the end of the day

46
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,199
that was my plan i still have to talk to

47
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:20,000
my wife about it though

48
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:20,000
so you grew up

49
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:27,439
a bunch of different uh

50
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:29,520
freak show plants and now

51
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,560
so so you've harvested so does that

52
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:37,439
imply you did a light depth

53
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:40,080
uh so

54
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:42,318
these um these different freak show

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,519
phenotypes this is an f7

56
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:48,639
f7 and uh

57
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,840
they're these are

58
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,759
are obviously seem very fresh and nice

59
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,519
so this was this like light yeah i just

60
00:02:53,759 --> 00:03:00,079
got them and they're disturbing

61
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,080
right now they're beautiful some of them

62
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:05,120
the minute i was able to get it yeah so

63
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,400
i'm gonna cure it

64
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,680
later so these are these beautiful

65
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:15,439
uh freak show seeds

66
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,719
and they as as the plant is

67
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,959
they are very unique and

68
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,000
they often they remind me a lot of

69
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,400
korean

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,439
um i don't know if folks know but if

71
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,480
you've ever grown

72
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:34,318
cilantro and and had it uh

73
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:38,158
go to flower that yeah hold on

74
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:42,719
actually give me one second

75
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:46,239
because i got my uh zipper

76
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:48,479
you've got some coriander there so here

77
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,439
here are freak show seeds and we can

78
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,798
compare

79
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:56,158
so that people can see the

80
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,438
the likeness of the freakshow meat and

81
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:02,798
the coriander seed

82
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:04,318
because jordan tell me if you agree but

83
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,680
i also feel that they

84
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:10,958
that these freak show seeds are

85
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,640
more rounded than

86
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:18,160
cannabis seeds

87
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:21,199
you know and people always say to us

88
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,680
they're immature and they kind of get

89
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,520
upset

90
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,680
sometimes when they first get their

91
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:29,198
freak show seed packed

92
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,840
and and we've tried a number of times

93
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,478
to explain in fact jordan even made a

94
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:37,279
video that kind of shows

95
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:40,719
that yeah there's a but but they're

96
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:44,399
always like this no matter how

97
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,639
long we let them mature on the vine

98
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,000
there's no way that you can get them to

99
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,840
be

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:57,040
uh darker or you know to look

101
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,039
differently this will show us right

102
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,600
[Music]

103
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,839
one second

104
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:29,280
okay so what is that so these ones

105
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:33,199
still have the the very skin

106
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:36,239
shroud it's sort of a it's a paper thin

107
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,960
uh coating that that cannabis seeds have

108
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,560
that are

109
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,159
you know it's it's where the tiger

110
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,918
stripes often

111
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,199
are found on cannabis seeds and and

112
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:50,399
about freak show seeds that's different

113
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,439
is that that that coating

114
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,719
that gives them their unique look uh the

115
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,759
different tiger stride

116
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,319
patterns the model looks of all

117
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,400
different types of cannabis seeds

118
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,439
the thing about freak show is that that

119
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,478
that

120
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:10,560
shroud is actually thinner

121
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:14,560
and detached so it it is more readily

122
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:18,160
brushed off by the seed sorting process

123
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,959
and and it doesn't uh weaken the seed or

124
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,240
damage

125
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:24,079
the actual viability of the seed at all

126
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,680
but it does certainly make it look

127
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,719
different and i would say

128
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,840
more like coriander right

129
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,600
say hi sure we've got a few different

130

well we were it might grow magazine but

144
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,918
we're uh

145
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,598
ideally yeah we were doing i was doing

146
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,639
some uh

147
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:19,598
it was raspberry parfait

148
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,598
yeah there's the last one i did for

149
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:24,000
grove magazine

150
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,719
hey there we go so we're doing a stack

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,598
spin of uh some raspberry parfaits and

152
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,240
seeds

153
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,719
down inside like actually still in the

154
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,160
plant

155
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,919
so um should be super cool i

156
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,280
haven't processed it down yet but it was

157
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,560
like

158
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:42,159
shooting started at like nine or ten

159
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,120
o'clock at night it was shooting until

160
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,160
uh

161
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,160
about five in the morning

162
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,120
so it was an all night shoot and what

163
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,840
was the reason why you did it at night

164
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,840
uh well so it we did it at night so it

165
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:59,918
was uh not super hot

166
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:00,878
uh it had to go all night because it's

167
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,240
basically

168
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,800
it's i don't know the total of pictures

169
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,038
like

170
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,720
crunch numbers but it was probably like

171
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,918
8 000 pictures

172
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,120
um because we're doing it's a 360 so the

173
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:16,159
camera will move

174
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,759
0.5 degrees between each shot

175
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,800
and then uh at each stage it's basically

176
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,160
taking

177
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,400
uh 55 different pictures for this one

178
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,960
so i can stack it together and get more

179
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,799
depth out of uh out of the frame

180
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,399
and and what are you shooting on are you

181
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,560
shooting on like uh

182
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,599
like a cannon with a hundred millimeter

183
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:41,038
lens or what what's the rig

184
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,759
uh yeah this one is it's a canon 5d sr

185
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,039
so 50 megapixels uh shooting with the

186
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:48,559
the canon mpe

187
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:52,079
65 millimeter uh dedicated map

188
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:54,559
1x to 5x um and that one last night it

189
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,040
was at about two and a half x

190
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,159
were you taking the pictures out in the

191
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,599
field or or just

192
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:04,480
inside with like a perfect uh setup like

193
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,040
a controlled environment or

194
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,440
yeah controlled environment yeah we uh

195
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,240
we took over the uh the document storage

196
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,440
closet

197
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,560
uh here on the farm and

198
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,279
uh and set up the rig in there um so we

199
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,479
can

200
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:23,759
control the uh the wind any airflow

201
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,639
ideally any vibration um

202
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,919
and uh yeah so we take take the stock

203
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,199
out of the garden

204
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:31,360
put it in there so we control the

205
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,320
environment the lighting um

206
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,600
and control yeah try and control

207
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,200
everything

208
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,200
almost controlled it tickled bummer

209
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,200
so and you did i mean that that's the

210
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,240
the cover of grow magazine with freak

211
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,480
show on it

212
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,278
so talk about um like it's obviously a

213
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,480
unique and

214
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:57,039
interesting plant like talk about

215
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,278
freak show but also just talk about some

216
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:02,078
other

217
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:02,720
you know interesting plants you've come

218
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:06,559
across

219
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,879
in your journeys of macro photography

220
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,518
or photography in general because some

221
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,679
of this stuff's not macro but

222
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,360
yeah well i mean just i mean interesting

223
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,599
plants you've met

224
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,440
free show's the craziest looking as far

225
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,399
as leaf morphology goes

226
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,200
but when you get up close on freak show

227
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,159
it's still

228
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,160
just you know trichomes everywhere yes

229
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,120
but it's you know it's just a standard

230
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,480
cannabis plant when you get up close on

231
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,679
it it's just a different

232
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,079
shape um which is super fascinating to

233
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,838
me

234
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:45,519
um and then as far as like

235
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,959
weird weird unique interesting plants um

236
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,959
a lot of the purple stuff i've been

237
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,439
shooting lately with the

238
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,958
pinks inside the trichome heads super

239
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,560
fascinated by that

240
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,958
um it's kind of a rare trait that

241
00:10:54,559 --> 00:11:01,119
doesn't really pop up too often

242
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:04,639
but uh that was on the uh the star pupil

243
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,959
i was shooting there and uh yeah just

244
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,078
anything super unique i'm like drawn

245
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,039
towards so i want to

246
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:13,838
want to shoot some more of uh the

247
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:13,838
freakshop you know

248
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,879
super tasty ones that we've been trying

249
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,559
over the weekend here

250
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:24,159
when you've done close-ups of the

251
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:26,078
trichomes is is it

252
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:30,639
different or is it just kind of similar

253
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,639
to other like at that close-up level

254
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,278
yeah well yeah we're going to catch all

255
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,278
of that we have

256
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:39,120
i have been hearing some stories of some

257
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,360
crazy trichome stuff that's going on on

258
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,320
the pre-shows uh

259
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,839
at shapeshifters farm but uh i haven't

260
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,320
shot him yet so that's that's gonna

261
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,000
happen this later this year but uh

262
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,399
as far as the macros of the freakshow

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
i've done so far the trichomes look

264
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,919
the same they're pretty much standard um

265
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,759
just normal normal looking strikes which

266
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,319
is pretty much standard across all

267
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,679
cannabis

268
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,600
it's just some have like longer stocks

269
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,519
or thicker stocks or

270
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,839
smaller heads bigger heads different

271
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,839
colors going on

272
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:19,120
i did recently photograph um a mac one

273
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,720
uh strain and um i found on this one

274
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,519
particular cut

275
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,560
a it's almost like a snailed eyed

276
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,360
trichome i have

277
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,078
no idea if this will come through if you

278
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,600
can see it

279
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:34,239
in the middle or not yeah yeah so you

280
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:37,519
see that one right in the middle

281
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,120
yeah it's like a snake tongue

282
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,879
yeah and then on the same exact plant

283
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,159
i found this other section this is gonna

284
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,200
be a little harder to see because it's a

285
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,639
little

286
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:53,120
bit darker yeah

287
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:57,360
um but there's just like this wild

288
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,360
looking trichome formation

289
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,278
and actually when you start looking

290
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,879
around more and more

291
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:07,759
into this frame there's like

292
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,919
you know double-headed ones next to

293
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,278
triple headed ones

294
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:16,399
next to real fat stocks

295
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:18,799
next to this other weird looking droopy

296
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,000
one down in the corner

297
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:24,958
and this was like very recent work um

298
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,958
not even published i just captured it

299
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:30,638
just a couple weeks ago actually

300
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:33,679
um so i have that cut drying

301
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,519
and then i'll revisit it um as

302
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,278
it's finished and see like what those

303
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,959
trek homes look like there

304
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,399
that's probably the weirdest thing i've

305
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,679
seen yeah that's definitely i've never

306
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,000
seen anything like that

307
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,679
like i've seen double headed trichomes

308
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,039
and double stock strike them but

309
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:52,479
that thing is a straight mutation

310
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:55,519
and like the the cola of the flower

311
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,039
also didn't look like normal

312
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,879
i i don't know really how to describe

313
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,559
did i show you pictures i don't have any

314
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,198
pictures of it with me

315
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,239
but it didn't have like the traditional

316
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:08,240
type of like uh

317
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:12,159
christmas tree cone top it was more like

318
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,839
weird sugary kind of swirly formations

319
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:17,278
and stuff on there so

320
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,920
weird pretty interesting stuff

321
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,399
when you talk i mean because i know like

322
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:22,799
you know

323
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,919
hash makers look for certain things in

324
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,278
the trichome

325
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:29,679
so what like

326
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,679
when you when you do a macro of kind of

327
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,239
a hashy

328
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,719
plant that's desirable to hash makers

329
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,240
kind of

330
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,160
what are you noticing that's different

331
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,159
than something that

332
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,000
maybe would be the opposite where

333
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:45,519
they're like that's not really what i'm

334
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,198
looking for

335
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:52,720
i mean so i i don't know i

336
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,519
i'm not a hashmaker i have a rudimentary

337
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,440
understanding

338
00:14:53,519 --> 00:15:00,240
i mean i i don't know

339
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,560
i haven't noticed a ton of differences

340
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,360
like if you shoot a classically

341
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,078
hash strain versus a non-hash strain as

342
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,919
far as

343
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:12,559
like what the trichomes look like um

344
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,519
classic hashtags usually have like a lot

345
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,879
more trichomes

346
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,519
on them um and another thing a lot of

347
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,679
people

348
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,679
that i've heard search for is short

349
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:24,958
stocks

350
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:26,879
but as far as like just if you took a

351
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,239
two macros and one's a hash train and

352
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,399
one's not a hash strain

353
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,079
i don't think you'd be able to tell the

354
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,000
difference by looking at the

355
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:38,719
actual heads themselves but i don't know

356
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,399
that's an interesting one i i think

357
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,000
something that

358
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:47,679
uh probably is hard to sort of like

359
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,720
quantify about hash making

360
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:54,000
is how easily the

361
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:58,720
the stalks will break off and allow

362
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,679
the bulbous trichome head to

363
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,320
sort of detach because a lot of you know

364
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,519
what you

365
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,959
see in think of like the full metal hash

366
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,639
and the really light colored

367
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:16,159
hatch that's you know off uh

368
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,480
you know live live bubble hash basically

369
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,919
or

370
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:23,039
fresh frozen bubble hatch

371
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,439
those those are really not

372
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,159
a lot of stalk material it's really just

373
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,120
the head

374
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,078
that you're capturing and so i think

375
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,360
that's a factor

376
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:36,078
of like what makes a good uh

377
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,039
strain that sort of just dumps trichome

378
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,359
heads

379
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,480
is takes a good half strain there's

380
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,120
another thing

381
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,240
called the uh that started starting to

382
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,480
pop up recently

383
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,440
and another photographer schwall is the

384
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,920
one that kind of

385
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,720
spotted it but uh he calls it the weak

386
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,319
neck

387
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,639
trichome and if you try going from the

388
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,320
direct side you can kind of see the head

389
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,639
is like

390
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,839
up off of the stock a little bit and you

391
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,000
can see this like really it's like a one

392
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,600
cell

393
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,838
kind of attachment point you can just

394
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,558
clearly see it's just barely hanging on

395
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,759
yeah it's gonna snap off yeah with

396
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,399
little effort

397
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,279
ideally you want to snap it off but the

398
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,439
to be able to

399
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,879
see a trichome from exactly that angle

400
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,720
is really tough so if you

401
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,079
shoot a whole leaf and you've got

402
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,519
hundreds of trichomes

403
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:28,798
in the frame you know maybe

404
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,440
10 or 15 will be at that exact side

405
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,359
angle

406
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,558
or maybe potentially a little bit more

407
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,918
but

408
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:37,599
yeah and then also um

409
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,038
just like the thickness of the gland

410
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,038
it's a little i think

411
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,879
challenging to see like through pictures

412
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,319
but yeah you definitely notice like when

413
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,840
you break up different

414
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:49,359
um cultivars with if the weed feels like

415
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,399
sticky or greasy

416
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,959
or like more powdery and sandy yeah and

417
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,160
then

418
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,319
that ideal for right patch making

419
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,519
um if the head's more resilient it's

420
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:01,599
gonna survive the

421
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:03,200
process a lot but you don't want to be

422
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,839
too thick because then there'd be less

423
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,798
total cannabinoids within the gland like

424
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:08,720
the thickness of

425
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:10,558
that's like a conversation i've had with

426
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,240
extractors i've heard that conversation

427
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,079
too but i don't know if it's like i

428
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,480
literally heard it on a podcast driving

429
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,839
up here i don't know i didn't fully

430
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,279
agree with it because

431
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,079
it's there's so much resin and it's just

432
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:24,798
a small

433
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,240
so tiny yeah it's gonna be super thin i

434
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,558
don't think it's taking away

435
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,640
that much resin if the head's thicker

436
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:33,038
but then again i have no idea

437
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,120
danielson and mr miyagi debated the same

438
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:35,119
thing

439
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:42,400
so so peter i'm really glad that you you

440
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,000
know

441
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:49,519
caught us here on this very laid-back

442
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,440
casual uh meeting of the mines up here

443
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:55,918
at our anchor farm in eastern humble

444
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,880
um this is where humboldt seed company

445
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,240
really

446
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:04,160
you know got going and uh

447
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,798
it's it's awesome to have shapeshifter

448
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,279
who created the freak show strain here

449
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:11,200
and these amazing photographers

450
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,319
and then we've got the guys from grow

451
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,440
magazine

452
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:18,319
who are you know this is eric's

453
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,400
photography right here on on the cover

454
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:25,599
of the magazine and of course the

455
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,360
yeah the famous freakshow

456
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,759
but here are the guys just to give you

457
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:34,159
an idea of what we're up to

458
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,160
we've been oh that's just gorgeous

459
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:41,678
look at that look at that center fold

460
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:41,678
oh yeah we gotta anger

461
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:48,290
[Laughter]

462
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,279
pretty cool well it's it takes uh a

463
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,480
village

464
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:58,558
and and so guy here is is working on

465
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,440
some freak show right now

466
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:03,279
actually and this is the mountain the

467
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,558
mountain cabin

468
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:10,240
that is a humboldt seed company uh

469
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:10,240
kind of headquartered whatever

470
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,400
so so so is he getting that ready to

471
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,280
roll a bunch of joints that you guys are

472
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,159
gonna smoke or

473
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:20,000
what's he uh prepping for we're also

474
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,120
getting all of the seeds so here's

475
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,919
pk and it's basically it's a taste

476
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,959
go ahead you tell them it's a taste test

477
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,120
yeah um

478
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,120
i got all of them sitting here seeded

479
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,000
and i did a bunch of fingers light

480
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,439
seeded so

481
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,038
we could still taste it uh so it sends a

482
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,720
meal with the light seed

483
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:43,119
to it and we have it um and we're gonna

484
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,400
i've narrowed this down to these five

485
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,759
and

486
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,159
there you go that's our job today is you

487
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:52,480
know

488
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,480
i'm using these guys as guinea pigs

489
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:57,678
so so talk about kind of the subtle

490
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,559
differences between the five

491
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,280
uh you know the only major difference is

492
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:06,158
the terpenes and just the flavor

493
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,599
because i nailed down actually locked in

494
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,039
a whole bunch of other

495
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:14,798
qualities with freakshow um just nailing

496
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:16,879
the leaf morphology right off the get-go

497
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,558
you know i didn't expect anything to be

498
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,159
stable in other ways but

499
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,319
yeah i've gotten to the point in my

500
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,080
breeding where i'll go ahead

501
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,240
and uh try to nail two or three

502
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,038
qualities just in one reading but that's

503
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,759
why

504
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:32,079
i started out with 120 phoenix uh

505
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,679
recently and then i i doubled out my

506
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,759
choice of 30

507
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,280
and we've narrowed it down to five here

508
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:40,158
now so

509
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,599
uh there you go that's our job now is to

510
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,720
go outside and uh

511
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:48,000
spark it up so awesome nat nat

512
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,720
can can we can we uh can you lend your

513
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,759
your uh palette can you can you take a

514
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,120
whiff of one of those and tell me uh

515
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:59,440
i have to describe it i've been loving

516
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,719
like the number 29 it's one that i've

517
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,798
been really

518
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,798
digging uh i don't know if you can see

519
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:07,440
this but i've already kind of gave

520
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:09,279
them little preliminary judgments you

521
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,919
know when i was

522
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,599
first throwing them in the bag and uh

523
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,240
some of them didn't make the cut i'm

524
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,759
like well

525
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,200
i'm not interested in you and but yeah

526
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,200
these these last five

527
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,120
are gonna get uh kind of go on the

528
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,319
market limited maybe two right now

529
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:29,839
yeah well you know basically the i

530
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:33,599
the criteria of course

531
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:37,519
for uh freak show

532
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:40,558
you know it's most well known for its

533
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:43,200
amazing and very unique leaf

534
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:43,839
shape but what a lot of people don't

535
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,519
realize

536
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:50,639
is that there are some incredibly unique

537
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:54,000
uh and original tri um

538
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,640
turpins that that freaks

539
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,159
the freak show strain actually produces

540
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,520
very

541
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:04,640
unique terpenes and so

542
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:08,720
now we kind of feel like our next job

543
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:12,080
or you know is really getting

544
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,240
what we consider to be the most

545
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:16,399
powerful terp and the most pleasant

546
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,960
turpin

547
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,080
well so so what are some of the unique

548
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,240
terpenes because i know

549
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:24,079
jordan when we spoke the other day i

550
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,519
mean not not in freak show

551
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,359
but you were talking about something you

552
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,599
smoked a long time ago

553
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:31,038
that i believe was thai that had like a

554
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:34,000
distinct chocolate

555
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:36,158
smell to it that you know is just not

556
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,480
something you can find now

557
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:43,200
um so what what's kind of the unique

558
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,759
terpene profile i mean have you isolated

559
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,919
what that

560
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,200
terpene or those that combination of

561
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,240
terpenes are

562
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,679
that give it its uniqueness yeah i was

563
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,480
telling that a while ago

564
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,400
that um like this generation is where

565
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,919
i'm kind of pulling together all of the

566
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,840
flavors i mean

567
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,278
no one could really nail it down to one

568
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,599
and we don't want to do that anyway

569
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:03,359
because

570
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,798
everybody kind of likes a different goal

571
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,359
of things and

572
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,599
the honest truth on this is i i probably

573
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,038
have 50 different types of freak show

574
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,199
right now because

575
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:15,440
that's how i am and that's how i do it

576
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,159
and i don't want to limit myself or

577
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,120
bottleneck

578
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,240
things and and just the fact that freak

579
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:24,000
show has such an

580
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,079
unlimited like ability to morph just

581
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,038
so it's i mean i'm going in different

582
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,319
directions on

583
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:31,119
leaf morphologies what he's asking is

584
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,839
the flavors

585
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,278
okay the original which we also have

586
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,959
here the holy express

587
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:38,480
which is one of the parent stock the

588
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,038
other ones uh

589
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,640
the holy express was the original and i

590
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:45,119
have that here

591
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,200
and so this is like three generations

592
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,038
deep on a sesquiterpene line that i'm

593
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,319
looking at the kind that hangs in your

594
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,319
sinuses

595
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,399
as you're walking out the door and you

596
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:56,480
get busy because it's sativa and it got

597
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,720
you out of your chair and you're jamming

598
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,558
and you're like still smelling it in

599
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,720
your head well

600
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:05,119
to me that's one of the most rarest kind

601
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,000
of genes that's been getting knocked out

602
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,199
in the last you know 20 years of time

603
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,200
and you know there's still

604
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,640
really nice melon wheat out there

605
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,278
there's all kinds of

606
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,799
fairly tasty way but it all seems to be

607
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:19,278
getting kind of homogenous

608
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,119
well i'm going back to those ones that

609
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,759
remind me of the old days

610
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:26,798
when an old dude says man that takes me

611
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:29,759
right back to 1968 or something you know

612
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:32,000
what imported we that have that really

613
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,158
weird smell up the house too

614
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,240
it's all about the quote sativa the

615
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,720
narrow leaf drug tropical

616
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,319
has always been my bag and you know

617
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,480
everyone's like

618
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:45,278
you know against me like people almost

619
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,660
like hate sativa for all these years

620
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:50,558
it's really true but wow

621
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:52,640
[Laughter]

622
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:54,079
are are you in a room full of haters

623
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,919
right now

624
00:25:54,079 --> 00:26:01,119
no no the times have changed and i don't

625
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,120
hate indicate anymore

626
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:08,079
yeah we're you know one thing peter

627
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,679
that's been really interesting

628
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:15,359
about having like the honor

629
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:20,080
of being the group that got to

630
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:24,240
you know sort of mass produced and

631
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:28,000
and come come forward with shapeshifters

632
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,240
wonderful creation has been

633
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,159
getting to kind of see how many

634
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:36,159
interesting different reactions

635
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:39,520
and one of the things that i

636
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,520
i started noticing was the people that

637
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,918
reacted kind of negatively and were

638
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:47,278
almost offended by

639
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:50,559
you know this totally different

640
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:53,759
cannabis that is still cannabis but it's

641
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:56,639
it's a hundred percent different

642
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:57,200
uh a lot of people that were i think

643
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,278
just

644
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,798
new to cannabis in general or at least

645
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:05,278
new to trying to grow

646
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:07,440
it um kind of thought to themselves

647
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:09,599
well you know these guys are out there

648
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,200
changing it before i even have a chance

649
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:14,319
to

650
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,960
and what they don't realize is we're not

651
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:17,359
changing anything we're just expanding

652
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,960
on

653
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:23,278
something and you know making it

654
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,399
more interesting and and kind of more

655
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,440
unique so

656
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:31,359
i think people that it seemed to be

657
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:35,440
consistent that like experienced

658
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:38,079
growers loved it and wanted to

659
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,840
try it as soon as they could and then

660
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,639
some of the people that were just

661
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:43,918
maybe growing their first plant were

662
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,919
like

663
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,520
why do you have to create something that

664
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,320
looks so different you know

665
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:52,960
like we just want it to look like a

666
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:55,278
normal pot leaf

667
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,240
people were actually like offended by it

668
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:59,519
and and

669
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,159
we i had to remind them that a this is

670
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,278
not

671
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:06,480
genetically modified uh ever

672
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:09,038
never it is modified by me well but

673
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,480
but not the traditional sense of genetic

674
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:13,839
modification where you're

675
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,558
not slicing genes so we're not

676
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:17,759
we're not splicing genes from

677
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:21,038
methodicals

678
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:24,240
we're not gene editing we're not uh

679
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:26,879
splicing genes or you know

680
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,679
we're not using crispr we're not using

681
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,120
any of that

682
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,720
technology this is just simply a natural

683
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:35,759
mutation that occurred

684
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,839
and and of course mutations are

685
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:41,440
responsible for

686
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:44,319
all evolution and so we wouldn't

687
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,440
be the human beings that we are today

688
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:49,839
without

689
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:52,960
many many millennia of of mutation

690
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:56,480
you know giving us an opposable thumb

691
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:59,120
and giving us all these like

692
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,599
advantages and potentially disadvantages

693
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:03,278
and then

694
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:06,319
letting you know natural selection uh

695
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:11,200
work that out and of course you know

696
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:14,798
this new and amazing kind of cannabis

697
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:18,080
is no threat like people don't need to

698
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:21,038
be threatened that all of a sudden all

699
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:22,240
cannabis is gonna look really weird

700
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,839
because

701
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,839
hold on are they threatened by wedding

702
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:27,839
cake

703
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:31,678
i i i would come at it from a totally

704
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:35,839
different direction

705
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:40,080
i think it it it looks like a

706
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:43,839
fern which from a plant

707
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:46,158
you know i'm not a an expert in plants

708
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:46,798
but i know the fern was kind of the link

709
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,080
but

710
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:52,398
it was like the first plant correct uh

711
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:54,639
and then all other plants you know the

712
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:58,879
fern's been around for

713
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:02,240
uh what 400 million years

714
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:05,360
um and and to me

715
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:08,480
that that this thing visually

716
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:09,839
looks like a connection not to something

717
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,440
weird and new and different

718
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,439
but literally to the past

719
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,399
that's why i'm saying i would look at it

720
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:21,440
inversely and say it's not this new

721
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:24,158
bastardized thing it's something that

722
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,278
again and it's it's visual but it it's a

723
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,600
reminder

724
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:32,960
of where plants came from in my mind

725
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:36,079
right and that and that's cool

726
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:38,960
i mean as i think and i'm sure maybe

727
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:40,398
i i could be a little bit off on this

728
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,840
but i think

729
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:47,439
even humans and and plants

730
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:52,240
we share like 75 of the same

731
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:55,200
dna and that's how of course

732
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,640
you know similar we we all are so i'm

733
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,600
sure that

734
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,720
yes freak show was related to a fern or

735
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:04,240
is in some

736
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,240
cosmic way but but the reality

737
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,640
is just to answer some of the basic

738
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,759
questions it

739
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,640
it is a natural occurrence the the freak

740
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:15,759
show strain

741
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,000
it's very different and it does have

742
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,038
what i would consider to be some really

743
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,038
unique

744
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:23,359
and unusual turbines would you guys

745
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:23,359
agree

746
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,558
and you know these guys trap you know

747
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,839
they

748
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:32,079
have photographed thousands of cannabis

749
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:33,759
strains and

750
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:35,278
uh you know so the turpins are really

751
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:36,240
unique and i think that there's a lot of

752
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,278
really

753
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:43,440
incredibly unique things and what i

754
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:47,200
really uh applaud

755
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:51,679
shapeshifter for

756
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:55,120
hit the fact that he did not discard

757
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:59,360
this unique plant

758
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:59,359
the fact that he was able to say

759
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:05,678
you know the fact that he saw the

760
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,720
potential of it

761
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:11,200
as he was developing it and

762
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,919
i mean i know i've i've been a breeder

763
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,759
here in

764
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:18,799
in humboldt for well over 20 years and

765
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:20,960
i've thrown away not

766
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:22,240
things like this but i've thrown away

767
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,240
things that didn't

768
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:30,480
fit the the normal criteria

769
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:33,919
that i expect you know our community to

770
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:37,038
to want and

771
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:40,399
and in retrospect

772
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:42,640
i you know probably threw away some

773
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:44,639
things that could have been amazing

774
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,000
but historically those anomalies were

775
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,519
scary in some sense

776
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,398
like i don't want to waste time or money

777
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:53,759
on that right well it's kind of a new

778
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:56,959
uh you know with the stigmas around

779
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:57,519
cannabis uh thankfully kind of melting

780
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,960
away

781
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:05,000
a lot recently it there is

782
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:07,600
more room for diversity and for more

783
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,558
experimentation and for more

784
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,678
research and you know amazingly the way

785
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,158
to get the diversity

786
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,720
back is going to be the line breed you

787
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,760
know in

788
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,399
all these separate directions uh

789
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:22,079
before it all gets so homogenized that

790
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,079
it's going to be super difficult to find

791
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:26,158
something unique and different

792
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:27,759
handedness and that's that's a lot of

793
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,880
how freakshow came about

794
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:32,879
is i was actually trying to nail a turd

795
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,039
you know like i said the sesquiterpene

796
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,039
uh the level that this one

797
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:39,440
some of the parents dog had i was like

798
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:43,519
okay i really need to nail that

799
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,120
and uh it turns out that right when i'm

800
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,798
right when i'm nailing what i was

801
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:47,599
looking for in the way of turrets i'm

802
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,158
trying to

803
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:51,199
fix this once and for all and it's gonna

804
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,600
have diversity

805
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,038
it's gonna have five flavors that range

806
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,240
from fruity to gas

807
00:33:55,038 --> 00:34:00,558
to whatever uh but yet it was at that

808
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,640
point when i nailed it i'm like okay i'm

809
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:04,798
super interested in this kind of

810
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,000
that's i started seeing the anomalies in

811
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:09,039
it like the gator tooth

812
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,358
leaf was kind of the burst really

813
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:12,559
it caught my eye like crazy because i

814
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:14,719
remember seeing that

815
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:17,519
all the way back in the day when you

816
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:20,719
would get one seed out of the tie stick

817
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:23,440
and it was the waxy crazy

818
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:25,118
really dragon looking it was like dragon

819
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,320
tail and kind of i remember calling it

820
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,240
back in the day

821
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,960
real super skinny leaves with these

822
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,559
hooked uh serrations on them and when i

823
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,960
saw that i go holy shit

824
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,639
that's the thai weed in this we know

825
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,398
there's highways in it probably from the

826
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,559
big sir holy week

827
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:43,039
um and i i researched it also a

828
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:46,480
pineapple supposedly housed high

829
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:49,039
and uh so it turns out that the

830
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,679
origins of freak show are all related

831
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,719
already

832
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,639
and i think these things just happen

833
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:57,039
because i've been choosing for certain

834
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,680
uh for what i'm looking for all this

835
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,079
time

836
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,759
and there was always a lot of abnormal

837
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,920
abnormalities in it i mean

838
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,520
they've been there the whole time i

839
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,079
don't know why it crossed my mind like

840
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:07,519
okay

841
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,839
i'm just going to see where i can take

842
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:12,400
this just dedicate a little time

843
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:13,599
to go on go for the really crazy looking

844
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,639
weed so that it

845
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:19,760
it stands out and the plan

846
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:22,480
actually out did me um i eliminated the

847
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,280
regulatory genes completely

848
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,920
it's not just an indication it's a plant

849
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,519
that can

850
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,000
continue to mutate indefinitely you know

851
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:32,000
uh

852
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,358
and that's the interesting part for me

853
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,480
is now i can

854
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:38,719
zero in on one but like i said i have so

855
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,079
many different lines of it i've got bad

856
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,598
crosses of it

857
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,640
one thing i haven't done i have

858
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,559
outcrossed it um just for fun to

859
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,319
check it out and test dropped out and

860
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:52,000
there's no freaks in the first

861
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,599
f1 outcross on anything you thought then

862
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,599
people are going to be posting that

863
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,240
later going wow

864
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,519
no no freaks uh but i guess there are

865
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,118
some people that are saying they're

866
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:02,320
getting a certain percentage of freaks

867
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:05,200
out of that one

868
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,760
i'll cross it with whatever but uh in

869
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,439
general

870
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,920
what we want to see is for the whole

871
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,039
entire world to have pre-show where it's

872
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,639
mainstream

873
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,119
on the people that are against something

874
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:17,118
that cool huh

875
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,920
total corey ever when it's all backed up

876
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,960
like that it does look like cory

877
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,079
well you know i think we're all i i

878
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,320
would certainly hope

879
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,280
that we're all into having you know

880
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,480
cannabis become

881
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,880
more and more accessible you know but

882
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,920
and it's a medicine and people should be

883
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,119
able to

884
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,720
you know enjoy it and have it however

885
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,760
they want to have it it's a gosh

886
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:45,439
damn plant so what the hell i mean

887
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,520
it's we're all here for one reason or

888
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,000
another and definitely cannabis is here

889
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,119
for

890
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,280
i think a lot of good reasons but um

891
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,240
hey do you think that uh we should give

892
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,839
it a try and

893
00:36:54,239 --> 00:37:01,199
and go on a little uh field trip

894
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:03,679
up up to the cultivation area and

895
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,679
and look at some at some freak show and

896
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:08,480
look at some different stuff

897
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:10,078
let's do it and then just jordan quickly

898
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,358
because your roots were in the santa

899
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,920
cruz area right

900
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:16,159
and so you you mentioned holy express

901
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,280
and i was like that must be some sort of

902
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:22,879
big sur holy weed kind of family tree

903
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:26,560
so basically the lineage is is

904
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:29,599
stuff that you grew up with right i mean

905
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:33,199
big sur holy weed uh

906
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:35,280
and then you said pineapple express

907
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:37,279
yeah the all of it in there is all

908
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,000
sativa or sativa dominant

909
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,440
and we'll just say sativa but yeah the

910
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,760
uh

911
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,760
i wasn't able to find out what uh

912
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,640
holy baba what was it uh banana

913
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,440
kush i'm sorry the banana kush had kind

914
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:56,319
of had it yet

915
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,679
and after what it really was it wasn't

916
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,079
so but that's the only

917
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:01,519
kind of broadleaf afghanistan line that

918
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,119
has in it but

919
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:04,719
see now i've done i've done a lot of

920
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,280
breeding where i'll bring in

921
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:08,719
you know some some afghanica but then

922
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,240
i'll just choose back

923
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:14,959
for the sativa phenotype so now

924
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:15,759
you end up with a 50 50 hybrid that no

925
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,800
one can tell

926
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,720
from a super solar haze it's just

927
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,400
uh it's just a matter of taking it in

928
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:25,039
the direction you're trying to do

929
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,800
and after years and years and years of

930
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,358
that i finally got to where

931
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,640
it's not so much guesswork anymore and

932
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:32,880
the family of

933
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:34,639
the seed bank i have i know real well

934
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,960
like the back of my hand i mean

935
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:38,639
i can almost predict the outcome on

936
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,679
anything i do

937
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:43,279
but yeah i'm i'm a line breathing tool i

938
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:44,559
don't want to go into a big round about

939
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,440
it but uh

940
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:48,400
you know i it's it's working the line

941
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,838
breeding thing

942
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,760
back crossing's good uh yeah i did take

943
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:55,679
this one for a back cross ride

944
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,520
um i wanted to take it more to the

945
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:00,159
pineapple express direction

946
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:02,079
because that was the one that had so

947
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:04,799
many generations of what i was looking

948
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:04,800
for in lawyers

949
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,720
did you grow up in humboldt or where did

950
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,079
you grow up

951
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:15,679
uh no i was born in new york and

952
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:19,039
grew up um spent time in philly

953
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:20,159
the then moved to humboldt when i was 18

954
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:24,400
years old so i

955
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:29,199
got a high tail uh that was in 1995

956
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:32,320
and voted yes on prop 215

957
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:36,319
with our our our guy dennis carone

958
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:39,760
um who became a friend later on

959
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:41,559
that was my my first vote was voting yes

960
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,520
on prop 215

961
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:48,559
1996. and uh the rest is history i never

962
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:52,079
really like left humble

963
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:56,078
after that aside from you know visiting

964
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:58,320
family and uh taking a few vacations

965
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,640
a few work trips things like that well

966
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,200
where where i was going with that was to

967
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:05,598
ask if you had any kind of historical

968
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:08,078
historical experience with kind of big

969
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,680
cert like the big sir holy weeds back in

970
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:13,359
the day

971
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:16,879
yeah we've grown big sir

972
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:20,480
for a long time we've had different

973
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:25,680
cuts of it and seeds of it come up here

974
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:28,559
and and big sur was uh on my way

975
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:29,358
i went and snuck into on my way to

976
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,719
humboldt we

977
00:40:29,358 --> 00:40:36,400
we snuck into ethelon and like smoked

978
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:38,399
big sur holy weed uh in their hot tub

979
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,559
late in the middle of the night when we

980
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,318
were what was mojave was mojave in the

981
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:45,519
hot tub

982
00:40:42,318 --> 00:40:48,559
i don't remember i you know i've since

983
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:49,920
met but i don't remember if he was in

984
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:53,199
the hot tub

985
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,680
that night it was a blur you know it was

986
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:57,519
a long time ago and lots of things

987
00:40:55,679 --> 00:41:01,598
happened in hot tubs back then

988
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:04,239
you know so we've now

989
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,519
deseeded and twisted a bunch of these

990
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:07,519
selections

991
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:09,440
this one here is all i have to remember

992
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:12,239
is that i got number 53

993
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,480
and i hope it wins and like i said this

994
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:15,358
is

995
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,920
i said so you you have favorites already

996
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:20,960
53 is your favorite

997
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,519
oh no we're down to 67. we're starting

998
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,800
we're going to

999
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:27,759
start the smoke analysis the uh

1000
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,240
and we'll do lab testing as well but but

1001
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,280
we're

1002
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,239
we've been here this has always been the

1003
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,040
most reliable

1004
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,039
we got to test each

1005
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:42,000
yeah i like it and that is is this your

1006
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,639
commercial way of uh

1007
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,559
of separating seeds the the you get a

1008
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:51,920
team of free labor to hand pick them out

1009
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:54,480
no we when we do this

1010
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,760
like really we're having a relaxed

1011
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,760
laid-back

1012
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,920
weekend where we're working on the freak

1013
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,599
show strain and trying to

1014
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,000
do some phenotypic uh

1015
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:07,280
you know narrowing it down a little bit

1016
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,519
so that we have

1017
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,920
um a consistent turpin profile

1018
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:15,199
um not that it's not all they're not all

1019
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,480
great they're all

1020
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:22,639
great but um you know so part of that

1021
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:25,838
is uh you know the organic way

1022
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:26,239
of selecting and working on phenotypes

1023
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:30,078
is

1024
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:32,159
smoking and checking out the flowers and

1025
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:34,318
and preserving any seeds that might be

1026
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:34,799
in it normally we have a seed sorting

1027
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:36,960
machine

1028
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,839
that we run it through and we've got our

1029
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,639
seed

1030
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:43,279
distribution laboratory out on the coast

1031
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:45,199
so you guys are kind of really seeing

1032
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,720
kind of the way that we've always done

1033
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:50,719
it and our

1034
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:52,480
a more rootsy way of of what we do here

1035
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:53,838
at humboldt seed company and it's just

1036
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,838
so happened that there's

1037
00:42:53,838 --> 00:43:01,358
a bunch of homies are in the house so

1038
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:04,318
special uh moment i would say

1039
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:06,318
so so just the last question before we

1040
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:09,279
uh cut it off and regroup

1041
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:12,000
uh jordan when i talked to him the other

1042
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,920
day was talking about breeding indoors

1043
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,519
will not produce as good seeds as

1044
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,680
outdoors so can i get your

1045
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:20,639
both your perspectives on that about

1046
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:24,000
kind of

1047
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:26,480
well you know outdoors

1048
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,559
i i think everybody has their opinion

1049
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,000
and um

1050
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:34,159
i don't know if if that

1051
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,159
uh

1052
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,559
you'd have to ask him

1053
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:42,880
so you well then you guys have a

1054
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:46,719
different opinion right

1055
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:49,838
well i i just think that you know

1056
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:52,559
you get what you put into it and i i'm

1057
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:55,199
sure that there are some amazing

1058
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:56,719
uh indoor breeding facilities we have

1059
00:43:55,199 --> 00:44:00,639
indoor breeding facilities

1060
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:04,159
and outdoor and you know i think that

1061
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:07,440
selection is the most important thing

1062
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:10,719
um and you know

1063
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:14,159
so i do kind of feel like um

1064
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:16,799
if you're only selecting

1065
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:17,920
in one environment then that can be a

1066
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,760
little bit flawed

1067
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:24,159
but um you know

1068
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,440
i tell them about the uh we breed in

1069
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:28,799
both indoors and out

1070
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,440
and grow up yeah that points up

1071
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,240
so much stuff right away oh well i think

1072
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,838
what jordan's

1073
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:36,078
what he's referring to is just how

1074
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:39,119
different

1075
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,640
uh growing conditions because

1076
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,640
if if anyone's familiar with the

1077
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:45,598
grow-off competition

1078
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:47,920
everyone starts with with one with a

1079
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,000
clone of the exact same

1080
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,159
plan it was they all end up with the

1081
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,760
same bug the last two years

1082
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:59,118
it was the last two years it was uh

1083
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:01,119
that's why we do that cookies and

1084
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,720
then the next year they chose caramel

1085
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,079
cream from our strain

1086
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:10,159
or from one of our strains and

1087
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:12,880
both years the test results came back

1088
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:14,318
like and i'm not trying to point anybody

1089
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:17,440
fingers or call anybody

1090
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:19,679
out but there was thc level

1091
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,800
from the same exact cutting that went

1092
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:24,239
from 15

1093
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:27,519
thc all the way to 30 percent

1094
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:30,639
and turpin results that went from

1095
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:31,119
point seven percent all the way up to

1096
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:35,519
five

1097
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:38,559
point which is just almost a record

1098
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:39,920
uh for turpins and so it just goes to

1099
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:43,358
show

1100
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:46,720
how one single clone

1101
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:49,920
you know one clone propagated strain

1102
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:51,919
can you know come out so differently in

1103
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,318
in different locations and different

1104
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:57,838
same mom growing yeah from it was it was

1105
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,838
all from the same exact mom

1106
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,200
but anyway let's go out to the field and

1107
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:04,719
uh

1108
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:07,598
and see how things go all right

1109
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:09,279
we might if we lose wi-fi it just means

1110
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,640
that we're gonna have to sign into the

1111
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,640
other

1112
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:17,279
wi-fi that we have to maintain for um

1113
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:18,000
like metric purposes and things like

1114
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,480
that

1115
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,199
you you have a dead okay because it does

1116
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,280
that need to be

1117
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:24,960
up 100 or just when you're uploading

1118
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,800
data

1119
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:33,679
just when we're uploading data okay

1120
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:37,680
so this is our kitchen garden here

1121
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:41,679
some tomatoes coming in and

1122
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:45,279
yeah i'm looking at my tomatoes uh

1123
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:45,279
outside the garage right now

1124
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:51,279
and this is our little trail you guys

1125
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,280
coming

1126
00:46:52,000 --> 00:47:00,239
got some pretty sunflowers

1127
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:03,920
so is is is everything

1128
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:03,919
on your home property

1129
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:11,199
yeah we have um we have a dude

1130
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:14,880
like two different premise technically

1131
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:16,078
premises and this is the residential

1132
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,240
premise over here

1133
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:19,280
and and there's no cannabis stuff over

1134
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:23,118
here but then you

1135
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:26,400
go across this magic line

1136
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:28,960
oh that you even have a bridge

1137
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,760
little foot bridge what do you think so

1138
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,119
it's kind of a

1139
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,280
little cloudy day so so so

1140
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,480
so wait which number are you on what are

1141
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,040
you smoking

1142
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,920
one 67 and it's rolled with a fresh

1143
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:43,119
tobacco leaves

1144
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:46,559
oh sixty-five very nice so do you grow

1145
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:49,599
do you grow tobacco at home yes sir i do

1146
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,000
oh yeah there's almost nothing i don't

1147
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:53,920
grow

1148
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:56,079
uh you know really grow it all

1149
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,318
matter of fact my air those are a lot

1150
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:00,640
more important to me than freak show

1151
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:01,920
to be honest i mean they're both super

1152
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:03,440
interesting

1153
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:06,720
you have no idea what i've done with

1154
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,800
heirloom tomatoes

1155
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:09,919
i'll mess around with any genetics you

1156
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,119
know i used to do

1157
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,318
hybrid uh wolves for many years and that

1158
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:17,200
was interesting too

1159
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:17,199
you know i had them up

1160
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:24,000
wolves like like the

1161
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:26,558
in the canine family yeah yeah

1162
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,838
they were absolutely pure ones they came

1163
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,920
from minnesota

1164
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:31,920
and then i had one out of alaska and

1165
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,800
then it was hybridizing them

1166
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,838
uh with german shepherd because you know

1167
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,079
you don't want to cross them with

1168
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:41,199
huskies huskies aren't really a

1169
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,800
real obedient dog at all so anyway i get

1170
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:46,078
them up to 96

1171
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:47,760
wolf big black beautiful wolves and

1172
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,280
listen to every word you say very

1173
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,559
trainable and all that stuff

1174
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:55,280
look more like a wolf than a pier and uh

1175
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,200
they had killed my favorite dog uh one

1176
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,079
night and uh that kind of ended the

1177
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:00,960
whole

1178
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,880
breeding program wow let's go check out

1179
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:06,480
the freak show chamber

1180
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,920
this is we're starting to get into sort

1181
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,358
of the

1182
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:14,318
zone so so you're growing it on your

1183
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:17,440
property too correct

1184
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:21,199
yeah we've got um

1185
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:23,920
this is this is our farm this is the

1186
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:25,759
humboldt seed company anchor farm and

1187
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:29,358
we've got

1188
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:33,359
40 different breeding chambers here

1189
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:36,400
that we each one

1190
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:37,119
inside each one we create each different

1191
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,240
strain

1192
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:42,640
that we release and we've also got

1193
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:44,399
a permitted farm and nursery down in

1194
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:47,920
nevada county as well

1195
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:51,599
so but this is our main anchor humboldt

1196
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:53,760
farm and then we have a

1197
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,359
distribution for the seeds that we call

1198
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,559
the seed lab

1199
00:49:55,358 --> 00:50:00,799
and that's out in eureka but

1200
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,800
um

1201
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:06,480
and so so the idea here is is once you

1202
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,240
guys

1203
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,480
pick a winner of jordan's uh

1204
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:13,279
the stuff that he brought over from his

1205
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,559
property

1206
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,040
you'd then pop those seeds and basically

1207
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,519
create

1208
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:21,838
seeds out of that that would then go to

1209
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:25,119
market

1210
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:28,078
yeah that's how we did the original

1211
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,880
um freak show seeds that are in market

1212
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,000
today

1213
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:35,519
so here jordan and i are going to go in

1214
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:38,800
uh inside one of these chambers here

1215
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:38,800
where we breed the freak show

1216
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:41,920
and all right so they're little they're

1217
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:46,000
little hoop houses

1218
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:49,440
got it yeah and i mean you know

1219
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,440
we have our own special

1220
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,599
sort of tricks that we've developed over

1221
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,880
the years for

1222
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:58,640
breeding different strains but i like

1223
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,760
the use of

1224
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:05,598
bamboo yeah

1225
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:08,400
yeah i mean it's nature

1226
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:09,359
and here's some freak show buds actually

1227
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,358
cfc'd

1228
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,358
i'm seeing the siege forming right there

1229
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:21,200
and this is the feminized freak show

1230
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:22,719
so the one of the interesting things

1231
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:26,000
about

1232
00:51:22,719 --> 00:51:29,199
um the way freak show

1233
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,760
develops the anthers

1234
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:34,799
particularly on this like a sex reversed

1235
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,119
one develop on the outside of the flower

1236
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:40,559
but you know what people really want to

1237
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,559
see are these beautiful

1238
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:44,399
freak show buds starting to form up

1239
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:47,440
isn't that just amazing

1240
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:51,119
yeah so so

1241
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:54,159
in this room it's all

1242
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:57,920
females that have been pollinated with

1243
00:51:54,159 --> 00:52:00,480
a male that you selected or or

1244
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,800
what kind of the set up in the room so

1245
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:06,639
we've actually

1246
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:09,760
fully reversed um

1247
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:13,118
the sex of of this plant

1248
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,079
or of of freak show and that's how you

1249
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:18,079
make

1250
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:18,960
uh feminized seeds so it just so happens

1251
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,839
that we're in

1252
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,119
a feminized breeding chamber right now

1253
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:27,039
but we all

1254
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:30,079
make regular freak show seeds

1255
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:33,199
um but yeah here's this

1256
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:36,400
is right here the this

1257
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:40,960
bud is is absolutely 100

1258
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,960
accepting pollen right now

1259
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:44,480
and the pollinators

1260
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,839
look like that

1261
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:54,000
yeah so

1262
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:55,519
you know this you're getting kind of a

1263
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,039
really

1264
00:52:55,519 --> 00:53:02,318
sort of a inside look

1265
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:06,000
at freak show we don't always

1266
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:07,119
share exactly what this stuff looks like

1267
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,159
but

1268
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:14,559
you know breeding isn't always

1269
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:18,399
as exactly as photo as growing

1270
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:22,160
flour for smoke because you know

1271
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:25,599
for one thing for seeds to be mature

1272
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:26,000
you need to let the the flowers kind of

1273
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,559
sit

1274
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,199
and and the seeds will ripen inside the

1275
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:32,240
flowers

1276
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:36,558
for another month at least

1277
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:39,919
beyond uh when you would harvest it for

1278
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:39,920
for smoking right

1279
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:44,880
and yeah and how freak show seeds are

1280
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:48,079
extremely hard to

1281
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,640
process because uh they're

1282
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,160
pale the way they're pale so it's almost

1283
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:56,000
impossible to tell

1284
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:57,598
a hollow one from you know a good one

1285
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,599
but it can be done you just go through

1286
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,240
them one by one check them

1287
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,359
right it looks like we're in like a

1288
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:07,279
jurassic park

1289
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:07,279
scene right now yeah

1290
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:15,920
he's got a leaf here actually

1291
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:18,400
so that's that's the uniqueness

1292
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,760
well not to mention that and the turpins

1293
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,920
are

1294
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,880
incredibly unique yeah peter this is a

1295
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,880
lot like the

1296
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,559
the super freak and the fruity freak

1297
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,838
ones that i'm i'm

1298
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,640
breaking out right now uh going for a

1299
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:34,558
much more

1300
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:36,639
kind of simpler lacier

1301
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,160
matter of fact the ones at my ranch are

1302
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:41,358
quite a bit different than

1303
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:44,399
this particular one but yeah

1304
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:47,279
sorry in terms of the leaf structure

1305
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,440
yeah exactly leaf morphology has gone in

1306
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,040
a lot of kind of crazy directions and

1307
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,280
you know that's what got me started

1308
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:54,880
finding freaks in the first place but

1309
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,960
you know i can't help myself now i'm

1310
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:00,480
looking at the freaks of the freaks

1311
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,960
and where it's you know really taking

1312
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,639
off

1313
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:08,000
and you know in another departure uh

1314
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:10,519
you know in the way of leaf uh shape

1315
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,239
and that's there is actually

1316
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:14,318
correlations between

1317
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:15,759
certain things that you can look at on

1318
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:18,159
any cannabis plant

1319
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,240
uh at any stage of the game aside from

1320
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:22,558
smelling them and stuff uh

1321
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:24,558
you know i did it as guesswork you know

1322
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,400
we would find out later oh yeah the one

1323
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,200
that you really love them skinny thai

1324
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,240
leaves

1325
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:34,000
uh that is the tasty one by god you know

1326
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:36,159
so uh yeah come to notice

1327
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,199
things like that correlations between

1328
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:40,798
morphologies

1329
00:55:37,199 --> 00:55:40,798
and you know final outcomes

1330
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,559
okay well it's really warm in here right

1331
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,960
now and

1332
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:52,400
yeah um

1333
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,838
anyway there's some beautiful we go

1334
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,000
yeah we could go show them the ones that

1335
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:58,960
are in the fields

1336
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:02,960
and and so in that room how many plants

1337
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,880
are there

1338
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,400
i'd have to look on metric there's quite

1339
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:10,160
a few so we do

1340
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:13,440
selection from quite a few plants

1341
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:17,199
i would say my guess would be around 40

1342
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:21,200
or so okay 50.

1343
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:26,000
so here's just one of our phenohunt rows

1344
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:30,000
and uh these are non-non-freak type

1345
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:34,639
cannabis these are just our our normal

1346
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,639
cannabis and we we like to grow

1347
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:43,680
they're looking good we like to do

1348
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:44,318
autoflowers kind of like out along the

1349
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:47,759
edges

1350
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:51,039
because it's sort of helps us build our

1351
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:54,079
autoflower research

1352
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:56,318
so here's some nice little cute little

1353
00:56:54,079 --> 00:57:00,079
autos that are just

1354
00:56:56,318 --> 00:57:03,440
popping out from behind these

1355
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,440
hedgerows of plants

1356
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:10,239
but anyway this is like a little tour

1357
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,079
now you're starting to get

1358
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:13,279
some of our breeding chambers are up

1359
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:16,559
there

1360
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,640
on this bigger flat you know i'm a

1361
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:27,839
little hesitant to like

1362
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:27,838
i didn't really clean up for this peter

1363
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:36,960
it's nice autoflowers are doing their

1364
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:40,159
thing right now

1365
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:43,679
so that's we like that

1366
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:48,318
it's a nice uh technique actually doing

1367
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:50,960
autoflowers just right alongside

1368
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:52,960
and is that just so you can kind of just

1369
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,880
see how their experiment is just an

1370
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:58,159
opportunity to let it

1371
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:00,880
express itself and get some feedback on

1372
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:03,598
it or is there another purpose

1373
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,000
uh we get feedback on it we test some of

1374
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:08,160
them

1375
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:10,719
and then you know it it's also just like

1376
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:12,159
you know it the more the merrier as far

1377
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:16,000
as flower goes

1378
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:20,318
um and so

1379
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,318
but primarily the answer is it's for r d

1380
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:25,439
all right so i'm moving up now to where

1381
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:30,000
we have some

1382
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,000
freaks growing out in veg

1383
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:39,519
and uh jordan's on his way as well

1384
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:40,558
let me just see this is um our blueberry

1385
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:43,679
muffin

1386
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:47,920
breeding chamber here

1387
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:51,118
so these are pollinated here we go

1388
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:53,200
okay so this is the blueberry muffin

1389
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:54,720
yeah this is our blueberry muffin

1390
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:56,719
breeding chamber

1391
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:58,798
so this i don't know if folks can see

1392
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:02,000
but that is

1393
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:03,519
full of of our femme blueberry muffin

1394
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,318
seeds

1395
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:06,318
oh wow okay

1396
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:15,440
so so so the see those seeds are already

1397
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:17,039
feminized or do you have to treat them

1398
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,679
so the way that people a lot of people

1399
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:22,639
don't quite get it

1400
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:24,879
the way that you make feminized seeds is

1401
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:27,199
by altering the pollen

1402
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:29,280
and the pollen comes from from a plant

1403
00:59:27,199 --> 00:59:32,719
that has

1404
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:36,400
two x chromosomes which is just a

1405
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:40,078
generally a female plant and so

1406
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:43,119
because of that it uh

1407
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:45,760
creates all female seeds

1408
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:47,280
got it so so so one once you put the

1409
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:49,040
seeds through the machine there

1410
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,720
and and pull them all there there's no

1411
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:53,039
more work to be done in terms of the

1412
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:57,358
feminization process

1413
00:59:53,039 --> 01:00:01,838
that's right yeah it it happens

1414
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:01,838
you treat the um

1415
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:08,318
you treat the plant with uh

1416
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,960
a silver with the female plant with

1417
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:12,639
silver

1418
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:14,079
until it releases um pollen which it

1419
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:17,279
normally would not

1420
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:19,119
release pollen so

1421
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,559
when it releases pollen the pollen that

1422
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:28,079
it releases is

1423
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:30,079
all female pawn now

1424
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:31,839
so these are just going to be full term

1425
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,839
outdoor and they're just currently in

1426
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:36,880
veg right

1427
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:39,119
yeah these are just in veg right now and

1428
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,039
and are these from feminized seeds are

1429
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:46,079
these just regular seeds

1430
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:48,719
i don't i think that some of them are um

1431
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:50,798
we created both feminized and regular

1432
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:55,199
freak show seeds last year

1433
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:58,318
and you know we've keep track of

1434
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:59,919
of our rating always at the base of the

1435
01:00:58,318 --> 01:01:03,119
plants

1436
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:06,880
you can see this one was rated

1437
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,880
nine and uh

1438
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:13,359
that just has a good turpin the gs

1439
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:13,358
stands for

1440
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:20,079
to be honest it's not that technical it

1441
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:20,078
stands for great smell

1442
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,240
but you know hey we're keeping track and

1443
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:29,440
we breed with our highest

1444
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:30,239
rated ones so these are all nines and

1445
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,798
tens

1446
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:35,358
and from individual populations and they

1447
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:39,759
were selected out of many many

1448
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:40,480
um so you know many phenos or let's just

1449
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,240
say

1450
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,240
individuals in a population

1451
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,319
phenotype is kind of a subjective word

1452
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:52,318
if you ask me

1453
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:53,679
you know one person's definition of a

1454
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:56,719
different

1455
01:01:53,679 --> 01:02:00,399
phenotype can be very

1456
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:03,598
different than someone else's definition

1457
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:06,798
if you know what i mean you know

1458
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:10,400
you know what what

1459
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:14,000
well okay just for example someone might

1460
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:17,599
call this freakshow

1461
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:20,880
leaf shape a phenotype and

1462
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:24,079
just say that is uh an

1463
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:27,358
interesting phenotype of cannabis

1464
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:30,640
but for jordan and i

1465
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:34,000
we we go through and look at these

1466
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:36,480
different freaks and and we think of

1467
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,039
each one of these leaf shapes that's

1468
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:39,760
different

1469
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:41,280
and so on and so forth we think of those

1470
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:44,640
as phenotypes as well

1471
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:46,480
so um i that's why i just would say that

1472
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:48,078
the word phenotype is subjective but

1473
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,880
that's okay it's

1474
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:52,880
it's meant to be subjective um they use

1475
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,798
overall phenotype for that you know

1476
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,160
overall phenotype includes everything

1477
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:59,519
about the plant

1478
01:02:56,159 --> 01:03:02,719
yeah and then we have chemotype and then

1479
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:06,318
looking at the genotype and

1480
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:10,399
terp type even yeah terp profile is

1481
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:11,838
another whole area of jeans

1482
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,480
and i always tell people when you

1483
01:03:11,838 --> 01:03:14,480
combine

1484
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:20,639
all of it together and you find that

1485
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:24,319
plant that you really love

1486
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:27,440
that we we call that one a dreamo type

1487
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:29,759
yeah right i got the problem of i

1488
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,880
kind of getting to where everything i

1489
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,680
got i love it all

1490
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:35,519
uh so that's why i have so many lines of

1491
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:36,239
fruit show i could take it in any

1492
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:38,000
direction

1493
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:39,759
i want right now and i could do it in

1494
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,519
you know one generation

1495
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,280
i'm pretty damn happy now it's just a

1496
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:45,838
matter of what flavor

1497
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,960
do you like you know at this point it's

1498
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:50,880
kind of a flat

1499
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:53,679
five flavor uh variety because

1500
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,318
it's gonna have the fives and i like it

1501
01:03:53,679 --> 01:03:56,399
that way

1502
01:03:54,318 --> 01:03:58,000

team grow magazine is here at humboldt

1511
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:21,038
seed company right

1512

1545
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:45,679
just walking through our breeding

1546
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:50,558
facility but oh with that anyways so

1547
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:53,919
all right this is uh

1548

northeast humboldt county

1550
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:06,480
kind of uh an unusually um

1551
01:06:04,318 --> 01:06:09,358
day we were potentially gonna have some

1552
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:12,559
thunderstorms today but they

1553
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:15,920
seem to be holding off but

1554
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:19,839
normally it's uh just

1555
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:21,760
bright blue skies right now

1556
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:23,599
right now that's that that's that looks

1557
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,960
like a happy uh

1558
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:29,200
happy spot it's a beautiful spot we have

1559
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:30,318
a wonderful spot for breeding here we

1560
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:33,358
have

1561
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:36,558
uh 25 000 square feet

1562
01:06:33,358 --> 01:06:39,199
and we breed in all of it

1563
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:41,039
or breed or do really intensive pheno

1564
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:45,358
hunting like you see there

1565
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:46,720
and um you know we were honored to be

1566
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:49,679
able to

1567
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:51,439
do freak show here but we have of course

1568
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:54,078
you know

1569
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,798
50 different genetics that we maintain

1570
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,920
here

1571
01:06:54,798 --> 01:07:02,639
um each one of them has this individual

1572
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:05,200
pollination chamber and um

1573
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:06,719
it's a heck of a lot of work we rarely

1574
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:11,279
take time out and

1575
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:13,598
just so happen that um our interview

1576
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,119
kind of a meeting a meeting of the minds

1577
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:18,720
or a lot of people come here

1578
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:18,720
to the farm today

1579
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:27,118
you know sort of a special moment and

1580
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:30,318
uh inspiration very cool

1581
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:33,920
well let let's uh let's pick this up

1582
01:07:30,318 --> 01:07:36,318
i mean uh we should do stuff

1583
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:39,039
like you get great reception so i'd love

1584
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:40,719
to do stuff from the farm and like like

1585
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:42,480
even like you know i'm just thinking

1586
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:43,199
like off the top of my head like talk

1587
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:46,559
through your

1588
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:47,199
like your process of feminizing seeds

1589
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,039
and like

1590
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:51,118
different breeding topics where you

1591
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:54,799
could teach people and

1592
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:56,318
um well we try to we try to be really

1593
01:07:54,798 --> 01:07:59,920
really like

1594
01:07:56,318 --> 01:08:01,759
sharing and not you know have too many

1595
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,000
trade secrets because we actually want

1596
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:06,640
people to

1597
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,000
try breeding themselves and we want

1598
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:11,279
people to get into it

1599
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,880
and you know we feel like the more

1600
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,319
people understand about it the more

1601
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:17,600
they'll understand how much

1602
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:21,359
like work and yeah real effort

1603
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:23,679
so so is that corn in the background

1604
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:26,000
yeah that's our little sweet corn patch

1605
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:29,039
that we do every year for

1606
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:34,319
you know the the trim

1607
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:37,359
not the crew but the seed harvest

1608
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:40,480
team and sweet

1609
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:42,560
guys talking about the sweet kron which

1610
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:45,278
if anybody has ever gone through

1611
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:48,880
southern oregon you see the big

1612
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:51,679
company that does sweet kron it's like

1613
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,560
they have corn and weed for sale that's

1614
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:55,600
funny

1615
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,239
we all like to you know no one wants to

1616
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:00,000
get

1617
01:08:56,238 --> 01:09:03,119
fully sort of just known for

1618
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:06,880
one thing as you know like the whole

1619
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:10,238
i think one of the reasons why he

1620
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:13,440
knew that freak show was special and to

1621
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:16,000
try to work with it and keep it around

1622
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:16,879
when it appeared for him is because he's

1623
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,079
had so many

1624
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,400
many years of experience you know he

1625
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:23,439
knew

1626
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:25,920
better than to just cast it aside like

1627
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:26,879
you know i might have done that in my

1628
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:30,399
early

1629
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:33,520
days of breeding so right he's got

1630
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:34,639
quite a few years on me and right always

1631
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,279
really

1632
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,239
you know we want to pay deference to

1633
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:41,440
that

1634
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:44,079
here at humboldt seed company because

1635
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:45,599
there's so many that came before us and

1636
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:48,079
even though i've been

1637
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,759
here growing and breeding in humboldt

1638
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:52,798
for

1639
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:55,359
five years alma or is that

1640
01:09:52,798 --> 01:09:55,920
no more than that i guess but anyway um

1641
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:58,880
i

1642
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:01,279
still feel like i'm you know a beginner

1643
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:05,520
in a lot of respects compared to

1644
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:09,279
some of the folks whoa but anyway

1645
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:11,840
peter it's been amazing and uh

1646
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:12,479
i guess i'll sign off now all right and

1647
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,440
i'll chill

1648
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:17,839
check in soon what are we looking at

1649
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:17,839
there

1650
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:22,560
to be honest this is uh this is

1651
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:26,238
forbidden fruit

1652
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:31,520
got it which um

1653
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:34,559
my cultivation manager here at the farm

1654
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:38,320
just loves forbidden fruit and i like it

1655
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,320
i'll give it up to forbidden fruit

1656
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:45,840
all right
