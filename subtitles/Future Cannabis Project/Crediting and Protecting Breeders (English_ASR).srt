1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
the abilities to be able to get yourself

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,549
contractual protection and I think with

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,129
community protection and support is

4
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,570
really just try not to screw each other

5
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:11,039
you know fundamentally man choose not to

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,830
burn the guy you're doing business with

7
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:16,890
and that seemed to work for a long time

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,990
I mean to me it's pretty simple

9
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,359
and I think that that you know in my

10
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:24,479
perspective from someone who traffics

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,279
genetics what I want to be able to see

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,080
is and what I've always done is I've

13
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:32,030
always given credit to the people whose

14
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:34,829
cultivars I use or material I use or

15
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,630
information I use because what happens

16
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,299
then is you promote just like Jason was

17
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,739
promoting NAT and gene saying hey man I

18
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,959
ran his stuff that was killed and my

19
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:45,089
friends run his stuff that's a courtesy

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,439
he didn't have to say it but he wanted

21
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,300
to say hey you know you guys are some

22
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:51,179
some guys that I respect and I

23
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,009
appreciate and what it does it adds a

24
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:54,509
level of legitimacy that you can't add

25
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:56,250
yourself I had this discussion with

26
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:58,378
someone today about the internet saying

27
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,600
the Internet guys tell you this is how

28
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,390
you promote yourself and I'm like no

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,760
really give a about them it's it's

30
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,349
just banter it's crap coming out their

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,390
mouth perpetually and you just turn it

32
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:11,548
off what you want is you want other

33
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,469
people to validate what you're doing in

34
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:14,970
an honest way because that resonates in

35
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:16,170
a way that you know is true because

36
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:18,868
they're not getting paid for it they're

37
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,978
not a shill and I think that that's part

38
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:22,259
of it is that you know you recognize

39
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:24,390
other people's farms and you commend the

40
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:25,890
product when it's legitimate and if you

41
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,390
don't have an ability to move your

42
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,009
product but you know someone who could

43
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,269
move product you push that product and

44
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,118
you make sure that person gets credit

45
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:35,219
and with the breeders you know don't

46
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,319
pirate their work you know what would

47
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:39,719
you had so funny one cuz jeans a mean

48
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:41,368
king but he was talking about how they

49
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,599
would rename in these varietals so they

50
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:43,859
could just get rid of the breeder and

51
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:45,569
there was this whole meme about how the

52
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:47,340
breeder was diminished minimized and

53
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:50,250
wiped out so that we can name anything

54
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,100
we wanted but it's it's such a true

55
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,509
statement because you're so you're so

56
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:56,578
desirous of your own success that you

57
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:57,930
forgot how you got there and I think

58
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:01,529
when it comes to with the breeders that

59
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:04,649
if you can keep them alive in the

60
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,329
conversation all the time you know in a

61
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,520
courteous sense where this is the

62
00:02:06,328 --> 00:02:10,679
material I got from Jason this is what I

63
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,030
used if you want to buy more you can go

64
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,860
to them if you've got questions you can

65
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,050
go to them you become innocent

66
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,340
credible referral network and I think

67
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,670
that the thing that protects you from

68
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:22,860
in life most is money your own

69
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:25,189
money makes you pretty safe because you

70
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,720
can afford infrastructure tools

71
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:29,639
connections and that's really what we've

72
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:32,039
been deprived of right now is liquidity

73
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,779
and so we have to kind of pull up our

74
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:35,609
skills until we can rebuild our

75
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,039
liquidity but hopefully this bout of

76
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,170
poverty teaches us how to behave a

77
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,509
little more intelligently in a communal

78
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:45,119
form so that when we do rear eyes up

79
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:47,099
again as a craft culture you're able to

80
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,330
actually take the education that we just

81
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:50,909
got about how you better stick together

82
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,800
you're gonna die and then use it to

83
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:54,479
create the models of protection so that

84
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,219
you end up having individuals that can

85
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,349
do the work so that all you have to do

86
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:00,689
is do your work a lot of people would

87
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:03,269
rather just grow and farm than have to

88
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:04,979
spend all their free time breeding - so

89
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:07,170
I mean that's my opinion on it it's it's

90
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,479
you you you you gotta you got to be

91
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:13,919
honest with whose work you're pirating

92
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:19,620
and make sure you kick back credit yeah

93
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:21,329
I would agree with with that Kevin I'm

94
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,759
sure you guys have had it happen I've

95
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,469
had it happen where where groups get

96
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,889
ahold you work and they renamed it as

97
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:31,620
their own and they don't give credit and

98
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:33,929
I've I feel like the the history and the

99
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:37,769
story is a big part of why things are

100
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:41,730
appealing and so I I always try to be as

101
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:43,500
forthcoming and factual with with all

102
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:48,329
the information that we put out there

103
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:50,219
about what we're working with and you

104
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,600
know there's there's companies out there

105
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:55,830
that are just getting rid of the names

106
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:59,039
altogether where it's it's it's the all

107
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,719
the all the history of you know hundreds

108
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,819
of years of people carrying this plants

109
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,310
just wiped away and now it's it's this

110
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:08,039
new just a whole new way of categorizing

111
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,840
things and you know I don't know really

112
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:13,560
how I feel about that I like people

113
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,689
being inventive and being unique but I'm

114
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,280
also you know very connected to the

115
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:23,219
history and you know there's something

116
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,829
that that might not say so well about

117
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,750
about just totally renaming people stuff

118
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:29,819
you know maybe maybe if

119
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,129
if you come up with a name for a

120
00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:34,949
specific Fino like that that could be

121
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:38,069
okay but but still it's the the whatever

122
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:39,420
fee no of this strain from this person

123
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,920
and still be honest about where it came

124
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:45,360
from and you can still name your fee

125
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:47,189
knows and as far as protecting your

126
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,770
genetics I think the open cannabis

127
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:53,719
project or you know somehow doc

128
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:56,279
documenting the genes as open-source

129
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,020
that's the only really other alternative

130
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,000
to trying to patent your stuff and keep

131
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:01,469
other people from having it I want other

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,879
people to grow it but I don't want

133
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,280
people to grow it and then take it from

134
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,050
me and say I can't grow it that's crazy

135
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:08,639
and that's literally something that

136
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,460
could be going on right now we've got

137
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,740
you know a number of cannabis patents

138
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:16,739
that have already been issued that are

139
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,210
gonna be problematic in the future I'm

140
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,960
sure there's gonna be challenges to them

141
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:23,339
but I think one of them is any one to

142
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:24,959
one that doesn't have mercy and in it

143
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:26,639
it's technically under patent right now

144
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,168
is that correct there's there's

145
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,089
something there's some very broad

146
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:31,680
cannabis patents out there right now and

147
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:34,349
I'm sure there's going to be more down

148
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,478
the road and you know documenting your

149
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:39,090
genetics through through groups like the

150
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:45,199
open cannabis project or or you know a

151
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:45,199
way to to combat that you

152
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:54,860
about spectrum utility patents the

153
00:05:52,459 --> 00:05:57,349
genetic data is holding for a lot of

154
00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:02,090
reasons but it's harder to translate

155
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:04,580
that information so more data and that

156
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:09,139
would be really useful to have prior art

157
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:10,879
argument for any so anybody that didn't

158
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:15,469
hear that he was saying chemo type data

159
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:21,639
is as or possibly more important than

160
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:24,920
the you know the genetic testing so yeah

161
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,990
and and that that can be hopefully a

162
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,970
discussion all on to its own that I

163
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,710
would love to delve deeper into that and

164
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:33,140
how we can protect the community's work

165
00:06:30,709 --> 00:06:35,000
as a whole one thing I wanted to touch

166
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:37,430
on is you know yeah when when you talk

167
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,839
about you know you're saying you're

168
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,720
gonna go try and sell your product to

169
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:43,639
people assume self-interest and so they

170
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,450
always take whatever you say with a

171
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:46,610
grain of salt

172
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:49,250
but if they overhear it from their

173
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,699
friend that says no no his stuffs dope I

174
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:56,990
like that or I like this type and and

175
00:06:51,699 --> 00:07:00,759
you're gonna take that you're gonna take

176
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,759
that in maybe a little more deeper or

177
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:07,129
what I'm trying to say is is support

178
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,410
your community and the other people if

179
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:13,939
you see something that you like you know

180
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:16,040
let people know and hopefully others are

181
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:18,769
gonna return the favor to you and and

182
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:22,700
that that's I feel how we build the

183
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:23,689
community together and help help each

184
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:28,459
other survive

185
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:30,920
so so you know definitely I think people

186
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:33,169
take it into account a little more when

187
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,640
when they hear it you know around you

188
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,020
know through somebody else or through

189
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,019
the grapevine or I heard that this

190
00:07:36,019 --> 00:07:40,459
that's that's how hype builds is is you

191
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:43,099
know people over here from somewhere

192
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:46,699
else that oh that's the one and and yeah

193
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,830
there is something that's that's you

194
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,659
know genuine to that is there's there's

195
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:53,029
reasons behind why those things got

196
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:55,400
built up it can't all just be pure

197
00:07:53,029 --> 00:07:58,009
advertising or you know there's there's

198
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:59,489
got to be some you know human element to

199
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:04,168
why something

200
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:05,850
you know become successful and so yeah

201
00:08:04,168 --> 00:08:07,529
just support support your neighbor

202
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:10,169
support when they're doing good let

203
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:12,599
people know it you know and and I think

204
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:14,728
that that from all of us that came from

205
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,120
the era where you didn't rat on people

206
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:21,418
which seems to be a foreign thought

207
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,699
nowadays ratting out on people screwing

208
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,750
people over isn't Wratten and so when

209
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:27,240
he's saying you know make sure you

210
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,100
support make sure you also call out

211
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,590
things that you see wrong because

212
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:33,839
they're screwing him they're gonna screw

213
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:35,968
you and by the time they get to you they

214
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,110
might not be anybody protect you and so

215
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:39,330
a lot of it is if you're seeing

216
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,979
unscrupulous stuff you don't have to get

217
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,450
out and broadcasted on the general world

218
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,730
but you can tell your friends man I

219
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:48,720
could ask all the time about would you

220
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:50,970
do business with this person and I try

221
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,278
not to screw anybody in a way that would

222
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,050
cause problems but ultimately if I know

223
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,360
that you have a history of pikin people

224
00:08:55,049 --> 00:09:00,750
I always just say the same thing I would

225
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,610
be cautious and what that means is that

226
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,899
I can't give you a recommendation and

227
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,580
that you should do your homework so I

228
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,230
don't have to go too deep into it but it

229
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,720
just says that I can't vouch for you but

230
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,420
I'm not gonna throw a rock at you that's

231
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,980
throwing a rock at you and and that's

232
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:15,750
important because someone said would you

233
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:18,629
work with that distribute or I'd say I

234
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:21,269
would be cautious and then they realize

235
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:24,149
that there's some reason because I'm not

236
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:27,809
in a business against them so therefore

237
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:29,338
why am I having trepidation and it's

238
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:30,689
because I saw something or heard

239
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,970
something and I'm just like look you

240
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,990
don't need to get screwed either so you

241
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:36,180
don't have to go and you know

242
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,039
shish-kabob them but if people are doing

243
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:39,629
good work you know make sure you let

244
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:43,199
people know and if and if people are

245
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:45,149
doing stuff that are unethical in a way

246
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,430
that's gonna really cause problems

247
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:48,990
they're not gonna hold back against you

248
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:50,639
either most people hold back because

249
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,930
they're afraid of ramification they're

250
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,799
afraid back in the day was they're

251
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:55,199
afraid they're gonna lose all their

252
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,669
teeth well now that that's not one of

253
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,959
the tools and I don't really think it

254
00:09:56,669 --> 00:10:02,689
should be a tool but it was a very

255
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:06,119
effective one you have to be able to use

256
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,740
financial and financial is to protect

257
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,389
each other and make sure that the people

258
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,430
that are doing this work on getting beat

259
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:12,169
to death

260
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:16,069
and that they're still around for you to

261
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:17,959
utilize as a resource and you you have

262
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,730
to preserve as many these resources as

263
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,460
possible because without it you end up

264
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:25,670
having a shrunken population of partners

265
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:27,620
to do stuff in the future and for me

266
00:10:25,669 --> 00:10:29,659
like what I've done my whole career I've

267
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,839
needed the people around because I only

268
00:10:29,659 --> 00:10:34,039
can do so much myself and my success was

269
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,930
really built off of all these

270
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:38,569
relationships I made with other people

271
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:42,289
and over the course of time we did

272
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:44,980
better than we did worse so don't

273
00:10:42,289 --> 00:10:44,980
anybody screw you

274
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:54,179
yes yes I believe so that what you could

275
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,529
do is if you did a licensing agreement

276
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:56,909
with the breeder you could also bring

277
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:59,549
material that you have and do

278
00:10:56,909 --> 00:11:01,169
collaborative projects that material

279
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:03,870
would then be able to be jointly

280
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:05,639
promoted you'd be able to have stock

281
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,320
that was unique to you because all the

282
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:08,879
material from the cross would be held

283
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,220
the tool you could figure out what was

284
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,799
the cultivar you wanted to release into

285
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,210
the public as production material not as

286
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:17,189
a cultivar unless you're building a

287
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,050
nursery if you're building a nursery

288
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,970
then you say hey nod I want to work with

289
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:22,409
you on a project I would love to take

290
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,000
some of the stuff you're doing put with

291
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:26,309
something I'm doing let's find a cut

292
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,679
let's put it into the market let's both

293
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:29,129
be honest did the work yeah there's

294
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,929
a good one

295
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:33,120
and then I'll both you can do combined

296
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:34,739
breeding and you can do licensing that

297
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,679
allows you to be able to use your

298
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:39,330
respective IP and then you can then find

299
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,069
individuals that you can license the

300
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:43,259
clone to because one of the problems is

301
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:45,390
overproduction of varietals and so you

302
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:46,919
end up out competing the success because

303
00:11:45,389 --> 00:11:49,679
you've got too much of the same material

304
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:51,449
and you know that I think that's crucial

305
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,919
but I think a lot of us just need more

306
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,310
legal help with that where we need to

307
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:57,149
have more people like Beth come in and

308
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:57,959
attorneys that we're like president was

309
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,939
great to have an attorney present

310
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,769
yesterday because he could kind of say

311
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,870
listen this is how we see this happen

312
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:05,579
and then you're able to get a better

313
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,679
idea because I don't think any of us so

314
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:10,460
at least 95% of us haven't been involved

315
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,689
in patent protection of genomic material

316
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,950
you know I mean I'm somebody messing

317
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,570
around all the time but it's that's not

318
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,890
what I do I still have lawyers that I

319
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,090
work with because I don't have time to

320
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:21,779
go to law school and I don't want to

321
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:24,990
it's not my thing but I need them yeah I

322
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:27,779
think licensing is cool because really a

323
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:33,029
license is just a contract between you

324
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:35,759
and your associate and you know it

325
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:39,620
certainly it's not you know as binding

326
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:42,539
as something like a patent it's it's but

327
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:45,000
it's more voluntary and I really I do

328
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:46,980
encourage folks to do that kind of thing

329
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,129
I mean like look at you know jeans

330
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:53,340
pre-rolled line like you know that's in

331
00:12:50,129 --> 00:12:54,539
a way like that's good for everybody

332
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,680
because

333
00:12:54,539 --> 00:13:01,529
you know that pre-roll person might not

334
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:04,169
have had quite such a namesake or

335
00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:07,529
following and so you know it's good for

336
00:13:04,169 --> 00:13:09,269
their pre roles and and it's cool for

337
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:14,179
Jean because he gets credit all that

338
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:19,049
stuff and just one more thing like I I

339
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:21,209
keep hearing you know everybody we're

340
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:24,000
all a little scared and we all like know

341
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:28,019
that the these big powers that have deep

342
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:33,149
deep pockets are coming and you know you

343
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:35,149
might sort of react to it and do

344
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:38,879
something that you might not otherwise

345
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:40,620
do you know get rid of all your your

346
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:45,049
purple strains or something dumb like

347
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:52,679
that but just remember that like when

348
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:57,179
booze became legal there wasn't like a

349
00:13:52,679 --> 00:14:03,299
Jim Beam or there wasn't Budweiser or

350
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:08,909
course those kind of evolved out of you

351
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:13,589
know there being quick and successes but

352
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:15,689
then you know in the mid 90s all of a

353
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:18,450
sudden there was this thing that came

354
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:21,510
out it was like micro beer and I never

355
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:25,470
thought in a million years that there'd

356
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:29,309
still be breweries opening in Humboldt

357
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:32,310
County that are thriving and just the

358
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:35,250
same with wine like but it takes a while

359
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:39,659
for that to kind of mature like you

360
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:42,529
don't go into the gas station down the

361
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:48,209
you know over Piercy or whatever and and

362
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:50,339
stick your nose up at the new microbrews

363
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:52,050
but you do a third you know maybe you do

364
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,750
or maybe you don't but at the Coors I

365
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:57,659
like PBR I don't know but that stuff

366
00:14:54,750 --> 00:15:00,210
hasn't had a chance to really like you

367
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:03,419
know like the PBRs and the course and

368
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:05,610
the Budweiser's of cannabis no one knows

369
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:07,799
that that's who they are yet

370
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:11,009
and so it's gonna take at least probably

371
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:14,849
like another year maybe two before that

372
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:19,139
really develops and then what I what I'm

373
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:21,990
really confident about is that the you

374
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:25,620
know the regenerative and the small and

375
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:31,110
the real craft actually then starts to

376
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:34,769
have its you know days in the Sun you

377
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:36,839
know pun intended and you know and I

378
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:39,778
think that's the same with strains too

379
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:42,420
I mean God remember how freaking long it

380
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:44,549
was just impossible to you know like

381
00:15:42,419 --> 00:15:46,229
it's you just had to grow og and then

382
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:50,278
you grew a bunch of this really cool

383
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:52,110
awesome stuff for your head and but you

384
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:55,769
just always you know kind of had to grow

385
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:59,789
a G and I think that that's gonna change

386
00:15:55,769 --> 00:16:04,740
too so you know let's just remember that

387
00:15:59,789 --> 00:16:06,179
we are pioneers and like I think you

388
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,419
know what me and gene said about like

389
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:11,759
well I'm not ignoring the fact that the

390
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:15,569
markets saying one thing but I'm also

391
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:18,480
not giving up on where my frickin roots

392
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:20,959
are and to where my convictions lie and

393
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,959
stuff like that
