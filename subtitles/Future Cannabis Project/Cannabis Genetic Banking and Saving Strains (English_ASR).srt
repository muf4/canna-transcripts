1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,419
it would it made me realize the

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:08,039
vulnerability of what we do and as I was

3
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:10,888
going into the hospital I was just like

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:14,160
man who's gonna yeah who's gonna fuck

5
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:15,539
with my stock and it's yeah yeah and I

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,010
know the crew is gonna water but it was

7
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:18,269
what do they do with my genetics stop

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:19,830
fundamentally what do you do with all

9
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:21,778
the material you've worked with and what

10
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:24,118
do you do with the the the stuff that

11
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:25,829
you spend all these years on and that's

12
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:27,118
what maybe you realize whoa we need to

13
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:29,428
be able to start figuring out how to

14
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,920
Bank stuff and how to get people to work

15
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:35,009
with it and and how do you expand the

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,050
circle you're with and and for me it's

17
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:38,759
like a you career because if you're not

18
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:40,890
I don't want to even talk to you on this

19
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:42,299
level because you don't catch it you

20
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,619
don't really catch the amount of work

21
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:46,288
that went into it everybody's like I

22
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:48,179
want your shit I want your shit and so

23
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,590
that's not that's not what I'm looking

24
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:51,210
for is I'm not looking for anybody shit

25
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,460
I got plenty of my own shit I've been

26
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,378
moving stock for a long time I don't

27
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,090
have problem moving genetic material I

28
00:00:55,378 --> 00:00:59,009
don't have a problem acquiring genetic

29
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,690
material and for the people that I

30
00:00:59,009 --> 00:01:02,549
started out in breeding and all these

31
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:04,259
different companies that I fed them to I

32
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:05,250
didn't screw them when I gave it to him

33
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,359
I said listen I'm gonna give you some

34
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,938
killer shit it's gonna let you move

35
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,159
forward and it was basically based off I

36
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:12,449
thought you a good person so for me if I

37
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,978
play with you I just have to hang out

38
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,240
with you for a while I want to have

39
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:16,859
lunch with you I want to see how you

40
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:18,298
treat people I want to see how you treat

41
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,009
your workers I want to see how you treat

42
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,180
the fucking waiter because if you're a

43
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,519
dick there you're gonna be a dick to me

44
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,380
too straight up everybody's a superstar

45
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,118
now and everybody's got a scene and

46
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:29,849
everybody somebody and everybody's gonna

47
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,959
do the thing and it doesn't mean shit to

48
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:33,809
me man I've been around money my whole

49
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,149
life and we were all career criminal

50
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,680
black market guys so we made a lot of

51
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:42,990
fuckin money when money was to be made

52
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,729
and and in throwing it around and in big

53
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:46,170
long ziplock containers that you were

54
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:49,140
pulling out of the trucks that you had

55
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,899
hidden in the yard that that lets you

56
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,609
become immune to cash and so money is a

57
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,310
tool now and there's less disposable

58
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:58,349
money now but I'm not in any kind of

59
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,909
economic bad situation I own all my shit

60
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:02,059
and I'm a sole owner of all my

61
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,170
investments and then I partnered with

62
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:07,140
Parker and the guys that you met and

63
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,459
because they have a stunning facility

64
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,378
and they asked me to come in and said

65
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,598
hey would you be able to be our partner

66
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,799
on this operation and I just said hey it

67
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,619
would allow me to shut

68
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,740
my other facility turn it into another

69
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:22,590
form of entity and then we can combine

70
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,150
that as a combined aggregate so now I

71
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,620
cause I can hold multiple permits you

72
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,020
guys can hold more events I already have

73
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,390
all permits in play so let's adjust the

74
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:32,219
permits so that we can team up and not

75
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:34,019
have redundant shit I don't need to have

76
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,620
my own nursery and then operate your

77
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,870
nursery

78
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,830
I'll just operate your nursery and then

79
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,480
I'll go at it with this and so Parker is

80
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,010
successful from tech industry in terms

81
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,949
of putting together money packages in

82
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:50,579
tech he gets into cannabis but the kids

83
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:52,709
shark and he's a work demon and then my

84
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,550
other partner is aerospace engineer from

85
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:58,650
los alamos weapons labs so I have a

86
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,870
basically you on musk where he can't put

87
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,969
velcro shoes on but he can split an atom

88
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,060
with a butter knife in the backyard and

89
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:07,530
then we have a good staff that I brought

90
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,090
in that I've been existing Lee working

91
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,039
with we put the new dispensary together

92
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,840
at that new facility so we have a

93
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:16,439
beautiful facility right on the highway

94
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,509
and then we have a new mega lab going in

95
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,889
for distillate crude production so a

96
00:03:18,509 --> 00:03:22,049
whole facility going in and then I have

97
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:23,789
another processing manufacturing

98
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,980
facility we're building on acreage we

99
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:28,739
already onto so we have all these pieces

100
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:31,229
in play and it's all happening and so it

101
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:32,640
lets me play different to where I have

102
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:34,019
14 these work with a lot of people and I

103
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,839
turn it down because I'm like you guys

104
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,280
are looking at short term money and what

105
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,319
am I gonna do next and yeah you're gonna

106
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,479
get paid but I'm already paid I'm not

107
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,560
broke now so what are you offering me

108
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,899
well you know I mean everybody's like

109
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,159
these people hold the money I had an

110
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:50,039
offer from the green house seat I knew

111
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:53,069
Franco right but they Franco flies in

112
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:54,689
and says hey my boss wants you to do

113
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:56,819
seed production for us because we're

114
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:58,800
gonna pay you $100,000 and I start

115
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:00,659
laughing and I'm like you know I got a

116
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,580
giant outdoor farm you realize 100

117
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,049
grands a single pull off a debt so

118
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,150
you're gonna make me commit to a year at

119
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,380
work for a fucking hundred K and he was

120
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,689
like no you don't understand it's a

121
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,879
hundred K and I says I don't think you

122
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:14,400
understand we got 100 K in a paint

123
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,689
bucket right here on the floor with

124
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,910
different guys you know I'm a little

125
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:19,079
different guys and so Franco laughed and

126
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,459
he ended up getting a bunch of genetics

127
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,839
from me and went back to Europe and then

128
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,939
Franco and I maintained a pretty good

129
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,349
friendship so he would send me a genetic

130
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:26,269
material from Europe and I'd send it

131
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,629
back to him

132
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:31,008
and then he dies the malaria but it let

133
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:32,538
me understand I asked him why don't you

134
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:34,460
do this in Africa where you can screw

135
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:36,978
them over and he said we tried but the

136
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:39,620
Africans nationalized our operation and

137
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:41,568
screwed us and so I said that's exactly

138
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:43,459
what you deserve you can't do that shit

139
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:45,080
and that's what I see right now is the

140
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:47,209
same abusive stuff and everybody's

141
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:48,709
waving money and so I go to a lot of

142
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:50,239
these lectures people have me come in

143
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:51,668
and they don't want me to talk about

144
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,288
cultivation they want me to talk about

145
00:04:51,668 --> 00:04:56,389
state of mind and I tell people don't

146
00:04:54,288 --> 00:04:58,550
mortgage your house right now don't look

147
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:02,000
at your house and then have an investor

148
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:04,788
take 52 points off your dollar to play

149
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,889
because that is your margin and all

150
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:08,658
you're gonna do is get wage and then as

151
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:11,120
soon as you don't achieve it they'll cut

152
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:12,949
you out and yes you'll be part owner of

153
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,689
a company that you will not get paid on

154
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:17,960
because they're gonna sink the goddamn

155
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:19,639
thing like a ship and so will it to me

156
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:21,379
I'm just like this is a disastrous

157
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,598
situation and because I've been here my

158
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:25,550
whole life I have an emotional problem

159
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:27,408
I'm actually connected to these people

160
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,879
these aren't cats I just hustle with

161
00:05:27,408 --> 00:05:31,129
these are cats I lived with and rolled

162
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,168
with and did business with and all over

163
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:34,579
the state so we come up to LA to meet

164
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:36,288
individuals I go to some of these

165
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:38,209
monster operations and the cat walking

166
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:39,228
out the doors dudes I already know and

167
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:40,459
so I'm like holy fuck we really know

168
00:05:39,228 --> 00:05:42,319
each other we traffic for years together

169
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:44,120
so we're cracking up because I didn't

170
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,288
know they had the new operation and then

171
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,300
they wanted to do the same thing they

172
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:49,009
said hey can you Bank genetics for us

173
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,710
can you take genetics from us and then

174
00:05:49,009 --> 00:05:53,750
give them back to us in micro form in

175
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:56,060
Kelowna level so that we can shut down

176
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,490
our nursery operation and then we can

177
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,079
work in these capacity and so I'm like

178
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:02,120
listen we'll figure it out and that's

179
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,859
the main point of it is to find out can

180
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,750
you have a workable relationship with

181
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,310
other people that are in the same

182
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,288
situation you don't intend to go

183
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,819
anywhere everybody's trying to retire

184
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:11,839
and then retire and do what somebody

185
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:12,860
said when are you gonna move from home

186
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:14,598
boss and I'm like never

187
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,830
yeah and then the other question was

188
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:20,089
when are you going to get out of weed I

189
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:22,579
said when I'm dead when I'm dead oh yeah

190
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:25,459
no I'm no matter how many times I had a

191
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:26,959
fight a case I never gave up and no

192
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:28,750
matter how much crap I went through I

193
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,310
never gave up because fundamentally I

194
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,620
love what I do and I love the people

195
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,620
that do it at this kind of level you

196
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:38,598
your normal people that are abnormal in

197
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,168
your hunger and that's me I'm a regular

198
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:43,228
person who's abnormally

199
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:44,698
driven and I don't have any intention to

200
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:46,560
screw anybody so and I do business

201
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:47,669
people and look you can vet me and if

202
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,740
you want to do business we can be

203
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:51,990
friends but I it's all good I'm not

204
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,509
trying to forge a relationship I have I

205
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,310
have one with my kids in my old lady

206
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:58,620
relationship with me is over time if you

207
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,449
know me now check me out check me out in

208
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,158
the month I'm the same dude check me out

209
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:03,978
in five years I'm the same dude I still

210
00:07:02,158 --> 00:07:06,688
got the same crew for 20 fucking years

211
00:07:03,978 --> 00:07:08,278
that's how I know it works because the

212
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:10,080
same guys I'm rolling with now to send

213
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:12,269
guys I was wrong with then and you can

214
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,508
meet new people but everybody nowadays

215
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:18,120
is so transient this is very myopic I

216
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:19,439
only see this and it's gonna be this and

217
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,360
it's gonna be this and I'm like I didn't

218
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,789
want to work at you because it's not

219
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,770
real and it just makes it almost

220
00:07:23,788 --> 00:07:27,300
impossible to have any success when

221
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:29,338
you're in those situations and no one's

222
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,408
looking at it as a long-term thing they

223
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:33,060
don't realize this is global situations

224
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:35,579
for me Humboldt County

225
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,228
I had an ability I got I got access to

226
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:39,389
the governor soryo office when all the

227
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:40,588
permitting came on so I had I had I had

228
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:41,968
a kind of neat situation when Gavin

229
00:07:40,588 --> 00:07:44,098
Newsome came to my greenhouse to hang

230
00:07:41,968 --> 00:07:45,810
out so he comes to LA comes to Oakland

231
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:49,259
he comes my greenhouse and they sealed

232
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:51,478
off my whole facility and the cops came

233
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:53,848
out guns and protected us while we had

234
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:55,109
lunch and all the county supervisors

235
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,490
were trying to get in but they weren't

236
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,199
invited and I wouldn't let him in the

237
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,658
gates so I pretend as it it's all right

238
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,978
we'll have discussion ourselves and what

239
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:03,658
it did is it allowed me to work on all

240
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:05,639
the permitting structures nursery

241
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:07,348
structures so else I had my hand and all

242
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,658
these permit pieces so I could try to

243
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:11,098
help create the levels and layers that

244
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:13,560
were needed for the people in my region

245
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:16,288
to still succeed because if you can't do

246
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,149
1,500 square foot a canopy which is what

247
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:20,188
you have available that means you're not

248
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:22,139
even allowed to be in the industry and

249
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:23,399
to me that doesn't make any sense and so

250
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,098
even though we're larger than that

251
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:28,879
that's that's only because we grew from

252
00:08:26,098 --> 00:08:28,878
our lower levels
