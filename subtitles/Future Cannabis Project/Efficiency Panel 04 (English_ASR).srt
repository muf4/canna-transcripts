1
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:21,059
yeah I mean you know touching on

2
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:23,178
operating procedures it's a it's an

3
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:26,189
important part of the new paradigm for

4
00:00:23,178 --> 00:00:29,518
cannabis cultivation undoubtedly you

5
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,469
know I would say mmm the majority of

6
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,170
cultivators that are here probably have

7
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:37,198
a methodology that they are at least

8
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,300
content with you know so perhaps the

9
00:00:37,198 --> 00:00:41,729
challenge becomes how do you standardize

10
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,750
your methodology so that other people

11
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:44,279
can do it are you going to be there

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,509
seven days a week are you gonna be

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,710
hustling are you going to be building

14
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:48,570
your brand you're gonna be networking

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,579
you know are you gonna be the guy

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,100
running the hose like you used to when

17
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,689
you had ninety nine probably not you

18
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,879
know so the reality of you know

19
00:00:56,689 --> 00:01:02,820
efficiency in terms of is what I'm doing

20
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:05,969
replicable how do I convey it how do I

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,899
assess whether it's being done in an

22
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:08,549
efficient manner

23
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:10,859
you know one of the examples I like to

24
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,530
use is you know let's say people are

25
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:15,299
irrigating a crop right by hand in the

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,489
in a warehouse setting let's just say

27
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,200
and you say well it takes them four to

28
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:21,030
six hours to do it and it's like well

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,520
why is it for six hours is it because

30
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:25,379
the volume that they're putting down is

31
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,810
different or is it because some people

32
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:30,089
tangle the hose more than others or you

33
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,859
know and and how do you get any grip on

34
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,450
what the reality of your cost of

35
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:35,099
production there is if you're not

36
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,579
tracking that how do you decipher

37
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:41,459
actually 20% of my nutrient cost last

38
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,259
year was because my guys screwed up the

39
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:45,329
res mix and they had to dump it because

40
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,728
I had a standard operating procedure you

41
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,679
know that even so that they knew to do

42
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:51,709
that or you know what I mean and so

43
00:01:49,679 --> 00:01:54,359
there a lot of it is is really

44
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:57,030
developing that system unruhe you know

45
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,709
on rolling out those SOPs and and

46
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,780
monitoring them and like you said you're

47
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:02,340
constantly re-evaluating looking at them

48
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,459
how can we do this better how can we do

49
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,310
this more efficiently and it's not the

50
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:09,868
same as you know one person or you know

51
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,530
a small group of people doing it by

52
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:12,870
themselves

53
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,330
you know as you're scaling those

54
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,519
processes have to be replicable it you

55
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,099
know at scale and so it definitely

56
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,200
changes the dynamic not just how can I

57
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:25,469
do it better how can I do it efficiently

58
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:27,339
but how can I do it consistently which

59
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:30,539
is per

60
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,370
one of the most critical endgame

61
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:35,560
components without a consistent product

62
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,050
you can't have a consistent following

63
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,140
you just can't you can't build brand

64
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:43,330
loyalty you can't build consistent

65
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:46,179
expectations within the marketplace if

66
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,799
you can't have consistent output and a

67
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,219
lot of ways that sort of circles us back

68
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:53,500
around to you know facility design right

69
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:55,359
and what are the seasonal limitations or

70
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,009
you know what are the limitations of

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,870
what you're working with and and how

72
00:02:57,009 --> 00:03:01,629
does that impact you know the model and

73
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:04,599
and the end product and data collection

74
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:08,469
I mean that's a big setting I've come

75
00:03:04,598 --> 00:03:11,798
back full circle you know I mean yeah if

76
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:14,439
your hand watering okay so are they all

77
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:15,939
doing it the same you know is it like

78
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:17,650
you said volume of water so are they

79
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:21,818
standing there counting for 10 seconds

80
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:24,430
oh oh my god I have you know I have a

81
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:27,458
phosphorus toxicity and now like there's

82
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,140
water everywhere right and I mean and

83
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,670
speaking of that you know I hear a lot

84
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:32,108
of people say well we want to keep hand

85
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:36,879
watering when they've gone from you know

86
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:40,150
like 50 plants to 50,000 plants and the

87
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:43,568
argument I always get every single time

88
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,760
is that well it gets us looking at the

89
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:47,409
plants it gets us in the room so that we

90
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:51,039
can look at the plants and my thought is

91
00:03:47,409 --> 00:03:54,219
if you just built into that walking walk

92
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:56,348
through the room for an hour as opposed

93
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:59,439
to standing there for six hours and like

94
00:03:56,348 --> 00:04:01,719
going like this right then you can

95
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,090
actually focus on the plant as opposed

96
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,799
to happenstance catching a problem

97
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,090
because you happen to be standing there

98
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,359
watering the plant what if you actually

99
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:11,379
scouted on purpose your crop I was gonna

100
00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:12,849
saying if you're looking if you're

101
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:14,049
paying so much attention to the plant

102
00:04:12,848 --> 00:04:15,340
then you're not paying attention to your

103
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:18,879
watering that you're doing you know

104
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:21,668
sorry yes the key is to set yourself up

105
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,680
for success right that's kind of the

106
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:26,109
hope you know we only have a few minutes

107
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,439
left so do we are there any questions

108
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:33,220
out there for these amazingly smart

109
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:37,019
panelists I hear you're thinking about

110
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,020
them right now they're serious questions

111
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:49,209
how can you efficiently design a site

112
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:55,509
plan for a county that is not knotted

113
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:56,948
not legal yet well the thing that all

114
00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:58,949
right I'll start the thing that comes to

115
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:01,658
mind is probably do as much of that

116
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:04,348
pre-planning as you can yourself so

117
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:06,639
you're not incurring additional costs

118
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:08,889
beyond that I would look to you know

119
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,400
what the standard you know probably

120
00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:14,139
first CD if you see DFA is presently and

121
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,870
try and you know and and all the other

122
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:18,668
agencies involved and try and orient

123
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,889
your plan to that you know there are a

124
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:22,658
lot of good resources out there in terms

125
00:05:20,889 --> 00:05:25,509
of you know how do you draw a site plan

126
00:05:22,658 --> 00:05:28,500
you know you know it's basic stuff like

127
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:31,300
that so depending on the intricacies of

128
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,598
your particular project or parcel or

129
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,389
whatever you know you if you have all

130
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:39,490
the sort of the background information

131
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:43,449
then I would say go ahead and and be

132
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:45,098
creative design your your dream and you

133
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:46,180
know wait and see and be patient and

134
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:51,278
don't spend a lot of money in the

135
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:55,439
meanwhile I I would agree with all of

136
00:05:51,278 --> 00:05:59,319
those things and add that ultimately

137
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:02,918
designing a site plan specifically for

138
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:05,189
cannabis isn't necessarily wildly

139
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:08,168
different than designing a site plan for

140
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:11,189
other agricultural purposes there are

141
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:13,299
some unique capacities but the

142
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:17,468
components like all the pieces that are

143
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:19,810
gonna go into it can be much the same as

144
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:25,240
as they are for anything else and so you

145
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:27,009
can start not worrying about the very

146
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:31,300
specific components that are going to

147
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:33,900
come in once it becomes legal and start

148
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:36,400
dealing with kind of the big block

149
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:39,310
considerations with your power with your

150
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:41,258
water because those it doesn't matter

151
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,968
legal or not legal there will be little

152
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:44,710
things that come up like can I use a

153
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:46,778
residential well versus a commercial

154
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:49,060
well etc etc and what you might have to

155
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:50,319
do to deal with the water but you can

156
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:55,959
start that

157
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:58,089
process and quite frankly not a lot of

158
00:06:55,959 --> 00:07:00,069
it may be impacted

159
00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:02,739
once those changes happen and once those

160
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,689
changes come down and in all honesty by

161
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,840
the time you're done with your planning

162
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:09,579
you may already be legal with how long

163
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:15,039
it actually takes to get that planning

164
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:16,779
in process and underway and I guess you

165
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,280
know waterboard compliance if that's not

166
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:19,359
