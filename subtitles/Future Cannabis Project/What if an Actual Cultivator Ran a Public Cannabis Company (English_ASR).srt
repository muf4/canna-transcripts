1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:13,660
[Music]

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:15,788
okay so I want to get into your journey

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:21,050
going public

4
00:00:15,788 --> 00:00:24,320
so the original you're based out of

5
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:26,599
Portland and the original company / you

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,278
started as a farmer correct okay and

7
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:29,118
what's the name of the brand so the name

8
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,338
of the company that we originally

9
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,140
started was eco firma farms yeah which

10
00:00:31,338 --> 00:00:35,210
was an indoor cultivation facility in

11
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,530
just outside about 30 minutes outside

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:41,808
Portland Oregon okay and the company was

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,070
crushing it in the Portland market the

14
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,780
company was crushing at the Portland

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:48,049
market even though our market in the

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,850
Oregon Market Eco firma farms was the

17
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:51,288
first company in the country to

18
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,539
nationally advertised that they

19
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:55,179
wholesale cannabis and put a phone

20
00:00:53,539 --> 00:00:59,539
number and email address to go with it

21
00:00:55,179 --> 00:01:01,820
back in 2012 and so we took it a

22
00:00:59,539 --> 00:01:04,099
full-page ad out in high times and made

23
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,448
that statement with our logo and to be

24
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,459
honest with you most of my friends said

25
00:01:05,448 --> 00:01:08,959
you're gonna go to prison and that

26
00:01:07,459 --> 00:01:10,969
didn't happen and we established

27
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:12,769
ourselves as a brand and kind of took

28
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:15,019
off from there and went down a path of

29
00:01:12,769 --> 00:01:18,530
sustainability looking at how you could

30
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:20,269
cultivate cannabis indoor and be carbon

31
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,680
neutral how could I look at an outdoor

32
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:24,229
farm we said you're destroying the

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,510
planet and feel good about myself and

34
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,670
say no I'm not so so we took off down

35
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,710
that PLAs path and we were 100% carbon

36
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,329
neutral our power was 100% wind power

37
00:01:30,709 --> 00:01:34,759
because we had that opportunity in

38
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:36,799
Oregon and then that just kind of

39
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:38,900
planted the seed of how do we get rid of

40
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,519
our garbage how do we use light how do

41
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,190
we use automation how do we grow

42
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:45,109
vertically what do we do to to be more

43
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:47,239
sustainable and what we learned was that

44
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:48,679
by being environmentally sustainable we

45
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:49,909
actually started creating corporate

46
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,310
sustainability and financial

47
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,890
sustainability so when we went through

48
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:57,620
our public audit when we sold the

49
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:01,460
company and we were the primary company

50
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:03,650
in an RTO to go public we found in the

51
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:06,469
audit that we had made it to 189 dollars

52
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:08,840
a pound to produce indoor cannabis which

53
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:12,340
is in a lot of cases less expensive than

54
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,340
a good deal of outdoor farms

55
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:20,909
you

56
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:30,150
it was really access to capital for the

57
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,550
expansion looking at Oregon and that

58
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,289
market in particular I think it was a

59
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,270
good representation of what you can see

60
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:37,650
in a supply demand as it gets larger

61
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,080
throughout the country and everyone's

62
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,210
going to see it eventually but Oregon

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,520
was a great example we went in a 90-day

64
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,980
period from a wholesale price of $2,600

65
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,810
a pound to a wholesale price is 600 a

66
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:50,909
pound in 90 days

67
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,409
so the attrition rate there is really

68
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:54,509
really high and what happens is you get

69
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:56,849
a lot of farms then who will start

70
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:59,189
selling cannabis for below their average

71
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:00,449
cost to produce just to try to get a

72
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:04,109
little back into the retirement account

73
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:07,530
right so for us we saw that and said we

74
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,570
need to a we need a lot of upgrades so

75
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,669
that we can produce cannabis for even

76
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:13,979
lower and we found ways to do that and

77
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:15,030
we also need to create a vertical

78
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:17,579
integration model here between

79
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,990
processing and retail and in order to do

80
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,880
that we're gonna need a lot of money a

81
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,860
lot more than usually a individual

82
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,449
investor is willing to put out right so

83
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,830
we looked into doing an IPO or an RTO

84
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:30,959
reverse takeover or initial public

85
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,730
offering and in looking at the RTO and

86
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,950
trying to decide how you do an RTO

87
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:37,469
figure it out where do you go where do

88
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:39,419
you start how we happen to have an

89
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:41,669
opportunity where another company had a

90
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:45,209
show already and they were looking for a

91
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:48,659
cannabis company and we collided in the

92
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:50,640
middle and we helped them take their RTO

93
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:54,569
into cannabis and they helped us take

94
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:56,579
our company public so you're now

95
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:59,400
basically in bed with this other group

96
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:02,370
right like they own a piece of equity in

97
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,129
the new co so they own a hundred percent

98
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,159
so what we did in the in the sale was we

99
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:09,359
struck a deal for and it's a lot of it's

100
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,879
public you can read about it but we

101
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,430
struck a deal for cash and for

102
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:18,779
investment future investment to move

103
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,949
forward and so they acquired you this

104
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,529
under purse okay got it

105
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:24,000
and now but you're saying they now own a

106
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:25,739
hundred percent of the company so you

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
don't have any equity in the company so

108
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,769
we did what's called a share purchase

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,819
agreement yeah so we took a lot of

110
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:34,379
shares okay right all right yes all

111
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:37,110
right so it's a pretty deal it was an

112
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:38,040
equity deal because it was mostly stock

113
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,629
not a lot of

114
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,480
that's one of my passion subjects

115
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:45,550
because I'm always curious that implies

116
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,800
that you believe that their share price

117
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:50,770
is not currently overvalued and will go

118
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,680
up I do because a lot of these deals

119
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:56,529
that you see in the press every time I

120
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,040
see a deal I say I bet it's like 90 plus

121
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:02,109
percent stock a couple million dollars

122
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,330
of cash and so that was your deal but

123
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:07,270
you were so it means you have confidence

124
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:11,918
in that group because they're gonna be

125
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:15,759
steering the ship correct yes ah maybe I

126
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:17,049
should say that different okay um you

127
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,659
ever heard the phrase the first one

128
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:21,639
through the door takes the most rounds

129
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,290
so typically the first one through the

130
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,740
door takes the most rounds they also get

131
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:29,710
the best deal so the deal that we struck

132
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:31,389
at our time going with them I was

133
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:33,219
confident was going to be a multiplier

134
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:36,250
for us in value in the future

135
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,720
that being said future deals don't tend

136
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,319
to get the same deal so a lot of times

137
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,270
when you see the Cresco labs 850 million

138
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:45,219
dollar purchase of a distributor in

139
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:48,399
California that's not their first

140
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:50,470
purchase and so how much of that is

141
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,819
stock and what is the lift going to be

142
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,770
out of that and where are they looking

143
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:55,719
for in a merger that is a completely

144
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:58,180
different play than to be the first

145
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,639
company to go public or the first group

146
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,560
of companies to go public and in my

147
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,870
opinion and the great thing that I got

148
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,879
to learning going public was I got to

149
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:09,069
learn from the very beginning how to do

150
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,199
an RTO how to take a cannabis company

151
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:13,959
public how to raise money for that

152
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,509
cannabis company and how to recognize a

153
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:19,779
lot of pitfalls that could be in what I

154
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:21,219
like to call the 1.0 of public cannabis

155
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:23,799
companies that's going on right now and

156
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,349
I believe the 2.0 is starting now which

157
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,509
is why I opted to leave the company that

158
00:06:26,348 --> 00:06:32,019
I was with and go start this new company

159
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:34,060
I start so to come leaving the company

160
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:35,469
is the one that just went public but

161
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,879
you're starting something new because I

162
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,200
was going to say it everything you're

163
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,550
talking about is implying that you're

164
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,500
gonna go through this process all over

165
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,348
again which implies that you're not

166
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,658
working full-time at the public code

167
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:49,029
that is correct so when I so based on

168
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:51,670
you sold your company you are now out of

169
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:54,809
the operations of it and you're now

170
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:58,150
focused on starting your next thing with

171
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,959
the cash part of what you receive from

172
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:01,149
the last deal

173
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:04,180
yeah the cash end the experience right

174
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:06,609
and okay so what are you now doing so I

175
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,389
am now opening I'm going to do an RTO

176
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:12,100
and we're going to open we're going to

177
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,569
consolidate companies once we have the

178
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,790
companies consolidated that we want

179
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:17,680
which were in LOI is with right now we

180
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,870
will then as a group take all of those

181
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,759
companies public with a shell that I

182
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:26,259
already possess okay and and what what

183
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,899
what part of the supply chain are these

184
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:31,029
companies in that your cobbling together

185
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:32,649
we're looking at everything from full

186
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:35,829
vertical integration so indoor and

187
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:37,449
outdoor cultivation processing retail

188
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:39,339
and then we're also looking at some tech

189
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:40,899
pieces and some manufacturing pieces so

190
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:45,789
like your LOI s are they with like a

191
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:48,959
processing company or like a retail yes

192
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:51,189
yes and yes okay so basically you're

193
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,409
three quarters of the way through

194
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:56,139
getting the whole vertical stack

195
00:07:53,410 --> 00:08:00,070
together the band together and then it's

196
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:01,990
announcing the public going public once

197
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:03,759
we have them we build all the financials

198
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,300
and have everything there to show

199
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,560
investors what they would be investing

200
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,629
in in our potential for gain in the

201
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,250
future and our experience level then we

202
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:14,079
will take it public and go raise capital

203
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,759
for that larger endeavor with all the

204
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,979
companies together so you're inspiring

205
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,509
to all the dudes who are actually guys

206
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,879
who know what they're doing from a

207
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:23,469
cultivation standpoint so you're an

208
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:25,810
example of somebody who's not going to

209
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,670
be a finance guy coming and rolling up

210
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,680
the cannabis space you're a cannabis guy

211
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:32,200
who's gonna do what the finance guys

212
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,090
have been doing in the industry correct

213
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,340
I'm a cannabis guy who got the

214
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:39,430
opportunity to learn the finance piece

215
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,860
of it over the last three years in on

216
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:46,059
the public side and so I'm gonna take

217
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,649
that experience with me into this new

218
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:50,859
endeavor and I was also fortunate enough

219
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:52,750
when we built eco firma at least from

220
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,279
what we've seen on public market and

221
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,740
what we've seen with REI and the power

222
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,480
score we also built one of the most

223
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,399
efficient gardens in the country so

224
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,409
being able to take that experience into

225
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,299
other businesses and be able to work

226
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,110
with them to create that efficient model

227
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:09,578
it's

228
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:10,778
where I would like to be someone will

229
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:11,949
shoot me for saying this but I would

230
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:14,078
like to be one of the first cannabis

231
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:15,430
public cannabis companies to right out

232
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:17,828
of the gate start giving out some

233
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:20,799
dividends even if they're not much yeah

234
00:09:17,828 --> 00:09:23,019
because it would be about that would be

235
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:30,789
not yes I don't think many of them are

236
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:33,009
very close to that right now so you're

237
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:35,740
not going to be stretched super thin and

238
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:38,769
trying to madly acquire things and

239
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,629
overpay for things and okay so basically

240
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:43,419
it seems like on your pitch deck you're

241
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:46,269
probably showcasing the fact that you're

242
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:48,309
the lowest cost indoor producer in terms

243
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:50,139
of capabilities and then you want to

244
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:51,849
scale this across the country and into

245
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:53,319
different markets like you want to do

246
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,240
the vertical and integrate so you're

247
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:57,160
doing the vertical integration in Oregon

248
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,379
right correct and then you want to start

249
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:01,419
attacking other states we're doing the

250
00:09:59,379 --> 00:10:03,578
vertical integration nationally so

251
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:05,620
Oregon will have pieces in it and organ

252
00:10:03,578 --> 00:10:07,419
is just a good example of where vertical

253
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:09,370
integration is key because of the market

254
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:12,360
that they are but vertical integration

255
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:15,310
in different states all have different

256
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,909
value points and so looking at a state

257
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:22,359
like um Nevada which I think is a great

258
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:23,769
example or Arizona Nevada Las Vegas

259
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,850
we're looking at 40 million tourists a

260
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:27,009
year that come through here that's the

261
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,528
that's the population of California that

262
00:10:27,009 --> 00:10:31,389
come through in a year just in tourism

263
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:35,198
having a footprint down here in retail

264
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:37,360
is a really good idea that being said

265
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:38,859
cultivation down here is substantially

266
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,039
more expensive than it is in say

267
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,539
Humboldt County or Southern Oregon once

268
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:49,838
we can open those borders up and start

269
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:55,360
moving cannabis south having an indoor

270
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:56,320
facility looking at the markets across

271
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,360
the country

272
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,129
and figuring out whether this is what

273
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,190
always blows me away about the money

274
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:06,698
that has spent then spent on those like

275
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:09,190
Desert Hot Springs facilities where all

276
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:11,588
you can think of in your mind is you

277
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:14,410
guys realize that in three years or five

278
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:15,380
or whatever it is that this facility is

279
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:19,250
going to be

280
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:21,049
a complete waste and so the implication

281
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,759
is that yes they do know that but they

282
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:25,729
think that they can make so much money

283
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:28,370
in the short term to justify that huge

284
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:30,680
capex correct right it's all an

285
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,629
estimation of ROI but I don't think

286
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:35,269
they're gonna make it out what we're

287
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:38,090
gonna find out in California we're gonna

288
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:41,809
find out all right so basically you're

289
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,759
so but your roll up do you have a name

290
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:47,419
by the way

291
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:49,250
yes okay you're gonna have sex your

292
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:50,089
brand names than that right yes okay

293
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,700
thanks

294
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:55,519
the mantas growth is really just for the

295
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:56,900
public capital public market in terms of

296
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,730
you you want to roll up a couple

297
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:01,519
companies and then go public with a big

298
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:02,750
tada moment my question and I just want

299
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,990
to make sure I understand the answer is

300
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:07,940
you're rolling those companies up in the

301
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,440
Oregon market like when you say you're

302
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:12,830
doing it nationally does that imply that

303
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:17,270
you're you're you have an LOI with like

304
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:19,759
a manufacturing company that has

305
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:24,079
manufacturing operations across multiple

306
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:26,059
states okay so good questions we are

307
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,580
entering an LOI right now in California

308
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:34,789
to acquire 32 licenses Oh

309
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:36,560
so in color for the the supply chain so

310
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:38,569
it could be a district distribution so

311
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:40,399
that's from one company that's from one

312
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:44,420
company okay so you're gonna you're

313
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:47,179
about to roll up a company that has that

314
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:50,209
is doing well in the California Mark

315
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:52,009
like building out this vision in this

316
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:55,280
market specifically so you'll have them

317
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:57,590
and then and then we're looking at a

318
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,470
company in Nevada that has cultivation

319
00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:02,120
and a retail footprint but you don't

320
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,250
like cultivation I don't but you are

321
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,149
gonna sell that as retail alright so you

322
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,370
would keep it you wouldn't try to

323
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:10,340
immediately sell that off right okay but

324
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,049
it has to be right for the purchase

325
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:14,240
price of the valuation to understand

326
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:16,909
what are we paying for it now what are

327
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,950
we looking at for the retail side if we

328
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:20,990
have to close down cultivation at one

329
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,730
year two year three year what are we

330
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,590
looking for for capex to be able to fund

331
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,690
that or not take a big hit grow and

332
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:28,100
that's really the discussion of the LOI

333
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,160
right and that's really the

334
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,528
responsibility

335
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,719
of us to the investors if I am taking

336
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:36,870
public money from investors be it I

337
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,879
bought 10 shares myself or I am a

338
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:41,399
private placement investor my

339
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,930
responsibility is to ensure that you may

340
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,629
not know the cannabis space really well

341
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:47,068
I do so my responsibility with your

342
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:48,990
money is to ensure that I spend it

343
00:13:47,068 --> 00:13:54,299
wisely so that we can gain value in

344
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:57,740
those shares whether it's for the no so

345
00:13:54,299 --> 00:14:00,688
that's so that's interesting that you're

346
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,519
so you're gonna you're tada moments

347
00:14:00,688 --> 00:14:04,349
gonna be with like vertical integration

348
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,850
in California like what's up world we're

349
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:07,319
vertically integrated in California

350
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,810
we're vertically integrated in Nevada

351
00:14:07,318 --> 00:14:12,659
and like maybe one or two other states

352
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:15,000
and then so so I am right in thinking

353
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:17,338
that your your long-term vision is to

354
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,419
basically you know since every state is

355
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:25,529
for awhile gonna be its own silo of

356
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:27,509
economy right you're you're gonna just

357
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:28,828
build that out into all the legal states

358
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:31,079
and then in each state you're gonna

359
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:34,799
decide which part of the stack we want

360
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:36,388
to be operating in okay how well will it

361
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:37,948
play together when we can bring all the

362
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:39,480
states together when we can open up

363
00:14:37,948 --> 00:14:43,258
federal borders sometime in the next

364
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,850
twelve to thirty six months I really do

365
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:47,639
think that's probably a good estimation

366
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:49,560
a timeline and within that timeframe if

367
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,938
you're looking at your asset or at least

368
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:52,919
if you're looking at what you're

369
00:14:50,938 --> 00:14:54,539
acquiring for assets across the country

370
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:56,309
with that mindset that eventually

371
00:14:54,539 --> 00:14:58,169
they're all going to blend together and

372
00:14:56,309 --> 00:15:00,448
how are they going to play together have

373
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:02,009
we made a giant mistake or not that

374
00:15:00,448 --> 00:15:04,859
that's what we're looking towards am i

375
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:06,688
putting up ten million square feet of

376
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:11,430
flowering canopy space in Ottawa Canada

377
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:12,958
I mean I hope not and I'm not saying

378
00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:14,489
that it's a terrible investment are not

379
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,049
saying terrible things about a company

380
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,209
that's there I'm just saying there's a

381
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:20,969
you know there's there's a reason people

382
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:24,328
don't buy substantial amounts of wine

383
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,680
coming out of Paducah Kentucky it's not

384
00:15:24,328 --> 00:15:28,289
because Kentucky's a bad place it's

385
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:31,789
because grapes grow better in California

386
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:34,198
it's just nature so looking at

387
00:15:31,789 --> 00:15:37,318
acquisitions as a whole for whether it's

388
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:39,058
retail or technology or cultivation

389
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:40,259
trying to make sure those puzzle pieces

390
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:42,058
are going to fit together right in the

391
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:42,930
future is what I think we should be

392
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:45,269
doing

393
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:48,719
talk tech acquisition so you're implying

394
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:51,480
that you'd want to roll up some tech

395
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,910
type operators as well like what kind of

396
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,080
technology are you looking at I believe

397
00:15:53,909 --> 00:15:56,669
that there is some really interesting

398
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,600
technology out there surrounding

399
00:15:56,669 --> 00:16:02,579
genetics and crop management cultivation

400
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:06,028
has really interesting crop management

401
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,860
across an erp scale for one but even on

402
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:09,778
the cultivation side if you if you are a

403
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,339
fully vertically integrated company and

404
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:14,028
you think about what it takes from the

405
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:16,589
time you plant the seed or cut a clone

406
00:16:14,028 --> 00:16:18,838
until the time it sells at a retail

407
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:21,390
dispensary what the consumers going to

408
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,930
want and how to trend that and make sure

409
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:26,610
that you have enough durbin poison in

410
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:29,519
the month of July because that's when

411
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,169
it's the most popular to sell how do you

412
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,939
know when to plant it and where to plant

413
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:34,860
it and which fee knows to plant it and

414
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,960
what environment it grows best at being

415
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,990
able to track that with software and

416
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,540
data to ensure that you can put that in

417
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:45,360
the hands of a $15 an hour employee and

418
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:47,099
it's all done right that's gonna be a

419
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,320
pinnacle piece towards towards crop

420
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,389
management for these large companies so

421
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,700
so it seems like with your vertical

422
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:56,100
integration you you could almost build

423
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,650
out like what you would want a

424
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,680
technology solution to be able to do for

425
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:03,750
your vertical integration and then take

426
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,808
all the data coming out of all that

427
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:10,078
making sense of it but then scaling it

428
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:12,299
to then selling into other operators

429
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,849
yeah that data becomes very valuable

430
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:18,149
yeah if I can tell you exactly what

431
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:21,688
plants yield exactly how much in every

432
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:23,730
product from pink shirt raw flour to BHO

433
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:25,620
what our highest price points are what

434
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,929
our best turpan e terpenes are what our

435
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:29,819
best cannabinoid profiles are and how

436
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:32,340
they sell in each market and all of that

437
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:33,779
is not six people crunching numbers as

438
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:35,669
cost accountants in an office that we're

439
00:17:33,779 --> 00:17:37,558
paying for but it's taken care of and

440
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:39,779
software and it's one cost accountant

441
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:41,609
that can look through it pick apart the

442
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:43,200
numbers analyze it and then the software

443
00:17:41,609 --> 00:17:45,269
can actually tell us what we need to be

444
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,429
doing that all the way down to the crop

445
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:50,339
level for harvest or all the way up at

446
00:17:47,429 --> 00:17:53,519
the retail level for distribution those

447
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:56,189
pieces are right so base that you'd be

448
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,500
looking to either build or acquire like

449
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:00,160
do

450
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,440
analytics capabilities that are getting

451
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,960
that are servicing and getting data from

452
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,029
different parts of the of the supply

453
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,590
chain yes and there are companies out

454
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:10,720
there working on it now okay so we've

455
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:12,970
been in talks with a couple of them got

456
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,279
it cool all right I like I like the

457
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,259
vision and I guess the special sauce is

458
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,940
you know what do you bring to the table

459
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:21,519
that nobody else does it's basically I

460
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:24,100
can grow indoor weed for cheaper and

461
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,589
better than anybody I wouldn't say

462
00:18:24,099 --> 00:18:29,349
better than anybody but point being like

463
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:31,779
right I think of generally right

464
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:34,689
I started at I've started what I like to

465
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:36,849
think of as a competition for people to

466
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:39,820
be able to produce higher quality for

467
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:42,069
lower cost and at a completely

468
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:44,710
environmentally sustainable way so that

469
00:18:42,069 --> 00:18:46,269
we're not robbing Peter to pay Paul I

470
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,680
mean the end of the day we're all

471
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:49,240
polishing the brass on the Titanic

472
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:52,960
around here if you think that you can

473
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:56,980
don't rob Peter to pay Paul I'm not Paul

474
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,680
but so yes I think the experience from

475
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,809
going through the the small-scale

476
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:05,170
cannabis cultivation all the way through

477
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:07,480
a public acquisition and also being able

478
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:10,090
to do this cultivation and be able to do

479
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,589
it more efficiently right now than

480
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:14,319
anybody in the country on an indoor

481
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:17,049
scale I think those two pieces put us in

482
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:19,809
a very unique positions you know current

483
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:21,399
as obviously the technology you're using

484
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:22,899
in your indoor grow operation is going

485
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,090
to change over time but like current

486
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,500
snapshot in time can you walk me through

487
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:30,849
what you're currently using so you're

488
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:34,960
using like fluence lights so we're using

489
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:38,740
fluent lights we're using packaged HVAC

490
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,660
units at this moment which are already

491
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:45,519
antiquated because we built the grow

492
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:48,190
three years ago we're using regular soil

493
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:50,170
that we grow in that we amend with a

494
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:51,700
higher concentration of perlite so that

495
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:53,890
we have a little better drainage yeah

496
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,230
we're using an automated feed system

497
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,000
that also tracks all of our feed all of

498
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,740
our data and can back net tie into all

499
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,079
of our environment and Westham is a

500
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:10,000
rhythm to say and then

501
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:13,089
we use 20% salt based nutrient right now

502
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,919
10 to 20% and are you shouldn't say we

503
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:18,519
the company that we sold that's what

504
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:20,770
they were using when I left are you are

505
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:22,538
you making your own like that at what

506
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:24,759
scale would you make your own nutrients

507
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:27,129
instead of buying them like who do you

508
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:29,558
buy nutrients from right so time to do

509
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:31,990
that right now so maybe I should

510
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:33,369
backtrack the three most expensive parts

511
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,019
of running an indoor cultivation

512
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:38,139
facility at least for us when we went

513
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:41,859
through an audit was humans were number

514
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:45,640
one power was number two nutrients was

515
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:48,459
number three so humans finding ways to

516
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,288
you can reduce humans by upping volume

517
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,990
the more I don't need to double the

518
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:55,390
humans I have employed if I double the

519
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:57,099
amount of volume I am cultivating once

520
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,750
we had proof of concept of how we

521
00:20:57,099 --> 00:21:00,730
cultivated it in more of an automated

522
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,490
fashion so we could have doubled our

523
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:07,120
cultivation and probably only added one

524
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:09,339
to two employees so we can fix the human

525
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:12,519
scale right we can fix humans there in

526
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:14,649
our costs for cultivation power we're

527
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:16,900
looking at renewable energy like we had

528
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,820
a large grant for solar so you can start

529
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:22,059
chewing that power away solar batteries

530
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:23,470
putting up a solar field Condesa it's

531
00:21:22,058 --> 00:21:25,960
done a great job obviously with putting

532
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,490
up solar fields but you're also using

533
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,590
wind right and we use a hundred percent

534
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,839
wind power so you have like a little

535
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:34,269
wind turbine on top of the so everybody

536
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:37,899
says that because it a distributed wind

537
00:21:34,269 --> 00:21:40,480
power or throughout the gorge in Oregon

538
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,950
and Washington there are massive wind

539
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,720
farms so we buy our power from the wind

540
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,610
farm okay

541
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,589
and then obviously nutrient and

542
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:48,879
nutrients the big one right so for when

543
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:50,379
I left the company that was where we

544
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,720
were just getting into like being able

545
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,760
to dial down on how do we solve this

546
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,380
problem buying nutrients in a bottle

547
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:58,329
you've got vehicles on the road that are

548
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,039
having to deliver it which is cost

549
00:21:58,329 --> 00:22:01,960
you've got ninety percent of it which is

550
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:05,230
water which has cost a lot of marketing

551
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:08,470
cost the waste the recycling of the

552
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:10,870
bottles all those pieces so yes I will

553
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:12,308
tell you right now at five thousand

554
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:14,319
square feet of flowering canopy space if

555
00:22:12,308 --> 00:22:16,210
you're doing it efficiently it is time

556
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,720
to get rid of bottled nutrients now we

557
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,569
had dry

558
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,220
yeah but all right so but when you

559
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:23,990
hadn't scaled up like what were the

560
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:29,720
brands you were like what brands do you

561
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:37,839
like um we were using gosh I got to

562
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:41,028
think through it Botanica dragonfly yeah

563
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:44,569
we had some natural bat guano's that we

564
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:48,138
were putting in we had some see a green

565
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:50,089
that we were using and then you go to

566
00:22:48,138 --> 00:22:53,599
concentrate some buy bulk like humic

567
00:22:50,089 --> 00:22:55,339
acids humic and fulvic acids stuff like

568
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:56,839
that kind of a combination of all those

569
00:22:55,339 --> 00:23:01,278
pieces the salt base that we were using

570
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:03,648
was the the a and B base of Botanica

571
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:06,829
that was our only salt okay so basically

572
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:10,369
your soil alone was not it you're

573
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:12,048
actually adding basically the a and B

574
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:13,699
right we were adding the a and B and

575
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:16,069
then we were adding biologicals and

576
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:21,409
beneficials and microbial life to the

577
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:24,888
soil along with fungi so that we had a

578
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:26,778
good living we had we had good life in

579
00:23:24,888 --> 00:23:28,969
our soil where microbial life was in the

580
00:23:26,778 --> 00:23:31,308
neighborhood of 400 I forget the

581
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,528
measurement so that's that's gonna be

582
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:36,470
outside my education right but I guess

583
00:23:33,528 --> 00:23:38,839
my so that the the a and the B weren't

584
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,308
like killing the okay

585
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:41,839
no because if you actually look into

586
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:44,480
Botanica and what they're using on the

587
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:46,878
salt side for a and B it's it's it's a

588
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,319
very small amount of mineral salt that

589
00:23:46,878 --> 00:23:50,269
they use and that was a really big

590
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,888
question for us like well is it really I

591
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:54,259
mean that's what you hear but was it

592
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:55,579
true right so as we added beneficials we

593
00:23:54,259 --> 00:23:58,610
would test it we would test our

594
00:23:55,579 --> 00:24:00,558
microbial life from veg all the way

595
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:03,949
through bloom and we would look at right

596
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:06,109
after we fed two days after we fed when

597
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,990
we were when we were uh if we were

598
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:11,479
running just a cycle with straight water

599
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,829
and no food like what were those

600
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,298
microbial life levels were they

601
00:24:12,829 --> 00:24:15,918
diminishing were they increasing were

602
00:24:14,298 --> 00:24:18,288
they staying the same and we found that

603
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,788
even right after we fed we were not

604
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:24,048
losing any microbial life and it would

605
00:24:19,788 --> 00:24:25,940
gain over time so so what a night and

606
00:24:24,048 --> 00:24:27,679
then because you have the soil I assume

607
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,690
what you're adding from an A&amp;B

608
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,310
perspective is super diluted it's like

609
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,720
you're just adding a tiny

610
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:35,119
right right the plants are really

611
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,680
efficient in the methodology of

612
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:38,359
cultivation that we were using where

613
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,340
we're growing in a vertical stack and

614
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:43,879
we're sharing an environment and we're

615
00:24:40,339 --> 00:24:46,549
tooling up LED light and bringing up co2

616
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,830
levels and bringing up feed levels and

617
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:51,019
then monitoring actual runoff of feed in

618
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:53,299
the soil so that we aren't just throwing

619
00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:54,889
nutrients down the drain we could get

620
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:57,649
really precise with how much each

621
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:59,150
cultivar wanted to consume and it got

622
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:01,220
really interesting because you could put

623
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:03,769
for example we had rooms where we'd have

624
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,870
up to six strains in one cultivation

625
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:08,569
room and you would see things like the

626
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:11,059
flav you would test it in week 3 of

627
00:25:08,569 --> 00:25:14,179
flower and it would be at 35 parts per

628
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:15,859
million of phosphorous and maybe a 5

629
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,240
percent difference between the top and

630
00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:19,789
bottom of the plant and then you would

631
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,309
in the same room at the same time test

632
00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:24,559
the pineapple cush and it would be at

633
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:26,329
300 parts per million at phosphorus with

634
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,879
a 10% difference between top and bottom

635
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:31,549
so looking at the mobility of the

636
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,890
nutrient and that cultivar you learn

637
00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:35,930
that I need to give Flav way more

638
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:38,210
phosphorous at week 3 but we don't need

639
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:40,640
to put as much phosphorus fin over here

640
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:43,430
and you can really get finite with your

641
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,790
nutrient input and those cost savings

642
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:49,610
get really big over time right so all

643
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:52,159
right so and then are you making like

644
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:53,449
tees or anything like that or when I was

645
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,370
leaving we were just moving down the

646
00:25:53,450 --> 00:26:02,029
path of wanting to go into a compost tea

647
00:25:55,369 --> 00:26:04,879
but you know it was um being a coming

648
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:07,069
from the base of being a grower it's

649
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,960
always really fun to like throw all this

650
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:12,799
cool stuff at the plants and watch it

651
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,110
happen when really it it was time to be

652
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:17,539
really methodical so let's take away

653
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:19,009
just this one piece and watch let's add

654
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:21,049
just this one piece let's test

655
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:24,619
everything and find out so that we could

656
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:27,139
be really scientific in in our movements

657
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:28,759
and ensure that we weren't hey with did

658
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,230
compost tea plus we're testing for these

659
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:32,470
nutrient levels and we're changing our

660
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:35,059
nutrient water levels on a regular basis

661
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:37,100
I've lost track of what's affecting what

662
00:26:35,059 --> 00:26:40,190
now I was wasting money on labor and

663
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:41,599
time and testing bread so we had just

664
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:45,039
started to get ready to make compost

665
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,039
teas and go down that path when I left

666
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:55,939
right because there are farms and this

667
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,200
is the direction we wanted to go and

668
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:02,028
I've I've since looked at other farms

669
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:05,600
met with other farms there are farms out

670
00:27:02,028 --> 00:27:07,429
there who are using bed cultivation

671
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:10,038
they're cultivating in beds inside

672
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:11,840
they're rotating their soil they're

673
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:12,890
using a hundred percent organic input

674
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:16,158
and they're doing it under high

675
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:19,490
intensity LED light which is hard to do

676
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,350
because too much light not enough

677
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:22,370
nutrient if the plant even if you have

678
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:24,259
enough nutrient for the plant isn't

679
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:25,548
capable of uptaking said nutrient which

680
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:28,519
is always harder with an organic

681
00:27:25,548 --> 00:27:30,349
nutrient you're never gonna succeed so

682
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:31,398
just saying hey we're gonna recycle our

683
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:34,548
soil we're gonna use all organic

684
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:37,459
nutrients and we're gonna grow under LED

685
00:27:34,548 --> 00:27:39,200
in a tight proximity that that's not as

686
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,700
easy as it sounds right and a lot of

687
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,830
trial and error and then you were also

688
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,690
saying before that living what was the

689
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:46,009
living soil common living soil so

690
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:47,808
there's a really big you know there's a

691
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:49,849
lotta and it's just kind of nomenclature

692
00:27:47,808 --> 00:27:52,129
we use right we use living soil we use

693
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:54,528
no-till that you know it's kind of the

694
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:57,140
catch phrases of the day for cultivators

695
00:27:54,528 --> 00:27:58,819
living soil no-till soil their their

696
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:00,500
cultivation catchphrases of the day

697
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:02,599
right the last year or two it's been a

698
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:05,599
really big catchphrase for we're gonna

699
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:07,189
do living soil or we do no-till Korean

700
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,719
natural farming is another one right

701
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:12,048
they're really popular and they're

702
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,899
popular methodologies but we sometimes

703
00:28:12,048 --> 00:28:17,200
as cultivators just trying to get our

704
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:19,699
point across we'll use that terminology

705
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,330
inappropriately and so to say that we're

706
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:27,200
using a no-till indoor maybe you really

707
00:28:23,329 --> 00:28:29,808
are doing that but there are a lot of

708
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:34,069
methods to having a cover crop and a

709
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:35,960
living true living soil which the soils

710
00:28:34,069 --> 00:28:38,210
not alive it's the life inside the soil

711
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:42,788
but we all know that to have it to truly

712
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:44,890
be using a no-till methodology indoor is

713
00:28:42,788 --> 00:28:48,589
extremely difficult to do that

714
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:50,750
efficiently and that begs the question

715
00:28:48,589 --> 00:28:52,398
what efficiency are trying to accomplish

716
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:55,308
because if the only thing you're trying

717
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,959
to accomplish is say that I use a

718
00:28:55,308 --> 00:28:59,599
no-till and plant cover crops indoor

719
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,389
well then congratulations like you've

720
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,138
accomplished it but if you're looking at

721
00:29:02,388 --> 00:29:04,729
it from the bottom line or

722
00:29:03,138 --> 00:29:05,779
mathematically or if you're

723
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,849
you can get it from a sustainability

724
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:10,369
whether it's financial corporate or

725
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:12,469
environmental sustainability you have to

726
00:29:10,369 --> 00:29:14,209
look at it from the point of why am I

727
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,890
doing this am i doing it so I don't have

728
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:18,079
to spend more money on soil because I

729
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:19,460
can continually reuse it am i doing it

730
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:21,470
because it's better on the environment I

731
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,179
am not flushing salts down a city sewer

732
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:26,660
system because I grow in an industrial

733
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:29,120
section in the middle of LA did I build

734
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:31,820
a bio Swale out back that will then an

735
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:33,769
Ag land be able to put native plants and

736
00:29:31,819 --> 00:29:36,439
they will burn off whatever nutrient

737
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:38,929
organic or non-organic that goes in all

738
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,669
these factors play in what is the

739
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:44,480
purpose and if the purpose should always

740
00:29:40,669 --> 00:29:45,679
be sustainability and sustainability

741
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,970
financial and sustainability

742
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,160
environmentally because at the end of

743
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:50,779
the day if you can't keep the lights on

744
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,130
you're not making money nobody's gonna

745
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:55,009
hear a damn word you have to say about

746
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:57,530
saving the planet right ok but so so

747
00:29:55,009 --> 00:30:01,940
what I'm hearing is that you're saying

748
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:06,109
it will cost more to produce in a living

749
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:08,179
soil indoor we're talking about so the

750
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:10,459
way you'd have to say is yeah but that's

751
00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:12,048
my number one priority I'm willing to

752
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,579
pay a little more maybe the market could

753
00:30:12,048 --> 00:30:15,918
like maybe there's a branding

754
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:18,769
opportunity where the market appreciates

755
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,509
indoor cultivators who are at least

756
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:22,900
trying to be as environmentally as

757
00:30:20,509 --> 00:30:26,419
friendly as possible so good pull back

758
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:28,130
the actual thing that I'm trying to say

759
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:30,620
I've always been trying to say is that

760
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:32,570
that's the myth it's actually more

761
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:34,808
sustainable and more efficient it is

762
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:37,279
cheaper to cultivate indoor

763
00:30:34,808 --> 00:30:40,099
environmentally sustainable than it is

764
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:42,440
to not to use salt based nutrients in

765
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:45,769
smart pots with soil that you throw away

766
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:48,620
every time compared to figuring out how

767
00:30:45,769 --> 00:30:51,889
to use organic inputs that take water

768
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:53,509
only on efu land in a hundred percent

769
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:55,970
carbon neutral sustainable cultivation

770
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:57,109
methodology it is less expensive to do

771
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:59,509
that and you will create a better

772
00:30:57,109 --> 00:31:02,479
product for the end-user but your when

773
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:06,859
you left you guys are using you're not

774
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,870
living soil you're adding salts

775
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:10,369
we were because we were moving because

776
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:12,289
we had changed so many things on an

777
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:15,589
environment to just figure how to do it

778
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:18,109
that when I left we were still using

779
00:31:15,589 --> 00:31:18,409
that but we were moving down the path

780
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:20,059
the

781
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,320
rid of it which is why I say we were at

782
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:24,200
189 a pound when we went through a

783
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:25,369
public audit I have 100% confidence that

784
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,840
had I have stayed with the company and

785
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:28,969
we implemented the pieces that we had

786
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:31,429
looked at we could have gotten below 75

787
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,980
and part of that is adding like a living

788
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:35,900
soil gameplan getting rid of all of

789
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,220
those bottles you misunderstood what

790
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,690
you're saying I thought I were saying

791
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:45,559
that it's impossible with living soil to

792
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:48,370
reduce the cost lower than other nozzles

793
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:52,069
what I was saying is using a

794
00:31:48,369 --> 00:31:54,559
regenerative soil methodology endure

795
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:56,539
under LED light requires a lot of

796
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:59,960
different input it is not the same as

797
00:31:56,539 --> 00:32:02,389
growing under a kavita using advanced

798
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,279
nutrients they are 100% different

799
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:06,140
methodologies and you have to get really

800
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:07,879
comfortable being uncomfortable changing

801
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,580
that and finding your way through it and

802
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:14,030
believe me we fell on our face figuring

803
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:16,220
out our pieces of it and so basically as

804
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:21,049
you launch the new company your grow

805
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:23,089
operations will be soil no salts we will

806
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:25,909
be focused on a large scale with an

807
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:27,769
ethos around sustainability cool 100%

808
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,910
that doesn't mean that the companies we

809
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:30,470
take have to be there when we get there

810
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,300
they just have to be open to changing to

811
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,819
get the right one you're talking about

812
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:38,029
like what you liked about being able to

813
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:40,879
kind of like you know have your a and B

814
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:43,639
so it seemed like you were saying with

815
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,720
what you just left you could say strain

816
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:50,509
a has its own nutrient supply it's not

817
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:52,519
it's not running the dosatron the

818
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:54,470
dosatrons not running the same stuff to

819
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:56,240
all the different strains but you're

820
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:59,210
