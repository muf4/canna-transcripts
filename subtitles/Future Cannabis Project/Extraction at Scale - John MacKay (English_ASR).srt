[Music]

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:16,089
so john mckay you gave a presentation on

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:19,570
extraction yesterday at the conference

4
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:22,149
and you started by asking everybody how

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,129
many of you do extraction and like three

6
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:26,618
people raised their hands and then what

7
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:29,079
was the next comment you made the next

8
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:30,820
comment i was making was more of saying

9
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:33,429
why would you possibly want to do that

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:36,250
so that this the presentation was about

11
00:00:33,429 --> 00:00:40,539
whether you build up your own extraction

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:43,659
company or whether you do in-house so

13
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:45,310
but wait but does that redundant or of

14
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:47,319
you outsource oh i'd had to do the

15
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,650
indoor sigh meeow meeow

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,179
so the seminar was about whether you do

17
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:54,369
in-house extraction or whether you

18
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:56,380
outsource so that would be two different

19
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:58,209
choices that aren't the same correct and

20
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,460
so if i went back through is as easily

21
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:03,130
as informative and confusing as that

22
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,719
statement but the part that's important

23
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,299
is is with the number of people that are

24
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:09,010
now into the industry and the number of

25
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:11,728
people that are that are looking to be

26
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:17,770
totally vertical is very different from

27
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:19,120
2017 2016 for sure back to 2013 and

28
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:20,679
before that there were probably just

29
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,329
three or four vendors there were four or

30
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,580
five different ways to do extraction

31
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:27,069
most of them came from Hollywood called

32
00:01:24,579 --> 00:01:30,280
the cottage industry and it was a very

33
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:31,779
very different world and now as you move

34
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,790
towards the hemp world which is

35
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,368
significantly different enormous numbers

36
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:39,420
as well on the scope scale in the scope

37
00:01:36,368 --> 00:01:42,219
nobody here hemp farm extraction yes Oh

38
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,478
300 is is a small one so some of the

39
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:45,908
people that I'm working with now are

40
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:47,260
moving to 7,000 even here in the United

41
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:49,840
States and so there was no one doing

42
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:53,590
seven thousand a booba cush sit so have

43
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:57,700
a give me like a per thousand acre

44
00:01:53,590 --> 00:02:01,299
what's the volume of biomass oh my gosh

45
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:04,090
our per acre yeah so if I was to go back

46
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:08,379
through a back track another way and

47
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:10,239
that is the entire flow no matter what

48
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:12,908
the the yield would be from an it from

49
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,719
an acre is and the reason I wouldn't

50
00:02:12,908 --> 00:02:16,250
give that answer is because

51
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,169
a number of different percentages up in

52
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,090
Canada it's a very low percentage in

53
00:02:18,169 --> 00:02:22,039
Europe it's a lower percentage here in

54
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,740
the United States people are have got

55
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:27,199
varieties that are 20% CBD for example

56
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,480
call it CBD a because it's not CBD and

57
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:33,259
then but but they're also doing some one

58
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:37,909
to one CBD to CBC and they're in one to

59
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:42,679
one of CBD to THC V and at the same time

60
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:45,400
they've been able to take out the THC so

61
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,930
now you have no THC or very little THC

62
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,709
just quickly when you mentioned Canada

63
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:54,980
versus let's say in California when you

64
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:57,020
said Canada is low low yielding or low

65
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:58,669
what so they that within their laws and

66
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,459
stuff they're they're less than the two

67
00:02:58,669 --> 00:03:02,689
percent many times of the hemp that

68
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:05,750
they're making so they have to be able

69
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:12,469
to extract no real hemp that's you know

70
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:14,719
low low percentage THC CBD hey you mean

71
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:17,659
they have a cap on the amount of CBD

72
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:19,580
that they can my understanding so I

73
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:21,139
don't want to give misinformation but at

74
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,810
the same time anyone I've talked to up

75
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:25,729
there it's a very low amount of CBD a

76
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,289
that they're trying to get out of of the

77
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:31,129
of the plants that they're growing that

78
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:32,659
their regulatory allowed to do yeah

79
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:34,189
which I would fact-checked

80
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:36,169
okay I will definitely a fact check it

81
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:40,280
but I find that interesting so in Canada

82
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:43,189
they're breeding genetics that basically

83
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,120
have a low yield of anything kind of

84
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:49,969
yeah I mean definitely low THC because

85
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,090
that's a requirement and low CBD which

86
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:55,069
for I mean pretty much everybody who's

87
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,879
growing hemp in North America right now

88
00:03:55,069 --> 00:04:00,530
is for isolate and extraction is that

89
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,729
kind of that is true

90
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:05,840
like nobody's making it for clothing or

91
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:07,069
people that are doing it so you'll find

92
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,159
people that are growing some of the

93
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:12,949
agricultural ones with the long stalks

94
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:14,509
but but because when people have to make

95
00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:16,430
that decisions on how they're going to

96
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:20,329
use their land currently with the CBD

97
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:22,160
being at such a high you know price then

98
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,750
they they're making the choice between

99
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,099
should I make a thousand dollars an acre

100
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,930
sure and I make a hundred thousand

101
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,909
dollars an acre the the numbers are

102
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,120
pretty

103
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:34,570
you know drive you towards the CBD right

104
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,579
so you you're the guy who comes in at

105
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:39,639
the tail end of the whole process which

106
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:42,759
is the extraction but it seems like you

107
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:46,300
would have a say in the conversation

108
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:48,579
around what varietals or cultivars what

109
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,910
hemp cultivars cultivators are

110
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:53,259
cultivating so can you talk about kind

111
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,630
of what you're seeing out therapy

112
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:59,289
because I feel like hemp cultivars are

113
00:04:55,629 --> 00:05:02,019
so new in North America that nobody has

114
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,790
like a tenure track record with I've

115
00:05:02,019 --> 00:05:06,099
been growing this type and it's a high

116
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:10,120
yielding this that or the other so

117
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:12,820
what's going on from a you know planting

118
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,430
different cultivars and seeing what is

119
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:18,699
the most prolific in terms of extraction

120
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,139
or other and purposes so it's really

121
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:21,819
interesting on some of the things that

122
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:23,259
I've learned to the industry especially

123
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:25,269
over the last three years with the hemp

124
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:26,889
because before that you know I didn't

125
00:05:25,269 --> 00:05:28,689
pay much attention probably most people

126
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:33,219
didn't but when you're looking at it now

127
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:35,709
the it's it's growing a cultivar that is

128
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,740
regionally specific and growing a

129
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:40,659
cultivar that people understand how to

130
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,720
transport the plants to wherever they're

131
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,910
going to the education some propagation

132
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,040
from propagation to the field okay and

133
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:51,130
then also the number of people that are

134
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:53,620
experts at being able to know how you

135
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:55,480
plant it and when you plant it I also

136
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,819
see the farming equipment coming in and

137
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,390
so that they're planting those the other

138
00:05:57,819 --> 00:06:02,949
part is when I go to the first crop so

139
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:05,289
there's people I know that are wanted to

140
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:06,639
grow 7,000 acres and I'm always telling

141
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,620
them and where are they growing out

142
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,810
they're growing it California and New

143
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,209
Mexico Colorado and you go back through

144
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:17,680
and you have Kentucky and you go back

145
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:20,979
through and you and you bring them back

146
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,900
to 25 or 300 acres and you will see the

147
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,879
difference as it moved to their first

148
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:26,319
crop of things that are small things

149
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,180
that are big you know the plants that

150
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,040
are high the plants that just died and

151
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:32,199
so the first year is to figure out oh my

152
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,280
gosh hemp is very sensitive to where

153
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,930
it's growing you can have one that's

154
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,789
three feet tall and one that's 12 feet

155
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,310
tall because that's where you figure out

156
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,720
you know where the best soil is or

157
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,360
whatever happened or something gets

158
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,550
flooded

159
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,979
or something gets dried out so in

160
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:48,800
Kentucky for example the the filtration

161
00:06:45,978 --> 00:06:50,449
the way their land is it filters very

162
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,348
very clean water but it filters very

163
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:55,788
quickly through that in in Oregon I've

164
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:57,319
seen stuff that's clay I could

165
00:06:55,788 --> 00:06:59,568
practically make pottery out of what

166
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:02,120
they're growing it in and then so each

167
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:04,580
one is so widely different and each one

168
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,228
has to be variety different so you can't

169
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:08,269
just buy seeds online like I'm gonna

170
00:07:06,228 --> 00:07:12,199
grab big boy Tomatoes versus the small

171
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:15,288
ones so in can you give some examples of

172
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:18,020
some are we calling them varietals or

173
00:07:15,288 --> 00:07:19,818
cultivars cultivars okay so can you give

174
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:23,990
some examples of some cultivars that

175
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:25,848
you're seeing that people are start that

176
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:31,310
are starting to dominate the market in

177
00:07:25,848 --> 00:07:33,348
certain markets to take to sort of be

178
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,629
consistent with the fact that the

179
00:07:33,348 --> 00:07:38,870
different micro climates are conducive

180
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:40,550
to different cultivars so I'll start

181
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,889
with a quick one the quick answer is no

182
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,689
I can't okay the second answer is I

183
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:46,098
could kill a plastic plant so I've been

184
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:47,750
staying in my lane as far as the

185
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:50,899
swimlane whatever they have for a

186
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:53,478
cultivar that's out there then my

187
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:54,948
extraction will will be towards what

188
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:56,689
they're trying to get out of that but

189
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:58,669
it's but I've really stayed out of that

190
00:07:56,689 --> 00:08:00,379
side so now let's move on to the

191
00:07:58,668 --> 00:08:02,658
extraction side and I'm sticking with

192
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:04,669
hemp because I think it's something new

193
00:08:02,658 --> 00:08:07,699
and different and interesting video it

194
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:09,978
markets and so talk to me about like you

195
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:12,560
you have a facility in Oakland that for

196
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:16,189
cannabis you have all these different

197
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,478
extraction all this different extraction

198
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:20,778
equipment for different types of

199
00:08:17,478 --> 00:08:23,959
extractions so what ethanol co2 you're

200
00:08:20,778 --> 00:08:29,028
not doing butane we can talk about that

201
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:31,698
later but for hemp is there are you in

202
00:08:29,028 --> 00:08:34,219
that game like I am in that game out of

203
00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:36,620
that same Oakland facility okay so you

204
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:39,490
can bring in both cannabis and and him

205
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:41,778
yes into the same facility yes okay so

206
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:44,810
what's going on in the hemp world are

207
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:46,789
you starting this this is your first

208
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:48,319
year in operation so let's fast-forward

209
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:51,759
to the end of the year okay

210
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,980
when when harvest season is upon us

211
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:59,000
you're gonna get like this much cannabis

212
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:02,389
and this much hemp yes and so are you

213
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,278
ready for massive quantities of hemp and

214
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:06,049
and what do you what are the

215
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:08,778
conversations you're having with hemp

216
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:11,028
cultivators it's a great question so

217
00:09:08,778 --> 00:09:13,549
these these are the situations I have

218
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:17,269
currently so I have a facility that I

219
00:09:13,549 --> 00:09:19,729
would call the I won't call this a strip

220
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:22,639
mall sears and roebuck it's a strip mall

221
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:24,860
store and in that I'm able to show the

222
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:26,990
smaller components of how to do each

223
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,329
type of extractions so ethanol at

224
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:32,899
different temperatures minus 40 minus 20

225
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:36,289
you know room temperature also being

226
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:37,659
able to do refrigerant-134a which is you

227
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:39,980
know totally legal it's a

228
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:43,338
tetrafluoroethylene so that's has its

229
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,839
own different extraction characteristics

230
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:48,380
sealed a number of different types of

231
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:51,110
co2 co2 plus ethanol co2 plus terpenes

232
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:52,879
different ways of doing the co2 and then

233
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:56,959
also another way that we've been doing

234
00:09:52,879 --> 00:10:00,078
it is with modulated cavitation so

235
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:02,809
modulated cavitation is a process where

236
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:04,909
you take the material mix it with a

237
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:07,399
solvent that's either ethanol or water

238
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:10,068
or a combination of the two and you

239
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,839
bring it through down to a quarter inch

240
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:14,599
so it grinded down to a quarter inch and

241
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,060
I bring it through a ear odor that's

242
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:20,540
that allows me to do flows through

243
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:23,448
cavitation and I can be able to modulate

244
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:25,969
how much cavitation I'm providing a

245
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:28,208
shock wave and then from there I have

246
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:32,959
post-processing but so how does it work

247
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:34,818
analogy for this is um is a garden so if

248
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,888
I have a garden and I go the spicket I

249
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:38,539
get a bucket of water I bring it back to

250
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:40,370
the garden I put it on the guard and I

251
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:42,679
go back in another bucket of water pour

252
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:47,899
it on the garden so that's what I done

253
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:49,759
and that's continuous batch batch can be

254
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:52,850
slower but what I've developed is that

255
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,439
by it they them what we developed with

256
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:58,220
another company out of Rome Georgia is

257
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:01,250
is a hose so now it's more of taking

258
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,589
that as a continuous flow so on that

259
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:06,649
side being able to do on a small side

260
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:07,620
say 12 pounds a minute on a very small

261
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:09,690
footprint

262
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:11,759
now the small footprint means that I've

263
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:16,320
still gotta feed that beast so I'm doing

264
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:19,259
it in Oakland Oregon New Mexico Southern

265
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,540
Cal where I have larger facilities that

266
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:24,000
would be a remote refinery so my Oakland

267
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:26,039
facility would allow me to show how it

268
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,440
works and then bring it out to a much

269
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:29,159
larger facility where I can do 120

270
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,780
pounds a minute

271
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:32,100
so Oakland is almost like a showroom

272
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:34,980
it's almost like a little strip mall

273
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,950
showroom okay but I'm still able to get

274
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,720
great yields out of there and and so

275
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:42,210
that's where I'm I'm doing that I'm also

276
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,990
doing refining there for pesticide

277
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:51,540
remediation as well as stripping THC out

278
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:55,919
of out of hemp processes okay so so with

279
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:58,049
with the hemp farmers companies brands

280
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,699
that you're talking to like what are the

281
00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:02,309
questions they're peppering you with

282
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,020
when it comes to extraction it's it's

283
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:05,359
interesting because the farmers are it's

284
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:07,980
everyone's swimming in their Lane

285
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,830
everyone's staying there I feel like if

286
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:12,779
I'm in lane number three I'm I have Lane

287
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,430
two and one next to me and I have four

288
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:16,889
and five on the other side sometimes I

289
00:12:14,429 --> 00:12:18,419
think lane five has a shark but other

290
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:20,370
than that you know Richard Dreyfuss I'm

291
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:23,339
just waiting to go out on the path when

292
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:25,919
I'm going back through their questions

293
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:29,879
are I've got this material how do I

294
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:31,500
prepare it for any type of extraction a

295
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,090
lot of times you'll have the big groves

296
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,970
in there saying well I'd love to do

297
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,530
ethanol and I'm you know if you go back

298
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:39,450
and we're talking baked hemp crows or

299
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:41,309
dig camp crows and you go back through

300
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,330
and you and you start to do the math for

301
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:44,699
them and they realize that they're gonna

302
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:46,650
need a twenty two thousand gallon that's

303
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,000
an all tank outside to support what they

304
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:50,159
believe they're going to be doing so

305
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,570
that's that's the other this is a

306
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,569
scenario where they'd want to do it

307
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:56,250
on-site or they have their own refinery

308
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,660
that they want to do it their place okay

309
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:00,330
so they're asking you questions about

310
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:03,509
building out their own refinery yes okay

311
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:05,129
and it's a it's amazing the number of

312
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:06,629
people that will grow and then halfway

313
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:09,659
through their grow of realizing that

314
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:11,039
they've got to extract it so and then

315
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:12,120
where do you bring it so some of the

316
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,099
things that we talked about yesterday

317
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:15,750
even during the presentation was do you

318
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,159
grow your own or do you find a place

319
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,139
that's outsourced that you can bring

320
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,399
your material to that you feel confident

321
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:24,159
that they will provide you

322
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:27,639
the extraction that you need and for

323
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:30,819
hemp cultivators are those facilities

324
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:33,159
popping are reliable facilities popping

325
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,930
up around the country to process

326
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,610
there's reliable business models that

327
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:39,039
are popping up around the country and

328
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,169
some of them are really making them so I

329
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,699
would say that if you had four or five

330
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:44,019
in Kentucky that would be a good thing

331
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,990
because you need one in Lexington you

332
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:48,699
need one in Pulaski you need one in in

333
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,830
in Louisville because of the number of

334
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,740
people growing if I was in Oregon I'd

335
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,810
have one in Medford Salem Portland so it

336
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,180
the number of people that are in Bend

337
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:59,739
see the number of places that that are

338
00:13:58,179 --> 00:14:01,899
growing the major ones to have a

339
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,490
refinery if I was saying that there was

340
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:05,620
one business model that's out there

341
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,529
right now that would be the most profit

342
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:12,700
all I would I would start to build local

343
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:14,709
refineries for hemp processing it is for

344
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:17,259
anything for him processing because once

345
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:19,300
you sew so when I go back to when I look

346
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:21,850
at him so cannabis has you know type 1

347
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:23,589
type 2 type 3 is a lot of people are

348
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:27,129
starting to adopt that so type 1 would

349
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:29,470
be high THC low CBD type 2 would be you

350
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:33,429
know 1 to 1 and type 3 would be a high

351
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:35,470
CBD low THC so the plants are are the

352
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:38,649
same as far as what an extractor sees

353
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:40,450
you know if I'm making if I have a you

354
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:43,809
know the different types of oranges I

355
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:45,759
don't really care it's a so-so for you

356
00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:47,829
from the extraction side it doesn't

357
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,799
matter whether it's hemp whether it's

358
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:53,110
high THC cannabis the Machine looks at

359
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,240
it the same way the machine has no idea

360
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:58,149
so a car has no idea who the driver is

361
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,409
right same thing and that you can have

362
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:01,809
different types of cars so you have a

363
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:04,419
Miata you have a you have a two-seater a

364
00:15:01,809 --> 00:15:07,000
four-seater you have a SUV and you have

365
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:09,759
a bus and if they're all going from Las

366
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,190
Las Vegas to LA and they're all at the

367
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,750
same speed then they're all going to get

368
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,950
there at the same time but it's it's

369
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,600
only the difference in the number of

370
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,720
people that are in it and that's a yield

371
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,629
type of thing right

372
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,580
okay like what what are some other so it

373
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:24,620
seems like with the hemp world one of

374
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:27,860
the one of the major things is just the

375
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,810
sheer scale of the amount of biomaterial

376
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:35,529
all these farms are gonna have it's not

377
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:38,750
the same as a 1 Acre cannabis farm so

378
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:40,309
the equipment is it just literally like

379
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:44,299
you said for the ethanol it's getting a

380
00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:48,259
20 mm gallon what stainless steel tank

381
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:50,029
for the outside right to be able to to

382
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:51,789
do that so there's a number of companies

383
00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:56,240
out there that that already do

384
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:59,269
large-scale processing for the botanical

385
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,970
materials and I would say hop OPS's of

386
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:03,980
botanical material right and so you know

387
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:06,410
beer industry uses a ton of it uses a

388
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,750
ton and ton and tons of it and so

389
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:10,399
there's there's extractors up in Yakima

390
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,320
that looks like a Saturn you know three

391
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,120
rocket for gosh sakes I mean it's that's

392
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,129
and they have the processes down they

393
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,929
they make pellets they do this they do

394
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:20,600
that so they have that process down so

395
00:16:17,929 --> 00:16:23,779
when we were doing you know a cannabis

396
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,700
on the type one we didn't we didn't if

397
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:28,159
anyone had that much material that would

398
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,780
be amazing that would you know solve the

399
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:35,120
you know have the whole world's amount

400
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:39,589
of THC in one day but with hemp and with

401
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:43,519
the use of CBD in so many products in so

402
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:45,889
many box stores now it's the extraction

403
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,100
side is allows you to have something

404
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:52,340
that will provide a quality product

405
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,320
every time but the thing that that is

406
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,540
most important for all the for people to

407
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,310
judge and that is what are there whether

408
00:16:56,539 --> 00:17:00,019
they're clean in place how are they

409
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,609
doing what's the cleaning validation how

410
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,009
do I know that the person before me

411
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:06,410
didn't run pesticides and somewhere it's

412
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:08,088
somewhere in your tubing so all of all

413
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:11,660
those things when you have an outsourced

414
00:17:08,088 --> 00:17:13,909
that's a great idea for for um monetary

415
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,740
but you also have to ask them lots and

416
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:18,140
lots of questions about the cleaning and

417
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,509
what they're cleaning validation is and

418
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:23,060
how they're doing that so that actually

419
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:24,500
raises a good point can you give in

420
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:28,279
addition to that a couple other

421
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:30,150
questions that someone bringing raw

422
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:32,579
material to a next

423
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:35,550
action facilities should ask oh that's

424
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:37,949
great so number one they should they

425
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:39,750
should ask about the cleaning validation

426
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:41,759
so that's that's one the other one is to

427
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,279
be able to meet with the chemical

428
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,140
engineers and the chemists that know how

429
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:49,680
to do the processing on the extraction

430
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,840
side and the post-processing on the back

431
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,990
side so if you're doing a ton of

432
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:57,659
material or a couple tons of material

433
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:59,370
extracting almost easiest part the

434
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,930
second part is it's how you get rid of

435
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:03,089
the ethanol because I've seen a number

436
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:06,660
of companies all across the world that

437
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:09,539
will they will take a low THC you know

438
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:11,460
less than the 0.3 0.1 and by the time

439
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:14,490
they're done process and you can be 5%

440
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:18,090
and the reason it's 5% is because when

441
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:20,370
you do a processing with CBD a and you

442
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:22,409
do it with ethanol or that sort of

443
00:18:20,369 --> 00:18:24,869
processing you you have such a high

444
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,490
conversion over to Delta 9 so when you

445
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:30,689
look at the molecule itself it will

446
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:32,640
convert very quickly from CBD a 2 to THC

447
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,140
through a couple number of steps but

448
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,810
even through a couple numbers steps you

449
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,640
might have 48% CBD and 10 percent THC

450
00:18:36,809 --> 00:18:41,549
while you're well well over the limit

451
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,860
and you made it yourself so you want to

452
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:47,430
ask about you know how are they doing

453
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:49,289
that on a small scale and what what's

454
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,240
going to happen on a large scale and put

455
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:53,460
it into the contract that if they you

456
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,279
know if they chemically convert it that

457
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,319
you want to have you know a way of

458
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:01,079
repartee or something that allows you to

459
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,909
go and do that so I would say what do

460
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:05,189
they know about thermodynamics what do

461
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:07,590
they know about mass transfer what do

462
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,690
they know about the entire process is is

463
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:14,549
critical actually on that topic

464
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:17,610
what's the legality around I bring my

465
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:19,710
harvest to the processor and it's below

466
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:21,599
the point what is the point zero three

467
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,789
percent point three point it's below the

468
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,789
point three percent and they give me a

469
00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:29,159
final project that's above it is there

470
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:33,569
is there any way to water it down like

471
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:35,970
so to speak or like you know because now

472
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:38,819
it's illegal like I can't make a hemp or

473
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:40,930
are a CBD product that I can sell

474
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:43,899
nationally

475
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:46,990
so even totally what's my next what's my

476
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:48,910
recourse how do i salvage it so they

477
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,559
should have processes in place that then

478
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,779
when it goes over that they know how to

479
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,509
bring it down to that limit so there's a

480
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:57,519
number of different very very

481
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:59,890
rudimentary ways so if you're at 53

482
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:03,069
percent CBD and you're it I'll make up

483
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:05,080
two percent THC so through the process

484
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:07,359
it just happens it's chemistry it just

485
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,579
happens and so now you want to have a

486
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,349
way of bringing you want to get rid of

487
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:13,029
the THC but what you're gonna do is

488
00:20:11,349 --> 00:20:14,409
you're gonna sacrifice some of your CBD

489
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:16,509
so your forty eight percent is gonna go

490
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,550
down to forty for your two percent is

491
00:20:16,509 --> 00:20:20,950
gonna go down to you know less than the

492
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:23,049
point three but so now somewhere in the

493
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,460
contract you have to be able to say that

494
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:25,930
if you have to go back through and get

495
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:29,799
rid of my THC and you're sacrificing

496
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:31,870
some of my CBD you know where's what's

497
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:33,849
that price model look like so somewhere

498
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:35,859
in the contract you have to be able to

499
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:38,289
say when I get this back I want to have

500
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,659
this amount of CBD based on what I'm

501
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:45,519
providing you for a plant

502
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:50,650
are you putting something into like

503
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:54,069
what's the if the CBD is forty percent

504
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:55,900
in our case study and the THC is four

505
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:59,799
percent which is way above the point

506
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:02,500
three percent what's the third

507
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:05,589
ingredient that's being added in to

508
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:08,769
dilute everything else so not so much a

509
00:21:05,589 --> 00:21:11,980
dilution but more of a an absorption of

510
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:14,379
both so when you have your when you have

511
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,450
your water filter on your on your local

512
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,400
on your sink in the kitchen and your and

513
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,080
you're using that also for your for your

514
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,880
drinking water well your your collecting

515
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,960
all the pesticides and the other things

516
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,930
that are in there your collecting

517
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,509
everything you know so the same thing

518
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:30,490
would happen here whether you're using

519
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:32,920
diatomaceous earth a combination of

520
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,960
diatomaceous earth and carbon black you

521
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,060
know whatever that concentration is and

522
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,690
whatever temperature that's at you can

523
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:42,069
add absorb both the CBD and the THC but

524
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,509
you're going to absorb everything else

525
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:46,839
to everyone else is going to be in there

526
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:48,549
so if your goal is to get to no THC then

527
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:50,169
you're gonna compromise the rest of the

528
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:51,669
entourage effect cuz you're only going

529
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:53,110
to get the CBD so you're not adding

530
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:55,330
something you're saying

531
00:21:53,109 --> 00:21:59,589
through some sort of filtration to pull

532
00:21:55,329 --> 00:22:01,990
things out yes ideally only THC but we

533
00:21:59,589 --> 00:22:03,970
know other stuff's gonna be milk too so

534
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,609
you're pulling more THC out than for

535
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:10,029
example the CBD until you've gotten the

536
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:12,308
THC down to 0.3 we've lost a whole bunch

537
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:16,470
of other stuff you have this basically

538
00:22:12,308 --> 00:22:16,470
the filter now has or the sponge or the

539
00:22:17,308 --> 00:22:21,759
in a contract you have to know that

540
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:25,150
those things can happen it will happen

541
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:27,519
so now in that contract I would you know

542
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:29,860
put in some sort of you know closet says

543
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,960
I that if you have to do this what else

544
00:22:29,859 --> 00:22:34,389
am I losing that I I don't want to have

545
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,759
just a nice lid I want to have something

546
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,559
with the other components in it right so

547
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:41,769
if you were doing that if you're doing

548
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:46,058
super critical fluid chromatography so

549
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:46,859
instead of Superman often do that but

550
00:22:46,058 --> 00:22:52,240
could keep going

551
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:54,250
continue what that will do remote

552
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,740
ography will separate out the THC you

553
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,410
can take the THC out and keep all the

554
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,058
CBD and all the friends in there because

555
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,370
you're just taking one component out

556
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:06,039
very specifically okay so that's a

557
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:09,459
method so if in our example were above

558
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:11,710
the THC allowed limit that's another way

559
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,990
to do it by and you only take out the

560
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,569
THC and you don't lose anything else yes

561
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,400
but it is since you started by

562
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:19,720
describing another methodology as the

563
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,940
implication that this is a much more

564
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,890
expensive way to do it or yes so the

565
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,740
your capital expenditures is much higher

566
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:28,900
so most people don't have the what was

567
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,819
the critical fluid chromatography they

568
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,110
don't have those machines no they don't

569
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:34,240
okay and there's other ways to do it

570
00:23:32,109 --> 00:23:37,629
I'll here the centrifugal partition

571
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:40,029
I'll see counter current but both the

572
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,770
counter currents bettered well actually

573
00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:43,899
just quickly with your questions yes an

574
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:45,879
extraction facility a good question B do

575
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,600
you have one of those machines on site

576
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,470
because if they do and yes they can

577
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:53,119
resolve this problem

578
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,009
yeah much easier than if they don't have

579
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,449
that much right or B or through a

580
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:58,579
contract say I don't care how you

581
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,200
extract I don't care if my THC goes up

582
00:23:58,579 --> 00:24:02,389
because you're gonna you're gonna take

583
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,370
it out anyhow so I don't care what you

584
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:06,920
do as long as you give me back CBD and

585
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:08,449
all my friends THC or less yeah and all

586
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,710
my friends so some people will make a

587
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,170
nice little and it doesn't matter

588
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:13,910
because they're gonna get pure material

589
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:15,200
but you're gonna still want to as I'm

590
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,640
thinking out loud you're still gonna

591
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,809
want to know I came in with twenty

592
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,550
percent of cherry wine great product I

593
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:24,409
have all my terpenes those are the ones

594
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:27,440
I want and I want you to give me back

595
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:29,390
you know my terpenes at this ratio with

596
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,820
an acceptable and my lost with no THC

597
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:33,890
well that's a different criteria you've

598
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:36,079
got to be able to match that criteria so

599
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:38,900
set up that contract on what you what

600
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:41,599
you want and if they and most I would

601
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,430
think the most extractors on the

602
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:46,519
refineries the local refineries will be

603
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:48,110
fine with saying okay I I can't do that

604
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,970
I'm doing it this way I can't give you

605
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:51,979
that you know go to go to another one

606
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,569
right and this and that's why it's

607
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,490
important to ask those questions so yeah

608
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:57,049
that kind of honest feedback and answer

609
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,910
because you can't assume that they're

610
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:00,829
just gonna give you everything back you

611
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:03,080
have to have some allowable loss you

612
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:05,750
have to have some allowable chemistry

613
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:07,519
going on if you don't have that it's I

614
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,470
tell people that if you start off with

615
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:11,779
even internally that you're gonna lose

616
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:14,059
thirty percent even on a good day if

617
00:25:11,779 --> 00:25:15,710
it's twenty percent that you're starting

618
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:17,000
off with you're not getting twenty

619
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,130
percent of the concentrate you're gonna

620
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,509
thirty percent goes somewhere you're

621
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:23,120
lost losing it all the way to the

622
00:25:20,509 --> 00:25:24,769
process kind of expected you have to

623
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,259
have expectations that are reasonable

624
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:29,150
for your investors because if they think

625
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:32,180
is twenty most people on the investment

626
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:34,009
side are well schooled on economy they

627
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:36,680
are not well schooled on extraction nor

628
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:38,809
do they world a rights alright so now I

629
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,670
want to so we've kind of that was like

630
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:42,169
my hemp conversation yeah obviously

631
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:44,570
touched on this stuff now I want to get

632
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:47,660
just right into old-school cannabis

633
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:51,500
extraction love it let's get ready yeah

634
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:53,660
with extraction you have basically come

635
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,000
up with a new what was the not

636
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,759
methodology but process yes I say call

637
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,970
it's more process more process so can

638
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:04,519
you a talk about that process and then

639
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:07,519
talk about you have kind of the showroom

640
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:10,059
of extraction types up in Oakland so can

641
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:12,500
you give me like walk me through

642
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:14,690
customer comes in and they want to do X

643
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,269
let's bring you over to the alcohol

644
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,740
extraction machine next customer comes

645
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:20,720
and wants to do something different

646
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:23,750
that's more appropriate for the co2

647
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:27,079
extraction machine yes so let's start

648
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:30,319
with the new process okay so on on the

649
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:32,569
new processes it's um it's a technology

650
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,399
that's been used in the hops industry

651
00:26:32,569 --> 00:26:35,869
now for the last four or five years so a

652
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,410
lot of people in the hops industry are

653
00:26:35,869 --> 00:26:42,589
moving from the co2 which is which is

654
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:44,710
slower more selective to the technology

655
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:48,740
that allows them to do it quicker so

656
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:53,350
almost all I'll say well over a hundred

657
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:55,009
now different Brewers or hops

658
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:58,369
manufacturers are using the technology

659
00:26:55,009 --> 00:27:01,160
all the way from the you know the craft

660
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:03,469
beer up to the you know larger beer

661
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,330
manufacturers and so what happens with

662
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:07,400
that is you're trying to have it not

663
00:27:05,329 --> 00:27:09,199
have all the acids and the bitters and

664
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:12,200
so this technology what it does is it

665
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,809
allows it to to break apart that the

666
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,880
hops and at the same time you know

667
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:19,579
reduce some of the alpha-beta acids so

668
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,940
then you bring it towards cannabis and

669
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:25,639
so on cannabis side an extraction means

670
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:28,400
that that a solvent goes into the into

671
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,080
the trichome you take the material it's

672
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,640
soluble and it moves outside the

673
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,949
trichome and then moves on its way so

674
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,020
the first part is thermodynamics it's a

675
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:39,230
solubility it's a temperature it's a

676
00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:42,470
type of solvent and what it will grab so

677
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:44,269
much like so like making a tea so if I

678
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,370
get a teabag and I put it in I put it in

679
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:47,750
with ice there's not a lot of extraction

680
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:49,399
that's happening if I put a you know as

681
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:51,619
I increase the temperature of the water

682
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:54,080
it allows me to get more components out

683
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:56,209
so that's how that a shorter period of

684
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,889
some shorter period of time and so when

685
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:00,350
when I'm looking at the cavitation what

686
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:02,630
it does is it does two things number one

687
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:06,109
with the modulated cavitation so not a

688
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:08,000
shearing motor or ultrasound on both of

689
00:28:06,109 --> 00:28:09,829
those they just everything gets torn

690
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,769
apart everything gets through sound

691
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:14,089
waves everything gets burst but when

692
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:17,609
you're looking at the modulated when

693
00:28:14,089 --> 00:28:21,509
it's a way of of bursting the trichome

694
00:28:17,609 --> 00:28:23,039
without bursting the plant cell wall so

695
00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:24,329
now I'm not getting a lot of the other

696
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,730
components that are sitting in the

697
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:29,309
chlorophyll like chlorophyll and all all

698
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:30,750
of her friends and so what happens is I

699
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:32,159
go back through with the trichome it's

700
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,069
like breaking up an egg and now it's

701
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:38,490
it's open to to the mass transfer of

702
00:28:35,069 --> 00:28:40,259
just moving along so so my analogy

703
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,819
another analogy so if I'm doing

704
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:43,829
extraction and I'm trying to get the dog

705
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:45,659
out of the house I got to go into the

706
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:47,759
house find the dog bring the dog back

707
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,200
out if the dogs on the front yard it's a

708
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,029
lot easier to bring the dog

709
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,769
and so when I'm bursting the trichome

710
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:56,190
the dog is out in the front yard it's

711
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:59,639
freed for me to find so when it's moving

712
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:01,980
to that process if I'm using water the

713
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:05,220
cannabinoids are not soluble water

714
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,890
they're nonpolar so now using water as

715
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:10,079
my as my media it allows me to burst

716
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:13,970
open the trichome some material is free

717
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:16,919
and then I have biomass water and the

718
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:18,630
nonpolar is the cannabinoids then I go

719
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,460
through a horizontal decanting

720
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:23,130
centrifuge which means I'm spinning it

721
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:25,069
through the biomass drops out and now

722
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:27,600
I'm just left with the oil in the water

723
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:29,460
so my oil and water now I had to get rid

724
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,959
of all the other small things that we

725
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,809
can't see the fines and so I go through

726
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,340
at this stack at centrifuge and

727
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:37,740
therefore I'm able to get rid of the

728
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:41,069
fines and then my last part is just a

729
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,170
tri phase a decanter which is common in

730
00:29:41,069 --> 00:29:44,639
in the petroleum industry the olive oil

731
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,200
all these other things and so now what

732
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,509
that does is that separates the water

733
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,779
from the from the oil so when I'm left

734
00:29:48,509 --> 00:29:55,799
now with is everything that was open

735
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:57,509
from the trichome in the oil so what

736
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:59,039
I've done is it's not an extraction it's

737
00:29:57,509 --> 00:30:01,289
actually solvent less because I'm only

738
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:04,589
using the water as a solvent

739
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:06,750
one more analogy sorry back through so

740
00:30:04,589 --> 00:30:08,730
my analogy on that is I have waves the

741
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:10,859
waves come in it's a beautiful time on

742
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,390
the beach the kids are playing they got

743
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:13,979
their sandcastles every year you're

744
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:16,800
painting a good picture in my head very

745
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:19,140
nice so then I raise the the waves I

746
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,169
take out the sand castles kids are

747
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,880
crying time for a nap so now I can re

748
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,320
encrease that or if I'm a hurricane I

749
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,790
have different style hurricanes where I

750
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:29,730
can take out the first row at all the

751
00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:30,769
beach houses or if I'm a tsunami I can

752
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,240
take out the

753
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:37,129
almost like you can create a more

754
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:40,250
violent extraction yes sort of process

755
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:46,040
yes so tell me when do you want to use

756
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:49,250
the gentle waves versus the tsunami so I

757
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:51,740
can use the same technology and take the

758
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:53,720
biomass let's say the first time I take

759
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:55,279
out the sandcastles okay that's that's

760
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,079
good I can take out that's my trichomes

761
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,779
I take out the sandcastles but I'm

762
00:30:57,079 --> 00:31:01,428
leaving the houses okay so there's

763
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:03,289
scanning electron microscope that shows

764
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:06,140
that I am doing what I said I'm gonna do

765
00:31:03,289 --> 00:31:07,220
the second part is is now that I've done

766
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,690
that let's say I've gotten my

767
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,069
cannabinoids and everything's wonderful

768
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:12,019
so now I want to raise it what if I want

769
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:14,689
to take that biomass bring it back

770
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:16,670
through be more aggressive break open

771
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,890
the carbohydrates the polysaccharides

772
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:21,558
and now if I wanted to or through the

773
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:23,660
second means you could make biofuel you

774
00:31:21,558 --> 00:31:25,789
could make hempcrete you can take the

775
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:27,440
same thing and beat it up more and then

776
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:31,308
I can come back around do the tsunami

777
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:35,000
and then provide that as a biomass that

778
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:38,149
can go back on to the farmer's land so

779
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,779
okay I'm liking this so with this one

780
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:43,670
machine yeah we can do a couple passes

781
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:47,119
first pass is the delicate pass that

782
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:49,039
gets out all the essentially stuff that

783
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:52,819
the cannabis industry wants which is the

784
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,710
oils second pass I think gets to kind of

785
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:57,439
I feel like the disconnect in the marker

786
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:59,980
right now is you know with him coming on

787
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,808
the scene you think of hemp based

788
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:07,730
biomaterials nobody really has the

789
00:32:02,808 --> 00:32:13,700
infrastructure to get hemp to concrete

790
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:14,839
or let like that the infrastructure is

791
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,700
not there but you're saying with this

792
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:20,178
machine and also people are growing

793
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:22,370
varietals that maybe they're only doing

794
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:26,200
oil extraction and then just tossing the

795
00:32:22,369 --> 00:32:29,299
rest of of the biomass and you're saying

796
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,400
we could basically it's almost like how

797
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:33,259
you know the Native Americans would kill

798
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,710
an animal and use every part of it yes

799
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:37,710
whereas

800
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:38,909
we kill an animal and we just used a

801
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:41,130
little part of it and throw the rest

802
00:32:38,909 --> 00:32:44,850
away extraction number one is for the

803
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:50,789
oil extraction number two could be for

804
00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:53,158
hemp concrete and biofuel yes sure just

805
00:32:50,788 --> 00:32:55,339
like you get soy and corn okay

806
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,929
and then extraction three could be

807
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:59,699
making sure it's totally clean bat

808
00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:02,220
backed it to basically turn it into

809
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,298
compost yeah we'll put it back on the

810
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,980
line so I don't know if it would be

811
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:07,408
composting up but yeah put it back on

812
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:09,569
the land it could become okay so I see a

813
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:10,770
way so that I I've noticed there's a

814
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:12,089
couple companies that are a few

815
00:33:10,769 --> 00:33:15,450
companies out there that are that are

816
00:33:12,089 --> 00:33:16,648
taking people's waste and then making it

817
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,360
into him creat through other

818
00:33:16,648 --> 00:33:20,009
technologies there's other ways to make

819
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:21,569
Kim creat whether it's through acid or

820
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:23,579
whether it's through shearing motors or

821
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:26,189
whatever so there's other ways to do it

822
00:33:23,579 --> 00:33:28,740
but I'm I'm finding that the big hole in

823
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:32,669
this industry is everyone's if you grow

824
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:38,308
7,000 acres of hemp and you only take

825
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:41,070
that 10-15 percent of the oil and throw

826
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:42,599
the rest away what are you doing with

827
00:33:41,069 --> 00:33:45,599
all that waste where's that waste going

828
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:48,359
in in our United States and if we could

829
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:51,839
use it for everything else use it for

830
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:53,428
something else along the way so we one

831
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:55,168
of the things we talked about before was

832
00:33:53,429 --> 00:33:57,809
like depending on what the person's end

833
00:33:55,169 --> 00:34:02,929
goal is you'd use a different process

834
00:33:57,808 --> 00:34:06,148
and technology and extraction solvent

835
00:34:02,929 --> 00:34:09,929
what what would so you could let let's

836
00:34:06,148 --> 00:34:12,449
say ethanol would be the best process

837
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:13,889
for whatever the person wants to make as

838
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:16,618
an end product so you could do like an

839
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:18,960
ethanol extraction but then throw all

840
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:21,510
the biomass back into what are we

841
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,530
calling this so it shockwave but a shard

842
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:24,210
of Sean wait

843
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,950
yeah shockwave was the original one but

844
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:27,869
we're calling it clean wave I guess

845
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:29,969
respect but but am I thinking about this

846
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:31,740
correctly like you could do ethanol

847
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:34,279
extraction as a first pass and then

848
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:37,709
throw it into the the clean wave

849
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:40,050
extraction unit it's even it's like that

850
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:41,699
habit really better okay I can use the

851
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:43,409
ethanol as a solvent put it through the

852
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:46,199
shock wave so rather than doing any

853
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:48,119
soaking at all it's just going through

854
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:49,859
as vast as the ethanol so

855
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:52,349
I made up a new word for that so the

856
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:54,630
first part is it's a separation so it is

857
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:56,549
non solvent on the on the on the water

858
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:58,530
side so but that's a separation because

859
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:00,330
you're not using any solvent the same

860
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:01,769
thing can be done with ease and with

861
00:35:00,329 --> 00:35:03,960
ethanol is it's going through the

862
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:05,759
process but you break open the trichomes

863
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,590
so you're never doing a soaking step you

864
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,900
don't do a soaking step it just goes

865
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,400
straight through so I call that you know

866
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:15,119
a separation pledged in the extraction

867
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:18,059
so that's a separation clever but but

868
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,859
but point being we don't need to use two

869
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:23,690
different machines here it can all be

870
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:28,620
done in the shockwave yes / clean wave

871
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:31,200
extraction unit so so as you see kind of

872
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:34,259
like extraction of the evolution of

873
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:36,299
extraction equipment it is this like our

874
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:39,540
the Eden labs of the world gonna be

875
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:43,769
building these types of machines or well

876
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:45,539
I have exclusive patent so okay but wait

877
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:47,820
but but you said this has been done in

878
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:51,119
the hops yes so the separate patents for

879
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,650
hops versus a separate path cannabis so

880
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,039
you took something that you were seeing

881
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:58,769
in the hops space applied it to cannabis

882
00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:00,869
and filed the patent on that so I have

883
00:35:58,769 --> 00:36:03,269
exclusive rights to a patent from a

884
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:04,769
company that allows them to do that so

885
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:06,659
someone else owns the patent and you

886
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:10,050
have the exclusivity in the cannabis

887
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:12,210
space yes got it okay so but but then

888
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:14,160
would you license that out to other

889
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:15,210
people to build the equipment you need

890
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,219
or do you want to be building the

891
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,840
equipment as well so I be building the

892
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:20,369
equipment as well but I would be doing

893
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,200
more of a leasing model to have other

894
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:24,179
people take advantage of the same thing

895
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:27,449
because there's so many places that

896
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:28,649
outsourcing is is critical and the

897
00:36:27,449 --> 00:36:30,569
people that are growing should be

898
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:32,550
growing farmers know how to grow but

899
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:34,980
extraction isn't what they're doing so

900
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:37,110
if I have someone as a dairy farm then

901
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:39,300
they providing the milk from the cow but

902
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:41,220
then the cows can be used for yogurt it

903
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,990
can be used for cream it can be used for

904
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:45,059
ice cream it can be used for a lot of

905
00:36:42,989 --> 00:36:49,469
other things so you just want to be the

906
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:52,608
refinery for the dairy industry right so

907
00:36:49,469 --> 00:36:55,858
it it seems like this is revolutionary

908
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:58,980
or at least evolutionary I would say

909
00:36:55,858 --> 00:37:02,250
it's up to me it's it's evolutionary

910
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:03,420
okay because it's disruptive but it's

911
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,929
only because people haven't thought

912
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:08,730
about this one way of doing it for the

913
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:11,159
cannabis industry and and there was no

914
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:13,108
reason really to do it before because

915
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:16,529
there wasn't enough material in the hemp

916
00:37:13,108 --> 00:37:19,799
industry now changed all that changed so

917
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:23,040
the sheer scale of the introduction of

918
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,470
hemp to the processing landscape is

919
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:27,750
changing things so that it looks and

920
00:37:25,469 --> 00:37:30,689
smells more like hops which is produced

921
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:32,369
on you know however many Budweiser's are

922
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,400
sold in the world you need that much

923
00:37:32,369 --> 00:37:36,599
hops to support it okay so I would say

924
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,280
that they probably don't use that much

925
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:44,809
oil but on the scenes I would look at

926
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,339
that is that now you also have the

927
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:50,369
fabrication companies that are very used

928
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:53,539
to making large skids with a single

929
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:56,519
software interface that can be used for

930
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:58,639
your using the same technology for for

931
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:00,869
making sure eggs don't have you know

932
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:02,759
microbials in it or you're making sure

933
00:38:00,869 --> 00:38:04,890
that your so it doesn't beat up the eggs

934
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,510
so enough so that they the egg whites

935
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:08,400
turn into scrambled eggs you're just

936
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:10,380
making sure that it's cavitation enough

937
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,568
and so I'm using the same sort of

938
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,789
technology so when I use water I'm

939
00:38:12,568 --> 00:38:17,009
having to have a stronger wave so I

940
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:19,588
should I should say more that my ethanol

941
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:21,599
with with the cavitation would be more

942
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,889
like taking out two sandcastles my water

943
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,440
means I'm having to go up a little

944
00:38:22,889 --> 00:38:26,940
further and take out the houses right

945
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,519
because I need a little bit more energy

946
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:32,550
to break it up because ethanol really is

947
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:35,039
an extraction and so it's it's aided in

948
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:37,589
that yeah the ethanol already swells up

949
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:39,719
a lot of the trichomes some steam works

950
00:38:37,588 --> 00:38:42,420
because it bursts the trichomes and then

951
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:43,949
and then you you release the material

952
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,960
it's not actually doing in extractions

953
00:38:43,949 --> 00:38:47,848
steam isn't doing an extraction hot air

954
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:50,190
is not doing it it's bursting trichomes

955
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:52,680
so this is another way of making that

956
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:55,789
the material more more available for the

957
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:57,659
process got it okay mold mildew

958
00:38:55,789 --> 00:38:59,759
pathogens how do you make sure your

959
00:38:57,659 --> 00:39:01,289
water is clean as an input into this

960
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,289
process well one way or the other the

961
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:04,268
water is going to pick up

962
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:05,799
things at a water-soluble and so

963
00:39:04,268 --> 00:39:07,298
anything that's water-soluble is gonna

964
00:39:05,798 --> 00:39:09,818
be in the water layer anything that's

965
00:39:07,298 --> 00:39:12,759
nonpolar is gonna be outside the water

966
00:39:09,818 --> 00:39:14,349
layer so having that separation there if

967
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:16,509
I'm separating out the water then I'm

968
00:39:14,349 --> 00:39:19,059
not going to get it into the into the

969
00:39:16,509 --> 00:39:21,248
oil anyhow I think the other question

970
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:23,079
would be if there is mold and mildew on

971
00:39:21,248 --> 00:39:26,108
the cannabis is there a way to remediate

972
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:28,119
that into the final oil products so when

973
00:39:26,108 --> 00:39:30,608
you're leaning don't have that final

974
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:32,890
product so if you have that if it's if

975
00:39:30,608 --> 00:39:34,179
it's insoluble and want if it's soluble

976
00:39:32,889 --> 00:39:37,358
and water is gonna stay in the water

977
00:39:34,179 --> 00:39:39,400
layer if it's a size thing because those

978
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:43,298
are organisms and you're gonna pick them

979
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:48,459
up in your your-your-your filtration

980
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:50,918
step but I assume a lot of people in the

981
00:39:48,458 --> 00:39:54,428
history of cannabis have had moldy weed

982
00:39:50,918 --> 00:39:57,788
and run it for extraction and it is

983
00:39:54,429 --> 00:39:59,709
there a way to I know we don't want to

984
00:39:57,789 --> 00:40:02,949
highlight it as something to do but like

985
00:39:59,708 --> 00:40:05,198
can you take moldy weed and extract it

986
00:40:02,949 --> 00:40:07,509
and have no mold in the end product so

987
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,759
the way I would do that very mildew we

988
00:40:07,509 --> 00:40:11,978
we yeah so what I would do is is during

989
00:40:09,759 --> 00:40:14,528
that process the final step of the oil I

990
00:40:11,978 --> 00:40:17,318
would make sure the oil is now going

991
00:40:14,528 --> 00:40:19,568
through a process a post process if you

992
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:21,429
wanted to to take out those those

993
00:40:19,568 --> 00:40:22,989
components so if I was to again if I

994
00:40:21,429 --> 00:40:25,119
doing it by supercritical fluid

995
00:40:22,989 --> 00:40:26,409
chromatography it's not going to last

996
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,759
through that because you're going to do

997
00:40:26,409 --> 00:40:29,709
the separation you're gonna like pull

998
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:31,630
out what you want and that's not that's

999
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:33,248
not going to go through that process so

1000
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:35,318
I think there's different steps that

1001
00:40:33,248 --> 00:40:37,298
allow you to be able to make sure that

1002
00:40:35,318 --> 00:40:39,099
you're always making something in the

1003
00:40:37,298 --> 00:40:41,739
final product that's safe for the

1004
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:43,390
consumer but also safe for the people

1005
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:45,249
that are working on the instrument well

1006
00:40:43,389 --> 00:40:47,318
let me let me say it differently instead

1007
00:40:45,248 --> 00:40:51,578
of like a scenario where we have ungodly

1008
00:40:47,318 --> 00:40:53,558
amounts of mold and mildew farmers will

1009
00:40:51,579 --> 00:40:55,929
have a little bit of those things on

1010
00:40:53,559 --> 00:40:57,699
their crops and it's not bad I think

1011
00:40:55,929 --> 00:40:59,650
regulations kind of say you're not

1012
00:40:57,699 --> 00:41:03,099
allowed to have any of this any of that

1013
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:05,739
but at least through extraction you can

1014
00:41:03,099 --> 00:41:09,559
make sure there's zero of it versus in

1015
00:41:05,739 --> 00:41:11,690
flower form yes okay

1016
00:41:09,559 --> 00:41:13,639
alright so the other part that I would

1017
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:16,579
say is that it's the other parts of the

1018
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:18,349
water that are besides the pathogens

1019
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:19,489
that are more concerning like what's

1020
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:23,329
your ionic strength

1021
00:41:19,489 --> 00:41:27,709
what's your pH are you in Midland Texas

1022
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:30,049
are you in Ashe was at Ashland Myrtle

1023
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:31,550
it's gonna say North Carolina yeah like

1024
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,140
say Asheville North Carolina cuz that's

1025
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:35,990
still there and so now you have a very

1026
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:38,659
different water in Nashville than you

1027
00:41:35,989 --> 00:41:40,969
have in Medford Oregon or you have in

1028
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:42,559
Tacoma Washington or Yakima just keep

1029
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:44,359
naming them so you want to make sure

1030
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,159
that when you had the consistency on

1031
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,530
that you're gonna have to make sure that

1032
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:50,690
your pre-processing allows you to have

1033
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:52,880
that window of acceptability of what the

1034
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:55,639
water would be same way I have a window

1035
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,440
of acceptability of ethanol so when I'm

1036
00:41:55,639 --> 00:42:00,379
doing ethanol my first pass on ethanol

1037
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,150
even if it's 99 percent I'm bringing it

1038
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,519
back around for my second pass now I

1039
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:06,440
have 95 percent of bring it around the

1040
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:08,239
third pass that got 90 so you not only

1041
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,800
have temperature of ethanol but you also

1042
00:42:08,239 --> 00:42:11,509
have that you're changing that ethanol

1043
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:15,500
each time it comes around because it's

1044
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:17,450
picking up moisture right so the the

1045
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,429
reason I thought this technology was

1046
00:42:17,449 --> 00:42:21,319
exciting and why I became more and more

1047
00:42:19,429 --> 00:42:24,619
enamored with it and picked up the

1048
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:28,580
exclusive license for it was because I'm

1049
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:31,400
using wet plant I'm getting as close to

1050
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:34,039
the plant when you harvest it that I can

1051
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:38,119
and that way I have a maximum amount of

1052
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:41,929
all the compounds that are in that plant

1053
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:43,759
at at time t guys right now I do time T

1054
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:46,489
and I try it while I'm losing this I

1055
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,320
move it across I'm losing that I'm just

1056
00:42:46,489 --> 00:42:49,909
trying to get as close to the plant as

1057
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,700
possible and then maybe that's not

1058
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:54,349
significant maybe it is but at least at

1059
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:57,409
some point in time I have everything

1060
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:59,809
that started off there and then you know

1061
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:01,670
if people need to take things they find

1062
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:04,489
more parts that are more advantageous

1063
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:06,139
than others that's that's fine too but

1064
00:43:04,489 --> 00:43:07,789
I'm starting off with something it's

1065
00:43:06,139 --> 00:43:09,619
close to the plant or I can take a tribe

1066
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:11,300
it doesn't matter where the process is

1067
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:14,000
when I'm putting into it I have to make

1068
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:16,490
it acceptable for the process so if it's

1069
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,860
a dry plant I got to hydrate it I'm

1070
00:43:16,489 --> 00:43:20,569
gonna put it in a big 250 gallon stir

1071
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:23,019
with a great big stir and I'm just gonna

1072
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:24,789
make sure it's hydrated so it has water

1073
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:27,730
all the way back through it and then I'm

1074
00:43:24,789 --> 00:43:30,009
going to do a processing so in that

1075
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:32,139
scenario there's almost no reason

1076
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:34,870
somebody would send it through a drying

1077
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:36,460
process in advance of sending it to you

1078
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:38,319
well the only reason would be is that

1079
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:41,139
they were very remote and they wanted to

1080
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:42,580
carry it across large distances and they

1081
00:43:41,139 --> 00:43:46,000
didn't have a freezer truck and they

1082
00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:47,319
didn't unit in fresh frozen or life--all

1083
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,150
eyes it or something like that so

1084
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:51,460
whatever you have on that site because I

1085
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:53,349
think that that's as it grows having the

1086
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:57,340
refinery closer and closer to the farm

1087
00:43:53,349 --> 00:44:02,469
now for me is this something that's

1088
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:03,519
reality is CBD so amazing along the way

1089
00:44:02,469 --> 00:44:05,109
that we're not going to find other

1090
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:06,849
plants or we're not going to find other

1091
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:08,650
things that move through maybe it's

1092
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:10,089
maybe it's maybe it pops in three years

1093
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:12,340
and then you don't want six thousand

1094
00:44:10,090 --> 00:44:14,890
refineries sitting out there that are

1095
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:16,809
that are vacant so that you mentioned

1096
00:44:14,889 --> 00:44:19,000
fresh frozen can you tuck because fresh

1097
00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:24,190
frozen seems to be gaining market share

1098
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:27,010
so can you talk about it in the more

1099
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:30,490
specific way what well what are you

1100
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:34,080
seeing like are you involved in in fresh

1101
00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:36,939
frozen processing at all I'm involved in

1102
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,519
yes okay so the quick answer is yes so

1103
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:41,650
people who have wanted to to take part

1104
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:43,210
of their crop and experiment with fresh

1105
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,829
frozen I'm finding most people won't

1106
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:45,699
take the entire crop for fresh holes and

1107
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:46,960
they'll take a little bit and say I

1108
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:49,179
don't know this this work or not work

1109
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,130
put it in a put it in a freezer and

1110
00:44:49,179 --> 00:44:53,169
that's where it sits so a lot of my work

1111
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:55,750
now I've already done the dry work

1112
00:44:53,170 --> 00:44:56,860
that's plenty of dry material I figured

1113
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:00,280
out that when that button I went pretty

1114
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:01,750
quickly and but now the fresh frozen how

1115
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,840
do you get it so you make sure that you

1116
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:06,969
get it down to a quarter inch size so

1117
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:09,160
through a grinding process that doesn't

1118
00:45:06,969 --> 00:45:11,049
stall up because it's wet and those

1119
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:13,059
things are readily available out in the

1120
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:15,430
industry we're just repurposing them for

1121
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:17,559
cannabis and therefore that's how I do

1122
00:45:15,429 --> 00:45:21,789
my process flow stream them together

1123
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:24,190
quarter-inch size keep moving but the

1124
00:45:21,789 --> 00:45:25,539
dry how long do you dry it how long do I

1125
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:27,760
stir it and then bring it through the

1126
00:45:25,539 --> 00:45:29,800
same process so both of those are the

1127
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,320
same there's just the pre-processing is

1128
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:34,870
a little bit different I will say one

1129
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,670
more thing sorry and so on fresh frozen

1130
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:38,098
or on some No

1131
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:40,230
okay what what sighs you just wrapping

1132
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:42,180
up fresh frozen like what what are you I

1133
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:44,909
mean it seems like something you said

1134
00:45:42,179 --> 00:45:46,649
people allocate a part of their crop but

1135
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:48,929
it seems like that skin I can that's a

1136
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:50,849
trend that's going to continue right to

1137
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:54,058
expand you know and that it may may not

1138
00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:56,369
but from a processing standpoint is

1139
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:58,319
adjust in that pre-processing that for

1140
00:45:56,369 --> 00:45:59,880
you there's any difference and then it

1141
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:01,349
just becomes the same as anything else

1142
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:03,900
you're handling it's the same as

1143
00:46:01,349 --> 00:46:06,059
anything else okay except for the

1144
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:07,559
ingredient sitter and then are in it the

1145
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:09,390
compounds that you're going to get from

1146
00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:12,269
fresh frozen are different from the ones

1147
00:46:09,389 --> 00:46:14,039
that I see from the dry and what are

1148
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,358
those compounds certainly when you're

1149
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:17,039
when you're drying them off if you're

1150
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:19,108
not capturing the terpenes you're losing

1151
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:21,480
62 percent of your terpenes just through

1152
00:46:19,108 --> 00:46:23,608
the drying process especially the more

1153
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,409
volatile ones you're you're changing

1154
00:46:23,608 --> 00:46:27,150
some of the plant dynamics the plant is

1155
00:46:25,409 --> 00:46:29,578
still living by the way I mean you're

1156
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:33,180
still getting acetone you're still

1157
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:35,849
getting Porifera Knaus it's a you get it

1158
00:46:33,179 --> 00:46:37,318
from chrysanthemums but Prizren cannabis

1159
00:46:35,849 --> 00:46:39,599
makes prisoners as its own protection

1160
00:46:37,318 --> 00:46:41,429
right so you have all those different

1161
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,460
parts that are in there you also have a

1162
00:46:41,429 --> 00:46:46,409
concentration of of your of your acids

1163
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,659
so you have a lot more of the acids and

1164
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:50,250
I don't know if it's a trend or whether

1165
00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:53,789
it's different but you're seeing a lot

1166
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:56,940
more of the CBG a and then so in fresh

1167
00:46:53,789 --> 00:47:00,659
frozen yeah post processed material that

1168
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:02,338
yeah okay it so that's interesting so it

1169
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:04,608
seems like that's one of the reasons why

1170
00:47:02,338 --> 00:47:07,440
people are doing fresh frozen is to

1171
00:47:04,608 --> 00:47:11,219
capture as much of what was in the plan

1172
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:14,059
on its very last day alive yes as

1173
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:16,588
possible yes and and you're from a

1174
00:47:14,059 --> 00:47:19,410
processing standpoint seeing that

1175
00:47:16,588 --> 00:47:22,369
actually scientifically like yes that is

1176
00:47:19,409 --> 00:47:25,019
actually accurate as you are seen more

1177
00:47:22,369 --> 00:47:29,940
cannabinoids more more variety of

1178
00:47:25,019 --> 00:47:32,009
cannabinoids and terpenoids ride first

1179
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,990
quartz and the time that has gone

1180
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:36,869
through that process so time is not only

1181
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:41,039
the trying but from time T it's changing

1182
00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:43,019
so I find that also so now to go back

1183
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:44,789
through and support it through you know

1184
00:47:43,019 --> 00:47:48,090
lcms you know

1185
00:47:44,789 --> 00:47:50,429
high-technology stuff to show what the

1186
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:51,960
differences are and are they important

1187
00:47:50,429 --> 00:47:52,949
or not they're just different I don't

1188
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:54,690
know if they're important or not like

1189
00:47:52,949 --> 00:47:56,159
because we can't do all that medical

1190
00:47:54,690 --> 00:47:58,950
research the United States because it's

1191
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:01,289
federally legal she's a whole nother

1192
00:47:58,949 --> 00:48:02,669
conversation you were gonna make one

1193
00:48:01,289 --> 00:48:04,259
last point on something that wasn't

1194
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:07,079
fresh frozen probably wasn't the one

1195
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:10,230
last point but there's like no and I see

1196
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:13,259
the I can use the same device for making

1197
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:17,159
micro motions so once I have the oil I

1198
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:19,080
can whatever the solvent is let's say

1199
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:21,239
it's water I can make her micro-emulsion

1200
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:23,730
so when people talk me like nano sized

1201
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:25,319
micro so not nano sized because an

1202
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:27,150
animal motion most of the time what

1203
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,950
people do is say is they and I don't

1204
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:30,690
know what the actual specifications are

1205
00:48:28,949 --> 00:48:33,059
but it's based on size and whether you

1206
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:35,639
can call it nano or Micro it's a size it

1207
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:37,679
should I say size up from nano yes okay

1208
00:48:35,639 --> 00:48:39,869
and so when I'm looking at that it's a

1209
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:42,119
matter of their there are no water

1210
00:48:39,869 --> 00:48:43,710
soluble cannabinoids that that can't

1211
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,809
happen so they talk about water sorry

1212
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:47,490
but it's actually just emulsions so you

1213
00:48:45,809 --> 00:48:50,099
can't tell that it's not mix it's just

1214
00:48:47,489 --> 00:48:53,279
that the they're so small that you you

1215
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:55,199
it looks like it's dissolved the second

1216
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,910
part on that one is even though it looks

1217
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:59,609
like you can still see through it

1218
00:48:56,909 --> 00:49:02,399
there's other scientific ways of seeing

1219
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:04,050
whether it really is you know still in

1220
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,510
there are herbs clung to the side of the

1221
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:08,910
glass or whatever container plug so you

1222
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:10,590
can use the same technology where I go

1223
00:49:08,909 --> 00:49:12,299
back to the oil and water and I can go

1224
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:14,309
back to and make micro motions out of

1225
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:17,100
the same technology so I can use it for

1226
00:49:14,309 --> 00:49:19,289
the first part of doing the extraction

1227
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:22,039
call it extraction for lack of a better

1228
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:24,900
word and so but then I can also use it

1229
00:49:22,039 --> 00:49:26,900
after I'd done the field now I can make

1230
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:29,639
other products I can use it for

1231
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:31,410
emulsifying the lotion for emulsifying

1232
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:33,659
an ointment for a mole supplying a

1233
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:36,329
tincture for so you can use the

1234
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:37,649
technology not just on the first part so

1235
00:49:36,329 --> 00:49:40,170
that was the other part that made me

1236
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:42,300
interested in it and where I found it

1237
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:46,619
and so basically the concept of

1238
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:49,410
emulsifying the the are we emulsifying

1239
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:51,750
the oil yes okay and that's making

1240
00:49:49,409 --> 00:49:53,149
everything smaller so is is the point

1241
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:56,280
there that it becomes more bioavailable

1242
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:57,599
it's possible to be bioavailable that

1243
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,260
but then you might take that same

1244
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:01,529
emulsion

1245
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:03,930
and put it in a liposomal or a my

1246
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:05,400
cellular so you can add surfactants or

1247
00:50:03,929 --> 00:50:06,659
other parts that depends on what people

1248
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,670
want to have for their final product

1249
00:50:06,659 --> 00:50:10,319
again but you can put it in with you

1250
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:12,389
know tween and Twain and all these

1251
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:14,309
others surfactants that are already

1252
00:50:12,389 --> 00:50:17,969
being used in all of our other foods and

1253
00:50:14,309 --> 00:50:19,739
our you know our salad dressings got it

1254
00:50:17,969 --> 00:50:22,889
doesn't matter what it is you're just

1255
00:50:19,739 --> 00:50:24,689
trying to make it content uniformity is

1256
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:27,900
key you want to have everything exactly

1257
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:31,500
the same so part of why you would

1258
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:34,590
emulsify the oil as a final step is to

1259
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:38,159
have uniformity of distribution of all

1260
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:41,010
the cannabinoids and chirping yeah okay

1261
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:45,029
so that if I'm if I'm like squirting it

1262
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:48,510
into into vape tanks that every tank

1263
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:50,460
gets the same mixture of yes a full

1264
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:52,410
spectrum plant good then you got to make

1265
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:54,630
sure from batch to batch so that one

1266
00:50:52,409 --> 00:50:55,889
batch may be contents and that that

1267
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:57,539
brings in a whole nother thing of

1268
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:58,769
in-line testing and things like that

1269
00:50:57,539 --> 00:51:00,269
right cool

1270
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:02,759
all right well John well we will

1271
00:51:00,269 --> 00:51:06,039
continue the conversation up in Oakland

1272
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:17,060
yes all right

1273
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:17,059
