I'm Courtney Freeman and I spent the

3
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:22,070
last year working on packaging I was

4
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:24,229
part of the first wave of businesses to

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:26,149
bring lab tested compliant packaging to

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,730
market and it was brutal

7
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:30,858
so I've been through it and I've asked

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,978
the hard questions and we put together a

9
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:37,609
panel here today to try to dig in and

10
00:00:33,978 --> 00:00:40,850
get some more solutions the requirements

11
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:44,239
for packaging have a universal ID I

12
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:47,239
shared this little card with many of you

13
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:49,369
there is a download for top ten

14
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:51,678
highlights so that you don't have to

15
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:54,468
take notes on everything I say I'm gonna

16
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,149
go over a few details I ran through my

17
00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:58,850
presentation with somebody and I

18
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:02,179
discovered that not everybody knows what

19
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:04,099
tamper-evident packaging is so just just

20
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:06,228
for heads up guys if you go to the

21
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:08,780
market everything at the market has

22
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:12,078
temper evident packaging it means that

23
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,118
you know if somebody has tampered with

24
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:18,048
your product that's an important element

25
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:21,200
it is currently very common to be a heat

26
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:23,539
wrapped plastic it's not necessary we

27
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,920
can use paper so one of the things we're

28
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:27,590
gonna be talking about here today is is

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,560
what inspired me to kind of prompt this

30
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:33,618
conversation there are many ways to

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,019
approach packaging and in this day and

32
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:38,209
age we've got some serious issues with

33
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:40,670
the amount of waste that we're creating

34
00:01:38,209 --> 00:01:43,339
has anybody seen the headlines about

35
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:47,299
China no longer accepting our recycling

36
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:50,960
anyone yeah okay so do you all know that

37
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:54,649
we have 11 years before we run out of

38
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:56,649
our recycling landfills for the

39
00:01:54,649 --> 00:02:00,468
Northeast here in the United States

40
00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:02,149
11 years that's it here in California we

41
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:04,459
got a little bit more time we're looking

42
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:06,858
at about 22 years but there are some

43
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:08,689
simple steps we can take like rinsing

44
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:11,150
and probably sorting sorting or

45
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:12,949
recycling for example so that's one of

46
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,200
the issues that prompted this the other

47
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:17,719
is small businesses

48
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:21,500
I'm a small business and it can be quite

49
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:23,568
exorbitant to pay for the patents and

50
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,939
all the testing that goes into child

51
00:02:23,568 --> 00:02:27,679
resistant packaging so we're looking at

52
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:30,439
how we can create solutions for

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,239
businesses as well because um if we're

54
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:34,159
gonna make it we need all the help we

55
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,409
can get and we're gonna do it together

56
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:39,379
so this is part of my initiative to

57
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:42,169
bring a greater sense of community come

58
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:44,539
together child resistant packaging

59
00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:46,280
h-hour resistant package is one that is

60
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:48,318
designed or constructed to be

61
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,199
significantly difficult for children

62
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:53,060
under five to open or obtain a harmful

63
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,669
amount of the contents within a

64
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,098
reasonable amount of time in addition

65
00:02:55,669 --> 00:03:00,949
the package must not be difficult for

66
00:02:58,098 --> 00:03:03,280
normal adults to use properly now I

67
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:07,149
don't know if you all have seen this

68
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:11,568
these creative boxes totally adult proof

69
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:14,150
totally adult proof I spent hours

70
00:03:11,568 --> 00:03:16,399
someone had to show me really

71
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,200
complicated but I'm showing you some

72
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,079
examples of packaging here today it's

73
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:23,119
really important how these solutions and

74
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:25,099
that one in particular I spoke with an

75
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,530
attorney I thought if you just had to

76
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:29,388
use two hands that was child resistant

77
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,099
it's not there's a lot of testing that

78
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:32,090
goes into it and we're gonna we're gonna

79
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:34,759
talk about that in a minute

80
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:36,979
another important issue when addressing

81
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:40,729
your packaging primary versus

82
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:43,459
informational panel the primary panel is

83
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:45,379
the front of the box or package it's

84
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:47,689
what you will most likely see when you

85
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:50,030
are in their retail environment the

86
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:52,579
informational panel is the rest of the

87
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,959
package it's informational the

88
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:56,120
government warning is there for example

89
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,069
which is quite important but that's

90
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,519
worth noting for those of you who are

91
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:04,369
not familiar with packaging compliance

92
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:07,039
all right packaging guidelines one you

93
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,739
may not use cartoons or anything that's

94
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:12,289
appealing to children this is important

95
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:14,900
we can look at the tobacco industry as

96
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:17,409
an example of why we wouldn't want to do

97
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,120
that I think that we all here are

98
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,799
individuals who are you know building

99
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,418
something beautiful with this industry

100
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:25,609
our intention is not to market to

101
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:27,649
children but we need to be really clear

102
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,389
about that and unfortunately animations

103
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:29,859
or

104
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:32,788
something that potentially can be

105
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:36,879
misconstrued as marketing to children

106
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:38,168
THC content specifically delta-9 needs

107
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,139
to be outlined on your packaging

108
00:04:38,168 --> 00:04:44,109
additional in addition CBD so if you

109
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:46,930
have other types of cannabinoids THC a

110
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,968
for example I you may not want to put it

111
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,829
on the front package the primary panel

112
00:04:48,968 --> 00:04:52,589
because there's going to be testing and

113
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:54,728
if you have a deviance of more than 10%

114
00:04:52,589 --> 00:04:56,799
that means you could have issues and

115
00:04:54,728 --> 00:05:00,699
you'd have to redo your packaging so

116
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,050
keep that in mind obviously in terms of

117
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:04,090
poison control we want to know how much

118
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,270
THC is in the package it needs to be

119
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:09,668
consistent and there's a reason for that

120
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:11,620
but it's worth noting and just for our

121
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:16,329
industry players that something could

122
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:19,750
save you a lot of headache 3 you must

123
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:21,008
use a minimum of a 6 point font now it

124
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,598
may not seem like a big deal but when

125
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:25,990
you're trying to cram all this detail

126
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:28,149
onto your tiny box it's difficult so

127
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,728
just be mindful of that and the

128
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:35,288
universal symbol that we discussed I'm

129
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:37,870
going to show you an example here this

130
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:40,959
is a beautiful brand from Amsterdam this

131
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,668
is outdated packaging this one right

132
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,370
here and you'll see that there's an

133
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:47,019
exclamation point it says THC alerting

134
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,088
you to teach see but that's not

135
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:50,859
universal people who don't speak English

136
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:52,538
or don't know about THC aren't gonna

137
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,439
understand that there's THC in the

138
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:55,990
package and that they should be

139
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,000
cautionary when consuming so keep that

140
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,978
in mind and then here's another package

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,199
from Henry's it does have the California

142
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:08,258
Universal ID a question that's often

143
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,120
asked if you have black packaging what

144
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:12,580
do you do with this universal symbol the

145
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:16,088
universal symbol is required to be black

146
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:18,338
so if need be you can create a white

147
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:20,079
space around it or some other color or

148
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:22,478
you can just do maybe a two or three

149
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:25,478
point maybe a ten point white line

150
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:29,408
around the universal ID just to define

151
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:33,098
it that's an easy solution five required

152
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:35,978
by the FTC you must list the license

153
00:06:33,098 --> 00:06:38,889
manufacturer part of packaging important

154
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:41,019
details are how do we trace packaging if

155
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:42,100
there's an issue how do we find out who

156
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:43,509
made it how

157
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:50,740
tracked down so we can take it off the

158
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:53,439
market this one you may or may not be

159
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:57,879
aware of but it's important to list your

160
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,019
ingredients in order of the volume so if

161
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:01,300
you go to the grocery store this is

162
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:04,659
something you'll see that the packaging

163
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:07,300
is the the most voluminous ingredient is

164
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:10,210
listed first if there's any allergens

165
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,829
you should include that number 8 for

166
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:13,839
edibles you'll want to include

167
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:15,759
nutritional content as well as any

168
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,789
coloring additives similar to other

169
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,769
products that you buy at the market and

170
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:23,819
then I want to highlight something that

171
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:26,589
very likely you don't know okay

172
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:30,699
employees are required to take a food

173
00:07:26,589 --> 00:07:33,549
safety course if they are manufacturing

174
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:35,740
or creating edibles so that's something

175
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:37,689
it's in the regulations for o28 zero

176
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,300
training program that's something you

177
00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:45,850
should be aware of it needs to happen

178
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:48,639
within 90 days of employment number nine

179
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:51,580
instructions for use such as the method

180
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,339
of consumption or application this one's

181
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:57,099
a little tough it sounds simple but if

182
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:59,229
you have if you have concentrate what do

183
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,660
you do with it right there's many

184
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:03,819
applications but you need to identify

185
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:07,450
what those applications are on the

186
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:10,360
packaging ten the product expiration

187
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:13,899
date they use buy or the best by date

188
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:16,199
and this is especially important for any

189
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:19,269
perishable items that are water-based

190
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,979
I'm producing a lotion right now it's

191
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:24,549
water-based you to be very cautious

192
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:27,730
about microorganisms or mold so be aware

193
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:33,250
of that and then we're not there yet

194
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:35,050
it's coming but the metric ID so once

195
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,240
we're in this seed to seal tracking

196
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:40,359
we're gonna need to include the metric

197
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,560
ID that the licensed entities will be

198
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,229
issued okay

199
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:46,719
that's important to note also you know

200
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:49,660
the reason that we we are so timely with

201
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,810
this conversation is that July 1st is

202
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:55,240
the deadline for compliant packaging to

203
00:08:52,809 --> 00:08:55,869
you to go through the retail channels

204
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,539
that are laid

205
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,460
since so if you don't have compliant

206
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:04,349
packaging you've done yourself a great

207
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,350
favor and being here today thank you

208
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:10,770
twelve if there's more than one serving

209
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:14,050
then the package must be resealable and

210
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:17,949
your serving size must be less than ten

211
00:09:14,049 --> 00:09:20,250
milligrams of THC all right now let's

212
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:23,440
talk about some medicinal

213
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,120
differentiation number thirteen if the

214
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,850
product is intended for medicinal

215
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,950
purposes or contains more than one

216
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,500
thousand milligrams of THC per package

217
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:34,570
you need to include the statement for

218
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,159
medical use medicinal medical use only

219
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,080
and by the way you should pay attention

220
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:41,610
to that because you need to be on point

221
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,230
it's not it's not one of the other and

222
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,649
that's for any products that are sold at

223
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:50,649
the retail a lot of us had concerns

224
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:51,549
about that because we didn't feel like

225
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:54,490
there should be these kinds of

226
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:56,319
restrictions on on medical for those

227
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,259
that are treating cancer for example

228
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,610
might be taking a gram a day and with

229
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:03,399
this restriction it means that we have a

230
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:05,440
lot of a lot of smaller packaging little

231
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:09,009
pieces of packaged plastic that aren't

232
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,680
necessarily value oriented like we would

233
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:14,700
find in the market and again it does it

234
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:18,278
does contribute to our waist

235
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:21,070
okay fourteen the regulations quote a

236
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:24,809
required government warning that must be

237
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:24,810
in bold that's the government wine

238
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,990
this is similar to what you have in the

239
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:33,439
pharmaceutical industry where your

240
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,278
pocket product comes with an insert and

241
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,720
that's something that we can also

242
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:42,838
leverage if we need extra space here 15

243
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,709
this one is a little tricky California

244
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:49,589
Prop 65 so for those of you who are

245
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:52,078
reintroducing terpenes for example beta

246
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:54,360
Mersin that's something that you need to

247
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,948
identify on the label it's quite

248
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,980
interesting the research i've done

249
00:10:55,948 --> 00:11:01,139
indicates that beta mersin is is part of

250
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:04,319
solutions for cancer treatment but

251
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:06,409
according to California's the the

252
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:08,939
research indicates that when you isolate

253
00:11:06,409 --> 00:11:11,250
Bane immersing similar to when you

254
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,750
isolate cannabinoids like THC I can give

255
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,519
you a headache when you isolate Bane

256
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,339
immersing potentially it can cause

257
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:20,159
cancer in the lab in the lab results so

258
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,750
something to note prop 65 you're not

259
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,120
gonna find that necessarily in the regs

260
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:29,730
that's something that you have to really

261
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:32,909
go through it to find out and 16 finally

262
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,278
let's address state lab testing for

263
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:39,389
pesticides and microbials

264
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:42,299
this is not in the regs so if you're not

265
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:45,629
aware we had an update to our emergency

266
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:48,208
regulations in May and one of the things

267
00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:50,429
that's changed is the testing

268
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,679
requirements previously you were

269
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:55,289
required to have a primary sample as

270
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:57,979
well as a duplicate field sample and now

271
00:11:55,289 --> 00:12:01,409
that the now this has been reduced

272
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:03,539
previously it was a major expense if you

273
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:06,600
are not aware of it and you did attempt

274
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:09,629
to bring a package that was higher

275
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,569
volume to market it meant that when the

276
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:15,269
field testing samples are taken they

277
00:12:12,568 --> 00:12:18,059
take your product in its final form in

278
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:20,879
which case you can lose thousands of

279
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:23,669
dollars to field testing samples and now

280
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:26,429
that's been resolved so thanks things

281
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:28,818
for that improvement that's a that's a

282
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:28,818
nice evolution

283
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:40,610
