1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,049
we really appreciate everybody joining

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,378
us to discuss the ten cardinal

3
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,670
parameters of plant health and vitality

4
00:00:06,378 --> 00:00:10,859
our intention is to share some

5
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:12,210
information that we researchers and

6
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:14,910
other industry professionals in our

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,410
ecosystem have collected and applied to

8
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,839
large-scale cannabis cultivation

9
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,948
facilities to minimize cultivation risks

10
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:25,018
and maximize genetic expression as the

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,090
title of our webinar suggests there are

12
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:29,129
ten parameters that work in Symphony to

13
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:30,629
produce an end product that contains and

14
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,909
preserves all of the secondary

15
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:34,950
metabolites which consists of

16
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:37,558
cannabinoids terpenes and flavonoids

17
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:41,070
that are a value for recreational and

18
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,659
therapeutic cannabis products the

19
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,730
structure of today's webinar will

20
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:47,279
consist of a 30 minute presentation by

21
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:49,738
Jesse Porter inspires cannabis business

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,829
specialist and Robbie batts inspires a

23
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:55,189
chief technology officer with that I'll

24
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,899
pass it off to rob to kick us off

25
00:00:55,189 --> 00:01:00,659
today's talk is truly inspired by dr.

26
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,480
Bruce Bugbee presentation at the CGC in

27
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:06,060
Niagara Falls in late 2019 his

28
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,829
sectioning of the main inputs into nine

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,570
cardinal parameters is something that

30
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:11,158
brought us to the realization that all

31
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,289
the systems of plant growth are

32
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,540
intertwined in a way that it's

33
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,640
impossible to focus on one without

34
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,520
having an impact on perhaps several

35
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,368
others so why do we have ten and the

36
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,959
esteemed dr. Bugbee has nine well dr.

37
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:28,170
Bugbee was specific about his nine

38
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,059
parameters being environmental only we

39
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,609
are humbly adding a tenth which is

40
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,460
microbes because our conversation is

41
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:38,368
specifically general plant inputs around

42
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:40,139
cannabis we exceed its impact on the

43
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:42,390
high dollar value of the cannabis plant

44
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:47,340
and we would be remiss if we did not

45
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,930
include them we find that when most

46
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,570
people talk about growing environments

47
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,399
cannabis they're most often looking for

48
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:57,000
that nugget of wisdom as it pertains to

49
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,780
VPD and many of you probably joined for

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,420
just that reason

51
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,280
well we don't blame you it's a topic we

52
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,740
take most seriously as a company that is

53
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,299
built on a backbone of temperature and

54
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:08,939
humidity control equipment and

55
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,219
controllers we're going to do a deeper

56
00:02:08,939 --> 00:02:12,840
dive shortly but to set the stage let's

57
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:16,930
talk about it right here

58
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:20,650
VPD is vapor pressure deficit it is

59
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:22,810
water vapor pressure deficit and our

60
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,549
business that inspire has become control

61
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,920
of this very important metric are

62
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:32,079
designing efficient systems that control

63
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:33,878
track and trend the metrics this is

64
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:36,370
amazing things happen when you get it

65
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:38,048
right and we've seen some less than

66
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,408
desirable things happen when you get it

67
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:43,000
wrong we take our job humidifying and

68
00:02:41,408 --> 00:02:44,979
conditioning the air very seriously

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,539
because there's someplace for water to

70
00:02:44,979 --> 00:02:48,639
move from inside the plant to outside

71
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:50,408
the plant it would be impossible for

72
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:55,029
plants to thrive and at the end of the

73
00:02:50,408 --> 00:02:58,509
day that's car business now it's almost

74
00:02:55,030 --> 00:03:00,430
a true it's important to both leaf

75
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:02,078
temperature control and the

76
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,689
photosynthetic process amongst other

77
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:06,370
things but the real understanding that

78
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:08,378
plants only use a small fraction of the

79
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,939
water you give them is the start of a

80
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:12,518
deeper understanding to environmental

81
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:15,340
controls sea water is pulled through the

82
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,289
roads up the stem into the leaves and

83
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,939
would otherwise have no place to go

84
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:20,229
except for the fact that there are tiny

85
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:22,930
pores on the plant called stomata

86
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:25,090
through which the water can escape now

87
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,639
these pores are mainly where co2 enters

88
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:29,500
the plant oxygen gas leaves the plant

89
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,769
and also the water that entered the

90
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,199
plant through the roots as a liquid

91
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:36,519
evaporates out into the environment now

92
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:39,459
in order for the liquid to evaporate

93
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,969
into the air the surrounding air must be

94
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:44,378
below the saturation threshold of water

95
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:46,209
taking a closer look at the picture on

96
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:48,250
the Left you're going to see again and

97
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:50,289
again and again in this presentation you

98
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:54,568
can see that there is a substantive

99
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:57,158
cavity just on the inside of the stomata

100
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:58,539
the entire gas exchange process I

101
00:03:57,158 --> 00:04:01,030
mentioned in the previous slide well

102
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:03,310
that happens here and if the surrounding

103
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,878
air is moist there's a good balance of

104
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:09,430
co2 entering an h2o leaving the plant if

105
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:11,888
the surrounding air is too dry relative

106
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,870
to inside the plant the co2 has a hard

107
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:17,889
time fighting its way upstream from all

108
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:18,639
the water vapor leaving the plant now

109
00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:20,590
that that's out of the way

110
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,509
let's talk about the interplay of all

111
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:25,049
these variables in the context of plant

112
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:25,050
vitality

113
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:32,639
Jessie take it from here hey thanks Rob

114
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,530
great information there I think diving

115
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,810
into the parameters of plant influence

116
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:38,459
there are wonderful reference points for

117
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,170
understanding the interactions that

118
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:43,769
maximize the plant's vitality and

119
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:45,960
directly influence BBD east cardinal

120
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:48,060
parameters work synergistically to

121
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:50,489
create the ideal cultivation environment

122
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,079
and as we collect more data we might

123
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,930
even uncover more parameters of

124
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:57,419
influence hormones maybe I don't know

125
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,699
but for now we'll talk about 10 many of

126
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,580
which you're probably familiar with

127
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:04,860
light humidity temperature co2 and air

128
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:06,810
flow and then down in the root zone we

129
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,170
have temperature again nutrients

130
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:13,530
microbes oxygen and water that are all

131
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:15,689
major influencers in plant health but

132
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:17,369
what plant right cannabis sure but

133
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:19,079
understanding the genetics and breeding

134
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,550
history of a cultivar and have

135
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,599
significant influence on our

136
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,600
environmental set points

137
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:29,750
speak on genetics it's very easy for me

138
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,360
to show you pictures of beautiful

139
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:35,029
strains autumn izing expressing unique

140
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,439
traits and losing their oils but I think

141
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:39,019
it's even more powerful to share a

142
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:41,870
concept from robert c clarke and his

143
00:05:39,019 --> 00:05:44,839
book marijuana botany as you can see in

144
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,780
the diagram phenotypes are the byproduct

145
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:48,619
of genetics mixing with the environment

146
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:50,539
makes sense right

147
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,550
strains are bred to thrive and are

148
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,250
uniquely adapted to the environments in

149
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,139
which they are created so whether you're

150
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,629
growing a maple leaf indica from a

151
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:01,250
reputable seed breeder a land race

152
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:03,740
Vietnamese black you picked up on

153
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:06,050
vacation or a handful of beans from a

154
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,120
friend it can be very helpful to

155
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,689
understand where they came from and how

156
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,040
they were bred in order to let them sing

157
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:16,189
if you think you're trying to create the

158
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,870
perfect conditions for your genetics you

159
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:19,730
should first consider the habitats

160
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,949
associated with the genetic origin and

161
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:23,629
then follow the environments in which it

162
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:28,789
was developed in order to get the most

163
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:30,649
out of your phenotype so what genetics

164
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,000
considered let's take a quick look at

165
00:06:30,649 --> 00:06:33,469
light and its powerful and dramatic

166
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,110
interaction with the other plant

167
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,540
parameters in order to maximize

168
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,550
photosynthetic rate and your lighting

169
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,670
investment right it's important to

170
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,500
harmonize temperature co2 levels and

171
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:48,230
ppfd while thinking about your lighting

172
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:50,779
source as you will see later they are

173
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:53,509
separate VPD charts for LED and HID

174
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:55,609
lighting this is because HID lighting

175
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:58,250
emits radiant heat which impacts the

176
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,319
plant and leaf temperature as a result

177
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,470
the same plant will prefer a lower

178
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,110
temperature room for HID for maximum

179
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:08,840
production and a higher room temperature

180
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:10,699
in an LED room maximizing the

181
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,619
photosynthetic rate of cannabis requires

182
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,449
a keen understanding of the relational

183
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,660
set points associated with your lighting

184
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:16,659
choice

185
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,460
mentioned there's also relationship

186
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:25,800
between light and co2 we know plants use

187
00:07:23,459 --> 00:07:28,558
light energy to convert co2 and water

188
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,499
into sugar and oxygen its photosynthesis

189
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:33,779
right but we also know as light

190
00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:37,379
intensity goes up the amount of co2

191
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:38,968
utilized by the plant does to co2 is a

192
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:40,979
plant food that passes through the

193
00:07:38,968 --> 00:07:43,709
stomata and is necessary for the

194
00:07:40,978 --> 00:07:46,408
photosynthetic process and the amount of

195
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:49,498
co2 assimilation is directly related to

196
00:07:46,408 --> 00:07:51,180
the accumulation of plant biomass so

197
00:07:49,499 --> 00:07:54,300
when you consider parts per million of

198
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:57,778
co2 you should correlate that to ppfd

199
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,610
and the stage of plant growth as the

200
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:02,310
plant transitions from clown to veg to

201
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:05,310
flower co2 can be increased alongside

202
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:10,680
light intensity in order to maximize the

203
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:12,269
plant's development but what good is co2

204
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,360
if you can't deliver it to the plants

205
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:17,788
effectively right air flow has a direct

206
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,069
impact on how co2 is delivered to the

207
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:22,348
stomata it also affects the leaf

208
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:24,689
temperature influences to model

209
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:28,588
reactions microclimate management and

210
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:30,870
VPD in cannabis plants the stomata is on

211
00:08:28,588 --> 00:08:33,509
the undersides of the leaves so the most

212
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:36,060
efficient way to deliver conditioned co2

213
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:38,309
rich air is up through the canopy and

214
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:41,250
directly to the undersides of the leaves

215
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:43,948
now as air passes the leaf surface it

216
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,690
has a drying and cooling effect it

217
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:48,809
should be accounted for when determining

218
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:51,000
room conditions in leaf tab airflow

219
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:53,369
considerations are also imperative to a

220
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,828
successful harvest as it can break up

221
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,948
canopy overlap contribute to cultural

222
00:08:55,828 --> 00:09:00,778
control help mitigate odor it can even

223
00:08:58,948 --> 00:09:04,649
impact drying and carrying employee

224
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:06,750
health and overall IPM strategy airflow

225
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:08,009
also plays a part in successful

226
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,948
regulation of temperature and humidity

227
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:13,110
and on that note I'll pass things back

228
00:09:10,948 --> 00:09:16,338
to Rob who can talk about what happens

229
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,339
when we get hot and wet

230
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:23,039
thanks a lot Jesse and as far away's

231
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:25,079
does almost a decade trying to

232
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,389
understand the interplay of temperature

233
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:29,609
and humidity and its influence on plant

234
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:31,409
metabolism you know it turns out that

235
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,100
when water evaporates from inside the

236
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:34,198
substance

237
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,420
evany I talked about before it has the

238
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:39,240
same effect as sweat leading a person's

239
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:42,088
skin it'll cool to plant down and make

240
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,318
the environment around it more moist now

241
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:45,509
the rate of which this happens is very

242
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:47,429
important because the leaf is a somewhat

243
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:49,500
narrow band of temperature where the

244
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:52,289
chemical process of processes are most

245
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,299
efficient fishing chemical processes

246
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:56,730
inside of the plant mean higher yields

247
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:59,370
and higher revenues so if we measure

248
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,930
this for a plant it should be easy

249
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,519
enough to just set the room temperature

250
00:10:00,929 --> 00:10:05,969
to the leaf temperature we want right

251
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:08,879
and bingo increased yield unfortunately

252
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,930
that's not the case although some days I

253
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,958
really wish it was that easy

254
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:14,729
instead all sorts of variables affect

255
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,909
leaf temperature and leave temperatures

256
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,560
almost always not room temperature now

257
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:21,629
it's not exactly easy to measure this

258
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:22,859
effect because leaf canopies are not a

259
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:25,019
single temperature as you can imagine

260
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:27,870
and in fact in fact they vary even

261
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:29,159
across a single leaf now in practice the

262
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,440
room is easy to measure

263
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:33,629
we set up an array of aspirated sensors

264
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,240
inside or close to the leaf canopy and

265
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:38,578
take our readings like to understand the

266
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,889
leaf temperature most often we use an

267
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:43,888
indirect measurement via for example a

268
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:45,120
thermal imaging system now it's

269
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:47,159
important to remember that the primary

270
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,039
heating source for a plant is the

271
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:51,299
radiation that is absorbed by the leaf

272
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:53,730
and this comes from primarily two

273
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:56,458
different sources now in a room lit by

274
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,800
HBS length we have the lights themselves

275
00:10:56,458 --> 00:11:01,049
that are throwing infrared photons into

276
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,278
and through the canopy essentially we

277
00:11:01,049 --> 00:11:04,229
have a source of heat similar to a

278
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:04,799
microwave heating their leaf from the

279
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:08,069
inside out

280
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:10,438
now most LED lit rooms don't have this

281
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:12,419
energy source to maintain the correct

282
00:11:10,438 --> 00:11:13,860
leaf temperature we have to bring heat

283
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:15,509
to the plant by elevating the room

284
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,970
temperature around it and the walls and

285
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:20,250
the surfaces provide some infrared input

286
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:22,470
to heat the leaf up and for the will use

287
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,600
convection and warmer air inside the

288
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:27,899
room to keep that leaf in a narrow band

289
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,120
I mentioned before now this might be a

290
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:31,259
topic of a webinar in and of itself but

291
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,139
if you want to jump ahead

292
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:36,089
maybe hop onto Google and study the

293
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:42,139
Bowen ratio now this defines the amount

294
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:45,360
of energy of some outputs and heat law

295
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:47,639
patient to the transpiration process

296
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,039
now speaking of which remember when I

297
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,899
told you before that we need some sort

298
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:53,909
of lower moisture environments but

299
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,159
plants can transpire and the water can

300
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:58,678
move to the plant well that's true but

301
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,629
let's talk about humidity and in

302
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:02,519
different context let's talk about the

303
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:04,139
pests that thrive in humid environments

304
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:06,899
now we're going to be showing you some

305
00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:08,909
tables later indicate a good humidity

306
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,948
relative to temperature for different

307
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:13,318
stages of growing environments and

308
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:14,818
growing rooms and this might lead you to

309
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:17,639
believe that anywhere inside those

310
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:19,048
ranges is good for plant health that may

311
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,028
be considered true but for the most part

312
00:12:19,048 --> 00:12:23,068
inside of a room where we are moving off

313
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:25,169
in hundreds of gallons of water through

314
00:12:23,068 --> 00:12:27,958
the air we have to be careful not to

315
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:29,698
give the pests a place to thrive now

316
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:32,248
it's widely understood that humidity has

317
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:34,948
a direct impact on the things like

318
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:37,259
powdery mildew and botrytis keep in mind

319
00:12:34,948 --> 00:12:40,169
the general rule of general rule of

320
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:41,459
thumb is the one of the room the higher

321
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:43,438
the likelihood that even a small

322
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:47,278
outbreak of these pests can become

323
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:49,078
unmanageable and a revenue destroying so

324
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:52,259
whatever what about the plants now and

325
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:54,628
the effect of humidity on them when we

326
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:56,188
look at this leaf cross-section we have

327
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:58,470
to remember that in order for the plant

328
00:12:56,188 --> 00:13:00,838
to use and move water we need to have a

329
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:03,899
humidity level outside the plant that is

330
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,879
less than inside this if this difference

331
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:10,289
is literally sucking the water through

332
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:12,329
the plant this difference is VPD now

333
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:14,399
it's actually a fairly simple task to

334
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:15,748
get an appropriate VPD chart if you know

335
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,089
just three of the things I've already

336
00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:19,379
mentioned get yourself over to the

337
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:22,169
website you see in the bottom right hand

338
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:24,209
corner with your room temperature your

339
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:27,088
room humidity and leave temperature in

340
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:29,068
hand and voila you can generate a VPD

341
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:30,959
chart for almost any type of growing

342
00:13:29,068 --> 00:13:32,399
environment assuming that the chart is

343
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:35,578
drawn for whatever plant you're growing

344
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,730
with but don't forget lighting type

345
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:40,138
affects how the chart is drawn the chart

346
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:43,110
below might be the kind of chart you'd

347
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:45,418
use in an LED lit room and this is the

348
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:48,079
kind of chart you would find if you're

349
00:13:45,418 --> 00:13:50,278
using an HP S or C mhm lint room

350
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:53,008
intercept the corresponding good areas

351
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:57,119
of transpiration have changed well let's

352
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:57,740
make things a little more complicated as

353
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,899
you can see

354
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,299
from this chart on the right-hand side a

355
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:04,699
player will photosynthesize less and

356
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:07,039
less as the VPD increases that is as we

357
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,009
make the environment drier but as we

358
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:12,319
decrease the VPD make it more humid the

359
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:13,939
photosynthesis will increase but so does

360
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,390
the ability of a pathogen to thrive

361
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:18,680
there's a balance in there somewhere and

362
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:20,990
understanding that is going to be really

363
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:25,789
critical to understanding how you can

364
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:26,990
maximize the plants in your facility now

365
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:29,120
remember I told you that leaf

366
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:31,039
temperature is not room temperature and

367
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,810
then we had to use different types of

368
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:36,049
measurement systems for both types of

369
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:38,869
temperatures well let's see a really

370
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:41,209
really complicated this can get when we

371
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,919
look at a 15-hour leaf and room

372
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:45,830
temperature trend in one of the rooms

373
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:48,559
that we've put plants in as you can see

374
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,850
here things change dramatically if I

375
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,099
wanted to take a look at just this

376
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:55,070
differential you can see here that the

377
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:57,470
difference between the leaf temperature

378
00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:00,530
and the air temperature changes almost

379
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:02,570
minute by minute the peaks on the left

380
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:04,279
and right hand side indicate areas when

381
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,590
the lights are on and the value in the

382
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:08,419
middle is when the lights are off in

383
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,519
this specific room if you're trying to

384
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:15,649
manage VPD with a static chart on the

385
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:17,899
wall you might have a hard time now we

386
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:20,480
use control systems and produce control

387
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:23,929
systems that can measure temperature and

388
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,750
humidity and plant temperature across an

389
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:28,099
entire range of time from the beginning

390
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,559
of the plants being moved into the room

391
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,659
to the time the plants leave its with

392
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,609
these sensors and controllers that were

393
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:37,159
able to measure the moisture removal

394
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,870
from the room every single day and feed

395
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:40,879
that information back to growers who

396
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,639
might find some useful nuggets out of

397
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:46,100
that what I'd say is we can see that the

398
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,689
plants transpire more when the lights

399
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,779
are on and that's the blue bar on the

400
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:52,550
right hand side at night they transpire

401
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:55,189
less and in fact most that moisture is

402
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:57,289
particular moisture loss by adding the

403
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:59,470
blue and the red bar up we can tell you

404
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:01,879
with pretty good certainty plus minus 5%

405
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:05,540
exactly how much transpiration is being

406
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:07,250
sent through the room now if you're

407
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:09,740
going to start off by trying to control

408
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,259
room humidity and VPD you're going to

409
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,610
need to size your equipment appropriate

410
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:15,769
we use the equation on the left hand

411
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,659
side as a starting point based on the

412
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:20,319
data we've taken from rooms and we

413
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:22,189
suggest you do as well

414
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,230
well that's enough about temperature

415
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,160
humidity Jessie why don't you take it

416
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:26,360
from here and talk about room

417
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:29,319
temperature and the rest of the

418
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,990
parameters you got it thanks again Rob

419
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:35,570
so temperature is also a major factor in

420
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:36,799
creating a healthy root zone when it

421
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:38,450
comes to the root zone I think it's

422
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,579
really important to consider the media

423
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:43,580
and its role in root zone thermal

424
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:45,470
regulation for example we know that soil

425
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,839
holds its temperature differently than

426
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:49,610
rock wall and if you're thinking about

427
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,680
an aeroponic approach it's going to be

428
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:54,470
heavily influenced by water temperature

429
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,359
and room conditions a root zone temps

430
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:59,269
play an important role in nutrient

431
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:01,610
uptake and root exudates production for

432
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:04,279
example studies show us that root zone

433
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:06,078
temps higher than 77 degrees inhibit the

434
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:08,660
uptake of calcium and other nutrients

435
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:10,399
and a root zone that is too cold will

436
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,140
slow chemical reactions and less than

437
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,809
the plant's ability to capture nutrients

438
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:17,150
a highly accomplished colleague of mine

439
00:17:14,808 --> 00:17:18,889
would say finding the sweet spot for

440
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:21,079
your genetics is about determining the

441
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:23,329
temperature that balances enzyme and ion

442
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:25,938
concentration in the root zone for

443
00:17:23,328 --> 00:17:28,338
maximum uptake I like to say it's like

444
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:36,570
Goldilocks all about finding the right

445
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:38,339
porridge and when it comes to

446
00:17:36,569 --> 00:17:39,869
for your plants we know there are many

447
00:17:38,339 --> 00:17:41,279
different nutrients and delivery

448
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:42,059
techniques available to the cannabis

449
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,549
cultivator

450
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:48,000
many of us even have our own secret

451
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:49,859
recipes despite that one thing holds

452
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,289
true for every successful nutrient

453
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:54,990
regiment it's directly connected to

454
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:56,789
transpiration might seem like a

455
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,529
stretched first but when you think about

456
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:01,049
how mobile nutrients are moved by the

457
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:03,329
planet and immobile nutrients are moved

458
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:06,419
through the transpiration process it

459
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:09,299
becomes more clear in order to maximize

460
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:11,220
your plants uptake of immobile nutrients

461
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:13,349
you must maximize the movement of water

462
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,670
through the plant otherwise the

463
00:18:13,349 --> 00:18:17,639
nutrients will never get where they're

464
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:19,470
supposed to go we can collect some great

465
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:22,230
information on transpiration and plant

466
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:24,720
nutrition first we can test the

467
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,490
nutrients available in the media and use

468
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,130
that as a baseline for comparing leaf

469
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:31,950
tissue analysis from new growth and old

470
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:34,230
growth on the same plant if we discover

471
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,509
immobile nutrients lacking at any stage

472
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:38,789
of growth we can assume we miss an

473
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:42,740
opportunity to maximize transpiration

474
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:42,740
and nutrient translocation

475
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:50,269
now oxygen is another very important

476
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,529
plant influencer we know oxygen is

477
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:54,139
something that your plants give off

478
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:55,700
during the process of photosynthesis but

479
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,710
oxygen in the root zone also plays a

480
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,049
critical role in roots breathing

481
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:02,630
chemicals interacting and good microbes

482
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:05,119
breeding now if the media becomes

483
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:08,120
compacted or the roots grow in an

484
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:10,969
anaerobic condition the roots will

485
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:13,689
suffocate chemical reactions will slow

486
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:16,069
and your plants growth will - an

487
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:17,750
anaerobic root zone is also a breeding

488
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:21,230
zone for pathogens that will negatively

489
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:24,289
affect plant health oxygen water and

490
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:26,630
temperature all interacting factors we

491
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:28,579
know that cold water holds more oxygen

492
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:31,460
we don't want to put ice water on your

493
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:33,649
roots right it's about balancing this

494
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,140
knowledge with your media choice room

495
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,850
conditions plant stage and other factors

496
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:45,170
to make sure oxygen is allowed to

497
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:46,849
function most appropriately oxygen also

498
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:49,960
helps us create an environment where

499
00:19:46,849 --> 00:19:52,730
good microbes thrive and pathogens don't

500
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,350
there are many different microbes on

501
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:56,960
this planet that directly influence

502
00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:58,849
cannabis one example Rob mentioned

503
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,490
earlier was the botrytis that's all

504
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:03,709
around us and preventing conditions for

505
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:06,679
it to take hold involve appropriate

506
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:09,470
dehumidification integrated biological

507
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:12,980
filtration air flow considerations and

508
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:14,539
proper staff training but there's also

509
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,480
good microbes we should think about

510
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:19,700
managing beneficial fungal colonies will

511
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,849
thrive on plants roots in an oxygenated

512
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,100
environment root zone fungus like raizou

513
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:26,659
faggus irregularity vies sugars -

514
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:29,169
bacteria as a reward for making

515
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:32,300
nutrients available in the rhizosphere

516
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:34,670
sounds relatively simple but managing

517
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:36,829
protozoa and nematodes micro arthropods

518
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:38,890
fungi and bacteria can be a real

519
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:41,389
challenge when oxygen levels are low and

520
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:44,480
fungal and bacterial pests begin to take

521
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:46,670
hold instead it's more about creating an

522
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,679
oxygenated rooting environment where

523
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:51,769
good microbes can maximize nutrient

524
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:54,500
uptake emulate growth and protect

525
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:56,869
against pests and pathogens good and bad

526
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:57,569
microbes like bacteria virus and fungus

527
00:20:56,869 --> 00:20:59,099
and

528
00:20:57,569 --> 00:21:02,720
controlled if the appropriate

529
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:02,719
environmental conditions are maintained

530
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:09,300
and when it comes to thinking about an

531
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:11,490
IPM strategy every good IPM plan starts

532
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:14,690
with cultural control which prizes

533
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:17,160
prevention over attempted eradication

534
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,289
filtering the air creating right air

535
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,820
pressures optimizing air flow

536
00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:23,490
considerations appropriately

537
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:25,619
dehumidifier and maintaining conditions

538
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:28,620
that are unsuitable for pests is

539
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:30,659
cultural control the ability to

540
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:33,329
precisely control your cultivation

541
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:36,330
environment limits IPM applications

542
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:38,519
limits labor hours and it gives you the

543
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:40,829
ability to change conditions for a short

544
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:44,099
period of time in order to increase the

545
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:46,949
efficacy of an IPM application for

546
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:49,079
example we're using the humidity for a

547
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:51,990
certain IPM application to be more

548
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:55,159
effective we're dropping the humidity to

549
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:57,059
control a fungal spread either way

550
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,370
environmental considerations are

551
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:05,179
imperative to the success of any IPM

552
00:21:59,369 --> 00:22:08,489
plan an application strategy and

553
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:11,279
speaking of success water management is

554
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:13,940
paramount to cannabis cultivation there

555
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:16,529
is no life without water right and

556
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:19,380
Leonardo da Vinci said water is the

557
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:20,970
driving force of all nature I like this

558
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,060
quote because I've heard the taxicab

559
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:26,069
water analogy before water is the

560
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:29,129
vehicle that picks up all the nutrients

561
00:22:26,069 --> 00:22:31,589
and moves them around water is the

562
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:35,250
driving force for cannabis plants both

563
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:36,869
internally and externally water delivery

564
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:39,200
must be treated to avoid the development

565
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:41,069
of pathogens like Pythium and

566
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,440
temperature of the water must be

567
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:45,569
considered as a lab an impact on root

568
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,960
zone temperature and oxygen holding

569
00:22:45,569 --> 00:22:52,049
capabilities oxygenated water will help

570
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,630
the root zone grow and aid in beneficial

571
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:56,669
microbes growth and appropriate water

572
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:59,280
pressures will maintain and maximize

573
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:02,460
plant growth nutrient utilization and

574
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:04,170
phenotype expression and we all know

575
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,789
that water in the room is humidity that

576
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:07,410
needs to be managed appropriately in

577
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:10,230
order to prevent things like powdery

578
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:12,480
mildew from destroying your crop instead

579
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,279
we suggest you apply the knowledge that

580
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,860
you have about vapor pressure deficit

581
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:18,950
and use water to maximize your plants

582
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:21,109
expression in biomass

583
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:25,549
and with that let me toss it back to

584
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:28,129
Brian Jesse Rob excellent work very very

585
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:29,419
nicely done at this point we'd like to

586
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:35,660
answer some of the questions that came

587
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:38,810
in from you all here at the top one of

588
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:47,269
our attendees asked is airflow different

589
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:50,359
than HVAC yeah I think that's a really

590
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:53,950
good question and I think when you think

591
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:56,329
about airflow considerations for a room

592
00:23:53,950 --> 00:24:00,230
sometimes we've separate them from an

593
00:23:56,329 --> 00:24:02,149
integrated HVAC approach but when it

594
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,150
comes to conditioning the air in the

595
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:07,430
room and redelivery it to the plant

596
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:09,650
they're tied together specifically I

597
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,890
like to think about air flow as you know

598
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:14,660
breaking the boundary layer and

599
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:17,690
recreating some outdoor environmental

600
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:19,850
conditions that put some you know subtle

601
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:22,400
pressures on the plan and remind them

602
00:24:19,849 --> 00:24:25,309
that we are mother nature when it comes

603
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,680
to the bigger HVAC conditioning aspect

604
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:30,950
it's about removing the water that

605
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:33,560
doesn't need to be there and controlling

606
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:36,950
the environment in a way that we're

607
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:38,779
filtering biological pathogens and we're

608
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:41,090
cleaning the system and that we're

609
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:44,089
maintaining the temperature and humidity

610
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:46,549
set points in a space so while I think

611
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:48,829
they're both interconnected there's

612
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:50,359
definitely a multitude of different

613
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:52,929
approaches we take with each one

614
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:57,189
I'm sure lab can add something there too

615
00:24:52,930 --> 00:25:00,830
yeah can you hear me guys we've got you

616
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:03,590
great so what I like to say to that is

617
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:06,529
if you're going to be looking at air

618
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:08,419
flow inside of a room most likely it's

619
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:10,849
going to be two separate systems that

620
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:12,920
handle the conditioning of the air and

621
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:14,869
the dehumidifying of the air and I

622
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:17,750
wouldn't rely on those systems to get

623
00:25:14,869 --> 00:25:20,029
the air just where it needs to be inside

624
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,650
a very dense canopy inside the room if

625
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:23,629
you were trying to do that you'd have

626
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:26,900
ductwork everywhere and frankly these

627
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:28,610
rooms can be quite busy and you're just

628
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,560
going to need some way to get air into

629
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:32,990
the room and then from the room itself

630
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,178
or in a general cavity of the room

631
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:37,429
out into the canopies in a way that's

632
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:39,170
not going to impede the ability of

633
00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:42,559
people to get around the room get in

634
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:44,000
between the rows etc etc but yeah

635
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:47,240
Jesse everything you said was correct

636
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,980
and they're definitely very much

637
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:54,370
intertwined excellent thank you guys one

638
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:57,740
follow-up question related to air flow

639
00:25:54,369 --> 00:26:00,079
is what are some good vertical upward

640
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:03,370
through the canopy air flow options as

641
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,369
far as brand and style

642
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:12,130
well what your shameless plug you know

643
00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:16,539
oftentimes we don't see anything that's

644
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:19,280
being done inside the rack and the tray

645
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:22,549
to bring air flows through the canopy

646
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,808
and so we're often sourcing these and

647
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:26,619
providing them ourselves

648
00:26:23,808 --> 00:26:29,269
so we supply them I think the most

649
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:31,339
integrated system out there is probably

650
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:33,500
the vertical air solution system and

651
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:35,449
that does a pretty good job now I think

652
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,609
the question was from the bottom up

653
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:40,819
especially they only go from the top

654
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:42,979
down at this point but yeah I think

655
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:44,389
there are a number of options out on the

656
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,819
market you could reach out to us and

657
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:48,740
we'd be happy to tell you all about them

658
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:50,569
and guys just to piggyback on top of

659
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,058
that I saw a quick question come in

660
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:55,730
about you know the effect that

661
00:26:53,058 --> 00:26:57,529
delivering this air to directly to the

662
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,929
stomata on the undersides of the plants

663
00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:02,869
you know is that a potential stressor

664
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:04,550
and I think this comes back to a couple

665
00:27:02,869 --> 00:27:07,808
of things it comes back to data

666
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:10,730
collection and real world application

667
00:27:07,808 --> 00:27:13,670
absolutely if we apply too much air flow

668
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:15,950
too fast we can affect the stomata

669
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:18,980
negatively we can get it to close we can

670
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:21,110
slow the plant's metabolic rate so when

671
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:23,420
it comes to this air flow delivery it's

672
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:25,759
really about making sure of two things

673
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:28,190
that the air is the appropriate

674
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:30,829
temperature in humidity so its condition

675
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,509
and also that the rate of air flow the

676
00:27:30,829 --> 00:27:33,470
actual velocity in which it's delivered

677
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:35,990
to the plant

678
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:38,029
I think our study shows somewhere around

679
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:40,308
a meter per second it could be wrong on

680
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:43,700
that but we've done some in-depth data

681
00:27:40,308 --> 00:27:46,089
and studies and just to show or just to

682
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:48,778
get an idea of how much air flow we need

683
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:51,399
to apply to that leaf surface to

684
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:53,788
positively affect the plant to break the

685
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,830
boundary layer and deliver that co2

686
00:27:53,788 --> 00:27:59,259
without any stressors without any leaf

687
00:27:56,829 --> 00:28:01,689
curl without any negative reactions to

688
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:05,259
the environment and it's just key that

689
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:07,179
that air air is conditioned and you know

690
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:10,028
delivered at the right velocity to avoid

691
00:28:07,179 --> 00:28:11,259
that kind of stress hopefully that's a

692
00:28:10,028 --> 00:28:17,519
little bit of insight on that that

693
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:21,579
concept Thanks thanks Jesse makes sense

694
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:24,190
another question I have here is the VPD

695
00:28:21,579 --> 00:28:28,288
and transpiration continue as a plant

696
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:28,288
process as a plant process post-harvest

697
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:37,178
so this is Rob here I think that the

698
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:39,640
transpiration process does not the

699
00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:42,519
transpiration is that full cycle the

700
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,770
water enters through the root system up

701
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:47,440
to the stem and then out the stomata of

702
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:50,500
the leaves at some point when you've

703
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,149
trimmed the plant is harvested in that

704
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,589
process stops there are no more roots

705
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:56,349
there's no more water going through the

706
00:28:53,589 --> 00:28:58,599
stem you're going to start seeing water

707
00:28:56,349 --> 00:29:00,609
leave the plant through the stomata or

708
00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:04,509
through that ticular membrane on the

709
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:07,898
leaves themselves that is very much

710
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:09,788
VPD dependent now it's not a VPD chart

711
00:29:07,898 --> 00:29:12,250
you would use or find on the website I

712
00:29:09,788 --> 00:29:13,960
showed you before but it's very much

713
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,869
dependent on how much humidity is in the

714
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,250
room the temperature of the room and the

715
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:20,589
temperature and moisture content of the

716
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:23,200
leaves and those two things will play

717
00:29:20,589 --> 00:29:25,058
off each other those two or sorry four

718
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,640
things of the two subsets from the plant

719
00:29:25,058 --> 00:29:29,889
and the room those things will play off

720
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,899
each other and dramatically affect how

721
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:33,580
quickly or how slowly that plant dries

722
00:29:31,898 --> 00:29:36,158
and further it will affect the

723
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:38,829
consistency of the drying so many times

724
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,200
we see a harvest lose so much value in

725
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:44,079
the drawing incurring process because it

726
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,090
was dried inconsistently it's crusty

727
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,678
outside on the bud and a really moist

728
00:29:46,089 --> 00:29:49,990
interior that's just perfect for

729
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,330
pathogen growth and that rate of air is

730
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:54,690
going to strip apart all the value

731
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:58,148
you've put into that plant to that point

732
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:59,980
mm-hmm yeah sounds like a great segue

733
00:29:58,148 --> 00:30:04,449
into our next webinar more

734
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:06,339
come another question here can you

735
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:10,590
provide a recommendation for maintaining

736
00:30:06,339 --> 00:30:10,589
soil temperature and large fabric beds

737
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:21,940
yeah I think I think what we're really

738
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:26,190
talking about here is no understanding

739
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:28,240
the process of break down in those beds

740
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:33,759
what I'm thinking of what I'm picturing

741
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:36,009
here is a no-till kind of approach where

742
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:39,548
people are trying to maintain beds or

743
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:41,079
even just a soil recycling system where

744
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:42,629
people are trying to sort of maintain

745
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:45,548
the temperatures in those beds and

746
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:48,790
obviously we know that there's a pretty

747
00:30:45,548 --> 00:30:50,650
significant influence from the airflow

748
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:52,960
and the temperature and humidity set

749
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:55,480
points you know how they're going to

750
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,400
impact that soil but I also think it's

751
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,798
important to sort of think about the

752
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,298
chemical breakdown and the nutrients

753
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:04,450
that you're going with if you have a

754
00:31:01,298 --> 00:31:06,220
soil based program and you have a lot of

755
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:08,769
really good organic inputs that are

756
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:11,350
continually breaking down and you have a

757
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:12,668
lot of microbial activity there's going

758
00:31:11,349 --> 00:31:15,490
to be a good chance that you have

759
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:16,929
wonderful micro climates this way we're

760
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:19,200
talking about micro climates in a good

761
00:31:16,929 --> 00:31:21,910
way in that soil structure that allow

762
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,308
certain fungal and bacterial colonies to

763
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:26,019
thrive and spread their wings and sort

764
00:31:24,308 --> 00:31:27,129
of encapsulate those roots and protect

765
00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:29,710
them from some of the environmental

766
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:32,559
threats I also think it's important to

767
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:34,120
think about water temperature a lot of

768
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:36,220
times we don't think about that delivery

769
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:38,349
temperature and if we deliver water

770
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,150
that's really cold to a cold root zone

771
00:31:38,349 --> 00:31:42,909
when the lights are off you know it's

772
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:46,600
cold on cold on cold and if we can

773
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:48,850
deliver the water at the root zone after

774
00:31:46,599 --> 00:31:50,798
the lights have come on we have a little

775
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:52,418
bit of warmth in that room we have a

776
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:54,940
little bit of process going on in that

777
00:31:52,419 --> 00:31:56,290
plant and if the water is warm enough

778
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,779
but not too warm again back to that

779
00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:01,210
Goldilocks porridge we can use that to

780
00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:02,829
sort of maintain the soil temperature or

781
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,860
any media temperature for that matter as

782
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:09,308
well hopefully that provides a little

783
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:12,399
insight there Barnett I like to add a

784
00:32:09,308 --> 00:32:13,420
little something to back when we were

785
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,210
doing work in the

786
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:17,769
some industry large soil beds were kind

787
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:19,900
of a de facto standard for growing

788
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:22,359
mushrooms inside of a cold wet darkroom

789
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:24,310
and so maintaining those bed

790
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:26,529
temperatures is pretty important and

791
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:28,149
some of the methods they use there and

792
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:29,799
I've seen some of this in the cannabis

793
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:33,370
industry people attempting it anyways

794
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:35,349
would be to use basically piping a coil

795
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:36,609
piping a radiant floor type system

796
00:32:35,349 --> 00:32:38,799
underneath the bed

797
00:32:36,609 --> 00:32:41,259
you could put cool or hot water through

798
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,180
it and end up with a temperature control

799
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:44,769
scheme that way and we've also seen

800
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,660
people attempt to use phase change

801
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:48,430
material kind of novel they'll find out

802
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:50,560
the time to get into it but we've tried

803
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:52,210
to see them use phase change material I

804
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,369
can't tell you how well it worked out I

805
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:58,779
can find out for you and the person who

806
00:32:54,369 --> 00:33:01,750
asked the question No right thank you

807
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:04,109
very much Steven I see that your hand is

808
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:08,380
up that you also have asked a question

809
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:12,059
I'll try and and ask your question here

810
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:15,070
shortly if you have more questions or

811
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:19,750
follow-ups I can also bring you our live

812
00:33:15,069 --> 00:33:23,159
to chat with us so just let us know on

813
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:28,299
that the next question I'd like to ask

814
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:30,190
is indoor agriculture is very energy

815
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:33,309
intensive what are some ways to be more

816
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:34,870
efficient with HVAC and are there any

817
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:42,069
sacrifices that are made to plan

818
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:44,049
performance as a result boy just show me

819
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:46,419
a soft one there I guess you know to

820
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:48,519
inspire we've designed and built some

821
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:53,170
very efficient ways to diiie humidify

822
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:55,089
the air the challenge is one of being

823
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:57,090
able to use the energy you're putting

824
00:33:55,089 --> 00:33:59,859
into the system in a novel way in

825
00:33:57,089 --> 00:34:02,019
standard G minification systems they do

826
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:03,609
that by using compressor energy to

827
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:05,079
reheat the air after they've cooled it

828
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:07,839
to that temperature where you get all

829
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:09,699
the moisture out we and some other

830
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:13,150
manufacturers in the industry go a step

831
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:14,619
further and we will move the air from

832
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:17,168
one spot to the other inside the air

833
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:18,699
handling unit in a sense in essence pre

834
00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:20,799
cooling the air before hits the cooling

835
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:23,409
coil and using that same room energy to

836
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,629
reheat the air back up and effectively

837
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:30,358
we get 30 to 50% less compressor energy

838
00:34:27,628 --> 00:34:33,719
there are other very very sophisticated

839
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:36,808
ways including desiccants to increase

840
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:39,989
the energy efficiency of the whole

841
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:42,539
growing process but see but you know

842
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:44,608
beyond all that making smart light

843
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:47,489
choices will probably help drive the

844
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:49,469
efficiency of the facility and also we

845
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:52,889
know that LED rooms which are much

846
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:54,298
warmer have a much easier ability to

847
00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:55,739
deity much easier ability to

848
00:34:54,298 --> 00:34:58,139
dehumidifier that air using less

849
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:01,559
compressor tonnage so those factors all

850
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:04,469
combined and from one to the other we

851
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:06,119
can see energy use 50% you know an

852
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:08,579
efficient building compared to a

853
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,559
standard building a legacy system that

854
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:12,660
was you know being built a designed I

855
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,599
guess even today but usually we saw them

856
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:16,940
mostly you know five years ago or so

857
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:20,940
then answer your question I hope

858
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:22,559
equation I believe so

859
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,179
but the second part would be are there

860
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,249
any sacrifices that are made to plan

861
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:30,748
performance as a result of the the more

862
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:33,118
energy-efficient process there can be

863
00:35:30,748 --> 00:35:34,919
but that has more to do with the choices

864
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,809
you make in general if you don't have

865
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,869
systems that can modulate and that can

866
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:41,880
handle the cool times at night versus

867
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:44,180
the hot times during the day and those

868
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,650
transitions in between its the

869
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:48,328
modulating equipment if you're not using

870
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:51,509
it that's where you're gonna find the

871
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:52,528
challenges it's one thing to sort dumps

872
00:35:51,509 --> 00:35:55,199
I'll get it but if you don't have a

873
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:58,380
really effective gas pedal lead on a

874
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,548
dump truck or an efficient Prius then

875
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,108
you're not gonna have a really good

876
00:35:59,548 --> 00:36:02,670
chance controlling those systems and

877
00:36:01,108 --> 00:36:04,558
that's where the sacrifice comes in I

878
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:06,539
mean the plant health will really suffer

879
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:08,130
if you give those pests a place to

880
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,319
thrive if you're not doing the right

881
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:16,700
thing for the root zone temperature etc

882
00:36:10,318 --> 00:36:20,969
I got it I like that analogy very cool

883
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:24,028
ok I got a question here from another

884
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:26,249
attendee temperature humidity and air

885
00:36:24,028 --> 00:36:29,338
flow conditions can vary widely within a

886
00:36:26,248 --> 00:36:31,828
room is there an ideal room size for

887
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:33,778
optimal quality at what point does an

888
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:37,048
increase in room size jeopardize plant

889
00:36:33,778 --> 00:36:39,768
quality you guys have any sort of these

890
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:43,199
general ideas around room size

891
00:36:39,768 --> 00:36:44,518
all right yeah I mean I think that let

892
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:47,278
me take a stab at this Rob and you can

893
00:36:44,518 --> 00:36:51,088
forward I think for the most part you

894
00:36:47,278 --> 00:36:52,739
know as we've all transitioned to larger

895
00:36:51,088 --> 00:36:54,420
scale cultivation facilities we've

896
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:57,719
started to sort of appreciate the

897
00:36:54,420 --> 00:37:01,048
smaller room size for isolation purposes

898
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:03,588
and you know prevention of spreads but

899
00:37:01,048 --> 00:37:06,150
at the same time you know if you

900
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:08,548
accurately and adequately understand

901
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:11,068
your watering rate and you have an

902
00:37:08,548 --> 00:37:14,068
appropriate mechanical system you can

903
00:37:11,068 --> 00:37:15,838
have a much larger scale to me it really

904
00:37:14,068 --> 00:37:18,268
comes down to a couple of things it

905
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:20,699
comes down to you know working with your

906
00:37:18,268 --> 00:37:23,149
engineer and really understanding the

907
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:26,159
inputs and thoroughly vetting them and

908
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:27,869
appropriate planning but it also sort of

909
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:30,469
comes down to CFD modeling and

910
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:32,969
computational fluid dynamics is

911
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:34,469
something that you know I wasn't too

912
00:37:32,969 --> 00:37:36,659
familiar with until I really started

913
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:38,759
looking at these larger scale rooms and

914
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:40,259
it wasn't as simple as hey we're gonna

915
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:41,940
put a fan every six feet

916
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:44,880
you know this rule of thumb for

917
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:47,190
traditional legacy growers was still

918
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,869
applicable but we needed to take those

919
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:51,958
inputs and sort of take them to a

920
00:37:48,869 --> 00:37:53,940
data-driven science level and by doing

921
00:37:51,958 --> 00:37:56,068
the modeling we're usually allow we're

922
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,989
usually capable of determining you know

923
00:37:56,068 --> 00:38:01,108
how many air exchanges we're gonna have

924
00:37:57,989 --> 00:38:03,719
you know per per couple of minutes or

925
00:38:01,108 --> 00:38:07,440
you know where that air is gonna flow

926
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:11,190
the potentiality for dead spots and and

927
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:13,108
as a result we can adjust our mechanical

928
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,059
influences and cultural control in that

929
00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:17,639
space to make sure that we are

930
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:19,619
controlling the space as a whole a lot

931
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:22,199
of times traditional techniques are

932
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:24,088
let's let's put up some HVAC let's put

933
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:26,999
in some pocket dehumidifiers and let's

934
00:38:24,088 --> 00:38:28,708
blow air all around the room and I think

935
00:38:26,998 --> 00:38:30,988
what we're talking about is a recipe for

936
00:38:28,708 --> 00:38:32,728
microclimate and without the appropriate

937
00:38:30,989 --> 00:38:34,858
planning and the appropriate data

938
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:36,358
collection it's really hard to get all

939
00:38:34,858 --> 00:38:39,139
those things on the same page and

940
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:41,219
actually manage the envelope as a whole

941
00:38:39,139 --> 00:38:42,048
but Rob you have you have something you

942
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:44,849
want to add to that

943
00:38:42,048 --> 00:38:47,458
well you busily stole my thunder dare

944
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:50,640
you yeah say the exact same thing you

945
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:52,609
know anecdotally we see rooms 2,000 to

946
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:54,289
3,000 square foot and

947
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:57,349
and they might go one or two tear we've

948
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:59,869
seen since 40 rooms but like I said

949
00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:03,139
gently without modeling you can't really

950
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:05,509
no modeling gives gives us a sheet that

951
00:39:03,139 --> 00:39:07,549
says what's the average dwell time of

952
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:09,860
air inside of a room it's one thing

953
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:12,019
design to design a room with an HVAC

954
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:14,930
system that's going to do a certain

955
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:17,719
number of air changes per hour but you

956
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:20,929
know even then unless you can prove to

957
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:22,969
me that we've gone in model the canopy

958
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:25,489
like they're doing the wind tunnels use

959
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:28,639
those same formulas and applied them

960
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:31,309
into the rows and the racks of the

961
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:33,710
Cannabis themselves through the CFD you

962
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:35,389
know I just I don't I don't believe it I

963
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:39,730
need to I need to see it to believe it

964
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:39,730
yeah modeling has helped us for sure

965
00:39:39,969 --> 00:39:46,339
great

966
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:47,899
all right questions are coming in guys

967
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:51,130
thanks thanks very much

968
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:54,820
for for the the level of engagement here

969
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:57,380
another question here from Eric Studdard

970
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:59,000
saying I do energy studies of indoor

971
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,200
cannabis facilities and you've seen a

972
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,599
lot of variety and how much

973
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:05,809
dehumidification is required during dark

974
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:07,579
flower flower dark periods the strain

975
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:13,730
type has the most significant impact on

976
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:17,630
dark period transpiration Wow great

977
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:19,400
question I go I can tell you that you

978
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:22,400
know we catalog every room that we

979
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,900
design and go back to verify how much

980
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,059
moisture is being taken out of it like

981
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,490
you saw on that graph during our slide

982
00:40:26,059 --> 00:40:30,940
we can measure the transpiration rate

983
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:34,729
down to the minute the instantaneous

984
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:37,099
transpiration rate of the room we have

985
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:38,210
yet to catalogue it like strain so it's

986
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:40,429
probably gonna be the next thing we go

987
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:43,280
and look at now our rooms are generally

988
00:40:40,429 --> 00:40:45,710
designed on day one to handle a wide

989
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,750
variety of plants so we don't want to

990
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:50,570
limit a grower or a facility to a

991
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:52,190
specific strain on day one and then you

992
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:54,710
know six months later market conditions

993
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:56,360
change etc we always advise using

994
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:58,010
standard rules of thumb and going just a

995
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,920
little bit bigger than that for your

996
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:02,780
room dehumidification design but that

997
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,590
being said I can't wait to go back and

998
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:08,790
look at that data

999
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:08,789
very interesting I'm curious to know

1000
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:19,570
great hopefully that answers your

1001
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:21,940
question Eric thank you again I've got

1002
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:24,280
another question here from Jacob Hickey

1003
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:26,050
are there any fundamental strategies or

1004
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,910
differences in maintaining the ten

1005
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:33,010
cardinal parameters in rock wool

1006
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:35,920
substrate well I think that that's a

1007
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:37,590
really good question and obviously

1008
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,030
[Music]

1009
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:43,000
that's that's an interesting

1010
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:45,390
conversation for a parameter but your

1011
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,510
media choice is definitely going to have

1012
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:50,889
some impact on how you deal with it over

1013
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:53,980
the course of time and how your plant

1014
00:41:50,889 --> 00:41:56,710
grows so I think when you think about

1015
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:58,570
the ten cardinal parameters you know the

1016
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:00,099
importance is understanding the synergy

1017
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:02,410
and how they all interact and how they

1018
00:42:00,099 --> 00:42:05,380
work together and the same thing goes

1019
00:42:02,409 --> 00:42:08,500
for your media choice for example you

1020
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:10,510
know if you're using rock wool media we

1021
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:13,059
know that initially that rock wool media

1022
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:14,859
tends to have a very high pH you know it

1023
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:16,000
could be it could be very high it could

1024
00:42:14,858 --> 00:42:18,299
be somewhere around eight it could be

1025
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,679
even higher than that so in

1026
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,600
understanding that and first

1027
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:25,659
appropriately treating the rock wall to

1028
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:27,339
get to that right pH is a step that you

1029
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:30,219
need to take because of your media

1030
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:32,530
choice in order to facilitate all those

1031
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:34,358
other parameters interacting a microbe

1032
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:36,820
growth the appropriate water retention

1033
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:41,019
the right you know root growth that

1034
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:43,330
leads to plant vitality you know the

1035
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:44,619
same goals same goes for every media

1036
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:46,239
choice that you have they're all going

1037
00:42:44,619 --> 00:42:48,550
to have you know slightly different

1038
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:51,608
considerations another one might be

1039
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:54,010
something like you know using cocoa and

1040
00:42:51,608 --> 00:42:56,769
we know that you know cocoa has a

1041
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:58,510
tendency to bind nitrogen over a long

1042
00:42:56,769 --> 00:43:01,090
period of time so if you're recycling

1043
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:03,160
your media over years that's something

1044
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:05,019
very important to consider you might

1045
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:08,199
actually have to add more additional

1046
00:43:05,019 --> 00:43:10,210
nitrogen to that to that product because

1047
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:11,889
you have a cocoa beast media and then

1048
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:14,320
when you start to mix media's and build

1049
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:16,179
your own media's and build soil you have

1050
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:18,430
all these other interacting factors as

1051
00:43:16,179 --> 00:43:21,699
well some of them are buffers force

1052
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:23,019
success through that mixture just by

1053
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,909
creating more inputs and more

1054
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:26,889
opportunities in the root zone but

1055
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:29,769
absolutely there there will be an impact

1056
00:43:26,889 --> 00:43:32,170
because of your media choice sort of

1057
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:33,909
mentioned temperature as well so in a

1058
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:35,380
cloning environment you have all these

1059
00:43:33,909 --> 00:43:38,049
little rock wool cubes sitting around

1060
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:40,119
and if you're blowing too much cold air

1061
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:41,440
past the environment they're gonna pick

1062
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:43,119
up that cold air they're gonna be

1063
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,858
sitting there without roots growing and

1064
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:48,550
that's going to dramatically impact your

1065
00:43:44,858 --> 00:43:50,679
ability to get roots quickly but if you

1066
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:52,269
think about that and you raise the

1067
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:53,889
environmental conditions and deliver

1068
00:43:52,269 --> 00:43:56,230
warmer air to that root zone that's

1069
00:43:53,889 --> 00:43:59,670
oxygenated that will have an impact on

1070
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:02,050
you know initiating root growth faster I

1071
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:04,059
think this is probably a topic for a

1072
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:05,710
much deeper dive but hopefully that's a

1073
00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:11,040
little bit of insight and the answer is

1074
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:14,050
absolutely yes it's great thanks Jesse

1075
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:17,289
another one here I hear a lot about

1076
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:20,280
Bruce brute-force HVAC are there any

1077
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:20,279
other options to consider

1078
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:26,409
yeah absolutely

1079
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:28,269
um I'll take this one yeah I've been

1080
00:44:26,409 --> 00:44:30,909
stood the technologies before for

1081
00:44:28,269 --> 00:44:33,568
dehumidification and how to make a less

1082
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:35,409
energy-intensive growing operation

1083
00:44:33,568 --> 00:44:37,779
there's a number of dehumidification

1084
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:40,509
technology you know we call them in our

1085
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:43,059
products at coil runaround loop there's

1086
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:45,579
an air to air heat exchanger around the

1087
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:48,579
same cooling coil mechanism that we

1088
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:51,030
talked about before there are liquid and

1089
00:44:48,579 --> 00:44:52,809
dry desk in systems that can be used

1090
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:54,760
well we talked when we talked about

1091
00:44:52,809 --> 00:44:57,880
brute force we're specifically talking

1092
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,020
about the use of a commercial air

1093
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,000
conditioner that takes the room

1094
00:44:59,019 --> 00:45:02,829
temperature and humidity air and brings

1095
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,048
that all the way down past that dew

1096
00:45:02,829 --> 00:45:07,030
point that's required to maintain the

1097
00:45:05,048 --> 00:45:10,329
room condition and that takes a lot of

1098
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:12,490
compressor energy compressor energy 70

1099
00:45:10,329 --> 00:45:14,920
to 80 percent of most air conditioning

1100
00:45:12,489 --> 00:45:16,750
systems we try and reduce that using

1101
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,059
that air to air heat exchanger system or

1102
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:21,068
a coil runaround loop and we've also

1103
00:45:19,059 --> 00:45:22,960
looked at dry and liquid desiccant and

1104
00:45:21,068 --> 00:45:24,849
they might be they may do a very good

1105
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,429
job too frankly we haven't found much

1106
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:29,048
luck but you know it's all about system

1107
00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:32,129
design and thoughtful approaches ahead

1108
00:45:29,048 --> 00:45:36,869
of time absolutely

1109
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:39,940
excellent piggybacking on that question

1110
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:42,819
in a region where outdoor temps can get

1111
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:45,039
below negative 30 degrees Fahrenheit and

1112
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:46,720
humidity in the 20% range will this

1113
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:49,420
affect indoor conditions of an enclosed

1114
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:52,779
facility and wood concrete floors affect

1115
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:55,180
things as well yeah absolutely

1116
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:58,000
I can tell you for sure that an unfilled

1117
00:45:55,179 --> 00:46:00,730
most over the second question lap or

1118
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,510
first a concrete floor we've seen it in

1119
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:08,139
rooms contributing humidity into the

1120
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:09,700
space almost 50 percent of what the

1121
00:46:08,139 --> 00:46:11,980
plants were doing at different times of

1122
00:46:09,699 --> 00:46:13,419
the stages of growth especially that's

1123
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:15,599
the problem in drawing rooms so if

1124
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:18,909
you're going to use a concrete floor

1125
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:21,219
your best chance to combat that and not

1126
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:22,599
have to over dehumidified moisture

1127
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:24,759
inside your space that's not coming from

1128
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:27,909
your plant is to seal it off use an

1129
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,200
epoxy seal if the rest of the room is

1130
00:46:27,909 --> 00:46:30,909
sealed going back to the first part of

1131
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:33,730
the question if the rest of the room is

1132
00:46:30,909 --> 00:46:35,940
sealed and it's still very well and the

1133
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:38,679
pressure is controlled appropriately

1134
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:40,269
then outside temperatures and humidity

1135
00:46:38,679 --> 00:46:42,190
don't actually have that much of an

1136
00:46:40,269 --> 00:46:44,079
influence that outside air that's being

1137
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:46,630
brought in for ventilation purposes if

1138
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:48,250
it's being brought in and we recommend

1139
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:50,250
it should especially for pressurization

1140
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:53,110
and pathogen control and biosecurity

1141
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:55,510
well then there should be treated and if

1142
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:57,340
it's too dry it should be moisturized if

1143
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:59,710
it's too hot it should be cooled down we

1144
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:01,210
don't want to bring in air into a room

1145
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:03,730
that's not conditioned in any way shape

1146
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:05,349
or form so we're not to manage that it's

1147
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:07,990
an engineering equation and at the end

1148
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:10,089
of the day again we recommend sealing

1149
00:47:07,989 --> 00:47:13,509
rooms so that we have the best pressure

1150
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:16,690
control possible if only for biosecurity

1151
00:47:13,510 --> 00:47:19,060
reasons that person can feel free to

1152
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:22,150
email me afterwards and I'll do a much

1153
00:47:19,059 --> 00:47:24,219
deeper dive but yeah sealing a room we

1154
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:25,690
find in most facilities we go into we

1155
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:28,299
just don't have that much influence even

1156
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:29,590
the hottest desert areas of ambient

1157
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,690
conditions considering the rooms

1158
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:33,820
themselves are rooms inside of

1159
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:36,070
facilities so they don't have a solar

1160
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:40,740
load and there's very little thermal or

1161
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:40,740
humidity load inside the facility itself

1162
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:48,609
right

1163
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:52,420
thanks Rob circling back on the on the

1164
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:54,039
medium the question of a medium are

1165
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,289
there any specific issues that inspire

1166
00:47:54,039 --> 00:48:02,289
can address as an aeroponic system of

1167
00:47:56,289 --> 00:48:06,759
being utilized yeah I mean I think when

1168
00:48:02,289 --> 00:48:09,880
you think about aeroponics and the way

1169
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:12,610
that we're controlling the root zone we

1170
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:15,700
don't have a buffer other than water

1171
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:17,590
right we're delivering a fine aerated

1172
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:20,469
nutrient mist to the root zone at

1173
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:22,870
periodic intervals and water is being

1174
00:48:20,469 --> 00:48:25,649
delivered through tubes and bucket

1175
00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:29,380
systems that run throughout the facility

1176
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:31,869
so when it comes to understanding the

1177
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:34,390
importance of that water temperature

1178
00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:37,420
because it lacks a buffer you know we

1179
00:48:34,389 --> 00:48:41,500
really need to control the oxygen levels

1180
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:43,570
and water and dilution of that of that

1181
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:45,250
delivery mechanism so when the water

1182
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:47,800
runs through the systems and the pipes

1183
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:50,739
get hot and cold those are going to have

1184
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:54,160
influences on the water delivery in the

1185
00:48:50,739 --> 00:48:57,159
root zone so in an aeroponic setting it

1186
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:59,409
becomes of critical importance to

1187
00:48:57,159 --> 00:49:01,839
control the ambient temperatures to

1188
00:48:59,409 --> 00:49:04,119
control the room temps and make sure

1189
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:05,890
that you don't have dramatic spikes but

1190
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:07,989
you can stabilize the delivery of that

1191
00:49:05,889 --> 00:49:15,519
water throughout the entire propagation

1192
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:20,229
period is that does that make sense yeah

1193
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:22,210
that's great thank you it looks like we

1194
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:26,800
have time for maybe one more question

1195
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:29,710
here I'm circling back on the concept of

1196
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,930
drying rooms which again will take a

1197
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:36,010
much deeper dive on with our next

1198
00:49:31,929 --> 00:49:37,719
webinar session the question is have you

1199
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:39,910
found an accurate way to estimate pounds

1200
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:42,369
per hour water loss of product in dry

1201
00:49:39,909 --> 00:49:45,219
rooms on an hourly basis based on

1202
00:49:42,369 --> 00:49:49,029
product mass volume percent moisture

1203
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:51,219
content and/or VPD in turn being able to

1204
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:53,140
accurately size the dry dry room HVAC

1205
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:57,730
system and control properly through the

1206
00:49:53,139 --> 00:49:57,920
drying process great question I can say

1207
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:01,219
that

1208
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:04,338
on so I would say that yeah absolutely

1209
00:50:01,219 --> 00:50:07,969
we have just like he saw in that graph

1210
00:50:04,338 --> 00:50:12,318
with red and blue bars we can watch

1211
00:50:07,969 --> 00:50:15,139
product in a room lose water weight at a

1212
00:50:12,318 --> 00:50:16,429
certain pace based on the effective

1213
00:50:15,139 --> 00:50:18,798
temperature and humidity control of that

1214
00:50:16,429 --> 00:50:20,239
space so starting at the beginning if we

1215
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:22,000
can control the temperature of the

1216
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:24,618
humidity to the customer's desired

1217
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,510
requirements that means we are removing

1218
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:29,660
the moisture that's coming off of the

1219
00:50:26,510 --> 00:50:32,480
plant after the harvest at a specified

1220
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:35,389
rate but we use sensors that are

1221
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,818
accurate enough and a verified miss with

1222
00:50:35,389 --> 00:50:40,400
weighed product in the field weight over

1223
00:50:37,818 --> 00:50:43,940
time to know that our air conditioning

1224
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:46,760
system feeds back the moisture removal

1225
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:48,349
rates from the product itself so we use

1226
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,109
our air conditioning system controllers

1227
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:54,140
to tell the growers and the harvesting

1228
00:50:51,108 --> 00:50:58,519
team how much water is being lost on a

1229
00:50:54,139 --> 00:50:59,929
pound per hour basis not being fed we

1230
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:02,509
know that water starts at a certain

1231
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:04,759
moisture content and the customer

1232
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:06,440
typically wants a targeted moisture

1233
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,680
content at the end of the drawing

1234
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:12,139
process what we do is we look at that

1235
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:14,598
difference in pounds of water coming out

1236
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:16,460
of the product and saying how many days

1237
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:17,599
do you want that product removed how

1238
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,039
many days you want that weight removed

1239
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:22,430
and usually we end up with a number

1240
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:24,619
that's seven to ten days you can make it

1241
00:51:22,429 --> 00:51:27,230
go faster than seven to ten days by

1242
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:29,420
heating up the room but you're probably

1243
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:33,108
going to do negative things to the plant

1244
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:35,568
you can slow it down and really

1245
00:51:33,108 --> 00:51:37,608
essentially slow down the plant drying

1246
00:51:35,568 --> 00:51:40,190
process these are all things that we

1247
00:51:37,608 --> 00:51:42,739
play with and it all goes back to really

1248
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:45,380
good sensors on the equipment that's

1249
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:48,139
doing the dehumidification and knowing

1250
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:54,740
from that exactly how that moisture loss

1251
00:51:48,139 --> 00:51:56,480
is being handled terrific all right one

1252
00:51:54,739 --> 00:51:59,029
one more question

1253
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:02,780
and we're going to have to sign off here

1254
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:04,298
in respect of everybody's time for any

1255
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:06,589
of the questions that we didn't answer

1256
00:52:04,298 --> 00:52:09,048
please feel free to reach out to us

1257
00:52:06,588 --> 00:52:10,548
directly and we'd be happy to talk with

1258
00:52:09,048 --> 00:52:11,909
you more

1259
00:52:10,548 --> 00:52:14,608
the final question

1260
00:52:11,909 --> 00:52:17,279
here is do you think recirculating

1261
00:52:14,608 --> 00:52:19,619
molecular filtration equipment proto

1262
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:23,849
mitigation has a negative effect on live

1263
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:26,400
cannabis in the space so that will

1264
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:29,250
question one more time circulating but

1265
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,619
do you think recirculating molecular

1266
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:33,690
filtration equipment such as activated

1267
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:35,430
carbon for for odor mitigation has a

1268
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:38,849
negative effect on the live candidates

1269
00:52:35,429 --> 00:52:41,730
in the space oh that's a pretty good

1270
00:52:38,849 --> 00:52:41,940
question I can tell you that we talked

1271
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,980
about

1272
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:46,019
VPD which is what when we talked about

1273
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:48,420
it in this context it was water vapor

1274
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:51,690
pressure deficit I can tell you that

1275
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:53,849
there's also a vapor pressure for other

1276
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:56,068
products inside the cannabis like the

1277
00:52:53,849 --> 00:52:59,789
chip beans themselves that if you've

1278
00:52:56,068 --> 00:53:02,699
removed them you may end up causing a

1279
00:52:59,789 --> 00:53:05,190
deficit of the token in the air which

1280
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:06,598
would have a detrimental effect of the

1281
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:10,019
tripping on the plant which is going to

1282
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:12,599
evaporate into the room now how much

1283
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:14,460
carbon filtration do you have to use

1284
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:17,519
inside of a room to drop the vapor

1285
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:19,769
pressure down of a terpene to affect the

1286
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:23,038
plant don't know the answer to that I

1287
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:24,690
can tell you that most times researching

1288
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:27,960
it in air even going through a carbon

1289
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:29,369
filtration scheme in fact it's only the

1290
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:31,260
air that's being injected out of the

1291
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:35,640
room in the facilities we design that's

1292
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:37,440
going through carbon filtration so the

1293
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:39,328
answer may or may not be yes I don't

1294
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,240
think using carbon filters in your

1295
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:44,099
recirculating air stream necessarily a

1296
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:46,278
good idea the pressure drops are high

1297
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:48,240
there's all sorts of other things that

1298
00:53:46,278 --> 00:53:50,909
there's a really good impact your bottom

1299
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:53,068
line in a facility that's not into that

1300
00:53:50,909 --> 00:53:54,210
question I hope I did answer it I got

1301
00:53:53,068 --> 00:53:57,630
the purse can reach out to me if they

1302
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:59,068
want Jesse give anything to add alright

1303
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:02,250
I think that was really good I think

1304
00:53:59,068 --> 00:54:06,088
when it comes to you know recirculating

1305
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:07,920
and it's it's better to to make a really

1306
00:54:06,088 --> 00:54:10,409
good stab at trying to do it right and

1307
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,150
you know necessarily think about the

1308
00:54:10,409 --> 00:54:14,670
minor implications that you might have

1309
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:16,528
for that recirculated air we know that

1310
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:19,170
stale and stagnant air is going to be a

1311
00:54:16,528 --> 00:54:21,119
health issue for people and plants in

1312
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:22,740
the like and just like you mentioned as

1313
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:24,750
far as an integrated system it's

1314
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:25,529
probably looking more like some sort of

1315
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:28,349
capture fill

1316
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:30,690
like a murder 13 followed by some sort

1317
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:33,839
of secondary treatment you know whether

1318
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:35,909
that's UB or photocatalytic oxidation or

1319
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,680
something like that in order to make

1320
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:40,109
that recirculation past or it makes

1321
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:41,669
sense for a long period of time the

1322
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,050
replacement on those carbon filters can

1323
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:45,240
be really tricky as well you know you

1324
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:46,680
might run them for a couple of cycles

1325
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:47,849
and then not know if they're full and

1326
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:49,649
not know if you need to throw them away

1327
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:52,110
and maybe not be able to accurately

1328
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:53,460
determine that so I have my concerns

1329
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:55,200
with carbon as well but I think you

1330
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:57,659
touched on that Rob we really just sort

1331
00:54:55,199 --> 00:55:00,000
of use it as the exhaust odor mitigation

1332
00:54:57,659 --> 00:55:05,309
and we do some pre-filter before that

1333
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,239
for the integrated room system excellent

1334
00:55:05,309 --> 00:55:08,400
excellent

1335
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:11,039
all right everybody looks like our time

1336
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,900

1337

1338
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,139

1339
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:19,289
