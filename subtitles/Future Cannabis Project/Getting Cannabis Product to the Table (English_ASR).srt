1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,219
I'm a field operator that's what I'm

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,039
about I'm about getting product to the

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:10,410
table and I'm about helping farmers get

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,529
product to the table I just absolutely

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,870
immerse myself in the science so that I

6
00:00:13,529 --> 00:00:17,669
can understand what product do I get to

7
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:19,589
the table and how do I get it to the

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,179
table and how do I get around problems

9
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:23,640
that are coming from other industries

10
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:26,129
that were involved in and so when Abrams

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,429
and I got to get together he came at me

12
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:31,129
academically but it wasn't aggressive in

13
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:34,140
a negative way it was like I want to

14
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:35,670
disprove approve your theory and once he

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,960
saw that there was a validity to it

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,250
which was awesome for me because they

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,230
let me know I was on the right track

18
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,729
because not every time does your theory

19
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:43,529
work out you know we all have theories

20
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:44,640
that not quite accurate and then someone

21
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,800
tells you and you're like okay I'll

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,320
adjust and that that's called

23
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,269
controlling your ego so you subjugate

24
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,590
your ego you get better information you

25
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,340
run down the road with the new material

26
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:58,559
and you do better and he was able to say

27
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,469
hey this is accurate can I use your

28
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:03,238
material to go play my own game with it

29
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:05,400
and I said yeah I'd love to because you

30
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,438
guys can do stuff I can't do with

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,020
Diagnostics scatter plotting you have

32
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,669
the ability to use scientific tools to

33
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:13,769
measure things in ways I don't have the

34
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,390
ability and you guys are statistical

35
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:18,060
geniuses so you'll be able to see

36
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,969
relationships in ways I can't and now we

37
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,969
can start to see how varieties really

38
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,920
lay across a spectrum so now we can

39
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:28,679
start to give people choices that are

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,030
accurate dispensaries an opportunity or

41
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,659
storefronts whatever we want to call the

42
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,159
modern in cannabis store the ability to

43
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:37,229
relate to the patient the customer

44
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,719
that's coming in and say look what are

45
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:42,539
you seeking and if you'd like a range of

46
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:45,929
products that reflect reality I can give

47
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,390
you a range here in ways that you like

48
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,100
so if you like flavor spectrums I can

49
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,939
give you stuff in similar flavonoid

50
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:55,469
profiles but on a gradient that'll say

51
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:57,298
similar experience through the mouth but

52
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:59,519
radical different experience through how

53
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,990
you in your head and that way what we do

54
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,500
is we start to be able to really work

55
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:06,599
with a knowledge base on customers which

56
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,189
then as producers it allows us to be

57
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,340
able to produce in a smarter level

58
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:12,310
versus strained as your because you

59
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,659
don't

60
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,159
this is constant new thing new thing new

61
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:17,859
thing I'm like you renamed it seven

62
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,180
times it's still Mendo purple yeah but

63
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,610
no it's still mando prep I don't give a

64
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,800
shit what you do DNA it all right it's a

65
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,989
perp and so why would you want to have

66
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,180
17 different perps and it's the same

67
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:30,670
with a lot of the oh Jesus you find the

68
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,900
best oh geez and that's what you work

69
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:33,848
with and you get rid of a lot of these

70
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,830
redundant lower quality ones that people

71
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:37,179
are playing with because ultimately the

72
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,650
buyer comes in and they look at it they

73
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,659
go there's 42 different ones how do I

74
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,459
know and so when I went into a

75
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:44,949
dispensary in Seattle my partner owns

76
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:47,140
dockside so dockside is the largest

77
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:48,818
Seattle the distributor dispensary in

78
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:51,669
Seattle so I go there they don't like

79
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:54,609
seven hundred varieties literally

80
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:56,589
there's seven hundred vary the board

81
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,390
that's on the wall it looks like you're

82
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,098
at a racetrack with so many different

83
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:02,559
horses running and you're just like holy

84
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:06,459
shit and it's overwhelming and I'm like

85
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,110
how would any customer ever get to

86
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:09,789
understand what they were looking at and

87
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:11,950
so you know I make it easy give me

88
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:13,509
something gassy give me something floral

89
00:03:11,949 --> 00:03:16,000
and I ask the bartender

90
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:17,469
what are you into and they go easy this

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,759
is what's gassy that's hot this is

92
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:20,439
what's floral too taut and I've been

93
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:22,689
really enjoying this one recently so in

94
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:27,400
a single sentence I just knocked out six

95
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:28,810
hundred ninety seven farms slow velocity

96
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,019
and they sit and they get something

97
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:33,909
called dust in the Shelf but ultimately

98
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:36,219
the people believe there needs to be

99
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:37,780
variety in order for you to compete with

100
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:39,340
these other dispensaries you have to

101
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,650
have the varieties otherwise they say

102
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,900
truncated so like for me at my new spot

103
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,730
I did the opposite I shrunk it down

104
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,989
because I know that the majority of my

105
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,699
market is going to be tourists coming

106
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:50,530
through I'm gonna have locals coming

107
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:51,969
through so we can cover some very high

108
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:53,889
quality products that the locals want

109
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:57,310
but I want to make sure that there's a

110
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:59,590
gradient in in what's available and in

111
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,170
pricing so I'm not just trying to target

112
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:05,439
and peel you because I I don't agree

113
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:06,729
with that and I came from a different

114
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,620
background so I gotta get her a

115
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:11,138
successful family but I came out of the

116
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,879
hood and so all the years you're in it

117
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:14,920
you start to realize that not everybody

118
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,238
has a lot of money so therefore me

119
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,159
beating you to death on price all the

120
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:20,949
time isn't the way to go that's a

121
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,260
specific group so a specific group pays

122
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:25,579
premium prices other people pay less

123
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:29,000
prices the difference is in nuance

124
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:31,250
not in overall quality qualities quality

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,538
the nuances of the rarity the very

126
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,538
distinctions of what Lao with a

127
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:39,579
separation and so I want these gradients

128
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:42,259
at my new store but I want a truncated

129
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:43,818
selection so that when you come in it

130
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:45,259
only takes you ten minutes you walk in

131
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:48,110
what do you got we got all this stuff

132
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:49,819
right here this is what we have this is

133
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,080
what does this and then go great I can

134
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:52,789
buy it leave and they can go and do

135
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:54,769
their thing otherwise you're in there

136
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:56,810
for two hours and you're shopping and

137
00:04:54,769 --> 00:05:07,038
you're exploring and you're wandering

138
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:08,990
and it doesn't work yeah exactly two

139
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,728
hours a time and so I don't agree with

140
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,879
it and I also don't agree with the fact

141
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:16,490
that you take on 700 farms and you're

142
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:18,740
only moving the product from 40 and it's

143
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:20,569
not that and oxides a fantastic

144
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,699
dispensary in all aspects and it's

145
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:24,830
managed well and it's got quality people

146
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:28,430
so to me it's an example of everything

147
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:31,579
that's done right in normal cannabis but

148
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:34,129
having to respond to the lack of market

149
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:35,568
knowledge and once we get market

150
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:37,819
knowledge where the market starts to

151
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:39,050
become educated and if you allow anybody

152
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:41,389
to educate them other than the

153
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,710
cultivators what's screwed because

154
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:44,509
everybody who's trying to educate him

155
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:48,698
trying to educate upon fancy boxes and

156
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:48,699
kill the packaging and a nifty new thing
