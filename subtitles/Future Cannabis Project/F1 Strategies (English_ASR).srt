1
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:08,240
all right so

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:11,919
today i want to talk about f1

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:16,160
strategies uh breeding

4
00:00:11,919 --> 00:00:19,920
f1's y and then

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,198
you know what f1s really are meant

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,920
for um in agriculture and that is

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,720
production

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:32,880
and so i think you know the ideal

9
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:35,920
um f1 plant

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,679
is expressing a lo it is expressing a

11
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,600
combination of its inbred

12
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:44,719
parental lineage from both sides

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,719
and and that can vary a lot in terms of

14
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,558
you know you can be selecting

15
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,198
for specific traits and try to get that

16
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,839
trait locked down so that all the

17
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:57,280
offspring share that you're trying to

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,399
understand the dominant

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,120
and recessive traits and then that will

20
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,478
also impart some strategy into the f1

21
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,798
but

22
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,400
essentially you know all the cannabis

23
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,520
f1s aren't really

24
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,760
real f1s at this point

25
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,798
and you know this one's pretty uniform

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,320
in that it

27
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,920
it's it's uh uniformly

28
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,719
very productive and very similar in

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,640
structure

30
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:30,078
and the main differing component is one

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,280
has the the white stigmas and

32
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:36,078
one has the pink stigmas

33
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,478
this is the coffee berry f1 made with

34
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:39,199
the

35
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,879
f5 generations of both coffee and

36
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,920
pinkleberry with the coffee being the

37
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,000
mother

38
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,159
and so what we're seeing is an

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,799
expression of really both plants we have

40
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,000
not seen anything else

41
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,320
affect the coffee as much as

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,438
the pinkleberry and that's also you

43
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:59,118
don't have anything else

44
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,798
that inbred and so you know what that

45
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,200
tells me

46
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,079
is that the further you get your lines

47
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,320
worked

48
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,000
the more predictable they become and the

49
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:12,239
more vigorous their offspring

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,280
when crossed become and so

51
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,239
um and then to breeding

52
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,000
f1s so you know if you really like the

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,759
combination or if there is a

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,439
pheno because there are going to always

55
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,439
be a couple of phenos

56
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,598
in the f1 generations with the lines not

57
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,000
having been worked

58
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,119
very much and so there is going to be a

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,039
slight variation

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,120
doesn't mean there's tons of different

61
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,159
things as long as it comes out smelling

62
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,200
similar

63
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,519
and and uh growing similarly and

64
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,318
finishing at similar times then it's

65
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,480
a very you know effective use for

66
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:55,518
agricultural purposes

67
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,560
so you know we've got this pink hair we

68
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,519
got the white hair

69
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,158
you know we've got a little bit in

70
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,959
between

71
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,519
all that some with a little bit of pink

72
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,280
this would

73
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,280
i say is coffee leaning

74
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,840
so you know if you're going to breed an

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,360
f1 you breed it back to one of its

76
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,680
parents

77
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,560
or at least parental lineage in our case

78
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,040
i don't use

79
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,039
last year's plants or last year's

80
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,679
generation to evolve

81
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,120
i cross them to this year's generation

82
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,640
parental lineage

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,039
to make a back cross

84
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:33,839
and solidify whatever parent i choose to

85
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,039
put on it

86
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,479
um as the main influence on the

87
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,959
the combination of the two genetics

88
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:46,479
and so that's you know that's a strategy

89
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,959
for using f1s for back crosses but also

90
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,158
you know creating double poly hybrids

91
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,479
for maximum

92
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,000
ability to make selections in the next

93
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:57,039
generation

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
by putting other f1s on f1s to bring

95
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,719
out a whole slew of potential and then

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,479
to start

97
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:06,719
trying and then to try and

98
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,318
stabilize the potential that you've

99
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:11,359
created

100
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:13,039
by then inbreeding with that double poly

101
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,080
hybrid until you're getting what you

102
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:18,159
want

103
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,319
expressed and so

104
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,320
you know if if you're growing from seed

105
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:25,918
and we grow all from seed here

106
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:27,279
always have and so our breeding programs

107
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:31,839
are designed to create

108
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:35,918
seed that we can utilize in the market

109
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:39,439
reliably and so

110
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:41,359
making f-ones is really the focus and

111
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,680
and you know i keep hearing it being

112
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,680
said in the communities

113
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,959
in the cannabis communities that f1s are

114
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,360
really unstable

115
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,478
then they're not really true f1s in

116
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,840
terms of

117
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:56,000
and when i talk stability i'm meaning

118
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,319
predictability and some people use the

119
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,519
term stability in terms of intersexing

120
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,560
but

121
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,560
when i say stability i just mean it's

122
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,319
it's worthy of breeding with because i

123
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,680
know what's going to come down the

124
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,680
line through that genetic and if you

125
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,720
have any variety regardless of what f it

126
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,000
says if it

127
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,240
if it is strong from one side or another

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,360
and passes on a reliably predictable

129
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,600
genetic you can utilize that in a really

130
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,120
effective way like it like it's an

131
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,360
inbred line

132
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,038
even though it may not be necessarily

133
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,240
but the only genetics that you're seeing

134
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,079
it pass on

135
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,000
are predictable enough to consider it

136
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,240
that

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,639
it it's it gets more and more complex

138
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,439
the further i dive into this stuff

139
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,160
and think about it but you know from an

140
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,560
f1

141
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,360
standpoint it's like if you're growing

142
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,478
from seed

143
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,160
for production for the market f1s are

144
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,120
definitely your choice

145
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,360
inbred lines tend to get smaller as you

146
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,840
further inbreed them

147
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,560
and less productive but you can always

148
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,198
maximize

149
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,038
production by simply plant spacing as

150
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,038
well so inbred lines are really nice for

151
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:08,399
uniformity as well

152
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,918
as f1s but you know then when it gets to

153
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,519
like you might not choose to put your

154
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,079
f2s or your

155
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,439
double poly hybrids out in a production

156
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,000
field because

157
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,000
a double poly hybrid might limit your

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,079
ability to take things at the same

159
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,079
time and just makes the commercial side

160
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,918
of things more challenging

161
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:31,519
um it becomes more of a you know craft

162
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:33,758
type of scenario where

163
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,359
you uh you have to pick some of the

164
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,919
plants you have to harvest some at one

165
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,720
time

166
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,918
the double poly hybrids just that's what

167
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,160
you're seeing

168
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,758
if you're if you've got an f1 that's

169
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,600
expressing seven different

170
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,520
potential phenoes it's not an f1 um

171
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,879
and like i said there really just aren't

172
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,359
even that many

173
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,279
real f ones ours are f one ish we're

174
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,400
going f1 ish with our

175
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:01,519
fifth generations um here you got

176
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,959
that one's seeded you can see that one i

177
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,318
pollinated that one and the one right

178
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:08,000
next to it

179
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,000
is not you see the stigmas

180
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,439
die back and so when i'm seeding this

181
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:14,478
variety

182
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:17,918
i'm i'm crossing back

183
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:22,000
to the coffee f6 so this is going to be

184
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,000
the coffee berry back cross

185
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,918
that i'm selecting for these really

186
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,360
magenta

187
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:32,879
hairs to bring into a coffee-like

188
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,639
growing structure and budding structure

189
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:39,680
and resin making

190
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,120
but let's leave it at that f1s

191
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,879
it's where it's at when we're talking

192
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,959
production for the market

193
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,038
inbred lines it's where it's at if you

194
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:50,478
really want to be making seeds

195
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:52,079
and so you know

196
00:07:50,478 --> 00:07:53,839
keep furthering your lines if you're a

197
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:57,120
breeder and hold your

198
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,959
your breeding lines separate and and use

199
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,519
those to make next year's

200
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,198
uh seeds if you're going to then also

201
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:06,639
not just be a breeder but a

202
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,960
production grower

203
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,038
and or you just want seeds to go to

204
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,719
people

205
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:20,159
with reliable production potential

206
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,160
all right f1s have a good day
