gonna be super super cool especially for

19
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,439
me I grew up smoking oh gee cush and for

20
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,600
I feel like eight and nine years

21
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,119
straight that's all I smoked that's all

22
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,130
I wanted to smoke pure clone only og

23
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,409
cush so his Dougie's kind of broad

24
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:05,159
working together I grew up in the Bay

25
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:07,530
Area grew up in Bay Area California up

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,009
in NorCal I lived in Colorado for the

27
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,929
last 18 years or so and now I'm back in

28
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:14,608
California just kind of traveling right

29
00:01:12,929 --> 00:01:26,998
now I'm on tour for the next two or

30
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:28,349
three months so just free-floating yeah

31
00:01:26,998 --> 00:01:29,670
there's a lot of stories and actually

32
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:32,699
that's that's one of the guys that I

33
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,039
look up to Josh D I really respect his

34
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:38,490
opinion and I follow that trend in that

35
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:40,049
story to be honest there's a lot of

36
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:42,269
different stories about OG Kush I

37
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,859
believe that Oh G stands for original

38
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,810
you know there's a lot of people that

39
00:01:43,858 --> 00:01:47,849
thought that it stood for ocean grown or

40
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,280
original gangsta and things of that

41
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:53,458
nature I was always told from day one

42
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,638
that the OG and OG Kush stood for

43
00:01:53,459 --> 00:02:00,359
original and then talking to a lot of my

44
00:01:56,638 --> 00:02:02,908
friends from that generation the cush

45
00:02:00,358 --> 00:02:05,158
part was due to the the cushy nature the

46
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,209
squishy nature of it and that's really

47
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:12,120
what's stuck as far as I've been told

48
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:13,860
about OG Kush and you know the lineage

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,909
is all over the place because nobody

50
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,750
created

51
00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:21,030
cush I think that some of the first og

52
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:23,520
you know that true true clone only

53
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,490
strain came out of Florida migrated to

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,490
LA I really gained its popularity and

55
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:32,370
its hype in Southern California and then

56
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:35,280
dispersed from there one cut went out to

57
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:39,180
ghost OGE out in Oregon you know and

58
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,590
things spread like that but some some

59
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,129
cool studies are coming out with the

60
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:48,900
genealogy and following the actual

61
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:51,750
origins of strings like this that's a

62
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,400
great question you know through and

63
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,969
through since day one

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:59,060
the hi of OG Kush has always been

65
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:01,919
extremely strong but clear-headed for me

66
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:04,650
and the taste is just something almost

67
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:09,119
undescribable I always say it's got a

68
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,770
citrus gas and tennis ball funk and I

69
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,400
say tennis ball because if you've ever

70
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:17,580
cracked a brand-new can of tennis balls

71
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:19,709
smell that smell and smell a jar of OG

72
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,920
Kush there's some similarities there

73
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:26,069
oddly enough so citrus gas and tennis

74
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,989
ball funk is what I consider a G and

75
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:29,069
then there's also a lot of G's and

76
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,260
especially some of the original ones

77
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:34,169
that do have a hint of anise on the

78
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:37,289
backend and on the top of the tongue so

79
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:46,529
a little bit of all those flavors citrus

80
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:48,060
gas anise and tennis ball funk a G Kush

81
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,800
and it might not have been the same

82
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,930
exact strain they might not all have

83
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,760
grown oh gee clone only oh geez and I'm

84
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:56,610
actually I haven't even fully dove into

85
00:03:53,759 --> 00:04:02,939
this just got it late last night and

86
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:06,120
just starting to dig in today yeah yeah

87
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:08,310
yeah yeah I always like to start out

88
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,230
with number one I like to make a big

89
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,370
list for myself write everything down

90
00:04:10,229 --> 00:04:17,879
and put things into the app but uh yeah

91
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,350
I always start just sequentially yeah

92
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:21,639
this is number one

93
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,110
[Music]

94
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,530
yeah first I want to smell it

95
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:29,139
take the sunglasses off for this first I

96
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:32,049
smell it take it out I want to see what

97
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:35,500
the nug structure looks like I want to

98
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:38,680
make sure that there's no you know no

99
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:41,079
issues that are blatant to the to the

100
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,300
eye to the naked eye just make sure that

101
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:45,668
there's no you know PM or might damage

102
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,410
and things like that which generally

103
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:48,728
speaking in most of these cups recently

104
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,160
you're not gonna see too much of it

105
00:04:48,728 --> 00:04:53,649
because it's gonna get pushed aside or

106
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:59,820
not actually fully entered due to

107
00:04:53,649 --> 00:05:03,189
failing of microbial or other issues

108
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:05,348
yeah I go for the smell I want to break

109
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:11,939
one of the nugs I want to really get

110
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:14,228
deep inside there smell it from there I

111
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:17,680
basically break one up and I roll a

112
00:05:14,228 --> 00:05:20,469
spliff because I can't really tell

113
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,079
anything you know fully from just the

114
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,789
smell and the appearance it's about the

115
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:28,930
smoke ability it's about how it burns

116
00:05:24,788 --> 00:05:31,029
it's about the flavor fully through so I

117
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,280
actually will smoke every single entry

118
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:35,799
from start to finish

119
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,239
certain entries you know you get halfway

120
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,430
through the spliff and it's just really

121
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,468
not good and we'll set those down and

122
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,610
you'll kind of notice in my ashtray that

123
00:05:41,468 --> 00:05:44,800
some of the spliffs are burned to the

124
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,288
crotch some of them definitely have a

125
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,689
big spliff tail as we call it left

126
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:52,500
behind because I didn't like it as much

127
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:54,968
so what's what's the initial reactions

128
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:59,500
entry number one smells great it's got a

129
00:05:54,968 --> 00:06:01,538
great structure big calyxes you know

130
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,629
often times I'll look to to see if the

131
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:06,370
bud looks like it was machine trimmed

132
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:08,978
and this does not appear so you know

133
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,439
I'll see if the calyxes have been

134
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:12,848
knocked off with some scissors and

135
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,468
things like that if people weren't as

136
00:06:12,848 --> 00:06:18,459
particular with the trim but it's a nice

137
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:22,180
tight trim big calyx structure beautiful

138
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:26,250
trichome coverage for an OG and it's got

139
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:29,139
a great cure on it too good Oh Geno's

140
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:34,370
it's got a little something else on the

141
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:36,228
on the tip of my tongue here

142
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,418
but I'm gonna have to taste it to really

143
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:44,589
really fully see what I think about this

144
00:06:38,418 --> 00:06:46,758
one yeah number one

145
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:48,560
so generally I'll go through them all

146
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,770
and just do a visual and smell

147
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,759
inspection take some notes and then from

148
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:55,279
there I'll start at the very beginning

149
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,610
again do the same visual and smell

150
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:03,379
inspection and then smoke a spliff of it

151
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:05,990
I smoke spliffs so I want to really see

152
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:07,699
a constant and that's something that I

153
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:10,370
do you know differently than a lot of

154
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:12,860
the judges but I know the flavor that

155
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,259
I'm really looking for when I blend my

156
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,759
grabba in with it it's like a base some

157
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:18,949
people use a blunt some people use a

158
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,538
bong when I smoke out of a bong all I

159
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:22,610
taste is resin you know and the people

160
00:07:20,538 --> 00:07:24,288
that are used to smoking bongs they're

161
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,848
using that resin taste that's kind of

162
00:07:24,288 --> 00:07:28,159
always on the back end of their tongue

163
00:07:25,848 --> 00:07:30,918
and they're able to taste the flavor of

164
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,720
the gum cannabis that much clearer

165
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:35,000
because they're balancing it off of

166
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,610
something that's a standard for me that

167
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,110
standard is an unbleached paper and some

168
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,819
grabba so that's really what I base my

169
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,669
judging off of I'll roll a spliff

170
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:49,759
because I smoke spliffs daily and so I

171
00:07:46,668 --> 00:08:01,758
mean how many for this one we have 10

172
00:07:49,759 --> 00:08:03,649
entries 10 passing entries okay so how

173
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:11,569
long will it take you to go through all

174
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:13,819
ten to give each one you know I'm you

175
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:16,219
know maybe it's that I'm blessed to

176
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:18,259
smoke really good but I've been judging

177
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,840
so many cups I've got a pretty healthy

178
00:08:18,259 --> 00:08:24,408
habit of smoking upwards of an ounce

179
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:27,228
ounce and a half a day so I do get high

180
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:30,949
and some strains definitely hit me a lot

181
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:32,629
stronger I try and space them out at

182
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:38,300
least a couple hours but I can knock out

183
00:08:32,629 --> 00:08:43,269
ten entries in a day yeah yeah I've had

184
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:43,269
upwards of 75 entries in four days

185
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:49,660
you know yeah so now let's talk about

186
00:08:46,269 --> 00:08:53,399
passing verses family because people

187
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:53,399
were throwing he that dug for

188
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:57,159
not-so-humble sunglasses back home hey

189
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:02,730
what's up what's the question

190
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:07,240
a couple entrance failed the testing and

191
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:08,980
very in my mind very openly let people

192
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,870
know that on histogram I think is pretty

193
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,360
transparent with the process then he got

194
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:16,028
a lot of shit for it because he wasn't

195
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,240
calling those people out by name what

196
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:21,490
I've seen from an outside perspective

197
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,680
because I've judged fuck a thousand cups

198
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:27,070
at this point to be honest I've judged a

199
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:30,069
lot of cannabis cups and I love the

200
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:32,290
transparency but you can only really be

201
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:35,440
transparent to a point we have a lot of

202
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:40,509
friends and you know community in this

203
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:43,060
that it's such a hard situation

204
00:09:40,509 --> 00:09:44,559
putting your friends on blast and things

205
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:46,239
of that nature is not what we're trying

206
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,828
to do you know we're trying to promote

207
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,480
positivity

208
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:51,519
some of some of the time these guys are

209
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,009
getting cuts from they're from you know

210
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,810
outside sources that have systemic

211
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:57,220
problems with them and that's how a lot

212
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:58,509
of these things are coming in it's not

213
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:00,570
that they're spraying with Michael

214
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:03,519
butanol still and things of that nature

215
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:07,720
but in reality it's not really my place

216
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,639
to speak on it it's one of the reasons I

217
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,019
don't throw competitions because of that

218
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:15,399
I've got too many friends in this

219
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:16,200
industry and you know it's it's it's a

220
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:29,210
balancing act

221
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:29,210
