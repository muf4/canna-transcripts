2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,998
my name is Michael Masterman Smith I'm a

3
00:00:09,349 --> 00:00:12,288
molecular medical pharmacologist from

4
00:00:10,999 --> 00:00:16,130
UCLA go Bruins

5
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:17,179
a brain tumor specialist from UCLA go

6
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,039
Bruins

7
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:20,660
chief scientific officer of CA labs

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,099
which is a small company that we're

9
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,530
starting and once again it's the

10
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,900
botanical drug space is one is one way

11
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:29,230
to explain it Fido phytochemistry is is

12
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:31,459
another way to explain what are what are

13
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,009
chemicals and pharmaceuticals that come

14
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,410
from nature versus something that might

15
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:38,929
be synthetically derived in a lab or and

16
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:40,429
and if any of you who have healthcare or

17
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:41,840
obviously of healthcare backgrounds but

18
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:44,000
if you have biology backgrounds we know

19
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,579
most of our drugs come from natural

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,079
products and then we will do.a some

21
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:49,609
tweaks on it and make it synthetic and

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,340
that and then that's how drugs develop

23
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:54,019
so in many ways my talk about medic

24
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,489
medicinal cannabis reverts back to

25
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,559
something that we used to do before we

26
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:59,269
had the age of synthetic chemistry and

27
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,979
our ability to really modify chemicals

28
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,960
in new in different ways

29
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:04,878
I'm also a United States congressional

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,700
candidate that was something new that

31
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,079
happened this year and I just felt as

32
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,329
though compelled that it was time for me

33
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:12,679
to step up and and take a serious

34
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:13,728
responsibility for some of the

35
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,830
healthcare issues that we have in this

36
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:18,019
country and I'm a founder of the Center

37
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:19,760
for accessibility center for

38
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:22,340
accessibility research and education

39
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,570
care it's a new organization that I'm

40
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,909
starting to be able to get healthcare

41
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:27,769
candidates elected as well as move on

42
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:30,020
some of these agendas that that that

43
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:36,170
need to be done at the federal level and

44
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:38,750
so I'm now a healthcare advocate so from

45
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:40,100
cancer lab to cannabis farm in 1998 I

46
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,290
became interested in malignant brain

47
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:44,030
tumors I was researching pediatric brain

48
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:45,770
tumors and we just didn't have a lot of

49
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:48,409
options for these patients and these

50
00:01:45,769 --> 00:01:50,688
kids the cause was unknown treatment

51
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:53,060
options were were and still are very

52
00:01:50,688 --> 00:01:54,438
limited and then in 2003 we discovered

53
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,390
these things called cancer stem cells

54
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:59,478
and these weren't pediatric brain tumors

55
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,159
and we found that this changed the way

56
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:02,780
we think about cancer as the cause of

57
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,130
the most malignant cancers and so this

58
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,590
is something where we actually could

59
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:08,269
dial into these cells go bad and that

60
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,610
causes the problem so we describe these

61
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:13,280
things as basically stem cells that

62
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,680
break bad and they just go they are

63
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,689
responsible for

64
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,250
create making copies of themselves but

65
00:02:16,689 --> 00:02:20,109
it also creating the tumor tumor bulk

66
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,000
and the malignancy as well as they're

67
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,020
responsible for metastasis and this was

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,099
something that I was always very

69
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,650
passionate about I'm still very

70
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:28,509
passionate about but it's it's a matter

71
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,250
of we haven't we now have a new

72
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:31,750
understanding of what cells we need to

73
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,479
be looking at now we need to target them

74
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:37,240
and then 2006 we screened and studied 30

75
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:39,519
over 30,000 drugs which could kill brain

76
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,409
cancer stem cells this is exhaustive

77
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,120
pharmaceutical research we're really

78
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:44,409
trying to find what might kill these

79
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,710
things and we couldn't find anything to

80
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:49,329
kill them the exception of by 2013 that

81
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,890
and if you look at the numbers the

82
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,660
amount of time and effort it takes to be

83
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:55,179
able to develop something that might

84
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:57,069
actually be brought through as a as a

85
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,770
treatment for cancers it's a lot of time

86
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:01,599
so into 2013 we published a study

87
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,490
proving cannabinoid receptor agonists

88
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,829
are a powerful drug class that could

89
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,330
kill these specific cells the issue was

90
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:09,040
we were dealing with synthetic compounds

91
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,300
we could not get them to clinical trials

92
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:11,439
we couldn't license them we couldn't do

93
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,630
anything with them because they would

94
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,159
they would they would be considered too

95
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:18,729
toxic for us to be able to continue

96
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:20,680
clinical trial that led later on to 2016

97
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:22,959
I founded a botanical biopharma company

98
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:27,790
to develop cannabinoid based medicines -

99
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,590
for hard to treat conditions what I'm

100
00:03:27,789 --> 00:03:32,949
gonna talk about today is what is the

101
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,180
endocannabinoid system three important

102
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:36,250
diseases where cannabis based medicines

103
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,020
may become essential in reducing disease

104
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,129
burden in healthcare costs one is brain

105
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,020
injury and brain health

106
00:03:39,129 --> 00:03:42,609
second one is cancer my specialty and

107
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,850
the third one is pain management and

108
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,560
stemming the opioid crisis I'm gonna

109
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:48,280
describe what do cannabis medicines

110
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,170
actually look like

111
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,830
what is the national kind of some

112
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:55,299
medicine policy look like and then we're

113
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,769
gonna go over real quickly challenges

114
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:01,300
and promise for implementation into the

115
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:02,860
US healthcare system the takeaway from

116
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:06,850
all this is how do we make America

117
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,830
healthy again the human endocannabinoid

118
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:10,000
system so the human endocannabinoid

119
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,219
system is a lock and key for

120
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,419
cannabinoids and cannabis based

121
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,400
compounds there's several different

122
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:18,629
receptors receptors are antennas they

123
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:21,910
coat the surface of cells in our bodies

124
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:24,129
cannabinoid receptor one in red is

125
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,830
receives THC that's tetrahydrocannabinol

126
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:28,329
that's the that's our that's our domain

127
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:32,019
thing that everyone focuses on in the

128
00:04:28,329 --> 00:04:34,149
adult use market with regards to to that

129
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:35,589
market it's mostly in the central and

130
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,538
peripheral nervous system then there's a

131
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:39,218
kind of annoyed receptor 2 which is

132
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:41,110
indirectly receives inputs from

133
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:44,228
cannabidiol which is which is a non

134
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:45,788
psychoactive CBD and then that's found

135
00:04:44,228 --> 00:04:48,370
in the nervous system and remarkably

136
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:50,168
it's found in the immune system if you

137
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,728
could see the greens and Red's though

138
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:54,698
these are this is a receptor system

139
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:56,228
that's throughout our bodies it is with

140
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,270
regard to difficulty the green area the

141
00:04:56,228 --> 00:05:00,098
immune system well it's for our gut is

142
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:01,209
it's for a lot of things go down go on

143
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:02,740
down there and that's where we have a

144
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:05,228
lot of problems with with autoimmune

145
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,150
diseases and whatnot in our guts and IBD

146
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:09,158
inflammatory bowel disease it's all it's

147
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:13,000
all mediated by our immune system and

148
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:14,800
it's in our gut area now there's also a

149
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,930
third we're still learning this is a you

150
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,759
know basically we we built the car and

151
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,019
we're driving it at the same time we

152
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:22,479
made there might be a third and

153
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:24,459
cannabinoid receptor that's still under

154
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,778
study it hasn't been called the CB 3

155
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:27,008
it's right now called some very

156
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:28,589
complicated name we're not getting it

157
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:30,699
into and then there's these

158
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:32,348
endocannabinoids and these are the drugs

159
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:34,060
that our body produces just like

160
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:36,459
endorphins get produced when you when

161
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,839
you run same thing happens in our bodies

162
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:39,128
we have these endocannabinoids that get

163
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,948
produced for a number of different

164
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:45,389
reasons and I'm just going to go into a

165
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:47,740
few of them here today and what they do

166
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:49,028
so traumatic brain injury traumatic

167
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,949
brain injury is a devastating disease

168
00:05:49,028 --> 00:05:53,769
it's a devastating thing that happens to

169
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:55,598
a person the and reproduces a cascade of

170
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:57,519
complex events within 20 minutes and

171
00:05:55,598 --> 00:05:59,588
then there is the reparative in

172
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:01,120
destructive processes that go on in

173
00:05:59,588 --> 00:06:01,838
those 20 minutes as well as beyond those

174
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,788
20 minutes

175
00:06:01,838 --> 00:06:05,408
there's primary secondary long-term

176
00:06:03,788 --> 00:06:07,870
effects there's no real effective

177
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:09,459
therapies and the side effects of

178
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:12,038
traumatic brain injury include painting

179
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:15,068
memory attention deficits anxiety stroke

180
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:16,449
effects PTSD affects learning depression

181
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:17,710
these are risks is a really hardcore

182
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:19,060
disease that we just really don't

183
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:21,068
understand a lot about and we're still

184
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,810
trying to figure out the interesting

185
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:25,750
thing about traumatic brain injury that

186
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,189
however is that we learned that the

187
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,718
about these endocannabinoids from

188
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:30,189
studying traumatic brain injury

189
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:31,629
so these endocannabinoids are naturally

190
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,699
occurring contaminoids they protect the

191
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:35,349
brain from stress during injury and they

192
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:37,300
were identified by studying the effects

193
00:06:35,348 --> 00:06:39,848
of brain injury on the right side of

194
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,509
this slide is a picture of a presynaptic

195
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:42,639
post

196
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:44,889
tactic noron and there was these

197
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,560
chemicals on the left slide is those

198
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:49,779
those odd-looking chemicals and those

199
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,110
are CBD like compounds and what they

200
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:55,239
learned was upon brain in a prawn upon a

201
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:56,590
traumatic brain injury these chemicals

202
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,650
get produced by the body and their

203
00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:02,079
specific purposes to to stop chemical

204
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:03,339
signaling that can kill neurons and I

205
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,300
thought this is very fascinating that

206
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,469
would happen that we were trying to

207
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,329
figure out traumatic brain injury we

208
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,100
ended up in the same fashion that I was

209
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:10,449
learning about cancer another lab

210
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,650
studying traumatic brain injury and they

211
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:13,269
said oh wait a minute this is something

212
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:15,009
that is something that could protect

213
00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:16,329
brain injury or not and I'm seeing in a

214
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:17,920
cancer lab and I'm like oh my god this

215
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:19,419
is something I could kill cancer this is

216
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,220
a lot of the ways scientific communities

217
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,449
starting to look at this look at this

218
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:26,050
thing and look at cannabinoids in a

219
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:27,430
different way can I have a kid who knows

220
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:28,960
in our production our brains are

221
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:30,790
constantly under stressed through

222
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,849
lifestyle aging if you have a brain

223
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,050
injury you played football or soccer or

224
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,720
any other event that would hit you in

225
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,100
the noggin mood disorders poor sleep

226
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,930
diet these are all things that we all

227
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,550
experience right and it turns out the

228
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,199
cannabinoids may fend off this stress

229
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,579
it's a natural thing that our bodies are

230
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:48,099
doing in order to in order to protect

231
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:50,800
itself from from these insults that we

232
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,510
have to our body and of cannabinoids are

233
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,160
produced in response to brain injury may

234
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:56,560
play a role in recovery from brain

235
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,120
injury and Oquendo binoy to repair and

236
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,829
protect the brain and then the

237
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,300
scientific consensus is now that

238
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:02,500
cannabinoids can be fir that should be

239
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,939
further developed as potential

240
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:09,970
preventatives as well as treatments for

241
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:12,040
brain injury now we're gonna move

242
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,600
switching to cancer the effects of

243
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,700
cancer on our healthcare system are

244
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,800
enormous it takes up to a billion

245
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:20,170
dollars to bring a drug to the to bring

246
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,870
a new drug to market to satisfy return

247
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,370
on those costs each successful drug must

248
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,560
bring in about five billion to ten

249
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,449
billion dollars so the worldwide sales

250
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,550
of cancer drugs surpassed 100 billion

251
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:33,490
dollars in 2016 and the market is

252
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:35,430
expected to reach 147 billions by 2017

253
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:37,479
or obscurity by 2018 which be this year

254
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:39,219
mark that bring that into the United

255
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,780
States and and directly affecting your

256
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,430
careers and what we're doing here in the

257
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:44,459
United States is that we have 1.6

258
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:47,289
million new cancer cases each year

259
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:49,690
600,000 cancer deaths and 30% of

260
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:51,099
patients die within one year so we still

261
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:52,480
feel own way to go and then we have

262
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:54,659
these economic issues that we have to

263
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,659
deal with

264
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:03,080
so the big question can cannabis really

265
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:06,440
be used to treat cancer absolutely this

266
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,879
is a very the slide of a very what what

267
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,160
goes on in cancer and how we study

268
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:12,080
cancer cannabinoid receptors get

269
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,759
expressed on cancer cells they act as

270
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,379
antennas to condemn it and then the

271
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,120
cannabinoids can get into the cells

272
00:09:15,379 --> 00:09:19,580
through those receptors and then they

273
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,289
actually just kill the cancer cells but

274
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,509
there's a lot of complications that go

275
00:09:21,289 --> 00:09:25,669
on so if you look at this slide there's

276
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:28,399
all these different signaling pathways

277
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:30,259
so the red parts are inhibitors of a

278
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,179
particular function and the green green

279
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:34,669
arrows are activating functions if you

280
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:36,379
look at the bottom of the slide most of

281
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:39,829
those functions that you're seeing are

282
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:41,539
cancer stem cell things epithelial

283
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,100
mesenchymal transition is how a cell

284
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,759
pops off from a tumor and then goes

285
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,529
somewhere else

286
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,569
that's how metastases get started

287
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:49,519
there's some things in the middle here

288
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:52,910
feel it directly in the middle that mTOR

289
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:56,769
that akt that pi3 kinase or it's called

290
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:59,769
PA 3k that's a very very powerful

291
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:02,269
cancer-causing signal the drugs are very

292
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:04,819
difficult to develop I worked with this

293
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:06,409
pathway for most of my career and we

294
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,970
every single time we throw a drug at

295
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:09,259
that that's trying to inhibit that

296
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,300
particular pathway that would kill the

297
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:12,620
cancer stem cell it didn't work so a lot

298
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:15,879
of these drugs that are on the market

299
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:18,830
now they're only there satisfactorily

300
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,389
they're satisfactory they're treated as

301
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,160
block Buster's but we still have a long

302
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:23,569
way to go because these pathways are

303
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:27,829
very difficult now that thing in the

304
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:30,470
middle that pi3k a KTM tor shutting that

305
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:33,050
pathway down will kill a cancer stem

306
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,950
cell and it turns out that that's what

307
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,349
we found and we were studying

308
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:38,390
cannabinoids it shut that pathway down

309
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:41,269
and the cancer can and the cancer stem

310
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:43,639
cells died and that's really where we're

311
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:46,159
looking at targeted chemotherapy for

312
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:48,169
cancer might actually be targeted

313
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:53,059
cannabinoid therapy for cancer in the

314
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:53,509
future how does kind of miss kill cancer

315
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:56,059
cells

316
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:57,799
some cancers cells Express antenna like

317
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:59,809
receptors on the cell surface perhaps as

318
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,129
a mutation for growth we're still trying

319
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:03,289
to understand why I condemn annoyed

320
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:05,629
receptor would be expressed specifically

321
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:06,469
on a cancer sent cancer cell a lot of

322
00:11:05,629 --> 00:11:09,110
research still needs to be

323
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,899
dun cannabinoids enter the cancer cells

324
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,460
and act as a Trojan horse can its effect

325
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:15,470
essential signals that keep cancer cells

326
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,060
alive and then cancer stem cells

327
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,610
particularly are highly dependent on

328
00:11:17,059 --> 00:11:22,039
very specific signals for survival that

329
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:24,289
cannabinoids shut down and because of

330
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,639
cannabinoid effects on immune function

331
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:27,259
they may help the body to kill cancer

332
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,230
cells in ways we don't fully understand

333
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:31,580
at this at this time right now I'm going

334
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:33,440
to switch into pain management I'm going

335
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,580
to switch into the opioid epidemic one

336
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,050
of the reasons I actually ran for

337
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,820
Congress was because I felt as though

338
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:39,379
something that we were failing that we

339
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:41,780
had a drastic failure that went right in

340
00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:43,220
front of our faces and and here as I

341
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:45,139
hear I'm as a cancer biologist I'm

342
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,790
trying to understand how to treat

343
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:48,889
complex cancers and all of a sudden

344
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:50,329
we're seeing deaths from opioids it was

345
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:52,549
something that we've created it was

346
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,530
something we did and now we're all

347
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:56,629
panicked by it every doctor I see is

348
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:58,490
completely panicked by the opioid crisis

349
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:59,779
so hands rolling I'm going to switch

350
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:02,240
into hands roll the hands rolling was a

351
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:06,139
statistician and he looked at basically

352
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,669
development and how finances and art and

353
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:10,279
and the development of our economies

354
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:11,779
related to life expectancy and he was

355
00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:14,360
Swedish so he was looking at the Swedish

356
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:17,059
life expectancy so on the on your y-axis

357
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,759
here though is YX is the life expectancy

358
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:21,589
on the x-axis is income as our income

359
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:27,980
and our GDP grows our life expectancy

360
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:29,330
goes up so as a the state of American

361
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,370
medicine can be seen that in the same

362
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,540
way these are pictures from his family

363
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,129
members who helped him write this book

364
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:35,419
called fact fulness which I strongly

365
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:37,639
recommend you to read and check out

366
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:39,829
because it's a pretty cool book so we

367
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:41,419
develop in a couple of you know we

368
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,340
develop when we go from walking and then

369
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:45,589
we get bikes and we start riding bikes

370
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,660
and then we have cars and now we got a

371
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:49,310
lot of cars so we run into developed and

372
00:12:47,659 --> 00:12:50,750
then we go over developed and I look at

373
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:53,029
that fourth thing and these are the

374
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:54,409
patterns of economic development so in

375
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:56,659
the fourth thing where we have plenty of

376
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:58,639
cars that's a situation where we were

377
00:12:56,659 --> 00:13:00,259
moving into over development and that's

378
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,379
really where I think our healthcare

379
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:05,240
system is at right now where we were

380
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:06,740
good and then we just went over the you

381
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,149
know went overboard a little bit this is

382
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,169
not to scare you we're gonna change

383
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:11,269
healthcare I think it's going to be

384
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:13,179
great in the future but we just have to

385
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:15,470
we have to figure these things out we

386
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:18,409
Americans make up 5% of the world's

387
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:20,540
population we consume 75% of the world

388
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:22,939
we pay the most for them that's not

389
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:24,860
helping anyone and and our u.s. life

390
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:28,730
expectancy is dropped because of opioid

391
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:31,129
deaths males will no longer live to 82

392
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:35,750
years old we're gonna live to 75 because

393
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:39,110
of an opioid crisis the number one

394
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:40,970
killer of people under 50 is opioids

395
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:45,800
we've got to go do something about this

396
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:48,709
folks it just turns out that state of

397
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:51,979
cannabis as medicine is there to start

398
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:54,309
to help this cannabis relieves a number

399
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,389
of common ailments pain and inflammation

400
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:58,579
they relieve some costly and difficult

401
00:13:56,389 --> 00:14:01,458
to treat conditions cancer brain injury

402
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:03,230
autoimmune disorders that work

403
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,729
synergistically with existing existing

404
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:08,060
medicine so it can be brought right into

405
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:10,879
our system and not necessarily be this

406
00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:14,019
odd thing that comes in it's just a way

407
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:15,860
to help other drugs that might work in

408
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:20,539
particular things such as chemotherapy

409
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:22,250
and opioids as broad-spectrum effects

410
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:23,870
and may reduce healthcare costs and in

411
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,659
ways we don't understand yet we have to

412
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,459
research it it can be safely used as a

413
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:30,769
replacement or with opioids to reduce

414
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:33,379
opioid overdose and abuse

415
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:35,689
and healthcare and societal costs are

416
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:37,009
going down prescription medication use

417
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:39,080
has gone down and deaths from opioid

418
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:41,088
crisis has gone down in states that of

419
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:43,610
medical cannabis programs these are not

420
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:45,020
is this there was a study in the Journal

421
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,820
of American Medical Association two

422
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:49,338
weeks ago Journal of internal medicine

423
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:51,410
as well at the same time Rand just

424
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:54,140
released a public address released a

425
00:14:51,409 --> 00:14:57,679
study showing the fact that that this is

426
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:59,689
what's going on what this kind of a

427
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,370
space medicine looked like well Johnson

428
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,959
&amp; Johnson just decided that there now

429
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:04,909
have a medical cannabis company up in

430
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,458
Canada that they're working with to

431
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:09,828
create medicines GW pharmaceutical and

432
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:12,799
in just under the GW Pharmaceuticals is

433
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:16,429
this on to the left of it is a compact

434
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:18,528
is a drug called a petiole X on April

435
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:21,919
18th just next week they're about to

436
00:15:18,528 --> 00:15:24,078
have their FDA review to treat as to

437
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,479
treat seizures from a very rare form of

438
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,099
epilepsy so this is the beginning of

439
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,149
what America is going to be going

440
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,710
through the process we're going to

441
00:15:29,149 --> 00:15:33,259
create these medicines and

442
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,610
and in city labs we learned we started

443
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:35,809
to work with patients we tried to figure

444
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:37,159
out like what works what doesn't work

445
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,989
and we started to figure out that there

446
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:40,699
was ratios that were that were very good

447
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:42,799
some people who needed pain maybe needed

448
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,720
more THC people but people who didn't

449
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,939
want to get the psychoactive effects

450
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,800
they'd be able to use CBD this is gonna

451
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:51,110
this is this is gonna be medicine in the

452
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:53,179
future and as more and more companies

453
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,789
start to move through the pipelines and

454
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:57,409
and be able to go through our clinical

455
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:59,209
trials we're gonna have some new tools

456
00:15:57,409 --> 00:16:00,919
in the toolkit and we're gonna get used

457
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,570
to it and we're going to be fine I I

458
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,979
fundamentally believe that we're gonna

459
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,810
be fine we can get ourselves out of

460
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,230
these health care crisis and cannabis

461
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:10,159
medicine is going to be a part of that

462
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,920
the way to do it

463
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,719
for true cannabis based medicine and in

464
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:16,669
order for medicine to be accepted and

465
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,250
doctors to be able to say yes I believe

466
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:21,199
in this it has to be precise it has to

467
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,480
be accurate it has to be for specific

468
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,970
indications we have to report on the

469
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:28,159
side-effects we have to understand the

470
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,870
proper use for the condition and then be

471
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,759
able to explain to physicians and

472
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,169
patients how they should be using it

473
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,970
because if you don't use it right it

474
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:36,679
might not work well and it might also

475
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:40,279
get you really really high and that

476
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:42,739
might not be good either and then when

477
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:45,079
we're dealing with the severe diseases a

478
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,399
physicians care should be there this

479
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,720
isn't something that people should go

480
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,179
off and do that I'll do on their own if

481
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,970
you're sick you know doctors would I'm a

482
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:54,439
PhD I know a lot of things doctors know

483
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,240
a lot of things they need to be able to

484
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,560
be able to work with the patient so we

485
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,360
don't really have that in this in

486
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:02,389
America right now and we need to get to

487
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,088
that point and then it should be

488
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:07,849
insurable once we can make an insurable

489
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:10,069
we'll probably be able to really be able

490
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:13,519
to reduce our healthcare costs as well

491
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:18,169
as improve our care and you know America

492
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:19,490
will get healthy again components of an

493
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,769
effective national medical cannabis

494
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:22,819
policy this is something that I came out

495
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:24,019
for years and years and years and

496
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:25,609
looking and looking and looking and when

497
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:27,619
I ran for United States Congress I said

498
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:31,219
what would I want to do if I had the

499
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:32,359
power what is exactly the steps that I

500
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,980
would take in order to introduce

501
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:36,169
cannabis into this healthcare into the

502
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,849
healthcare system first accurate

503
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:40,610
scheduling of cannabis and cannabinoid

504
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:42,500
derivatives such as CBD and THC THC

505
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:44,359
psychoactive CBD is a little less

506
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,679
psychoactive to non psychoactive and yet

507
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:47,750
being treated like the exact same

508
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,750
compound with the exact same as a drug

509
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,759
of abuse that has little or no medical

510
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,048
value and yet we're seeing that there is

511
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:56,740
medical value and they're not

512
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:59,119
necessarily drug drugs of abuse either

513
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,769
we need to have a federal recognition to

514
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,750
cat cannabinoids are a safe alternative

515
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:04,759
for pain relief because that's where it

516
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:06,259
started we got the opioid crisis because

517
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:07,548
we were focusing on opioids for pain

518
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:08,720
relief and we weren't looking at

519
00:18:07,548 --> 00:18:10,429
anything else and we need to start

520
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,660
thinking out we need to start thinking a

521
00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:14,870
little bit differently about how things

522
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,759
go we need to fund research initiatives

523
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:19,069
we have to study the endocannabinoid

524
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:20,150
system when I was in training they

525
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:22,849
didn't teach us anything about the

526
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:24,470
endocannabinoid system that's just it's

527
00:18:22,849 --> 00:18:27,009
not something that you learn when you're

528
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:30,140
going through an American medical school

529
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:32,629
we have to research and develop and

530
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,799
deploy new therapies and we're going to

531
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:37,160
start to have to do this very very

532
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:38,660
quickly we have to understand the

533
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,370
healthcare economics so if healthcare

534
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,960
cows go down with cannabis and they're

535
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,178
researching it cannabis is an out of pot

536
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,890
out-of-pocket expense so we have to

537
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:48,259
understand how this is going to actually

538
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,660
favorably improve healthcare and and

539
00:18:48,259 --> 00:18:53,808
favorably improve our ability to insure

540
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:56,029
for it and actually make it possibly

541
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:58,190
easier to sell insurance if you're

542
00:18:56,029 --> 00:19:00,349
dealing with things at work and and have

543
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:01,759
the right cost metrics this could help

544
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:04,428
this is going to help you help your

545
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,058
industry and over the long term and then

546
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:09,320
we have to study Panama's use disorders

547
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:11,240
scientists and doctors do not call this

548
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:13,519
an addictive substance they'll call it a

549
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,380
cannabis use disorder they won't call it

550
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,629
an addiction there's something going on

551
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,549
there that this is not an addictive

552
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:23,150
substance as we've been led to believe

553
00:19:19,548 --> 00:19:25,220
throughout generations we have to create

554
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:28,009
specifications for medical education and

555
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:30,289
continuing medical education training

556
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:31,940
doctors nurses and you in the healthcare

557
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:33,710
system they want to learn about this

558
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,330
they want to do the right thing they

559
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:37,400
know the drugs that they're that they're

560
00:19:35,329 --> 00:19:39,710
prescribing in many cases are not what

561
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,880
they are not optimal they just want

562
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:42,829
other options but they need to be

563
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,929
trained and so see me is gonna be a part

564
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:47,418
of that as well as continuing education

565
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:48,769
for our health care insurers you guys

566
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,330
should really get up to speed on this

567
00:19:48,769 --> 00:19:51,740
this is why I'm here we're gonna have

568
00:19:50,329 --> 00:19:54,710
these conversations we're gonna learn a

569
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,940
lot it's going to help us and then we

570
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,160
need to improve the regulatory process

571
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:00,500
for cannabis medicine across our federal

572
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,880
the DEA the FDA the Veterans

573
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,410
Administration the National and suits

574
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,320
our drug abuse these are agencies that

575
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:08,090
need to be working together in concert

576
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:10,369
to be able to introduce cannabis

577
00:20:08,089 --> 00:20:11,899
medicines into our society and then

578
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:13,909
Six's insurance coverage for medical

579
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,380
cannabis and cannabis medicine it's a

580
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,550
medicine it should be it should it

581
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,780
should fall under the same exact

582
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:19,069
guidelines that we deal with other

583
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:20,779
medicines and that's where we're getting

584
00:20:19,069 --> 00:20:23,929
to and this is one of the reasons why

585
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:26,720
I'm speaking here today the challenge is

586
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:31,580
to implement a cannabis medicine pretty

587
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:33,650
simple we have an adult use thing we all

588
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:36,980
have something some relationship to

589
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:39,259
cannabis in some way we have to separate

590
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,690
out that yes there's a director a tional

591
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:43,910
use and the adult use and the fact that

592
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:47,120
we use this to treat very deadly

593
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:49,370
diseases and we use it as a mechanism to

594
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,079
improve our healthcare system and these

595
00:20:49,369 --> 00:20:52,579
are two different things and the stigma

596
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:55,490
that gets applied through things like

597
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:58,009
this don't help doesn't help my job it's

598
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:01,099
not going to help your job so if you're

599
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:03,259
gonna walk away from here I'm gonna ask

600
00:21:01,099 --> 00:21:05,449
you for this the promise and implemented

601
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:08,359
cannabis based medicine it's grown-up

602
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:10,610
pants when somebody's at the dinner

603
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:12,229
table and you're at cocktail hour or

604
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:14,829
you're in the office and you're talking

605
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,360
about cannabis and cannabis medicine

606
00:21:14,829 --> 00:21:18,769
we're the grown-up pants and say hey

607
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,119
listen I talked to somebody who really

608
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:22,250
knows what he's talking about he says we

609
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:23,239
can cure cancer with this I talked to

610
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,180
somebody who really knows what they're

611
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,620
talking about and they they they're

612
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:31,279
there's a there's a way to go about

613
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:33,589
doing this yes I snicker I laugh it's

614
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,960
funny but I'm also working on very

615
00:21:33,589 --> 00:21:38,019
difficult diseases and so my goal is

616
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,220
really recruit everybody in this room to

617
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:42,410
think like that because we're all gonna

618
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,640
get sick we're all gonna have to we're

619
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,500
all gonna have to deal with this in the

620
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,450
future do we want to do it we do do we

621
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,099
want the medicines we already have yes

622
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,779
some of them are great some of them

623
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,129
aren't that great some of them may be

624
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:54,500
too much some of them it's not enough

625
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:56,090
that you know circumstance ours that

626
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,680
we're there and we need to integrate

627
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:59,750
cannabis medicine to our healthcare

628
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,730
system because while we don't the rest

629
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:03,680
of the world is going to so this is

630
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,779
something that that grown-up pants are

631
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,519
pretty important and it is okay for you

632
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:08,960
to laugh but then say yeah but it's also

633
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:10,519
used for some really important things

634
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,549
and those medicines are going to come

635
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:14,549
along and we're going to

636
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:16,740
the insurance codes for specific ratios

637
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:17,789
and specific dosages and and specific

638
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,500
products are going to be on the market

639
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:20,909
and I have a feeling that they're going

640
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,319
to be a lot cheaper than some of the

641
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:27,450
drugs that we have to do that we have

642
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:29,909
today and we can make America healthy

643
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,620
again I'd like to thank everybody like

644
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:39,840
thank you for listening to me

645
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:48,649
[Applause]
