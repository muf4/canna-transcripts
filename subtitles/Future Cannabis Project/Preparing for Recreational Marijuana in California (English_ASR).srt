16
00:00:50,359 --> 00:00:55,159
I we purposely chose uh this particular

17
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:57,358
group so that we could talk a little bit

18
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:00,279
about 2018 which is when we're looking

19
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,399
at hopefully licensing or starting to

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,478
take applications for licensing so I

21
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,680
have a representative from a brand a

22
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:09,599
cultivation and a retail and a

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,118
dispensary and I think it's important

24
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,039
that we all take a look at what is going

25
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:18,000
on what I want to

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,799
know is what are you guys talking about

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,560
at your quote Monday morning meeting

28
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,240
around whatever kind of conference room

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,640
table you might possibly have in your

30
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:31,158
environment we want to know a little bit

31
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:33,719
of an Insight of what what's going on we

32
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,159
have a a quasi regulated system right

33
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,679
now we have a law that's partially in

34
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,320
place we have medical regulations that

35
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,040
are going to come down and start taking

36
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,319
effect in 2018 regul recreational

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,320
marijuana that's going to start taking

38
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,118
effect in 2018 which probably will be

39
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:49,438
late 2018 so I don't want anybody to get

40
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,359
the idea that it's going to be January

41
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:55,199
anymore because it will not um and

42
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:58,039
knowing that these are knobs to be

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,920
twisted still and to figure out how this

44
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:01,879
is going this is what I want to discuss

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,560
with you guys okay so we're coming from

46
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:09,118
that perspective so um let's start

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,120
with

48
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,000
Dave um you've been a cultivator for

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,640
about 20 years maybe even more than 20

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,560
years at this point right um the

51
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:25,439
1996 all right so prop to 15 right how

52
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:29,360
convenient very safe answer awesome so

53
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:30,359
you you got so let's let's talk about um

54
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,879
testing

55
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,440
right because that's a big part of being

56
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:37,159
a cultivator is being able to properly

57
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:39,000
test all of your product what what do

58
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:40,759
you see now and then when you're going

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,158
forward and you're looking a year and a

60
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:44,280
half to two years in advance what kind

61
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:46,919
of things are going through your mind

62
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,640
and what are you guys talking about um I

63
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:52,559
think the biggest thing is clean room

64
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:54,719
technology for indoor cultivation um the

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,640
one you know benefit I think we have is

66
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,158
we went out of state in

67
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,559
2012 um and we've been cultivating in a

68
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:04,719
regulated space space in Arizona now

69
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,319
we're cultivating in Las Vegas and you

70
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:09,120
know so we're already kind of subject to

71
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:11,919
the state testing requirements and

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,519
having facilities in multiple States

73
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,119
really allows us to have two

74
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,640
Laboratories where we could do lots of

75
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,200
testing on just different procedures to

76
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:21,439
dial in our protocols so I think a lot

77
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:24,079
of what we've been doing is kind of

78
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:26,400
developing cultivation IP so that we

79
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,200
could you know understand how to pass

80
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,280
the State Testing kind of the

81
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,878
Technologies we need so

82
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,120
our product could be safe so that's what

83
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,598
one of the main things we've been doing

84
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,920
is developing the the IP to uh to

85
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:41,399
compete in a regulated market and how do

86
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,679
you how do you do that when you're

87
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,560
looking at different states with

88
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,879
multiple sets of laws right so I think

89
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,239
the the way the way that I look at it

90
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:51,840
and the way we're kind of looking at it

91
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,959
as a company is what's the strictest

92
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,079
requirements on the books and let's

93
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,840
shoot for that right so we look at

94
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,280
Oregon and say okay basically you can't

95
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,280
use any pesticides you can't use any

96
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,438
fungicides you pretty much have to grow

97
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,000
in a clean room environment so how do we

98
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,318
how do we survive in that market if we

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,959
could survive in that market we could

100
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:13,479
survive in any Market uh and so kind of

101
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,600
that's the philosophy we're taking got

102
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:18,319
it and and and baron let's just talk

103
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:23,000
about that as well

104
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:24,560
so um as a brand you guys have uh you're

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,079
constantly having to pay attention to

106
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,038
the current regulations everything from

107
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:30,918
from you know licensing which we'll talk

108
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:33,199
about in a minute but and to packaging

109
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:34,560
as well what kinds of meetings and kinds

110
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,079
of thoughts and talks are you guys

111
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,319
having at that conference room table

112
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:38,839
right

113
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:42,839
now

114
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:45,519
so with regulations changing um

115
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:48,758
consistently um we're actually talking

116
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:51,319
about the right Partners so looking for

117
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:54,720
um the right sources and cultivators we

118
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:56,800
don't grow our own cannabis um our goal

119
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,600
with our company is to support

120
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,360
entrepreneurs and cultivators and

121
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:05,439
Growers so is our Focus we never wanted

122
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,520
to grow our own um our own product uh

123
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:11,600
Marley natural is about continuing Bob's

124
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:14,599
Legacy um and if if you guys don't know

125
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,120
so the Marley family um approached

126
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,840
Privateer Holdings about two years ago

127
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,918
to develop a cannabis brand because they

128
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:25,439
wanted to continue his legacy and his

129
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:28,879
message Bob was an advocate for cannabis

130
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:31,000
for 50 years um so what we're talking

131
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:33,199
about is finding the the right partners

132
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,038
and long-term partners and we are

133
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,680
actually you were talking about

134
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:43,478
restrictions we are our compliance team

135
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:47,000
is very strict um we

136
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:48,560
don't um our Partnerships are very tight

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,360
so it's all about creating tight

138
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,478
Partnerships knowing who your partners

139
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,960
are and relying on them for long-term

140
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:58,918
growth both for yourself and for their

141
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:01,000
businesses and have you guys increased

142
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:03,918
your level of compliancy let's say over

143
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,399
the last year in response to regulations

144
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,120
and laws do you feel like there's been a

145
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:10,959
big shift and is there another shift

146
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:14,800
coming we've always taken the slow

147
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:19,239
approach grow Slow Grow right do it for

148
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:22,160
the long term so we've we've been you

149
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,240
know anticipating regulations and just

150
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,720
really planning to do everything really

151
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,240
slow so we're in California right now

152
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,080
we're in Oregon as you said Oregon is

153
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,918
really tough um and we're planning to

154
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,839
launch in Washington as well and you

155
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:39,079
know the partners The Growers we work

156
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,879
with work with they're all natural

157
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:44,240
they're pesticide free they're chemical

158
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,918
free so it's really important to know

159
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,720
exactly who your partners are your

160
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,758
Growers are and continue that

161
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,400
relationship and and let me just touch

162
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:54,400
on testing because we talked about it

163
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,159
how does that affect you looking at all

164
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:00,638
the the you know nebulousness in the

165
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,639
testing world right now right um so we

166
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,560
you know we find great Partners all the

167
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,478
time and we test products and if they

168
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,319
don't pass the test we can't do anything

169
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,918
with it we will not put it into the

170
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:13,080
market um it'll be a loss for us you

171
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:15,719
know we stand by our word and our

172
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:18,639
product and that's all anyone can do

173
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,680
that's in this industry so if there's

174
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,879
any um anything I can recommend to

175
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,079
everyone here is just be true to your

176
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,560
product and make sure you're doing it

177
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:32,399
right there's too much to risk we're all

178
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,519
all here to advocate for a great cause

179
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:38,239
and this is just the beginning so don't

180
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:40,478
don't cut any Corners that's great

181
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,038
advice let's definitely that one

182
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:45,560
deserves a hand Morgan let's pass the

183
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,360
mic over to Morgan so Morgan you're with

184
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,158
medmen medmen for those of you who don't

185
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,000
know is actually a corporate company and

186
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:53,158
that has several different dispensaries

187
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,959
you can tell us a little bit more about

188
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:57,918
that under the umbrella but really you

189
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:01,959
are mostly dispensaries would you say

190
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:02,959
that's correct for this talk yes for

191
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:05,719
this talk

192
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,878
absolutely so dispensaries are all about

193
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,560
compliance at this point let's talk

194
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:11,439
about that what's happening at your

195
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,478
Monday morning meetings and you know I

196
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,839
joke about that but what are you guys

197
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:17,680
talking about as to how you've been

198
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,119
operating and then how you're going to

199
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:23,199
have to change your operations going

200
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,680
forward I would assume sure so first I

201
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,759
just want to say thank you so much to

202
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,840
Jackie and women grow for having me here

203
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,560
it's really exciting medman is a manag a

204
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,360
cannabis management uh company and we

205
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,478
have facilities throughout the country

206
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,240
and we're also an investment firm our

207
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:41,879
Flagship dispensaries in West Hollywood

208
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,879
and one of the big things that we're

209
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,879
doing and preparing for 2018 is thinking

210
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,639
about

211
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,639
documentation what kinds of standard

212
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,360
operating procedures can we have that

213
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,600
give us a full picture of what our

214
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,800
operations look like everything from

215
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,800
welcoming uh new members into our

216
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,278
Collective what does documentation look

217
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,919
like how do we train our new employees

218
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:06,320
even thinking about emergency

219
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:08,319
preparation fires all kinds of things

220
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,720
because in our experience for the other

221
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,120
states where we've applied for licenses

222
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,160
the applications often ask for a full

223
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,600
packet of Sops so we want to make sure

224
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:19,919
we have those another thing we do is

225
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,200
create compliance packets we have a

226
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,759
dispensary in the city of Los Angeles so

227
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,000
I literally took proposition D went

228
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:28,958
through every single compliance measure

229
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,399
in there put it into an Excel

230
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,799
spreadsheet sheet and made sure I had

231
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,759
documentation to back up every single

232
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,078
thing whether it was getting our

233
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:39,240
business tax registration certificate on

234
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:41,359
time checking uh physician

235
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,278
recommendations to make sure that those

236
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,720
are all correct for our members or

237
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:48,958
having the right hours just making sure

238
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,200
we have this full packet so when the

239
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,359
state releases its application and its

240
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,959
regulations we could present that you're

241
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,278
ready to go I think that's a really good

242
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,399
advice for everybody in this room too um

243
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:00,799
we get asked these questions a lot and

244
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,399
if there's anything you could do for

245
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:04,838
yourself right now as a business if you

246
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,000
just don't know what's your next step

247
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,360
listen to what Morgan said which is do

248
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,600
everything possible to get every piece

249
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,879
of documentation you might possibly need

250
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,200
together now so that when 2018 comes

251
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,879
around and they are ready you literally

252
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,040
can just hopefully Go and show up in

253
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,600
line and make it a lot easier so uh and

254
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:23,838
you know understanding what those what

255
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,240
those documents are is challenging but

256
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,600
if you can start thinking like that I

257
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,680
think that's going to be good you

258
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,839
mentioned something about training and

259
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:32,559
there a lot of we talk about this a lot

260
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:37,399
butt tender

261
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:40,039
training um would you say that in your

262
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:42,078
retail operations that you feel good

263
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,439
about your the bud tender training

264
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,479
because and I think I want to bring this

265
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,320
up to all of you guys because we're now

266
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,000
getting into a place where with

267
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,000
recreational there's going to be a lot

268
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,919
of people coming that don't know as much

269
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,879
information as let's say patients out

270
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:57,838
there that have been maybe at this for a

271
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,799
while and know the questions to ask Bud

272
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,360
tenders need to be well educated

273
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:03,359
what do you guys do about that and are

274
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,759
you going to set up any kind of training

275
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,680
for them going forward that they don't

276
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:10,319
have now we absolutely have trainings in

277
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,879
place we have a system that we use to

278
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,600
train all of them in our standard

279
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,439
operating procedures and it actually

280
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,519
provides them a lot of quizzes that they

281
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,839
then have to take and we assess whether

282
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,799
or not they complete those but another

283
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,399
thing that I recommend for businesses is

284
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:26,319
to have someone dedicated to compliance

285
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,879
if that's possible it doesn't need to be

286
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,879
their full-time job you could have a

287
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:32,039
Communications person or a public

288
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,559
relations person and on top of that they

289
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:36,639
do compliance but having the buck stop

290
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,399
with one person in particular can be

291
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:42,200
super helpful so around the November 8th

292
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,440
election I wrote a bunch of memos for

293
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,680
our Bud tenders so they could feel very

294
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,680
informed when patients walked in about

295
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:51,599
how to talk to them about the upcoming

296
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:54,439
election that's really good let's pass

297
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,519
the mic to Dave there so Dave you don't

298
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,959
really deal directly with Bud tenders

299
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:02,360
yeah not too often but with the stores

300
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:04,838
with retail you do right so looking at

301
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:07,600
what might possibly be the distribution

302
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:10,200
models coming down how will that affect

303
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,079
your business and as oppos like looking

304
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,440
at how you do things now and how you

305
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:17,198
might do things going forward to get

306
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,000
your product into the stores or into the

307
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:20,479
hands of Distributors what are you guys

308
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,198
talking about in that area that's a

309
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,800
great question I think you know what

310
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:27,679
we're doing is a lot of data collection

311
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,198
um like I said earlier one of the one of

312
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,000
the benefits that we have that we went

313
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:33,679
out of state and we're attached to

314
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,159
retail locations out of state and so

315
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,278
we're able to kind of see how our

316
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:41,399
breeding so we do a lot of breeding for

317
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:43,439
specific strains for the retail market

318
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:45,679
and so we could kind of see the trends

319
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,680
in the retail market for specific

320
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:51,120
genetics for extraction and we bring

321
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:52,719
that information back to kind of inform

322
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,759
us on how we're going to proceed on the

323
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,160
cultivation side so it's really I think

324
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:02,439
having the retail data and using the

325
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:04,879
retail data to inform kind of the uh

326
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,360
protocols on on the cultivation side do

327
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:07,838
you feel instead of just kind of blindly

328
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,560
cultivating right now but speaking of

329
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,000
retail data do you feel like you're able

330
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:13,559
to get that data yes you feel good about

331
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,519
that we feel really good about it okay

332
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:16,679
because that's important too is making

333
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,159
sure if you're getting data that it's

334
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:22,719
quality data it yes yes so yeah in in

335
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:24,519
Phoenix we have a dispensary extraction

336
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,240
and cultivation and they're all

337
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:29,440
connected under one license so we we

338
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,879
have a lot of retail data that's great

339
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,360
now are you going to try to do something

340
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:36,120
similar here yeah of

341
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,519
course uh actually on the on the retail

342
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,639
side that's probably what what we're not

343
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,560
going to focus on we're looking for

344
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:45,278
Partnerships you know um with with

345
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:48,319
investors or uh people on the retail

346
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:50,679
side we know our specialty our you know

347
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,199
our talent is in cultivation and so

348
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:57,000
that's what we're focusing that's great

349
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:59,240
pass that to Baron Baron um as we're

350
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,440
talking about compliance how much time

351
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,198
you guys spend do you think dealing you

352
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,120
know here's Morgan saying you should

353
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:06,479
have somebody dedicated to compliance

354
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,519
you know there's been a there's been

355
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,759
changes that sometimes feel

356
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,278
daily you know how do you keep up with

357
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,639
that as as a brand especially when you

358
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:15,879
have packaging so you're generating lots

359
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,000
of product and you're also having to

360
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:22,240
manufacture this packaging on top of it

361
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,078
and then the regulations change um we're

362
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,720
fortunate enough to have um a couple of

363
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:32,758
people dedicated just to

364
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:35,120
compliance and I run everything by them

365
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,839
um so I do I do marketing one other

366
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,799
thing I wanted to say about butt tenders

367
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:44,199
butt tenders are king and queen of your

368
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:47,399
business um you need to bow down to your

369
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:50,359
butt tenders it is so you we can't

370
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:54,120

371
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,600

00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:19,720
love butt tenders um compliance we have

380
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,639
a dedicated team we're very fortunate

381
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,320
that is something very important to us

382
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:27,680
we don't take it lightly um we we invest

383
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:31,240
a lot of time and energy in everything

384
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:33,599
we do and we and everything we say goes

385
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,278
through compliance all of our packaging

386
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,839
you know we're we're working in a

387
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:40,720
business that's still federally illegal

388
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:44,399
that's it's it's scary you know um

389
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,079
anyone can get shut down at any time and

390
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,360
with our new Administration we just have

391
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:52,198
to be careful with everything we

392
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,399
do definitely uh let let's go back to

393
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:54,919
Bud tenders because I think it's an

394
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,120
interesting topic we don't really talk

395
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:59,679
about that often um but some of us here

396
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,440
spend time talking about it and one of

397
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:05,318
the things that seems to be a a a Talk

398
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Amongst Regulators is maybe creating

399
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:08,879
some kind of certification for Bud

400
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,319
tenders what do you guys think about

401
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,078
that and let's take a quick poll in the

402
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:13,759
room how many people in here think Bud

403
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,399
tenders should have a

404
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,480
certification that's pretty much

405
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,519
everybody okay what do you guys think

406
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,360
about

407
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:25,278
that um I I agree I think it's it's a

408
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,399
process I think all bud bud tenders

409
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:30,278
should go through a training process you

410
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:32,600
know they're recommending um you know

411
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:34,720
medicine to to people so there

412
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,000
definitely needs to be a training

413
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,959
process and there's a trust you know so

414
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,679
when I go into a dispensary I'll go go

415
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,479
to a bud tender and ask them you know

416
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:46,278
let them know what I'm looking for and I

417
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,240
and I trust them so I think it's very

418
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:51,159
important and what we do from a Brand's

419
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,278
perspective is we go in there and we try

420
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:55,879
to educate them about our products and

421
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:58,198
what our products do and hopefully other

422
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:59,958
brands and you know companies do the

423
00:16:58,198 --> 00:17:01,919
same

424
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:04,078
that's great you have a thought on that

425
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:06,558
bud tender certification yeah I think

426
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,480
it's a good idea um you know there's

427
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,918
always you know I think on the

428
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,480
cultivation side uh the cultivators take

429
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:14,720
the you know the the plant very

430
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,679
seriously and we spent many years

431
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,000
developing different strains and

432
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,038
studying tpine profiles and different

433
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,919
techniques and um a lot of times that

434
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:25,439
doesn't carry over to the other side

435
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,199
there's a lot of name game happening and

436
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,000
you know you'll develop something and

437
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,038
the the name will switch when it goes

438
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,519
across to the retail side so I think

439
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:35,798
it's a great idea I think you know the

440
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:38,359
more the bud tender knows about tpin and

441
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:40,400
cannabinoids and um potential

442
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:42,199
interactions and negative and positive

443
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,038
effects that's much better for the

444
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:48,720
retail user so I'm all for it great

445
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:51,240
Morgan I don't have a particular stance

446
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,558
on it but we are operating in New York

447
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,839
and it's one of the most highly

448
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,879
regulated medical marijuana programs in

449
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:59,798
the country and they actually require

450
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,640
pharmacists to be on staff and on site

451
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:04,079
at all times which is a pretty

452
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,520
interesting thing I would say as we're

453
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:09,199
waiting for the regulations to come down

454
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:11,200
to look at other states and see how

455
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,840
those regulations are written so you can

456
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:17,480
anticipate what potentially could

457
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:21,359
come hang on to the mic there so

458
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:24,159
um how will the new laws affect like

459
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,719
what SKS you guys put in your stores you

460
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:28,159
have X amount of SKS right now and I'm

461
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,880
assuming you kind of have a finite

462
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:33,320
amount of shelf space until you can

463
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,799
expand so do you feel like the new laws

464
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:37,200
are going to change how you guys look at

465
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:40,038
which products you're putting in your

466
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,600
stores again going back to testing

467
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:45,038
testing results and things like that and

468
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:47,199
just sort of overall compliance right

469
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,759
what happens when you come up when

470
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,919
somebody presents a product to you that

471
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:53,000
you guys aren't on board with sure I

472
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:54,600
don't think we fully know the answer

473
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,480
right now but we do know that the

474
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,839
state's going to require C toale

475
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,759
tracking so tracking it from the origin

476
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:05,038
all the way through the dispensary and

477
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:07,000
it being uh purchased by a patient uh

478
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,079
and we developed our own software called

479
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,200
my medmen that allows us to do that kind

480
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:13,119
of robust tracking so I would just

481
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,480
recommend for people to think about your

482
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:17,519
existing point of sale software can it

483
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,200
eventually adapt to whatever the state

484
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,158
is going to require um and just be

485
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,360
mindful of what those potential

486
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:26,559
regulations could look

487
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:28,759
like let's let's talk a little bit about

488
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:30,918
licensing because I think pretty much

489
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:33,000
everybody in the room is in one way

490
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,919
shape or form going to be trying to go

491
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,960
for a license and Dave if you don't mind

492
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:40,280
jumping in on this

493
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,079
um in California yeah do you feel like

494
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:44,480
you're going to take a wide approach and

495
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:47,279
try to apply for multiple licenses and

496
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,240
see what you get are you also part two

497
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,440
is are you going to apply for medical

498
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,279
licenses and recreational licenses you

499
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,720
know even though we don't know if those

500
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:58,079
things can sit side by side just yet

501
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,200
what's sort of a strategy that you're

502
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,558
thinking about

503
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,640
I think because we don't know it's a

504
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:05,480
shotgun approach it's just like let's go

505
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,600
for all of it and whatever works you

506
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:10,159
know uh when we when all the you know

507
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:12,000
pieces fall then that's what we'll we'll

508
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,400
make a decision at that point but I

509
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,679
think you know for licensing it's just

510
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,840
going after opportunities that are

511
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,000
available if there's an Avail available

512
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:24,158
opportunity for a license we're going to

513
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,400
go after it I mean and until we know

514
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,320
what the state's going to do we we don't

515
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,759
want to wait for them so we're just

516
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:33,158
going out after opportunities on the

517
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:36,798
licensing side and and baron what about

518
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:38,600
Marley Marley natural um are you guys

519
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,440
going to also do the same thing are you

520
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:42,319
going to go for multiple licenses do you

521
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,440
think I mean I know that's not exactly

522
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:47,079
your role in the company but I'm sure

523
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,840
you've been talking about it and medical

524
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:53,798
versus recreational how does that factor

525
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:56,720
in that isn't my specialty but what I do

526
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:58,639
know is we are going very slow with

527
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,319
everything we're we're we're watching

528
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,240
watching we're trying to work out all

529
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:07,558
the Kinks that um come up with any

530
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:11,159
cannabis business and really just kind

531
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:13,879
of um specialize in what we do work with

532
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:16,640
our partners and and see where that

533
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,520
grows and again like grow slow we're not

534
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,440
trying to be this you know big company

535
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:23,079
too fast it's like it's about the

536
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,360
Partnerships we have right now and

537
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:27,678
growing slow and having growth are you

538
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:29,959
guys in multiple States we're in

539
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,960
California in Oregon and we are

540
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,679
launching in Washington this spring okay

541
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,440
and so potentially plans for other

542
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:40,798
states down the line yes hopefully

543
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,360
hopefully but it's again it's I mean

544
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,960
with with everything that's going on in

545
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:49,959
this country right now it's slow it's

546
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,558
slow for sure so Morgan let's pass this

547
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,798
over to Morgan

548
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:56,960
um we talked a little bit about this

549
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:59,079
before what kinds of questions are you

550
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,840
getting from the customers in your

551
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:03,119
stores and how are you guys answering

552
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:05,199
those because I'm I'm sure many of you

553
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:08,558
in the room know that just because prop

554
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,519
64 passed doesn't mean you can actually

555
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:14,079
sell marijuana at this point to a 21y

556
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,240
old it is not yet licensed so that

557
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:19,240
particular piece of the law is not legal

558
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,440
yet until those licenses are issued but

559
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,319
unfortunately there are many operations

560
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,720
around the state that have just decided

561
00:22:23,319 --> 00:22:27,678
to start selling recreational marijuana

562
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,558
and the problem is is that the customers

563
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,400
don't necessarily know any different

564
00:22:29,558 --> 00:22:32,960
they just are kind of going with it and

565
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,038
following what the what the shop is

566
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,759
saying how are you dealing with that I

567
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:39,480
think one of the most common questions

568
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:41,599
we get is do I need to renew my

569
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,240
physician recommendation especially as

570
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:46,759
I'm already a member of the collective

571
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,640
and our answer is always yes we only

572
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:51,558
have a license to operate a medical

573
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,038
marijuana Collective so we will continue

574
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:56,558
to be fulfilling that and requiring all

575
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:58,480
of our patients to have their updated

576
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,200
physician recommendation valid ENT

577
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,278
identification and be a resident of

578
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,600
California and that's going to hold you

579
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:06,919
until licenses are issued right so we're

580
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:08,359
looking at again sometime in maybe late

581
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:10,559
2018 that they'll start to take

582
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:12,719
applications and hopefully get some so

583
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,240
just to be clear in this you know for

584
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,278
this room everybody still needs their

585
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,319
medical wreck so whether it's a pot

586
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:21,000
Lounge that someone's having you need

587
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:22,759
your medical wreck if whether it's any

588
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,278
dispensary anything you're doing that

589
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:25,919
scab is involved you still need that

590
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:28,119
wreck so and that's going to definitely

591
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,919
hold for a good year and a half maybe

592
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:31,519
two years years so you know that's a

593
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,038
question that we get asked a lot what

594
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,400
about you what are your customers say to

595
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:38,119
you you have a different kind of

596
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,919
customer um are they in the know most of

597
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:41,639
the people who you deal with yeah I

598
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,360
think so yeah most of the people we deal

599
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,520
with um just because we've been

600
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,319
operating for quite some time so

601
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,839
everyone that we deal with for the most

602
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:53,158
part has been in the industry for many

603
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:56,879
years so they yeah they're in the know

604
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:59,000
and the only question we really get is

605
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,360
when are you going to have more

606
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,159
product which is a good good you know

607
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,519
good problem to have at this point so I

608
00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:06,520
mean it's just you know the issue is

609
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:10,000
like keeping up I think with the demand

610
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:11,599
of of uh the market exploding and are

611
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,839
you we know you're you know looking your

612
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:14,599
in in other states are you going to

613
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:17,359
continue to try to expand that business

614
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:19,038
to be able to help meet this this the uh

615
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,798
need oh yeah yeah I mean I think

616
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,879
California is our Focus for sure um even

617
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:25,759
though we went out of state you know uh

618
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,440
California is really you know we know

619
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:29,519
it's the place to be we is where we

620
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,519
started it's where we're from so this is

621
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:36,359
where we want to be that's great so

622
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:39,278
Baron are you guys um one of the things

623
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:41,240
you and I have talked about is uh your

624
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,119
we'll call it giving back giving back to

625
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,720
the community um what are some of the

626
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,798
things you're doing now and looking down

627
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,720
the road in into 2018 is that going to

628
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:55,639
change what what are you doing now yeah

629
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:58,399
so um we created a um social impact

630
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:02,278
initiative called rise up before we even

631
00:24:58,398 --> 00:25:05,359
even launched or sold a product um in in

632
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:11,079
California and that is because we feel

633
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:13,519
responsible to um to this community to

634
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:15,918
to the Cannabis industry and to give

635
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:18,079
back to people that have been harmed by

636
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,960

that we need to help those people so in

657
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,880
Oregon we we did an expungement program

658
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:20,399
we helped expunge 25 um records and men

659
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:24,520
and women and we paid for it we got the

660
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:27,199
lawyers for it I mean it's it's the the

661
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:29,000
least we can do and you know that it's

662
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,120
just the beginning it's really that's

663
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:34,319
it's my passion actually it's it's what

664
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,879
I want to do it's why I um joined the

665
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,759
industry I actually worked for the

666
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:41,760
Marley family before um getting into

667
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:44,278
Marley cannabis uh Marley natural I was

668
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:47,480
working for one of their other companies

669
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:49,960
and I I joined the I was fascinated by

670
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:53,038
the Cannabis industry I I felt like I

671
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:55,360
wanted to be a part of um a community

672
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:58,519
that is changing the world and we

673
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:00,398
actually are we um in my lifetime time

674
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:03,480
we'll see the end of prohibition and

675
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:06,918
that's something I never thought I'd be

676
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:10,159
able to say so I feel very grateful to

677
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:13,200
be this in this industry and I feel like

678
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,200
all I want to do is give

679
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,720
back definitely definitely what about

680
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,240
you do you have any programs that you

681
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,000
you know do kind of a giving back

682
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,720
program yeah I mean you know the the

683
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,720
thing about cultivation is um you just

684
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,880
kind of by Nature have to employ lots of

685
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,839
people with criminal

686
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,919
records so I think we've been giving

687
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:38,720
back for many years on that

688
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:40,840
side but um you know we we we uh out of

689
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,200
state you know we've definitely employed

690
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:45,720
veterans um we we have a lot of old

691
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,120
hydroponic equipment that we've been

692
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:51,880
building up over 20 years and we're you

693
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:53,599
know uh creating a program to give it to

694
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,919
dispensaries and collectives to donate

695
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,319
to patients so they could start their

696
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:59,600
own grows um but those are the main two

697
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,038
things we're looking at right now hire

698
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:04,398
we hire veterans like I said we've been

699
00:28:02,038 --> 00:28:07,480
employing people with records for many

700
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:09,918
years and you know uh we're giving back

701
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,640
equipment uh and teaching people how to

702
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,278
grow I'm also actually in Nevada I got

703
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,440
to go back uh to Vegas tomorrow and I'm

704
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,319
going to be creating an education

705
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,640
program to help people with felony

706
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:23,960
records um so they can present it to the

707
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,919
judge to produce their records so that's

708
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:28,319
another thing I think that's very

709
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,159
beneficial that's wonderful and one not

710
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:33,639
on that uh for those who don't know in

711
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:37,120
prop 64 in California uh it is now the

712
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:39,759
law that um if you have a prior

713
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:41,278
marijuana offense that you will not be

714
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,879
discriminated against when applying for

715
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,000
a license and that you'll have every

716
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,399
same opportunity to do that so even if

717
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,720
it was just a small offense um or a big

718
00:28:47,398 --> 00:28:51,398
one and you were incarcerated for a

719
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,480
felony you are now able to apply for

720
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:55,398
license that's another one that's going

721
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,960
to get fought but in the law that is

722
00:28:55,398 --> 00:28:58,250
what it says so that's good you you were

723
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,460
ahead of the game oh

724
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,359
[Laughter]

725
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:03,480
[Music]

726
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:07,678
by by

727
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:10,278
Nature uh so um I want to bring up a

728
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:16,360
topic that um everybody seems to want to

729
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:18,759
know about and that's CBDs and uh THC so

730
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:21,359
um knowing that these regulations and

731
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:24,879
laws are still very nebulous are you

732
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:27,199
guys making any distinctions between CBD

733
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,200
products THC products um as you're

734
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,000
carrying them in your store and thinking

735
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,759
about stocking them on your shelves or

736
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,720
are you just kind of winging

737
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:39,919
it we do have a variety of products

738
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:43,038
whether it's just CBD products or a

739
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:46,000
mixture or THC I think it's largely

740
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:48,158
dependent upon uh what we see from our

741
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,038
patient base and what they tend to want

742
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,919
and that's what we continue to stock so

743
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:54,679
that goes back to our software that we

744
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:57,559
have and our point of sale system and

745
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:59,759
being able to review all of that um and

746
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:03,278
just in terms of compliance and thinking

747
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,960
about the future in regards to that one

748
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:07,880
thing that's really important for us is

749
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,840
to craft our policy strategy and to

750
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:13,039
think about our priorities so for us

751
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:15,759
like one super important thing is making

752
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:18,278
sure that the state while they are going

753
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:20,480
to require seed toale tracking uh

754
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:22,519
software that we are allowed to still

755
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,120
have our own that could then roll up to

756
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:27,679
the states uh so just think about what

757
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,439
your policy priorities are and then how

758
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,519
you can use your voice whether it's

759
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,080
through your city council or joining

760
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:36,399
existing Trade Organization to get those

761
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,879
important things across I think that's a

762
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:41,879
really good point um you know uh getting

763
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,519
involved with your city councils we've

764
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,880
talked about that a lot are you guys

765
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:48,960
active as well the other two of you in

766
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,559
in any kind of city councils or just

767
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,880
getting out in front of people and that

768
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:56,079
are regulating um we hire we hire people

769
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,000
to help us with that we're focused on

770
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:01,240
cultivation but on the licensing side

771
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,119
yeah we hire um law firms like Frontier

772
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,120
law they're uh doing a lot of hard work

773
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:07,678
out

774
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:10,038
there but yeah so you know like I said

775
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,278
we focus on cultivation but we we kind

776
00:31:10,038 --> 00:31:15,278
of contract out for those

777
00:31:12,278 --> 00:31:17,798
services and baron what about you guys I

778
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:19,480
I'm personally not in front of them but

779
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:23,200
um we have the right team members that

780
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:26,360
are definitely what about the CBD THC

781
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,360
discussion do you guys have both we do

782
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:30,319
you do we do and do you ever make any

783
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:31,959
distinctions between that or you know I

784
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:34,079
just because the the laws and everything

785
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,919
are just so questionable right now and

786
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:38,638
with the DEA doing what they just did

787
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,440
with CBDs you know it's just a topic of

788
00:31:38,638 --> 00:31:41,879
discussion there's no actual answers yet

789
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,320
but I'm just kind of curious if those

790
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,159
conversations are happening oh sorry

791
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:49,119
what was that just about being able to

792
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:51,639
safely carry CBD products we kind of

793
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:54,558
know what's going on with CHC but CBD

794
00:31:51,638 --> 00:31:58,038
it's somewhat weirdly you know

795
00:31:54,558 --> 00:32:00,599
unanswered I'm I'm not that person that

796
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:04,000
the person that would know that um I

797
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:06,240
heavily rely on our team and our compli

798
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,679
team that would you know investigate

799
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,000
that further for us okay all right all

800
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:12,320
right so the final thing I'm going to

801
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,679
talk to you guys about um and then I'm

802
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,278
going to take uh we'll open it up to the

803
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,840
audience for some questions is uh

804
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:21,159
banking so it's a problem for everybody

805
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:22,839
we know this but what conversations are

806
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:24,880
you having right now and how are you

807
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:26,599
dealing with Banking and looking forward

808
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,000
what are you anticipating so that same

809
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:31,839
question goes to all of you whoever's

810
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,200
the mic and go first um so banking is

811
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:37,199
not my specialty but I can tell you you

812
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,960
know

813
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,038
um we shouldn't try to rush this

814
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:46,960
industry it's about doing it right for

815
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:49,519
everyone and the more time it takes you

816
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,240
know we need to get involved we need to

817
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,919
voice our opinion we need to let people

818
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:57,359
know exactly what we're looking for um

819
00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:00,278
and what kind of benefits we want um as

820
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:03,119
members of of this industry so you know

821
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:05,159
it's not it's not a rush game it's let's

822
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:07,398
let's take our time with it and and do

823
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:07,399
it

824
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:12,919
right uh Bank of

825
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:18,078
[Applause]

826
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:24,038
mattress banking is a huge priority for

827
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:27,599
us and also thinking about federally 28

828
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:29,720
and the tax code and all of that I for

829
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:32,439
what we decided is to join as many

830
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:35,200
organizations as we can to make our

831
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:37,240
dollars and also our voices stronger so

832
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,679
in the city of Los Angeles we chose to

833
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,839
be a part of ucba but there's a ton of

834
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,960
other Traders associations that you can

835
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:47,319
be a part of um and at the federal level

836
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,319
we've become members of ncia which is

837
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:53,240
also pursuing the banking issue at the

838
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:55,480
federal level okay um so if I just want

839
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:59,440
to go across real quick and and if you

840
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:01,759
could give the small business

841
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,200
owner something to think about something

842
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:06,679
to chew on from your perspective because

843
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,320
you guys are already in business so a

844
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:10,119
lot of people in this room are not yet

845
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,440
in business or are just starting and

846
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,280
they want to be in business what advice

847
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,838
and what thoughts and suggestions do you

848
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,079
have for that small business owner from

849
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,679
where you

850
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:22,919
sit I think largely documentation is

851
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:26,119
super important and also research look

852
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:28,158
at how other states are handling this

853
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:31,320
and see what could be transferable to

854
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:34,119
you what makes sense uh do the robust

855
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,919
regulations in other states deter you or

856
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:39,200
are they actually something that you can

857
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:41,799
handle and take on and then pursue that

858
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,759
further yeah no I mean it's partially

859
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:47,760
true the banker mattress thing but I

860
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:51,000
mean uh I I think in in in our situation

861
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,919
we kind of default to our CPA and we say

862
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,639
this is what we've done you know you

863
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:59,639
make us you know

864
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,639
compliant

865
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:08,118
um what I'd like to say is this isn't

866
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:11,640
easy at all um so you should all be

867
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:14,160
proud to be in it or to be smart enough

868
00:35:11,639 --> 00:35:17,879
to think about getting in it um I want

869
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:20,879
to say fight the fight um it's worth it

870
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:25,119
and it's there's a bigger picture at

871
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,480
hand and we all have a chance to to get

872
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,519
into this and do it right so don't give

873
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,079
up

874
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,639
that's great thank you guys so much all

875
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,440
of you so we're going to take some

876
00:35:33,639 --> 00:35:39,239
questions Cass uh there's there's one

877
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,599
okay that's fine too uh you mentioned

878
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:43,959
the ncia handling banking at a federal

879
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,720
level what other

880
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:50,318
organizations are involved that we can

881
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:52,078
be associated with sure so I would say

882
00:35:50,318 --> 00:35:54,000
look at the marijuana policy project

883
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,039
they're doing an amazing job across the

884
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,159
country locally the LA cannabis task

885
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:02,318
force Southern California Coalition

886
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:04,399
minority Alliance those are all amazing

887
00:36:02,318 --> 00:36:06,358
organizations also ccia which is

888
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,960
California Cannabis industry Association

889
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:11,199
so NCI is the national and then ccia is

890
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,960
the California one as well as a drug

891
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:15,639
policy Alliance who's very involved in

892
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,920
the prop 64 side so there's a lot of uh

893
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:20,480
different different places but those are

894
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:23,000
some really good ones next oh she's over

895
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,838
there right now yes I have a question um

896
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,480
for

897
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:33,199
Morgan so we're in um we have our

898
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:36,119
lo50 tax bill coming up on February 18

899
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:38,358
28th because of prop 64 it's sort of

900
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,559
changed the rules it looks like this uh

901
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:42,480
city taxes taxation without

902
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:48,838
representation curious what you guys are

903
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:50,719
doing with that at medman pay it so for

904
00:36:48,838 --> 00:36:52,519
the business tax registration

905
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:54,799
certificate specifically we're just

906
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:56,719
following what the office of Finance is

907
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,280
saying and we're going to submit our

908
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:01,199
payments whatever

909
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:03,480
based on however they Define it I know

910
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:07,159
that the Board of Equalization has taken

911
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,719
particular stances on uh prop 64 and

912
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:10,519
whether or not you have to charge sales

913
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:12,719
tax for medical marijuana so I would

914
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:15,880
just suggest looking at their website

915
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:17,919
we're largely going off of what those

916
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,119
agencies are telling us to do are you

917
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,200
doing the 6% and the

918
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:26,559
9% I'm not part of the finance team so I

919
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:29,039
don't specifically know but um I would

920
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:31,400
just defer to either your legal counsel

921
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,400
your CPA or you could even reach out

922
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,559
directly to those agencies to see what

923
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,559
they

924
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:41,719
recommend hi I have a question for Dave

925
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:44,879
if you're growing in Las Vegas and

926
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:46,639
Arizona how do you transport it like

927
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,160
across state lines no we don't they're

928
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:51,199
all individual entities so anything we

929
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:53,039
grow in Arizona stays in Arizona

930
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:55,439
anything we grow in Nevada stays in

931
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:58,039
Nevada so there's no yeah no Crossing of

932
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,240
state lines not yet okay you know in

933
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:02,960
five years but right now it's all each

934
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:06,118
each uh cultivation is isolated within

935
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,639
the state and why can't we cross state

936
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:12,000
lines federally it's a federal offense

937
00:38:09,639 --> 00:38:13,279
okay yeah make sure everybody

938
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,039
understands that do not cross state

939
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,640
lines whatever you do yeah okay next

940
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:21,759
question so I agree that bud tenders are

941
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:23,559
King and Queens too because every time I

942
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,920
go into dispensary they're just so

943
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:27,960
knowledgeable as it relates to training

944
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,119
can you make a recommendation

945
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:34,599
um Oaker versus an

946
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,760
online um training organization because

947
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:40,400
as a business owner I feel like I want

948
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,400
to know everything there is a note

949
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,720
too um I'm not familiar with those

950
00:38:46,838 --> 00:38:51,759
schools but I would rely on your

951
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:55,118
partners so your sourcing Partners your

952
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:59,440
Growers your vendors your Brands to come

953
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:02,280
in and educate um your staff on on their

954
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,920
product that's key it's the duty of your

955
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:08,720
partners to do that so there are there's

956
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,519
Oaker Dam that's one example there's CCI

957
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:12,279
anybody in here in the room know any

958
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:14,199
others that we can just shout out any

959
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,760
sort of good cannabis training program

960
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:19,039
say that again green green flower media

961
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,599
exactly that's another one anybody else

962
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:23,079
420 Learning Tree 420 Learning Tree so

963
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,440
there's a couple of different places

964
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:28,000
that you can uh go and learn about this

965
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,960
um but as far as ual butt tender

966
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,760
certification programs I don't know if

967
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:33,159
they really actually exist yet it's

968
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,200
something that's being discussed right

969
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:37,559
now with

970
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:40,358
Regulators hey my question is for Dave

971
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:42,639
and baron who do you guys use to test

972
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:46,759
your flower and

973
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:49,559
why um I use two Labs

974
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:53,000
exceler um up in I think it's in Union

975
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:55,358
City and the workshop Jeff raber those

976
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,838
are the two Labs I use here in

977
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:59,719
California here in California yeah

978
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:02,199
and in the other you know other states

979
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:03,799
it's a little bit hit or miss so but I

980
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:06,078
would say in California those two labs

981
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,519
are very very legitimate um and they

982
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,318
give you very you know very scientific

983
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:12,880
results that are reliable you know and

984
00:40:11,318 --> 00:40:15,079
on the cultivation end because we do a

985
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,519
lot of breeding we're not really looking

986
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,720
for the lab that give us the highest

987
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:20,920
results we're looking for labs that give

988
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:22,598
us real accurate data and so if you're

989
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,960
looking for accurate data I would

990
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:27,680
recommend those two Labs the workshop

991
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,838
and exceler and I think Workshop is is

992
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:32,719
about to reopen in uh the next couple of

993
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:34,318
weeks um they've been kind of out of

994
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:35,719
commission for for a minute but

995
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:37,318
definitely I would recommend the

996
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:41,279
workshop in

997
00:40:37,318 --> 00:40:44,559
exceler and work is spelled w

998
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,839
RC I I defer to

999
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:49,920
DAV okay we have a question up here I

1000
00:40:46,838 --> 00:40:52,199
know we do oh okay that's fine here then

1001
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,760
there um yes it's I don't think it's a

1002
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:58,480
question but um I I just came back from

1003
00:40:54,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Amsterdam we in prom and but I live here

1004
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,800
um they were selling CBD liquid in in

1005
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,319
bottles uh at the CBS Store and it's

1006
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,359
considered uh you know easy over the

1007
00:41:07,318 --> 00:41:11,559
counter to get and it's considered a

1008
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:13,799
food item and they said it's it's easy

1009
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:15,318
to transport even so I don't know what

1010
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:17,640
you maybe it is a question what do you

1011
00:41:15,318 --> 00:41:20,559
think of that

1012
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:23,480
penel I I think the DEA just came down

1013
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:25,799
with a ruling that makes CBD schedule

1014
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,240
one so there I think I think you know I

1015
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,800
mean I'm not 100% sure but I have lots

1016
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:31,759
of friends that have companies that were

1017
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,519
doing CBD extraction so they were

1018
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,319
importing a lot of CBD from Europe um

1019
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:38,880
especially Germany because the source is

1020
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:41,358
very clean uh but I think because of the

1021
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,880
DEA ruling I don't think you could

1022
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:47,318
export it or import CBD anymore but I'm

1023
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,280
not a lawyer so maybe you could ask

1024
00:41:47,318 --> 00:41:51,880
someone else but that's what I've

1025
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,960
heard yeah give the M knows a little

1026
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:56,599
about that yeah actually you can import

1027
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:59,838
it still okay um okay as long as it's

1028
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:00,920
from the the stocks of the hemp plant oh

1029
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:04,199
okay I didn't know that okay so it has

1030
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:05,800
to be certified as that Europe CBD is

1031
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:08,399
excellent because you can get it over

1032
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:10,480
the counter the United States we have

1033
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,519
not the schedule it's always been

1034
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,639
scheduled as a schedule one CBD has but

1035
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:19,079
we finally the DEA finally gave it a

1036
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,519
number that's the difference and the

1037
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:22,880
reason they gave it a number one of the

1038
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:25,920
reasons is is to make it a

1039
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,800
pharmaceutical so connect the dots there

1040
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,119
and that's what they're doing so they're

1041
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,800
not enforcing it and a couple lawyers a

1042
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,720
couple big law firms hob and law is one

1043
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,160
of them has actually filed paperwork

1044
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:40,598
against the DEA so we'll see where that

1045
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:44,679
goes okay just cleared up thank you

1046
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:44,680
H uh we have a question over here in the

1047
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,519
corner hi my question is for Dave so uh

1048
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,318
with some of the larger cultivators that

1049
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:55,358
I converse with depending on how the

1050
00:42:53,318 --> 00:42:57,159
state rolls out licensing and everyone

1051
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:59,358
talks about the quick Crunch and the

1052
00:42:57,159 --> 00:43:02,118
shortage of product everyone else is

1053
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:05,119
talking about what happens a year later

1054
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:09,519
and the collapse of the Commodities

1055
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:12,960
market and the general prediction on the

1056
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:16,480
optimistic side I hear is 800 a pound

1057
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,800
and on the not so optimistic side 400 a

1058
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,838
pound I'm wondering what your thinking

1059
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,160
and your feelings are well I you know I

1060
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:24,239
think it's inevitable that there's going

1061
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:26,399
to be a price collapse I I don't think

1062
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:28,118
that low you know just because I think

1063
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,318
there's a high enough demand for like a

1064
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:32,519
higher end flower and just the cost of

1065
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,838
production makes it impossible to

1066
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:37,239
survive there was some data recently

1067
00:43:34,838 --> 00:43:40,279
published by medical marijuana Business

1068
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:41,838
Daily um and I you know I I'd like to

1069
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:45,000
think that Colorado is probably one of

1070
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:47,880
the most saturated markets in America

1071
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,599
and they have something like 1,500

1072
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,200
regulated commercial cultivators and

1073
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:57,559
their average price dropped to about

1074
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:59,480
1,500 so at 1,500 with a very very

1075
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:04,119
efficient commercial cultivation you

1076
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:06,440
could still be profitable so I I I think

1077
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:09,400
if they're still hitting that number on

1078
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,880
average and that includes outdoor indoor

1079
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,760
is still I think well above 1500 for

1080
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,680
really high end so you just have to make

1081
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,400
sure that you're doing something unique

1082
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:19,279
you're doing something Boutique and I

1083
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,720
think you could still survive in this

1084
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,240
market for several years many years

1085
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:26,279
maybe 5 10

1086
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:28,399
years I might be incorrect but on your

1087
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:32,200
website is says you have indoor

1088
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:35,280
production to 7 cents a gram no that's

1089
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:37,000
not I wish that that would just be our

1090
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,440
that's the cost of our n of our

1091
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,599
fertilizer just our fertilizer but the

1092
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,880
total cost is way above that yeah the

1093
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,039
labor and the electricity and the yeah

1094
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,079
the rent but yeah that that's just the

1095
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,480
nutrient

1096
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,119
cost all right we got time for one or

1097
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,039
two more questions and then we're going

1098
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,800
to move on what you

1099
00:44:56,039 --> 00:44:59,759
got

1100
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,359
uh thank you so much for being here so

1101
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,800
for a lot of us that are new to the

1102
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:06,558
industry um do you recommend going in

1103
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,359
with a partner or someone who's been in

1104
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:10,640
the industry already or do you think

1105
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:12,318
that it's doable for us to come in as

1106
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:15,719
newcomers and learn the industry and

1107
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:15,719
maybe become a small business

1108
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,599
owner

1109
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,599
um I'm all about Partners but you have

1110
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:31,838
to know who your partner is um I'm all

1111
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:34,640
about being independent as well um and

1112
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:37,599
being a small business owner I I believe

1113
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:39,879
you can do it um it it really depends on

1114
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,200
who your partners are you you really

1115
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,200
never know you have to vet

1116
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,079
everyone agreed yeah I mean um it's hard

1117
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:52,920
to say because I'm very you know

1118
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:54,200
exclusive industry side so uh in my

1119
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,838
experience it's definitely good to at

1120
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:58,679
least pick the brain of someone who's

1121
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:00,639
been in the industry because it it it's

1122
00:45:58,679 --> 00:46:02,440
it's a completely different industry

1123
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:04,159
than anything else so I think you at

1124
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,440
least want some perspective I don't know

1125
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:07,799
if you necessarily to partner up with

1126
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,920
someone in the industry but at least you

1127
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:14,480
know do due diligence and and and kind

1128
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:17,639
of talk to as many people as you can in

1129
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,639
the industry to get some

1130
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:22,679
perspective on the re retail side I

1131
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,599
would just say be careful about where

1132
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:27,318
you are entering like for West Hollywood

1133
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,838
for example they've already given out

1134
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:31,000
the four licenses that they're going to

1135
00:46:28,838 --> 00:46:34,119
be giving for dispensaries for Los

1136
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:38,639
Angeles it's a pretty iffy situation

1137
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:40,079
right now with uh measure M M M M that's

1138
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:41,519
coming on there's going to be two

1139
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:45,160
measures on the ballot guys there's

1140
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:47,079
measure M and measure n n though is on

1141
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:49,558
the ballot that's the ucba one and

1142
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:51,760
that's not to be voted on but made the

1143
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:55,480
ballot and it's going to be there so we

1144
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,680
have to get that straight m is the one

1145
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,639
that people are really looking at n is

1146
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:03,358
the one that we're at least not voting

1147
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:05,078
for so to enter Los Angeles is also kind

1148
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:06,639
of iffy because it's unclear what the

1149
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:08,160
city council is going to determine for

1150
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,598
the number of dispensaries that they're

1151
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:13,358
going to allow so just be mindful about

1152
00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:18,160
what the existing regulations

1153
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:19,838
are okay so with that I am going to say

1154
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:21,519
thank you to all three of these

1155
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:24,199
