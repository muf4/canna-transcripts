1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,009
one of the things as regulators we're

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:06,689
constantly looking at is how we can how

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,050
we can make the supply chain more

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:13,259
efficient because it is a cannabis

5
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:15,389
product is a very difficult commodity to

6
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,399
get to market in an efficient timeframe

7
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:20,879
so we're always looking at we're also

8
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:23,429
balancing between retail and supplier

9
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,710
and manufacturer because we feel like

10
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:28,829
you can't what's good for one isn't

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:32,579
always good for all so I would love to

12
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:35,129
hear from your perspective on the things

13
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:39,179
that we can control in regulations can

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:42,359
you point to one single change that

15
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:46,619
would make the supply more efficient

16
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:50,600
from your point of view I know that's a

17
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:53,698
tough one huh I can go out of order yes

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,710
so I would say we're we're on the path

19
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:59,339
to this right now but it's it has

20
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:01,320
everything to do with allowing Khoa

21
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,650
testing as high up in the supply chain

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,349
as possible and then letting that bulk

23
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:10,439
material that's been tested and have

24
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:14,728
that Khoa test move through to other

25
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:17,609
distributors to co-packers to others who

26
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:21,000
will handle it and put it into packages

27
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:24,180
or pre-rolls or you know go through that

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,819
supply chain and and that itself would

29
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,520
make things much more efficient and that

30
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,978
is much better than the alternative

31
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:34,289
of the illicit market where nothing is

32
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:35,909
tested so I totally appreciate that

33
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,939
we want to make sure that nothing

34
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:42,090
there's no jars of flour or pre rolls or

35
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:45,658
manufactured products that are tainted

36
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:48,000
with chemicals and filth and that kind

37
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,979
of thing but no matter what if it passes

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,819
a Khoa test at the bulk level it is

39
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:56,158
definitely better than what is being

40
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:58,769
sourced on the illicit markets and so I

41
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,829
would love to see that Khoa tests for

42
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:04,368
bulk product be able to travel with with

43
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:07,919
that with those I'm going to use a

44
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:12,009
metric term with the package tag that is

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,170
assigned to it and be and be good to go

46
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:15,848
but you know what I think would actually

47
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:17,738
do something amazing in the supply chain

48
00:02:15,848 --> 00:02:19,810
right now is something that gets used in

49
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:21,519
supply chains and manufacturing and many

50
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,590
many other industries whether regulated

51
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,530
or not and it's often referred to as

52
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:30,219
skip lot testing and it's the concept of

53
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:32,890
when a producer or an actor in the

54
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:35,109
industry who's responsible for the

55
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:37,539
quality of a product has demonstrated

56
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,159
that over a period of time that's

57
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:41,078
specified by a regulatory body that

58
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:42,878
they're doing things correctly there's

59
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:45,780
been an on-site inspection there's been

60
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:48,250
an audit of their SOPs and from a

61
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,079
regulatory testing perspective they're

62
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,628
passing and not having issues that are

63
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:55,090
systemic and that are related to their

64
00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:57,759
their processes and so in many

65
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:01,209
situations like that in other industries

66
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:04,328
those good actors will be allowed to not

67
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:06,639
test every lot if that was a place based

68
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:08,920
on data that we could get to from a

69
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,680
comfort level to say that we can verify

70
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:14,318
a producer to the extent that we can

71
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,590
feel comfortable taking that approach to

72
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:19,568
testing and approval of products would

73
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,128
be amazing but I think we're probably a

74
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:22,479
bit far out from that in terms of having

75
00:03:21,128 --> 00:03:27,340
the data to be able to base those

76
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:29,888
decisions on I would kind of going back

77
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:31,509
to the dispensaries piece I can't get

78
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:35,260
into a specific regulation but just

79
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:37,209
generally I would like to see some

80
00:03:35,259 --> 00:03:39,250
efforts to encourage a lot more

81
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:41,769
transition from the black market or what

82
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:44,469
I'll even say is the prop 215 crowd that

83
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:46,900
are sort of waiting in the wings

84
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:48,430
III I'd really like I think that our

85
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,409
success is going to depend on how many

86
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,409
outlets and dispensaries there are and

87
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:55,269
so I would encourage as unfavorables

88
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:57,840
this might be to some people a much

89
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:59,379
lower bar of entry for dispensaries

90
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,359
understanding that there's going to be

91
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:03,698
problems there but we need to have

92
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:06,639
access for the public to start trusting

93
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:10,239
and wanting to participate it's as a

94
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:12,879
term I use where they drew before we

95
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,899
need more carrots and less cannons to

96
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:19,680
encourage transition I know I'll say you

97
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:21,788
know further this is an industry that

98
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,400
we're not concerned about getting

99
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:25,629
arrested so cannons aren't that

100
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,089
effective they have

101
00:04:25,629 --> 00:04:30,909
been for generations so why we think

102
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:34,509
that would be effective now I think that

103
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:36,160
really some creativity and how we could

104
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:38,920
encourage people to participate in the

105
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,230
regulated market at that retail end is

106
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,949
going to do an awful lot to stimulate

107
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:46,330
growth in the supply chain throughout

108
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,849
yeah I would I would agree with that I

109
00:04:46,329 --> 00:04:51,310
think on the retail end is really about

110
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:53,710
we're the public facing side of the

111
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,930
supply chain so anything that goes wrong

112
00:04:53,709 --> 00:05:02,589
anywhere it's always the retailer's

113
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:04,420
fault and we're the lab but nobody knows

114
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:07,299
who the love is for the public ones

115
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:12,250
where the store fronts so where some of

116
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:15,639
us are and so I think that public health

117
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:18,160
component and child safety component is

118
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:21,310
really important to the retailers and

119
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,140
making sure there's the story I have

120
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,250
told a couple times about I'm sure some

121
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:27,099
people know what happened with Maureen

122
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,629
Dowd in Colorado and she ate too much of

123
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:30,430
an edible and then wrote an op-ed in The

124
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:33,430
New York Times about it and it almost

125
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,079
completely destroyed the manufacturer in

126
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,699
cannabis manufacturing industry in

127
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:39,719
Colorado and they're still recovering

128
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:43,389
today this happened in 2014 and so

129
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,760
things like that happen and so we need

130
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:47,829
to make sure that we're we're doing the

131
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,959
best of both like protect you know

132
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:52,810
touching on the the child resistant

133
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:55,209
packaging needing to be closest to the

134
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,620
actual product for certain products I

135
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:59,589
think is something that's a very

136
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,670
important um which you've heard me say a

137
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:05,500
couple times now different hearings and

138
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:08,710
also I think some sort of a just

139
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,870
consumer education outreach to take down

140
00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:12,159
take down the illicit market encourage

141
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:16,090
more people to come into the legal

142
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,970
regulated market and have some sort of

143
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:21,849
easily accessible map I have a just a

144
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:23,800
quick story my mother decided she wanted

145
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:26,439
to go buy some cannabis she lives in San

146
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:30,370
Diego County in North County and didn't

147
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:33,899
tell me but whatever and looked it up

148
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:37,199
did a Google search and found

149
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:39,659
a website that lists lots of

150
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:44,250
dispensaries some licensed some not

151
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:46,139
licensed and she she told me that she

152
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:49,680
went to a licensed dispensary in Vista

153
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:52,168
California and I was like mom no I don't

154
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,939
this does not licensing I don't think

155
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:55,589
you did and she's went to some place

156
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:59,550
called the Sugar Shack where they sold

157
00:06:55,589 --> 00:07:01,529
her a 300 milligram chokolate bar that

158
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,629
was I mean the whole thing luckily she

159
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:05,728
knows enough to not eat the whole thing

160
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:07,168
and break it up and she said it actually

161
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:10,019
didn't do anything which goes to the

162
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:12,899
testing but that whole story I was just

163
00:07:10,019 --> 00:07:15,120
like if my mother who actually you know

164
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:16,409
has a daughter in the industry and it

165
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,660
kind of knows a little bit about this

166
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,130
and she's 71 year old grandmother now

167
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,979
there must be lots of people out there

168
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:24,418
that are doing this and and I couldn't

169
00:07:22,978 --> 00:07:27,000
even I was trying to I sent her the

170
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:28,680
spreadsheet that was on the BCC site

171
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,379
because there there isn't really a place

172
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,990
that I could point to that's directly

173
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:36,240
like here this is a map of all of the

174
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,009
licensed dispensaries that you can go to

175
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,439
and you know it's tested and you know

176
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:43,409
this and and all of that and it's safe

177
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:46,709
so I think yeah just some sort of

178
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:49,199
consumer information so that the the

179
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:51,408
people that do want to go to the legal

180
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,720
market know where to go and can trust it

181
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:55,829
and then I think I'm just all of these

182
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,460
are really great points but coming back

183
00:07:55,829 --> 00:08:01,408
to Michael's point about how the batches

184
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:03,899
are configured with testing from a

185
00:08:01,408 --> 00:08:07,769
cultivator perspective you know we might

186
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:10,788
harvest one batch from one farm of say

187
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:14,129
og cush and then that og cush turns into

188
00:08:10,788 --> 00:08:16,610
one grand prix rolls and then pack of

189
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:20,219
seven pre-rolls and then eights and then

190
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:23,430
quarters and so those all new have they

191
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,710
all have new SKUs to them when they go

192
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,560
in new track and trace batch numbers

193
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:30,989
when they go to the distributor but it's

194
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,028
literally one batch of cannabis flowers

195
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:39,299
so for us to now have to test the single

196
00:08:35,028 --> 00:08:42,028
pre-rolls as one batch the five to a

197
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:43,769
pack as one batch the eight as one batch

198
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:47,549
as a cost that we can't necessarily

199
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:49,350
afford to sustain as cultivators putting

200
00:08:47,549 --> 00:08:51,509
non manufactured products into the

201
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,940
marketplace so if that could be looked

202
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:56,220
at as one batch because it came from one

203
00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:00,990
farm was harvested at the same time was

204
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:03,660
one crop that would actually create such

205
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:06,629
a tremendous amount of ease in moving

206
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:09,419
these products safely from the farm

207
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:12,208
through the testing and distribution

208
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:13,289
model and into the retail so that's one

209
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:15,599
of the places where we're really

210
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:18,480
struggling with timing hang-ups and

211
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,909
costs of trying to get a broad spectrum

212
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,670
say of non manufactured products into

213
00:09:20,909 --> 00:09:25,439
the marketplace that's a sticky spot for

214
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:27,629
cultivators right I actually think that

215
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,399
highlights one of the biggest issues

216
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:31,110
that we've all talked about along the

217
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,049
way which is the different

218
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:36,959
interpretations of the regulation text

219
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:39,740
by different parties and so Chris and I

220
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:44,009
had an aha moment a few months back

221
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:46,680
where one of the members of the BCC team

222
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:50,399
helped us understand that as a lab that

223
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:53,458
we can actually sample as one batch pre

224
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,620
unpacked flour eighths and quarters all

225
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:59,069
together as one batch and apply the coa

226
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,870
to all those different SKUs and so in in

227
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,060
certain readings of the regulations it

228
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:06,089
was interpreted by some people as if

229
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:07,649
every SKU had to have a specific coa but

230
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:09,690
in the case of flour which is kind of a

231
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:11,278
special case with the exception of pre

232
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,990
rolls which is handled differently in

233
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,120
the new draft at least as it as it

234
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,669
stands at the moment we actually have

235
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,250
the ability now to to tighten that up a

236
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:23,099
little bit into to apply one coa to

237
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:24,629
unpacked flour eighths and quarters say

238
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,759
that were from the same harvest batch

239
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:30,269
can we get a memo over to our testing

240
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,539
facility that'd be great 100% i got the

241
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:36,039
nod

242
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:56,480

243
