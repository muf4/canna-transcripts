1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,719
MPV was mentioned a couple times and I

2
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:06,039
assume most of you know who we are but

3
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:08,800
in case not we're a 22-year-old

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,719
nonprofit based in Washington DC and

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,280
we've worked on medical marijuana for

6
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:14,239
years and years we were the lead

7
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:15,718
organization for most of the medical

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,879
marijuana laws that passed in the last

9
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:20,358
15 years and we've also worked on

10
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,160
decriminalization bills and we played

11
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:24,039
the leading role in five of the eight

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,039
marijuana adult use initiatives that

13
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:27,560
passed including Colorado and we also

14
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,480
supported the one here in California

15
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:30,719
that our allies at DPA took a leading

16
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,640
role in

17
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,079
um it's just such an amazing time I've

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,079
been with MPP since 2003 and when I

19
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:39,079
started out you know there were eight

20
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,759
states with medical marijuana none with

21
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,200
adult use and about 35% of the

22
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,280
population of the United States

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,840
supported making marijuana legal and now

24
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,799
we've got 29 medical marijuana states

25
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,600
60% support for making marijuana legal

26
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:54,159
and 29 states that have medical

27
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,439
marijuana but at the same time we have

28
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,479
all this promise and the support we also

29
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:00,479
have a time of peril you know we have an

30
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,319
attorney general who thinks that good

31
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,079
people don't use marijuana well we have

32
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,640
a president who said that he supports

33
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,519
State's rights to make their own

34
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,159
decision he can't necessarily be trusted

35
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:13,079
and the Attorney General is urging

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,640
Congress to get rid of the rider that

37
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:16,200
they've put on an Appropriations bill

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,840
every year to tie the hands of the

39
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,000
Department of Justice so they can't go

40
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,118
after medical marijuana providers we're

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,680
trying to get that renewed and also to

42
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:26,000
get a measure passed that would apply to

43
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,840
adult use so even if sessions wanted to

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,159
go after all of these providers they

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,799
wouldn't be able to so in addition to

46
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,880
financially supporting advocacy um which

47
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,159
is such an issue as Mary Patton

48
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,280
mentioned you know a lot of

49
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,479
philanthropists are thinking there's all

50
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,280
this money to be made and Industry

51
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:44,560
should really be funding it now so we

52
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,640
have this circumstance where we've got

53
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,478
22 states with bills pending where

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,560
really the limit to how many states can

55
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,640
move how fast is how much funding there

56
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,320
is because there's more opportunity for

57
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,680
us to move very quickly than there ever

58
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,718
has been but there's just not the

59
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,320
funding so in addition to the need for

60
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:00,759
funding for all kinds of advocacy

61
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,158
organizations

62
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:04,959
uh it's so important that industry

63
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,439
members make a real firm relationship

64
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:07,959
with your members of Congress you know

65
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:09,878
not only should you know them but they

66
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:11,159
should know you if they're at all

67
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:12,639
supportive you might want to go to their

68
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,318
fundraisers you might want to invite

69
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,719
them or their staff on a tour um your

70
00:02:15,318 --> 00:02:19,318
state local and federal officials it's

71
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:21,719
worth building a relationship with all

72
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:23,119
of them if you have a dispensary or

73
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:24,800
other business you know make sure that

74
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,640
your customers and that your employees

75
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,879
are involved that they're contacting

76
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,479
their members of Congress because this

77
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:32,399
is all of course federally

78
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,878
and the survival and the freedom of so

79
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,760
many people really depends on elected

80
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,239
officials realizing this is something

81
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:41,759
that people care about and the tides can

82
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,239
shift really quickly I worked on a

83
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,560
medical marijuana initiative in 2004 and

84
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,239
I remember getting a call from this

85
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,519
patient I worked with and he said the

86
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,000
cops came and they counted his plants

87
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,640
and then they laughed after it passed

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,199
and it was amazing and he actually ended

89
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,719
up dying in prison now that about eight

90
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:01,318
years later after the federal government

91
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,639
under Obama arrested him and his

92
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,238
partners for conspiracy and they thought

93
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:07,238
they were okay that had law enforcement

94
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,280
coming for tours that had a business but

95
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,959
it was kind of in the gray area so

96
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,919
there's there's always this risk it's a

97
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,878
lot less in some respects than it might

98
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:17,318
be there's a lot more hope but it's so

99
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,359
important that you know we don't let up

100
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:21,560
there's people's freedom in so many

101
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,799
states and under federal law depends on

102
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,120
it so we can't take that from

103
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,840
granted so that's it thank you so much

104
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,840
for your interest and
