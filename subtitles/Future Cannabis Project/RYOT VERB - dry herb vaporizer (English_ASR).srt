1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,558
all right we're on like day ten of

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:09,798
lockdown

3
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:13,160
I haven't taken a shower today or

4
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:18,079
yesterday or brush my teeth yet today

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:21,079
and it's afternoon but to keep me happy

6
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:22,879
and not going stir-crazy some companies

7
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:28,099
have been sending me some products to

8
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:30,349
review so we have actually said this is

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,910
the very first pipe I ever smoked out of

10
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:35,689
when I was about I don't know nine or

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:38,390
ten years old the prototype Richard

12
00:00:35,689 --> 00:00:41,268
Jorgensen sent us down so thank you

13
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,189
Richard very much I'm excited to play

14
00:00:41,268 --> 00:00:47,119
with this which I haven't smoked out of

15
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:50,838
in a long time and then also back in

16
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:56,149
those days be Patti the one hitter was

17
00:00:50,838 --> 00:01:06,189
big and riot sent me not one so here's

18
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:06,189
the would one but two values this is the

19
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:14,359
more advanced one but anyway what I

20
00:01:10,578 --> 00:01:18,769
wanted to focus on today was the dry

21
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:22,930
herb vaporizer from riot so let's turn

22
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:22,929
this thing on it's called the verb okay

23
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:29,358
there we go

24
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:31,759
all right I don't know what did it maybe

25
00:01:29,358 --> 00:01:37,298
it's the fours we're gonna be smoking

26
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:42,649
Josh D gave me some OG Kush so we will

27
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:47,960
what's this gonna light up to 190 202

28
00:01:42,649 --> 00:02:03,429
and it's fast I get you ready let's be

29
00:01:47,959 --> 00:02:08,319
quick okay

30
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:08,319
so this thing still heating out

31
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:21,568
for huh my let's put the top on for haha

32
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,370
for 20 very funny

33
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:36,598
probably hotter than I'd want to go but

34
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:50,150
let's start there that's tasty a little

35
00:02:36,598 --> 00:03:03,408
hot and it comes with this poker that

36
00:02:50,150 --> 00:03:03,408
there's the poker okay it works

37
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:13,858
ergonomic lightweight it's small not too

38
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:18,169
small not too big easy to use let me

39
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:24,859
just bring it down let's go down to

40
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:27,750
about like three it's kind of like 380

41
00:03:24,859 --> 00:03:29,849
so different terpenes boil off a

42
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,810
different or in cannabinoids at

43
00:03:29,848 --> 00:03:32,810
different temperatures

44
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:44,430
a little nicer so what you could do is

45
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,290
probably start down at like 320 and work

46
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,980
your way up with each hit so you're

47
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:57,649
hitting different terpenes along the way

48
00:03:49,979 --> 00:04:04,589
and cannabinoids I like it

49
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:13,259
super easy it's literally the first time

50
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:16,939
I ever hit this so anyway we'll come

51
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:21,259
back and we'll go through the dugouts

52
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:25,579
batty dugout proto plate

53
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:30,089
we also have a cantor guard roller from

54
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:36,800
Purple Rose so we will make a can of

55
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:36,799
guard we need some fresh needs very cute

56
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:47,420
turning off alright anyway we'll make

57
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:51,740
some Kanna gars we'll have some fun boys

58
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:54,100
and girls anyway we'll be back they

59
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,100
saved
