2
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:21,140
today we're discussing the newly

3
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:23,730
released draft permanent regulations

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:27,289
that are currently in a fifteen day

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:31,160
comment period so to start just so I

6
00:00:27,289 --> 00:00:33,870
understand how many people here are

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,369
retailers are in the retail space

8
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:41,929
all right and how many are distributors

9
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:46,319
distributors correct good

10
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:51,808
cultivators in the room thank you any

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,909
testing labs here today okay good but

12
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:56,429
see manufacturers in people

13
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:58,589
manufacturing okay great

14
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:00,859
and then I know we have some POS

15
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:05,219
companies some people who work for

16
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:10,609
advertising and branding firms and then

17
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:13,859
my compliance nerds in the back so I

18
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:15,390
will admit what I'd like to preface by

19
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:18,150
saying one that this isn't everything

20
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,659
that's in the regs in the newly released

21
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,280
draft it kind of is to help maybe focus

22
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,170
your attention on certain areas

23
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,420
obviously there's some big hot-button

24
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,939
issues that everybody is talking about

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,609
and then there's also some more granular

26
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:34,889
interesting little tidbits that they put

27
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:36,569
in there that also have consequences so

28
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,920
part of this is we're just going to talk

29
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:40,559
through some of those changes

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,000
highlighting those changes the possible

31
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,049
impacts and hopefully give you some some

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,149
fuel or inspiration to draft some

33
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:53,579
meaningful public comment in this very

34
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,469
short period of time we have how many of

35
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:57,559
you guys commented on the last set of

36
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:03,090
regulations actually submitted comments

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:05,189
okay so the interesting thing on Friday

38
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,600
October 19th these revised regulations

39
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:08,669
were released we have until Monday

40
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:10,649
November 5th at 5:00 p.m. to submit

41
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,799
comments so that's 12 more days from

42
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,599
today a special No

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,670
for this round of comments is that only

44
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,500
comments addressing the newly proposed

45
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:21,479
changes are accepted so you can't go

46
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,939
back and still comment on the old things

47
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:25,799
that didn't change so you really want to

48
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:28,199
identify when you're looking at this new

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,020
language where a change happened because

50
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:33,709
that's your that's your crack to get in

51
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,090
there and insert public comment on those

52
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,469
aspects so you can comment on the newly

53
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,620
proposed revisions and you can also

54
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:42,780
comment on the new documents and forms

55
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,500
and other things that are glorious that

56
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,060
they've introduced so in order to not

57
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,360
have this just be a completely

58
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,719
depressing experience I tried to start

59
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,790
with some positive aspects that I

60
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,409
gleaned from some of the changes that

61
00:02:56,789 --> 00:03:01,319
we're good there were good wins that we

62
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:03,060
had one of the biggest ones I think for

63
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,099
the industry is going to be that they've

64
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,750
changed the sequence of labeling so that

65
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:11,400
distribution can now label the

66
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:13,379
cannabinoid content THC CBD after after

67
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,960
final product so a manufacturer can

68
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:18,090
submit their packaged labeled product

69
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:20,490
with everything except that cannabinoid

70
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,890
content to a distributor and after

71
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:25,590
receiving that certificate of analysis

72
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:27,509
then they can put on the THC CBD if

73
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,490
you've been seeing the headlines that

74
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:32,269
one in five products is failing in

75
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:35,370
California everything's poison oh my god

76
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:37,560
65% of those fails is because of label

77
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,349
claims is because the THC CBD is not

78
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,949
coming within that 10% threshold and so

79
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:46,229
now we would hope that about 65% of

80
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:47,939
those remediation efforts will be

81
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:51,239
eliminated and people will just be able

82
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:53,579
to label it after they get that final

83
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,230
test result another big one is that the

84
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,050
BCC in the Department of Public Health

85
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:59,849
have agreed upon teachers being a thing

86
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,410
and being allowed to be part of the

87
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:03,539
industry so they've changed the rules

88
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:05,520
around alcohol alcohol content for

89
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:07,829
tinctures so this is now an allowable

90
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,689
product category and they're actually an

91
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:10,980
agreement which is fantastic when that

92
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:13,919
happens

93
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:15,899
thanks to SB 311 we now have distributed

94
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,319
distributor transfers that are possible

95
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,090
so the test results hold and you can

96
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,500
distribute a tested program product and

97
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:24,119
transfer that between multiple

98
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,009
distributors so you don't have to test

99
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,090
it with every single distributor that

100
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:30,060
you should happen to be work

101
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:32,789
with great win there's expanded events

102
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,319
locations thanks to a be 20/20 so now it

103
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,020
doesn't only have to be on a fairground

104
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:39,779
with local authorization we have

105
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:43,740
pathways to have more public events for

106
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:45,929
retail and consumption we can now reject

107
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,090
partial shipments this was like you know

108
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,978
maybe not a very exciting one but it was

109
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:52,138
pretty great because they had it before

110
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:54,509
that either you had to accept the whole

111
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,879
shipment or reject it if something was

112
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:58,529
wrong with it so now if you get a

113
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,379
shipment and some of the product is

114
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:03,179
damaged you cannot accept it if you get

115
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:05,909
a shipment and part of it is not labeled

116
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,069
correctly you cannot accept that part of

117
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,290
the shipment and as a retailer you can

118
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:12,629
take in the rest of it that'll help the

119
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:15,540
supply chain a little bit there's now

120
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:17,610
edibles can be remediated through

121
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,979
repackaging so if you put in your batch

122
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,449
of you know blueberry chocolates and it

123
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:24,029
hits over the limit you can actually

124
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:25,978
repackage it so that you can put as many

125
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:28,709
would actually meet the requirement

126
00:05:25,978 --> 00:05:31,139
instead of having to destroy that that's

127
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:33,779
pretty great there's some higher action

128
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:36,120
levels for the category to solvent so it

129
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:38,309
kind of gives a little more wiggle room

130
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,840
there in the testing things and there's

131
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,379
lots of new forms

132
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:46,098
we love forms it's great the BCC has all

133
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:48,478
of these instructions that they give on

134
00:05:46,098 --> 00:05:50,038
notifying them about this and notifying

135
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,889
about that but they never really gave

136
00:05:50,038 --> 00:05:55,079
much methodology to notifying other than

137
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:57,060
like send an email to info of BCC and

138
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:58,918
maybe somebody will see it and a lot of

139
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,810
these forms have to do with like the

140
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:03,870
licensing procedures because they

141
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:06,810
probably saw a whole gambit of quality

142
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,280
and and presentation and form so in a

143
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:10,589
lot of ways it's it's really good that

144
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,869
they're systematizing it it should be a

145
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:15,119
lot easier going forward there's going

146
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,300
to be a lot more clarity and even with

147
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,660
the sequin I'm it's provided Los Angeles

148
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:23,280
was a morass with sequa because the

149
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,900
process in LA has been so slow they've

150
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,759
now laid out clearly what everyone's

151
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,699
expected to give with respect to sequa

152
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,620
and those forums like I mentioned and

153
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,469
begin are part of the material that you

154
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,750
can comment upon so if you I'm not

155
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,599
covering the contents of those forms in

156
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,790
this presentation but you would want to

157
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:42,829
look at the content of the

158
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,439
forms and if there's aspects of it that

159
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:47,839
merit a comment you will want to do that

160
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,629
so in the greatest thing maybe is more

161
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:53,689
clarity I don't know some in some cases

162
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:56,329
yes in some cases no but now we'll talk

163
00:06:53,689 --> 00:07:00,319
about the other things the other things

164
00:06:56,329 --> 00:07:02,029
in there so one of the biggest pieces

165
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,579
that came down is this expanded

166
00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:06,349
definition of ownership surprise you may

167
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:09,709
be an owner of a cannabis company and

168
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:11,480
not know it the language that was added

169
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:13,459
in one section is that any individual

170
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,600
entitled to a share of at least 20% of

171
00:07:13,459 --> 00:07:19,819
the profits may be considered an owner

172
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:24,200
this is important because a lot of folks

173
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:25,849
were using passive involvement to claim

174
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:27,439
that they weren't owners and so this is

175
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:29,600
really going to affect a lot of the

176
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:32,750
large management groups out there who

177
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,120
are managing multiple retail chains if a

178
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,600
particular jurisdiction has a cap on

179
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,720
ownership per city in many cases I have

180
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:43,850
included the statement of reason that

181
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,650
came from the BCC sometimes just because

182
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,750
it's funny like some of their statements

183
00:07:45,649 --> 00:07:51,739
of reasons is one step up for because we

184
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:53,389
said so so and or lots of times it's

185
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,980
just like this is just additional

186
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:59,539
clarity if it's ruining your life it's

187
00:07:54,980 --> 00:08:02,030
fine so so some of those you'll see I

188
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:03,980
included like what was their reasoning

189
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:06,529
that went in cases that they did it so

190
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:07,910
it's extending upon that this is where

191
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:10,489
it starts to get really interesting in

192
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,840
that designation of owner so they put in

193
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,300
this from any individual who assumes

194
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,709
responsibility for the license so this

195
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,050
can be somebody who's managing or

196
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:20,299
directing the business in exchange for a

197
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,699
share of the profits it can be somebody

198
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,470
who assumes responsibility for debts it

199
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:26,389
can be an individual who is determining

200
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:29,420
how a portion of the cannabis businesses

201
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:30,889
run including non plant touching

202
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,610
portions of the commercial cannabis

203
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:38,149
business such as branding and marketing

204
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:41,570
that's interesting that's an overreach

205
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:42,978
we'll see and then also an individual

206
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,360
who's determining what cannabis Goods

207
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:45,560
the commercial cannabis business will

208
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,330
cultivate manufacture distribute

209
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:51,889
purchase or sell so this is this is

210
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,000
where it gets interesting in a lot of

211
00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:53,610
the discussions that are happening

212
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,309
because

213
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,470
can theoretically incorporate a lot of

214
00:08:56,309 --> 00:09:01,199
people and there seems to be a

215
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:04,200
discretionary aspect of it as well so

216
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,890
when it keeps going like when it's an

217
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,149
entity they want to get down to I want

218
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:12,569
them to have a t-shirt made that just

219
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:13,769
says until only individuals remain which

220
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,620
is going to be my new motto for the

221
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:18,299
cannabis industry itself just say can we

222
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,740
just take it back the individual and

223
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:21,899
anyone who's been going through the

224
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,490
license licensing processes probably

225
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:25,440
experienced that we've had a couple of

226
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,959
projects where we've had to go up six or

227
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,670
seven levels of corporate entities until

228
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:32,489
they get to the warm bodies it's it's

229
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:34,259
Las Vegas casino style regulations they

230
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:36,570
ultimately want to know who's going to

231
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:38,669
be profiting with these businesses where

232
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:40,890
is the money going and that's along with

233
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:42,689
the expansion of the definition of

234
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:44,850
ownership came the expansion of a

235
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:48,089
definition of financial interest holders

236
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:50,339
some of these were super surprising you

237
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:52,740
know that they go down to receiving a

238
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:55,230
portions of the in profits is employees

239
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,389
who are doing a profit share with their

240
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,980
own company landlords who have entered

241
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:01,169
into lease agreements who are taking a

242
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,870
piece of your company consultants who

243
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:05,759
have taken a piece of your company

244
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:08,129
attorneys and accountants who have taken

245
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,990
a piece of your company part of this to

246
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:11,909
me is super exciting because we're gonna

247
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,409
see all of these interesting companies

248
00:10:11,909 --> 00:10:15,360
that have been taking a piece of a lot

249
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:17,370
of people's companies and they're gonna

250
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,409
have to be disclosed as financial

251
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,419
interest holders and that shouldn't be

252
00:10:19,409 --> 00:10:23,278
surprising at all because that's the

253
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:25,289
guidance the state's been giving over

254
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,110
the last nine months when disclosing

255
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:30,328
these financial interests you know

256
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:32,579
unambiguously they've gave us advice in

257
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:34,708
writing over the phone that you know if

258
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:36,659
anyone's getting a percentage of the

259
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:39,359
revenue if anyone's getting percentage

260
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:41,698
of the profits if any time there's

261
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,769
percentage based compensation that's

262
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:45,179
like the red flag triggering that you're

263
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:47,220
financially interested

264
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:48,569
state wants to know who you are as a

265
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,670
financial interested party you're not

266
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,990
getting live scan but the state wants to

267
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:54,179
know who's profiting from these things

268
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,310
absolutely and even if even a

269
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:58,078
salesperson who's making a commission on

270
00:10:56,309 --> 00:11:00,778
sales is considered a financially

271
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,429
interested party and if that commission

272
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:04,278
you're getting or that portion of the

273
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:07,620
business exceeds that twenty percent

274
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:09,240
threshold back to surprise your own own

275
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,389
because you're now profiting more than

276
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,450
20% based on your business so conflating

277
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:19,199
those two when an institute has that

278
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:21,629
financial business the the Bureau is

279
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,790
going to decide in some cases they may

280
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:26,820
decide that you do fall under the owner

281
00:11:23,789 --> 00:11:29,009
through their definition of owner so

282
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,110
while there's different requirements as

283
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:33,059
Aaron was saying of the disclosures you

284
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,100
have to do in terms of live scans and

285
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,778
whatnot as an owner and just being

286
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,360
listed with your information and

287
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:41,610
identifying features as a financial

288
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,800
interest holder it's possible in

289
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,149
disclosing those financially interested

290
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:47,099
parties that the bureau is going to

291
00:11:45,149 --> 00:11:49,500
receive review it and say actually that

292
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,028
person is an owner and and shift that

293
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,129
and the same thing with the financially

294
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:54,600
interested parties they want to get down

295
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:57,330
there to the flesh-and-blood person

296
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,680
until only individuals remain it's you

297
00:11:57,330 --> 00:12:00,360
can't be an entity they want to know

298
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:02,309
every person involved with that entity

299
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,430
no matter how many layers the entity

300
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:08,250
goes back and and just with anything

301
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:10,739
throughout these licensing process you

302
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,778
know failing to disclose or having the

303
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:15,389
appearance that you're trying to hide

304
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:17,100
something that's usually going to be

305
00:12:15,389 --> 00:12:18,149
worse than what you don't want to

306
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,389
disclose if they think you're

307
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:23,819
intentionally trying to deceive them and

308
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:26,699
in that understanding of seeing that

309
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,920
interest that they have in who where

310
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,629
who's where's the money coming from who

311
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:32,909
is involved who are the parties I

312
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:34,950
believe has a lot to do with the second

313
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:37,289
area of white-hot panic which is this

314
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:40,560
white labeling issue that has come up

315
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:42,208
which is the the the sentence all

316
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,449
commercial cannabis activity shall be

317
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:49,139
conducted between licensees and that in

318
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:50,879
the extension of this they get a lot

319
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:52,199
more detailed on that you're not going

320
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,299
to be conducting commercial cannabis

321
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,520
activities on behalf of at the request

322
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:59,069
of or per with the contract with anybody

323
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:01,559
who is not licensed under this act so

324
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,120
this obviously brought a lot of fear up

325
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:04,889
for people because a lot of people's

326
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,440
models are based on white labeling

327
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:10,470
relationships with non licensed entities

328
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,410
and brands that there's many reasons for

329
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:16,019
this I'm some of the issue that we see

330
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:18,449
is what and this will kind of thread

331
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:21,000
throughout is that you have the industry

332
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:24,610
in my opinion is responding to

333
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,820
large and sometimes egregious operators

334
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:29,529
who are operating unlicensed under the

335
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,900
protection of saying I'm an on plant

336
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:33,669
touching brand therefore I don't have to

337
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:35,350
tell you who I am I don't have to get a

338
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:38,199
license and I don't have to be held to

339
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,810
your advertising regulations so in a lot

340
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,060
of these cases it seems like an action

341
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:45,039
on the bureau's part to be like nope you

342
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:49,139
want to be a cannabis brand you have to

343
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,139
play by the rules of regulated cannabis

344
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:54,460
there's been a lot of celebrities who

345
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,129
want to attach themselves to Canada

346
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:58,930
cannabis brands and and the overarching

347
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:00,730
guidance from the state and again I'm

348
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:03,099
not shocked by seeing it in policy now

349
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,529
is that they don't want unlicensed

350
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,649
people engaging in commercial cannabis

351
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:18,279
activity they don't want licensees going

352
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:20,409
beyond the scope so you know I spent the

353
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:22,209
last two days in Anaheim with a lot of

354
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:25,059
smart people who were all you know

355
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:27,639
discussing solutions for this issue

356
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:29,979
obviously this is if this is an area

357
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:32,769
that desperately needs some comment

358
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,930
because I think in trying to take out

359
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:36,759
one piece of it obviously it's it's

360
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:38,409
compromising the way that a lot of

361
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:41,769
smaller businesses are functioning in

362
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:43,389
this space so what we need to offer here

363
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:46,000
and this goes into how you craft a

364
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:47,439
comment is a meaningful comment is the

365
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,840
only thing that the agencies have to

366
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,370
respond to so if you just say hey you're

367
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,170
ruining my life and why don't we just

368
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,389
deregulate everything that wouldn't be

369
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:59,740
considered a meaningful comment you have

370
00:14:55,389 --> 00:15:02,559
to actually cite a specific section the

371
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:06,129
specific regulation say state what the

372
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:07,839
problem is and offer a solution so

373
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:09,309
luckily there's lots of smart people

374
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,620
working on that but don't necessarily

375
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:13,750
depend on them to do it you should

376
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,970
submit your own comments there's been

377
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,740
everything suggested from maybe they

378
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:20,019
should have been a new license type that

379
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:22,990
would cover brands and IP and an on

380
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:24,460
plant touching aspects with 15 days and

381
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:27,460
them up against the line of expiring

382
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:30,900
emergency regs are you know chances of

383
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,900
that happening are slim or

384
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:35,630
as some eloquent people thought it might

385
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:39,110
be as simple as the addition of some

386
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:41,000
language saying that all of this is you

387
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,190
know this is fine and good except in the

388
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,230
cases in which the person is a financial

389
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:50,450
interest holder so that you could extend

390
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:52,670
that information in terms of who is the

391
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:54,470
person it benefiting from this and that

392
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:57,139
they want their name attached to it

393
00:15:54,470 --> 00:16:01,279
their information there's an interesting

394
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:03,919
model in ABC liquor that could be a

395
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,799
possible solution as well which is a B

396
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,569
893 in 2015

397
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,209
sponsored by the California craft

398
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:13,580
brewers association created this thing

399
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:15,860
called a beer brand registration so a

400
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,420
beer brand registration was a document

401
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,430
that a brand would send even if they

402
00:16:17,419 --> 00:16:21,349
were contract manufacturing to say hey

403
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:24,319
we're brand here's our information

404
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:27,980
here's here's what we want to do we can

405
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,750
only dream of the day as cannabis people

406
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:31,700
that you could get something as sweet as

407
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,440
this when you read what it is in the

408
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,570
business and Professions Code that all

409
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,280
they have to do is register the band the

410
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,110
brand with the Department upon filing of

411
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,000
the registration you can be sold without

412
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,350
any further action from the department

413
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,299
you don't even have to wait for them to

414
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:47,029
say it's ok you just send in the letter

415
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:49,699
and it's fine you go for it that would

416
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:51,799
be great so I mean this is an example so

417
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:55,100
there are examples from the alcohol

418
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:56,719
industry of even for the brokerage issue

419
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,659
because some of that stuff of financial

420
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,639
interest holder and unlicensed parties

421
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:03,679
goes into that broker model of the

422
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,930
middleman who is arranging deals and

423
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:07,818
making that problematic and in the wine

424
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,259
industry you have a wine broker license

425
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,670
which is you register they have your

426
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:12,980
information you're listed with the state

427
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,670
I'm a wine broker it's interesting to

428
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,130
look at

429
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:18,318
Nevada's model where Nevada has the

430
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,910
agent card anybody who's participating

431
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:21,949
in any way in the cannabis industry has

432
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,199
an agent card they get live scan their

433
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:25,370
informations there and it seems like

434
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:28,220
this might be something that would

435
00:17:25,369 --> 00:17:30,439
satisfy the state's interest in knowing

436
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,799
who are the players what is your name

437
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,360
where do you live you know and where is

438
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:37,940
the money like where is it coming from

439
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:40,250
and where is it going so those are those

440
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,309
are some of the existing models we have

441
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,390
to point to to say hey is that simple

442
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:46,159
and something like that

443
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,750
could be something like beer brand

444
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,220
registration could be easier than the

445
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,609
creation of a license type which is

446
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:54,350
causes them panic and fear or you know

447
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:56,539
something that may not satisfy their

448
00:17:54,349 --> 00:18:02,269
needs of the information disclosure that

449
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:05,750
they're after so another big topic was

450
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:09,139
the technology platform regulations so I

451
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:12,109
mean in short form we can see what

452
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,740
happened is that some unlicensed

453
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:19,909
operators advertisers tech platforms

454
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:23,240
were you know doing very very large

455
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:25,070
scale businesses benefiting from the

456
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,470
commercial cannabis industry and

457
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:30,470
sometimes the non-commercial cannabis

458
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:31,970
industry and in claiming that because

459
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,759
they were not a licensee they were

460
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:37,130
outside of the domain of the regulated

461
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:40,309
sphere so it seems that the Bureau has

462
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:42,380
come with a very specific Smackdown for

463
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:45,710
some of those business models so this

464
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,350
piece of regulating technology platforms

465
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:50,750
was another with an was another big one

466
00:18:48,349 --> 00:18:52,159
this was their statement of reasons was

467
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,109
that the Bureau has found that a number

468
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,610
of Bureau licensees engaged in delivery

469
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:58,279
services that are facilitated by

470
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:59,929
technology platforms however use of such

471
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:02,119
platforms has created confusion in

472
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:04,400
customers as to whether a bureau

473
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:07,609
licensee is conducting the commercial

474
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,019
cannabis activity so moreover some

475
00:19:07,609 --> 00:19:10,759
technology platforms may create the

476
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:14,329
impression that they hold a bureau

477
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:17,660
license and so to clarify this and avoid

478
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:21,919
this confusion the bureau decided to

479
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:24,769
throw down this section 54 15.1 shall go

480
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:26,420
down in infamy that a licensed retailer

481
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:28,220
or micro business can't sell or transfer

482
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,500
goods through the use of an unlicensed

483
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:35,900
third-party intermediary business broker

484
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:42,170
or any other business entity so that's

485
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:43,759
you know clarifying so unless you know

486
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:46,070
there are things you can use a platform

487
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,809
you can use technology we're not having

488
00:19:46,069 --> 00:19:51,529
to be Stone Age and go off the internet

489
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:52,940
but the number one is clear the licensed

490
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:54,470
retailer licensed micro business did not

491
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,019
allow for the delivery of cannabis goods

492
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,490
by the platform in the delivery

493
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:00,619
regulations delivery

494
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,259
they have to be employees of the

495
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:06,109
licensee that was pretty clear so that

496
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:08,240
one you know we got that this is a nice

497
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:10,159
one the licensed retailer licensed micro

498
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,900
business does not share in the profits

499
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,820
of the sale of cannabis Goods with the

500
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:16,038
technology platform service or provider

501
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:18,589
or otherwise Prasad provide for a

502
00:20:16,038 --> 00:20:21,319
percentage or portion of those cannabis

503
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:23,359
Goods sales and and this shouldn't be

504
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:25,279
surprising to the extent we're still

505
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:28,609
recognizing medical cannabis because a

506
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:31,038
lot of these commission-based

507
00:20:28,609 --> 00:20:32,569
lead generation contracts and the

508
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,579
medical community are just wholly

509
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:36,950
illegal with other healthcare providers

510
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:39,349
it should be you know in the healthcare

511
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:42,500
context it's all done unlike flat fee

512
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:44,839
fair market value arrangement not based

513
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:48,019
on like per capita or percentage of the

514
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:49,849
sale and we saw a similar thing in the

515
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:51,769
events language when they did the event

516
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:53,449
that no event coordinator can make a

517
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:55,339
profit of the sales off of their

518
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:57,350
business so it's kind of kind of trying

519
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:59,298
to create these clear contracts where

520
00:20:57,349 --> 00:21:01,339
there's a fee to use it that's the same

521
00:20:59,298 --> 00:21:03,849
for everybody and not that there's these

522
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:06,889
individual profit sharing agreements

523
00:21:03,849 --> 00:21:08,779
this one is fun as well number three so

524
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:10,788
the licensed retailer can micro business

525
00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:12,200
can't advertise or market cannabis goods

526
00:21:10,788 --> 00:21:15,169
in conjunction with the technology

527
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,659
platform service provider outside of the

528
00:21:15,169 --> 00:21:19,610
technology platform and shall ensure

529
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:23,870
that the platform service doesn't use

530
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:25,038
their license number to advertise on any

531
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:27,439
advertising we're marketing that

532
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:30,200
primarily promotes the services of the

533
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,179
technology platform so when you're

534
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,669
driving around and you see an ad just

535
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:37,490
for a technology platform with no

536
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:39,409
license fee attached or with a license

537
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:42,288
number attached that does not belong to

538
00:21:39,409 --> 00:21:44,090
that look that delivery platform this is

539
00:21:42,288 --> 00:21:46,700
what they're calling out in this prin is

540
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:48,918
problematic that the delivery platform

541
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,860
cannot be the predominant thing

542
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:55,610
advertised over the actual licensed

543
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:58,219
retailer who owns the license number so

544
00:21:55,609 --> 00:22:00,709
that is going to throw a wrench in a lot

545
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:06,409
of the billboards all over California

546
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:08,269
we'll see these these ones this one is

547
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:10,580
nice as well that the licensed retailer

548
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:11,940
micro business has to ensure that the

549
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:13,769
following information is provided to

550
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,690
the consumers that the product

551
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:18,750
advertised for sale discloses at a

552
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:20,308
minimum the licensed retailers or micro

553
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,558
businesses business name in license

554
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:24,538
numbers so when you're on said platform

555
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,000
and you're just buying products and you

556
00:22:24,538 --> 00:22:29,398
have no idea which store it's actually

557
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,089
coming from what the state is saying is

558
00:22:29,398 --> 00:22:35,099
that that retailer the actual retailer

559
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:38,569
with a license number supplying that

560
00:22:35,099 --> 00:22:41,699
product has to be visible

561
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:43,859
this one this 4a is important because

562
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,220
this actually is not just deliveries

563
00:22:43,859 --> 00:22:49,619
facilitated it says any cannabis Goods

564
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:51,929
advertised or offered for sale so this

565
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:54,329
also would incorporate advertising

566
00:22:51,929 --> 00:22:57,509
platforms that are advertising products

567
00:22:54,329 --> 00:23:03,089
without a licensee and license number

568
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:05,009
attached that's no longer okay and then

569
00:23:03,089 --> 00:23:05,939
this B is interesting as well placing

570
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,679
when you're placing an order through

571
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,929
that platform you have to be aware of

572
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,940
which retailer it's coming from and

573
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:13,919
their license number prior to buying the

574
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,389
product so it's not that you go through

575
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,659
the whole system and it's this blind

576
00:23:15,388 --> 00:23:19,949
process where I'm on platform XYZ going

577
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:21,299
through it and I bought a product and

578
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:22,950
then at the end when I get the receipt

579
00:23:21,298 --> 00:23:25,500
I'm like oh this actually came from this

580
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:28,139
dispensary you have to know before you

581
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:44,099
buy the product which dispensary is

582
00:23:28,138 --> 00:23:46,888
actually supplying that product there's

583
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:48,449
a lot of where you go I mean it is

584
00:23:46,888 --> 00:23:51,558
interesting in this case because that's

585
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:54,450
what I highlighted at the top I mean

586
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:55,648
there's a where the onus is placed is

587
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,298
something that I like to look at but

588
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:59,250
it's the licensed retailer micro

589
00:23:57,298 --> 00:24:01,460
business has to ensure that it's it's

590
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:03,898
visible enough so that makes it

591
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:06,629
interesting that you then begin to

592
00:24:03,898 --> 00:24:08,518
question the fine legal minds of is it

593
00:24:06,628 --> 00:24:10,589
not the platform's responsibility to

594
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,149
make sure that information is visible or

595
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:21,658
it's the retailer's responsibility to

596
00:24:12,148 --> 00:24:24,500
make sure it's more about consumer

597
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:25,940
safety so consumers know where

598
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,859
they're getting products from and if

599
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,779
something bad happens with a product or

600
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:31,639
or if there's some other you know

601
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:34,460
non-compliance that's a threat to public

602
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,770
health you know the the BCC has a record

603
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:51,740
and they can go up that trail to nowhere

604
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:53,480
where the product came from yeah it does

605
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,069
I mean and that's something I like to

606
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,079
remember is that as much as like the

607
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:58,460
Bureau of cannabis control is that you

608
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:00,079
know the agency we're kind of most

609
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:01,519
familiar with maybe in the industry that

610
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,470
they're housed under the Department of

611
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:06,019
Consumer Affairs and the Department of

612
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:08,539
Consumer Affairs like you know reason

613
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:10,879
for being is to protect consumers from

614
00:25:08,539 --> 00:25:13,279
deceptive or misleading advertising and

615
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,500
and in public safety and those aspects

616
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,660
so a lot of when you're going through

617
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,250
the statement of reasons one of the

618
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,529
things that comes up consistently with

619
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:23,200
the BCC is that there was confusion

620
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:25,940
around this and when people are

621
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,140
reporting how is this person doing this

622
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,070
they don't have a license I don't

623
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,630
understand I don't know where this

624
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:32,299
product came from that's what they're

625
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:34,820
responding to is that visibility on the

626
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:36,919
consumer side of Who am I getting this

627
00:25:34,819 --> 00:25:38,119
from where do I come from and ultimately

628
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,670
it's going to be important for the

629
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:43,519
industry because when we move into you

630
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:45,830
know the our litigious future and you're

631
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,619
dealing with product liability consumer

632
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:51,379
reliability all of that information has

633
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:52,939
to be a parent for the consumer of who

634
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:55,070
did I get this and where where did it

635
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,350
come from and I think it goes back to

636
00:25:55,069 --> 00:25:59,389
their overarching theme with it which is

637
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:01,969
they don't want unlicensed people

638
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,890
engaged in commercial cannabis activity

639
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:06,769
so it's it's really showing that these

640
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:08,150
technology platforms aren't the ones who

641
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:09,710
are the licensed entities aren't the

642
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,210
ones who are filling orders aren't the

643
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:12,890
ones who are delivering they're not

644
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,960
doing commercial cannabis activity the

645
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:16,250
onus is to make sure it's clear to the

646
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,559
public to the customer

647
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:20,089
where they're getting a product from and

648
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,950
I think a million like we said part of

649
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:24,049
it I think is the reaction of the agency

650
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,580
from the response that they've had when

651
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:28,609
they've when they've made outreach and

652
00:26:25,579 --> 00:26:30,679
enforcement efforts or requests of large

653
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:32,509
technology platforms that their response

654
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,509
was well actually we're not under your

655
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:36,569
purview so have a nice day that they

656
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:38,669
went

657
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:42,119
and get my pencil I honed in make that

658
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:45,659
not the case so I will always give

659
00:26:42,119 --> 00:26:48,359
diplomacy goes a long way just maybe

660
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:50,519
don't pick a street fight just yet

661
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:52,528
so and this is the last piece of that is

662
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:54,960
that even on the required sales invoices

663
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:57,240
and receipts again that you have to

664
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,679
disclose that licensed retailer and the

665
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,380
life already there in the delivery regs

666
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:05,100
yeah like that's exactly that that was

667
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:06,750
in record-keeping requirements anyway so

668
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:08,628
just let's keep talking about delivery

669
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:11,490
because there's two more things on that

670
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:14,009
the other aspect of delivery I didn't

671
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:16,919
drop the slide in here and but but one

672
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:18,558
of the things that did stay is that you

673
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,370
can deliver to any municipality

674
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,980
municipality whether or not they have a

675
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:25,678
ban that piece is still in there

676
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:28,110
the state is hanging tough they believe

677
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,659
that it has you know access must be

678
00:27:28,109 --> 00:27:32,069
preserved so we'll see what happens with

679
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:34,379
that what the League of Cities response

680
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:37,319
is going to be we'll see but the BCC is

681
00:27:34,378 --> 00:27:39,058
sticking by it they did make some

682
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:41,788
alterations to what we've been calling

683
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:44,339
the dynamic piece of it which is that it

684
00:27:41,788 --> 00:27:47,429
had gone up in that revision to that you

685
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:49,829
could carry $10,000 worth of product in

686
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:52,139
a delivery vehicle you could drive

687
00:27:49,829 --> 00:27:54,000
around the block until you got a call if

688
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:57,178
you get if you got an order within half

689
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,038
an hour while the rest of the industry

690
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:00,990
goes through extraordinary security

691
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,339
measures alone delivery driver could

692
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:05,429
make an order in their trunk in the

693
00:28:02,339 --> 00:28:07,319
middle of a public road they got some

694
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:10,110
responses about that they got some

695
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:12,359
responses so they've scaled it back a

696
00:28:10,109 --> 00:28:14,609
little bit so now it's the the you can't

697
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:17,908
have value in excess of $5,000 at any

698
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:19,019
time in a delivery vehicle and that the

699
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:22,019
value of the goods carried in the

700
00:28:19,019 --> 00:28:24,149
vehicle that was not received in

701
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:26,159
processed by the licensee prior to the

702
00:28:24,148 --> 00:28:28,109
delivery to partner in departing can

703
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,480
exceed three thousand dollars so pretty

704
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:31,798
much you have to have if I'm doing the

705
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,990
math right because so many of these

706
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:35,970
things hurt my brain uh you have to have

707
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:39,089
a two thousand dollar set of prepackaged

708
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:40,649
orders to leave and you can have three

709
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:45,589
thousand dollars of additional inventory

710
00:28:40,648 --> 00:28:45,589
in the car as a delivery driver

711
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:52,829
you can't do multiple stops yeah so you

712
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:55,710
can leave with those $2,000 of orders

713
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:57,809
set and then continue to get orders on

714
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,069
the fly I mean look at this section

715
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:00,809
carefully there's still more

716
00:28:59,069 --> 00:29:02,669
record-keeping requirements and the

717
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:04,889
inventory log requirements and and

718
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:09,080
there's more finesse to how this has to

719
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:10,770
go down but but this is the amount of

720
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:13,529
retail cost

721
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:15,210
it's the retail value of the products in

722
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:20,789
the car

723
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:22,500
oh dear what'd I do okay okay so another

724
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:23,970
beautiful one is it a vehicle used in

725
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:25,710
the delivery can't have any markings or

726
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,000
other indication on the exterior of the

727
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:30,329
vehicle that may indicate there a

728
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,220
delivery employee maybe not have been

729
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:34,019
the best idea ever to be like the Geek

730
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:38,160
Squad driving around being like come

731
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:40,200
over I got weed so so they're saying

732
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,620
pretty much please don't drive around

733
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,480
advertising your vehicle industry this

734
00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:47,579
part is interesting there's been some

735
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,670
confusion around this fully enclosed box

736
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:52,829
was added to clarify that no portion of

737
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:54,930
the enclosed box container a cage can be

738
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:57,179
comprised of any part of the vehicle or

739
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:59,190
the trailer this is also mirrored in

740
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,320
distribution vehicles because what was

741
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:03,059
happening is people you know got a

742
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:05,069
Sprinter van and they dropped a cage in

743
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:09,029
the back and they're like it's a cage so

744
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:11,460
the the state is clarifying for better

745
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:13,589
or for worse that the security on the

746
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:16,110
inside of the vehicle has to be its own

747
00:30:13,589 --> 00:30:19,109
cage like that it can't you can't be

748
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:21,750
using the sides of the car or caging of

749
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:24,990
in the vehicle itself it has to be a

750
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:31,140
distinct fully enclosed little lock box

751
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:33,120
inside of it also has to be bolted to

752
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:36,390
your vehicle so I mean there's again

753
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:40,919
read the whole thing cuz it that that it

754
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:43,710
has to actually be bolted so but but it

755
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:45,690
can't be that you just put welding

756
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:47,340
inside of you know the back of it so you

757
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,990
open the door they want that secondary

758
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:50,639
thing so nobody just cuts through your

759
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:56,220
door opens the side door and there you

760
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:58,919
go oh so this is a this is a new big

761
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:01,200
record-keeping piece for delivery

762
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:05,159
some technology platforms that I know

763
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,860
are ready for this which is great so at

764
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:09,960
all times you had to identify where your

765
00:31:07,859 --> 00:31:11,219
drivers were so if the BCC walked in and

766
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,960
they go where's all your drivers you had

767
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,690
to be able to pull it up and identify

768
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,340
them on GPS immediately now you also

769
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:19,320
have to document the history of all

770
00:31:17,339 --> 00:31:22,349
locations travel to by a delivery

771
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:24,599
employer why while they're delivering so

772
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:27,480
they want in that history that

773
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:28,829
turn-by-turn history of where they went

774
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,798
and what they did and what their route

775
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:34,678
was now falls under that 90-day

776
00:31:31,798 --> 00:31:37,168
record-keeping requirement so when

777
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:39,840
you're looking at your GPS you know

778
00:31:37,169 --> 00:31:42,538
delivery platform technologies that's

779
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:43,709
gonna be your new question is do you

780
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:45,720
have turn-by-turn

781
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:48,419
you know coordinates that are stored for

782
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,120
90 days for every delivery driver and

783
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:53,460
where they went and what they're doing

784
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:56,759
and that helps with that dynamic piece

785
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:59,429
as well because again I mean so much of

786
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:01,319
what we're up against is obviously like

787
00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:04,528
in an industry such as this that is

788
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:06,480
pervaded by so much stigma and fear the

789
00:32:04,528 --> 00:32:08,730
way we get out of this is through total

790
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,139
transparency they want to know who it is

791
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:11,519
where's the money where did you go what

792
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:13,408
did you do who did you talk to what were

793
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,980
you wearing they want to know everything

794
00:32:13,409 --> 00:32:18,690
that we're doing so this is just another

795
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:22,829
clarifying thing and there and another

796
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:26,970
record-keeping requirement I love this

797
00:32:22,829 --> 00:32:28,859
one so much so wild transportation by

798
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:30,269
means of aircraft watercraft drone rail

799
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:32,339
human powered vehicle or unmanned

800
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:34,079
vehicle is prohibited you can now

801
00:32:32,339 --> 00:32:36,119
deliver to Catalina just so you know you

802
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:39,720
can distribute to Catalina they threw

803
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:42,178
that one in there it's gonna be

804
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,339
interesting because obviously to go to

805
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:48,288
Catalina you have to pass through either

806
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:50,638
federal airspace or federal water yeah I

807
00:32:48,288 --> 00:32:52,288
don't know if they did I don't know if

808
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:55,918
they did and I'm also loving the fact

809
00:32:52,288 --> 00:32:59,849
that like I there is not a single auto

810
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,500
ferry that goes to Catalina so if you're

811
00:32:59,849 --> 00:33:03,359
trying to fulfill your distribution

812
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:06,569
requirements with a distribution vehicle

813
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:09,569
and you can't put your truck on a boat

814
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:10,888
to take it to the island somebody's

815
00:33:09,569 --> 00:33:12,379
gonna have to hand carry which isn't

816
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:15,779
allowed

817
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:18,080
with the venom who leases that boat and

818
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:21,960
does the Coast Guard know who that is

819
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:23,490
and you know it takes approximately like

820
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,289
20 years to get a vehicle like

821
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:26,670
authorized on Catalina they don't like

822
00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:28,369
cars can be married so I don't know if

823
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:31,950
there's an available compliant

824
00:33:28,369 --> 00:33:33,689
distribution vehicle on Catalina but I'm

825
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:36,059
sure somebody will figure it out because

826
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:38,850
as I always say if the canvas industry

827
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:39,720
is one thing it's wily and smart we will

828
00:33:38,849 --> 00:33:40,919
find a way

829
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,180
now that they've given us permission

830
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:48,750
we're going to Catalina we're gonna go

831
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:50,820
um this was another doozy for some

832
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,619
brands I'm sure this came under the

833
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:54,809
marketing cannabis good there's

834
00:33:52,619 --> 00:33:56,879
alcoholic products you cannot do it

835
00:33:54,809 --> 00:33:58,470
anymore doesn't matter if they have it

836
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,560
or not you can't advertise them as

837
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:04,589
cannabis beer or wine or vodka or

838
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:09,119
anything there's a spirit wine or beer

839
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:12,690
we're done obviously this just this

840
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:14,909
entire you know businesses are decimated

841
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:18,510
in this confusion so it'll be interested

842
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:20,190
in saying that you know and this again

843
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:22,230
comes down to that consumer affairs part

844
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:23,820
the claim in this case is that it's a

845
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:26,099
matter of confusion and they don't want

846
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,500
consumers to be confused that this non

847
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:29,400
alcohol is cannabis beer maybe is

848
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,409
actually beer

849
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:33,119
some of them out there are using terms

850
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,609
like hoppy water rocky waters

851
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,049
sparkly water so I mean but that will

852
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:39,599
also I imagine be a matter of

853
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:40,950
interpretation of you know again like

854
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,599
when you were saying what are what are

855
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:44,759
these terms of knowing like how much

856
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:46,710
confusion in is like if it's a can with

857
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,990
a pop top and it has hops is that too

858
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,670
close to beer for somebody or what is

859
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:52,019
the interest behind that so a lot of

860
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,820
people are working on that

861
00:34:52,019 --> 00:34:55,500
talking to the agencies because part of

862
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,380
this process too is just getting more

863
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,539
clarity from the agencies what are they

864
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:04,559
afraid of who's behind it who's lobbying

865
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:06,779
for what and like how do we fix it so

866
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:09,509
this is a lesson in kneecapping your

867
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:13,560
sales 101 which is some other additions

868
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:15,480
that they made this part has you know

869
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:18,000
been of concern to me for a while

870
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:19,380
obviously the the state kind of put

871
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,530
forth this thing on the sale of non

872
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:24,599
cannabis Goods in response to a lot of

873
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:26,119
it was the CBD hemp products and saying

874
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:27,858
like no no all you can sell

875
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:30,950
cannabis Goods and cannabis accessories

876
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:34,098
in your shop they've now expanded that

877
00:35:30,949 --> 00:35:35,719
to cannabis Goods cannabis accessories

878
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:39,829
and brand it in your own branded

879
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:42,858
merchandise I'm not sure if this is

880
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:45,410
their intent but it seems crazy to me

881
00:35:42,858 --> 00:35:47,659
that you can no longer sell Jack Herer

882
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:50,298
is the Emperor wears no clothes in a

883
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:52,429
dispensary you cannot sell educational

884
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:54,829
books about cannabis in a dispensary

885
00:35:52,429 --> 00:36:01,098
you can't sell nog Champa and adds

886
00:35:54,829 --> 00:36:03,048
mystery this this prohibition and this

887
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:05,210
is just my personal concern is that in

888
00:36:03,048 --> 00:36:06,798
an industry where on one hand now we're

889
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,929
allowing delivery to go to any

890
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:12,079
municipality regardless of a ban and

891
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:14,808
then you have a retailer who is only

892
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:18,559
allowed to do cannabis transactions

893
00:36:14,809 --> 00:36:21,259
period and cannot enliven that retail

894
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,730
experience with any other cultural

895
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:24,980
commodity that they may want to include

896
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:26,809
in their store you can't sell crystals

897
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,969
you can't sell art you can't sell

898
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:31,099
records you can't do anything except

899
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:34,719
sell cannabis cannabis accessories and

900
00:36:31,099 --> 00:36:37,519
your own branded promotional merchandise

901
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:39,409
add a brig would be an accessory because

902
00:36:37,518 --> 00:36:44,108
you use it to smoke but a book on

903
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:44,108
cannabis would not be an accessory yes

904
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:52,190
we can register as a cannabis accessory

905
00:36:49,088 --> 00:36:54,768
but that is an area where I would

906
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,568
desperately encourage comments and

907
00:36:54,768 --> 00:36:57,768
clarifications from the agency because

908
00:36:56,568 --> 00:36:59,778
I'm not sure that they're I think the

909
00:36:57,768 --> 00:37:02,118
intent is one place but the fallout is

910
00:36:59,778 --> 00:37:03,949
another I mean obviously lots of

911
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,450
operators segment their space in their

912
00:37:03,949 --> 00:37:06,739
business so they have their cannabis

913
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:08,629
space over here and then they have a

914
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:11,298
regular retail space over here because

915
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:13,548
why would they pay taxes on you know jit

916
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:15,409
on selling books and incense and stuff

917
00:37:13,548 --> 00:37:18,469
when they don't have to within their

918
00:37:15,409 --> 00:37:20,659
licensed premises but it is I mean

919
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:24,139
obviously you guys know there's so many

920
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:27,048
beautiful amazing you know experience

921
00:37:24,139 --> 00:37:28,998
oriented dispensaries that sell you know

922
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:31,248
essential oils and others a you know

923
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:34,219
just in other aspects that aren't

924
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:37,308
necessarily cannabis at all but

925
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:38,869
encourage you to make the trip and go to

926
00:37:37,309 --> 00:37:40,460
this place it's also it

927
00:37:38,869 --> 00:37:42,589
tax strategy for retailers because

928
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:45,380
separate streams of revenues aren't

929
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:48,620
counted for i 280e so a lot of retailers

930
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:50,720
have adopted holistic wellness shops

931
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:53,029
within their retail space or or another

932
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:54,769
you know type of business to have that

933
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:57,590
separate revenue to make rent and other

934
00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:59,900
things employees deductible and just you

935
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:03,710
think this clause is this is a direct

936
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:06,500
reaction from this ccc to people selling

937
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:07,869
CBD stuff okay so they're basically

938
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:10,639
throwing the baby out with the bathwater

939
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:12,079
just because they yeah that one so

940
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:16,309
because you can't sell him you also

941
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:19,489
can't sell doritos it's all gone you

942
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:22,219
know and and it and i think that's a

943
00:38:19,489 --> 00:38:24,709
challenge especially as brick-and-mortar

944
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:28,579
retailers work to distinguish themselves

945
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:30,380
as a destination in in contrast to

946
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:32,329
delivery models where it's more just

947
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,130
transaction airy you know good because

948
00:38:32,329 --> 00:38:35,869
it's that question of why are people

949
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,730
going to make the trip ultimately and

950
00:38:35,869 --> 00:38:40,279
that so much of that usually has to do

951
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:43,340
with the education the experience and

952
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,230
the ancillary things that are there so

953
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:48,110
they also added some definitions one of

954
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:50,119
them is the promotional materials which

955
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:51,950
you know is they had to add that for

956
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,809
clarity because distributors are allowed

957
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:55,009
to transport them and retailers or it's

958
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:57,500
the one thing you're allowed to give

959
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:59,570
away is his promotional materials and

960
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:03,110
it's a very limited definition it can

961
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:05,090
have no intrinsic or secondary value a

962
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:06,680
battery is not a promotional material

963
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:08,600
lighter is not a promotional material

964
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:11,059
it's literally the flyers and

965
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:14,449
information that goes with the product

966
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:16,519
you know they also like because they

967
00:39:14,449 --> 00:39:18,829
love to insert themselves in processes

968
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:21,079
created a new definition for branded

969
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:23,299
merchandise so that is clothing hats

970
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:25,009
pencils pins keychains mugs water

971
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,010
bottles beverage glasses notepads

972
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:30,950
lanyards cannabis accessories if it's

973
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:33,380
not that it other types of merchandise

974
00:39:30,949 --> 00:39:37,069
approved by the bureau so there is this

975
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:38,720
process now of approval of having your

976
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:44,269
branded merchandise that has to be

977
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:47,299
approved by the bureau i would like to

978
00:39:44,269 --> 00:39:49,670
challenge all of you to troll the agency

979
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:51,769
by making up the most ridiculous branded

980
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,730
merchandise and submitting it for

981
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:55,849
approval

982
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:58,219
every day I say I can think of all sorts

983
00:39:55,849 --> 00:40:00,890
of crazy things I want to propose so

984
00:39:58,219 --> 00:40:03,679
they outlined this process for branded

985
00:40:00,889 --> 00:40:05,809
merchandise approval so if you want to

986
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,338
sell something that is not clothing hats

987
00:40:05,809 --> 00:40:09,108
pencils pens keychains mugs water

988
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:11,299
bottles beverage glasses no Pez lanyards

989
00:40:09,108 --> 00:40:13,759
or cannabis accessories you have to

990
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:16,640
receive written approval from the bureau

991
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,560
before you sell it so you can't start

992
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,509
selling it I got this great idea start

993
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:22,608
selling and then send it you need that

994
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:26,390
approval in advance you have to send

995
00:40:22,608 --> 00:40:29,980
them a picture of the item and and get

996
00:40:26,389 --> 00:40:32,629
written approval and to sell the stuff

997
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:34,429
so and I love their statement of reason

998
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,539
they clarified that the approval has to

999
00:40:34,429 --> 00:40:37,098
be obtained in writing to avoid

1000
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:40,338
confusion about whether they approved it

1001
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:43,309
so you're going yes I believe that is

1002
00:40:40,338 --> 00:40:45,349
the definition of Ouroboros slice snake

1003
00:40:43,309 --> 00:40:50,480
eating its own tail just like so you

1004
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:52,700
know just in case you thought there was

1005
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,400
anything you could advertise for free

1006
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:57,289
please just stop saying free just

1007
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,260
eliminate it from your vocabulary it

1008
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:04,489
doesn't exist they double down more in

1009
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:06,619
the in the readapt of the in the first

1010
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:09,049
proposal we got this edition of the buy

1011
00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:11,088
one get one free free product with any

1012
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:14,390
donation and contest sweepstakes and

1013
00:41:11,088 --> 00:41:17,328
raffles no go and now they've included

1014
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:19,159
you shall not advertise free cannabis

1015
00:41:17,329 --> 00:41:21,950
goods are giveaways of any type of

1016
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:24,710
product including non cannabis products

1017
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:26,750
so now you can't even say come to the

1018
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:29,599
store and get a free t-shirt come to the

1019
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:37,750
store and get a free later you just

1020
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:37,750
can't say it like there you go

1021
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:43,629
well discount coupons I would say is not

1022
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,010
buy one get one free as long as you

1023
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:46,809
don't think I don't get one free on that

1024
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:50,950
coupon that's not what it is it's not a

1025
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:53,320
free product with a donation yes but you

1026
00:41:50,949 --> 00:41:55,359
will run into other issues because there

1027
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,760
are other issues with advertising the

1028
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,530
price of an item as I understand with

1029
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,240
cannabis like you have to parse these

1030
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:03,580
with the rest of the advertising

1031
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:05,979
regulations because there there was

1032
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:09,190
other specifics about things that and a

1033
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:10,900
lot of this runs into because we like to

1034
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:12,909
keep it complicated you also have to

1035
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,320
look at your local ordinances for what

1036
00:42:12,909 --> 00:42:16,210
advertising is like there are certain

1037
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,309
local ordinances that will prohibit you

1038
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:20,440
from advertising price showing a picture

1039
00:42:18,309 --> 00:42:22,929
of a cannabis plant like there's certain

1040
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:26,829
things you cannot do in advertising it's

1041
00:42:22,929 --> 00:42:30,369
very restrictive again I would encourage

1042
00:42:26,829 --> 00:42:32,500
everyone to try to be as compliant as

1043
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:35,049
possible with advertising because if you

1044
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,969
look at models like Nevada and they're

1045
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:38,740
incredibly stringent advertising

1046
00:42:36,969 --> 00:42:40,899
restrictions we're much like our branded

1047
00:42:38,739 --> 00:42:43,209
merchandise here every single

1048
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:46,840
advertisement in Nevada has to be

1049
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:48,550
approved by the bureau by the agency so

1050
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,140
I don't mean I would imagine every

1051
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:51,820
magazine is a quarterly because I don't

1052
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:53,650
know how they would have time to like be

1053
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:56,140
like approve every single every single

1054
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:58,090
advertiser has a registered agent card

1055
00:42:56,139 --> 00:43:02,019
every single advertiser has to be

1056
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:04,780
verified as a licensed business so there

1057
00:43:02,019 --> 00:43:07,989
if if and clearly from looking at the

1058
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:09,460
technology platform language Laurie Ajax

1059
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:11,409
got her hands on some of that Nevada

1060
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:14,440
regulations so if they just keep going

1061
00:43:11,409 --> 00:43:16,329
they're going to get to the advertising

1062
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,230
part and we might see more stringent C

1063
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:19,230
in those areas

1064
00:43:22,019 --> 00:43:27,969
they did not put any language in about a

1065
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:30,820
fee for those so we would hope that's

1066
00:43:27,969 --> 00:43:34,439
just incorporated in the licensing fees

1067
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:36,700
which also went up yeah so we'll see so

1068
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,980
stop saying free there's no free samples

1069
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:41,889
it doesn't exist it's not a thing I

1070
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:43,358
always love to point out there's some

1071
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:44,348
discrepancy it kind of is like a deep

1072
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:46,900
dive because if you're a Los Angeles

1073
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:48,490
person you know the BCC says you can't

1074
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:51,099
get free canvas goods to anybody now

1075
00:43:48,489 --> 00:43:52,750
that's been extended a little bit or

1076
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:54,820
actually that that's you cannot provide

1077
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:58,420
free canvas goods except for in the very

1078
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:59,859
limited medical card scenarios business

1079
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,450
and Professions Code says you can't give

1080
00:43:59,858 --> 00:44:03,400
away any amount of cannabis or cannabis

1081
00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:04,779
products or any cannabis accessories as

1082
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,358
part of a business promotion or

1083
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:09,070
commercial activity and Los Angeles

1084
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:10,509
Department of cannabis regulations says

1085
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:12,700
you cannot provide free samples of any

1086
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:13,599
type including cannabis to anybody so

1087
00:44:12,699 --> 00:44:22,960
you're not allowed to give anybody

1088
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:25,619
anything in LA you cannot give away

1089
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:30,369
branded merchandise no did I understand

1090
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:34,269
in Los Angeles free samples

1091
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:40,570
but in LA free samples of any type

1092
00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:42,909
including cannabis good ha ha that's a

1093
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:44,800
different story all together I mean an

1094
00:44:42,909 --> 00:44:48,429
extra bag is now a mandatory thing that

1095
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,539
you have to give everybody I don't think

1096
00:44:48,429 --> 00:44:51,190
that they considered that branded

1097
00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:52,539
merchandise but that would be an

1098
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,070
interesting clarifying point to make

1099
00:44:52,539 --> 00:44:55,599
with them to say do you have to have

1100
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:58,180
those approved considering that it's

1101
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,400
something walking out the door um I

1102
00:44:58,179 --> 00:45:03,368
always it I always think though from a

1103
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,130
legal perspective I love this definition

1104
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:07,450
the in the definitions of free cannabis

1105
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:09,070
Goods it says it means any amount of

1106
00:45:07,449 --> 00:45:11,618
cannabis Goods provided to any person

1107
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:15,338
without cost or payment or exchange of

1108
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:18,070
any other thing of value that's an

1109
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:19,838
interesting phrase to make of like what

1110
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:21,220
is another thing of value because I

1111
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:22,750
would think that there may be an

1112
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:24,759
argument somewhere that like getting

1113
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:27,219
somebody's email address is a thing of

1114
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:29,140
value from a business having somebody

1115
00:45:27,219 --> 00:45:32,019
join your you know membership VIP

1116
00:45:29,139 --> 00:45:33,309
program is a thing of value I don't know

1117
00:45:32,019 --> 00:45:35,920
that anybody's really gone down that

1118
00:45:33,309 --> 00:45:39,230
road of arguing that

1119
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:43,880
but it's there and just remember that

1120
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:45,409
it's there so if you were worried if you

1121
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,390
were interested in compassion or equity

1122
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:50,719
programs they added equity one word

1123
00:45:47,389 --> 00:45:52,639
there there goes for all the comments

1124
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,709
about compassionate used obviously SB

1125
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:56,210
829 the Weiner bill passed in Senate

1126
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:59,269
wasn't signed by the governor so we

1127
00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:03,380
didn't get the tax relief for compassion

1128
00:45:59,269 --> 00:46:05,420
programs the bradford bill SB 1294 did

1129
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:08,300
get passed in sign the cattle board can

1130
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:11,030
a California cannabis equity act of 2018

1131
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:17,060
which gives a fund to begin to help to

1132
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:19,490
facilitate local programs I mean this is

1133
00:46:17,059 --> 00:46:21,799
an area of interesting confusion for me

1134
00:46:19,489 --> 00:46:23,329
and implementation as well to say that

1135
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,730
in addition to the free cannabis Goods

1136
00:46:23,329 --> 00:46:28,429
which is giving to the the card holders

1137
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:30,079
in the city that a licensee may donate

1138
00:46:28,429 --> 00:46:32,569
cannabis Goods in the use of equipment

1139
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:36,349
in compliance with any local compassion

1140
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:37,730
to use equity or similar program so it

1141
00:46:36,349 --> 00:46:39,440
could be that this is yet another

1142
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:40,969
indication of where we need to work at

1143
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,000
the local level for having those

1144
00:46:40,969 --> 00:46:46,489
compassion programs and equity programs

1145
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:48,380
actually clarified and implemented since

1146
00:46:46,489 --> 00:46:51,619
it does seem to give us some sort of

1147
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:56,650
ability to to interface and provide

1148
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:58,940
services to those populations so

1149
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:59,599
continuing the how's everybody doing you

1150
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:02,300
guys doing all right

1151
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:43,179
yeah we're good there's so much I want

1152
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:45,410
to say I mean short answer no there are

1153
00:47:43,179 --> 00:47:47,629
manufacturing and distribution companies

1154
00:47:45,409 --> 00:47:49,969
that are getting or contemplating

1155
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:51,860
getting delivery licenses retail

1156
00:47:49,969 --> 00:47:54,469
delivery licenses so that they can

1157
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:58,700
compliantly deliver product to their own

1158
00:47:54,469 --> 00:48:03,549
staff because that's one of the areas

1159
00:47:58,699 --> 00:48:07,269
because the state has felt so shackled

1160
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:10,550
by this no free products aspect and that

1161
00:48:07,269 --> 00:48:12,759
the entire back end sales process was

1162
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:16,970
something that was seemingly ignored

1163
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:18,320
there are really difficult mechanisms

1164
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:21,889
that people are going through in terms

1165
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:24,430
of those basic questions of sales how

1166
00:48:21,889 --> 00:48:27,949
does the manufacturer seeking a

1167
00:48:24,429 --> 00:48:30,440
distributor entice that distributor to

1168
00:48:27,949 --> 00:48:33,769
work with them when they can't give them

1169
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:35,210
a sample you know until it's gone all

1170
00:48:33,769 --> 00:48:38,300
the way through the distribution chain

1171
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:39,740
and been approved so so obviously

1172
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,510
everybody right now is doing all of

1173
00:48:39,739 --> 00:48:43,519
their crafty work arounds and thinking

1174
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:44,780
that they've managed this system but my

1175
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,960
concern is that a lot of those

1176
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:50,600
workarounds will be incredibly difficult

1177
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,519
once track and trace turns on because

1178
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:55,969
there's not going to be a category for

1179
00:48:52,519 --> 00:48:58,940
oh I gave it to my staff you don't for

1180
00:48:55,969 --> 00:49:02,139
or what did I do so so those kind of

1181
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:06,349
fundamental aspects of the supply chain

1182
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:08,719
how business is done how how employees

1183
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:10,639
get educated about products like it

1184
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:12,559
would be preposterous in another market

1185
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:15,019
to think that you go into a wine bar and

1186
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,219
you ask the wine guy

1187
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:17,989
what do you recommend they're like I

1188
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:21,169
don't know I'm not allowed to do I have

1189
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:24,469
no idea like there you go let's read the

1190
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:27,200
box like that that's so so I mean

1191
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:30,019
obviously we're in a where

1192
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:41,779
a process of baby steps but that's

1193
00:49:30,019 --> 00:49:43,489
that's well well they wouldn't come they

1194
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:45,380
wouldn't come for free they'd come you

1195
00:49:43,489 --> 00:49:46,879
know documented and build and put on

1196
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:50,720
your you think because you need paper

1197
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:52,460
for it yeah it's in the manifest the

1198
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:54,379
very interesting thing that I find is

1199
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,970
that and this is where some of the

1200
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:58,849
agencies are ahead of others the scene

1201
00:49:55,969 --> 00:50:02,719
ETF a the tax agency actually has a

1202
00:49:58,849 --> 00:50:06,050
really good descriptive tax scheme for a

1203
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:09,500
product that is given to a retailer or

1204
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:11,720
buyer and consumed it never makes it to

1205
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:14,030
retail they seem to recognize that that

1206
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:15,679
scenario exists in there like and this

1207
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:17,869
is how you deal with the taxes for that

1208
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:20,539
but like many things I mean in cannabis

1209
00:50:17,869 --> 00:50:22,280
and in LA like the tax agency was way

1210
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:25,969
ahead of the regulation they're like

1211
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:29,570
absolutely you can pay us for that so so

1212
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:33,348
it's and honestly I mean honestly that's

1213
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:35,599
what people hire like lawyers and

1214
00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:39,530
compliance people to do is to be like

1215
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:41,838
how do I map a compliant process that's

1216
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:44,569
gonna stand up to track and trace that's

1217
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:46,969
gonna satisfy the state's requirements

1218
00:50:44,568 --> 00:50:48,559
and that can actually allow me to move

1219
00:50:46,969 --> 00:50:53,568
things through the supply chain you know

1220
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:56,328
in in the right way I mean the concern

1221
00:50:53,568 --> 00:50:58,009
that I have now and then I'll keep

1222
00:50:56,329 --> 00:51:00,769
moving through because there's a but the

1223
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:03,290
concern that I have now is and not just

1224
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:05,420
because I'm a compliance in song but but

1225
00:51:03,289 --> 00:51:07,730
it's difficult for people to prioritize

1226
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:09,769
compliance when they're just trying to

1227
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:10,849
survive like where obviously everybody's

1228
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:12,559
just like I'm just trying to keep the

1229
00:51:10,849 --> 00:51:14,210
doors open I don't have time to make

1230
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:18,108
sure that I'm papering this process

1231
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:20,030
correctly or whatever but as friendly as

1232
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:22,489
the agents may seem when they come to

1233
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:24,589
you know check out your place I like to

1234
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:27,588
be like these are not your friends they

1235
00:51:24,588 --> 00:51:29,299
have five years to to levy penalties and

1236
00:51:27,588 --> 00:51:33,199
fines against things that you're you did

1237
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:35,180
day one the tax agency has said they

1238
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:37,879
absolutely will go back and audit year

1239
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:40,849
one the record-keeping requirements for

1240
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:43,670
cannabis companies went into effect

1241
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:45,380
back on January 1st so everyone that was

1242
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:46,730
feeling that they had all this lead wag

1243
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:47,869
is really all well track and trace isn't

1244
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:50,059
on so I can do that I'm gonna bring in

1245
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:51,889
this product I'm gonna do that when they

1246
00:51:50,059 --> 00:51:55,009
show up and they're like okay we need to

1247
00:51:51,889 --> 00:51:58,789
review your records on it like for this

1248
00:51:55,010 --> 00:52:00,650
year you know that's just it's the

1249
00:51:58,789 --> 00:52:02,960
question is like what position is that

1250
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:04,220
going to put you in and we'll get to it

1251
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,500
at the end you'll see the the

1252
00:52:04,219 --> 00:52:10,009
cultivation Department put in their

1253
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:11,750
penalties for record-keeping the

1254
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:13,730
operational penalty for working without

1255
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:15,050
a license maxes out at five thousand

1256
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:16,460
dollars like if you if you're operating

1257
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:18,200
without a license it's a severe

1258
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:19,610
infection obviously you can get your

1259
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:21,079
license rug whatever but the fine is

1260
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:23,360
five thousand dollars in the

1261
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:25,909
record-keeping section of administrative

1262
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:29,230
failures the max fine is thirty thousand

1263
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:32,989
dollars per instance so they are not

1264
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:36,050
kidding about record-keeping and it

1265
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:39,199
sounds so boring don't say it's it's

1266
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:41,060
it's the hardest thing in this moment to

1267
00:52:39,199 --> 00:53:01,399
convince people that this is something

1268
00:52:41,059 --> 00:53:04,190
you should be thinking about I I think I

1269
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:07,519
think I think it's never too late

1270
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:09,619
this is I think that this is you know

1271
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:11,800
the final regs aren't final this is

1272
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:14,779
always going to be an evolving process

1273
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:16,070
it may be - it may be too late I mean

1274
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:17,990
it's not too late in terms of I think

1275
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:19,280
everybody should comment on it it should

1276
00:53:17,989 --> 00:53:21,500
be on record your voice should be heard

1277
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,150
it's a public record they need we have

1278
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:26,989
to document our existence and our

1279
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:28,820
feelings but but one of the things one

1280
00:53:26,989 --> 00:53:30,949
of the glimmers of hope that a lot of

1281
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:32,420
people are looking to as well is in

1282
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:34,189
November we're gonna have a new governor

1283
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:35,720
and we are gonna have a governor most

1284
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:37,730
likely that really supports the cannabis

1285
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:40,459
industry and supports efficient business

1286
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:43,460
so that you have the option of where

1287
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:45,980
this regulatory tweaking period will end

1288
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:48,170
you know this isn't over by a long shot

1289
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:50,990
there's 70 bills that are gonna be

1290
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:52,909
introduced on cannabis in January you

1291
00:53:50,989 --> 00:53:53,679
know or more probably by the time we get

1292
00:53:52,909 --> 00:53:57,129
to January there

1293
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:58,779
a huge amount of legislative change that

1294
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:02,349
can happen as well and that's kind of

1295
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:05,380
the more master strokes that we need is

1296
00:54:02,349 --> 00:54:07,930
somebody to go in and really correct

1297
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:09,550
some of the things that were caused in

1298
00:54:07,929 --> 00:54:11,259
the drafting of my cursor I mean anybody

1299
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:13,720
knows me like one of my big pet peeves

1300
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:15,849
is like Alma was an adult use bill with

1301
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:17,558
a 15% excise tax that got combined with

1302
00:54:15,849 --> 00:54:20,650
the medical program and put an adult

1303
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:23,140
excise tax on medical goods how that

1304
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:25,150
happened I don't know like but it but

1305
00:54:23,139 --> 00:54:26,858
that should be undone and there's a lot

1306
00:54:25,150 --> 00:54:29,588
of areas where people are working you

1307
00:54:26,858 --> 00:54:31,088
know to change those things the other

1308
00:54:29,588 --> 00:54:32,500
thing that I'll say is that like you

1309
00:54:31,088 --> 00:54:34,000
know for this very moment we're sitting

1310
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,130
in right here these are not the rules

1311
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,619
these are still the proposed rules you

1312
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:40,480
know so we still have 12 days of

1313
00:54:38,619 --> 00:54:42,970
comments a new introduction of a draft

1314
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:45,789
so I mean it's it's incredibly difficult

1315
00:54:42,969 --> 00:54:47,348
I understand as operators to be like one

1316
00:54:45,789 --> 00:54:48,608
of those it you know you're trying to

1317
00:54:47,349 --> 00:54:51,010
make packaging and they keep changing

1318
00:54:48,608 --> 00:54:52,960
every aspect of it which is the next

1319
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:55,150
thing we'll cover really quick it's

1320
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,949
difficult to be that responsive but it's

1321
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:59,380
also you know that it's it's

1322
00:54:56,949 --> 00:55:03,789
unfortunately the the race that we're in

1323
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:06,849
is having to be that that nimble so you

1324
00:55:03,789 --> 00:55:12,759
may have seen that CRP is back sort of

1325
00:55:06,849 --> 00:55:16,690
not really often so they kind of entered

1326
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:19,089
this halfway thing where so now prior to

1327
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:20,260
January 2020 it has to be tamper evident

1328
00:55:19,088 --> 00:55:23,529
but it doesn't have to be child

1329
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:25,420
resistant or resealable unless if you go

1330
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:27,730
to the Department of Public Health where

1331
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:30,849
if it has multiple uses than it does

1332
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:33,369
have to be resealable and then ask we've

1333
00:55:30,849 --> 00:55:35,380
been starting in 2020 it's going to have

1334
00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:40,809
to be that resealable tamper-evident in

1335
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:42,309
child resistant so until that day the

1336
00:55:40,809 --> 00:55:43,569
Department of Health says you can meet

1337
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:48,579
those packaging requirements through the

1338
00:55:43,568 --> 00:55:50,409
use of an exit bag ah this is kind of I

1339
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:51,640
was talking to somebody from the

1340
00:55:50,409 --> 00:55:54,460
Department of Public Health about this

1341
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:56,440
because it's almost like you know we had

1342
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:58,000
the environmental argument of like oh my

1343
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,230
god it's too much packaging or the

1344
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,849
industry's not ready and this is

1345
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,710
terrible and then we have the oh my god

1346
00:56:00,849 --> 00:56:04,480
I don't want to do exit bags or why

1347
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:05,949
don't we just do it that way and now it

1348
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,659
seems they just did all of it at the

1349
00:56:05,949 --> 00:56:11,259
same time they're just like great

1350
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:13,000
now we're gonna have literally literally

1351
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:14,380
all cameras goods purchased by a

1352
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,789
consumer can't leave the present

1353
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:18,160
premises unless they're in an opaque

1354
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:19,930
exit package which prior to January 2020

1355
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:22,480
has to be resealable child-resistant and

1356
00:56:19,929 --> 00:56:24,460
opaque so now we find ourselves in the

1357
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,260
Kafka esque world in which child

1358
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:28,298
resistant packaging is going to be put

1359
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:33,549
in a child resistant exit bag to leave

1360
00:56:28,298 --> 00:56:36,909
in store so all of our worst features

1361
00:56:33,548 --> 00:56:43,929
are being realized and then after 2020

1362
00:56:36,909 --> 00:56:45,759
you know you can have tote bags so and

1363
00:56:43,929 --> 00:56:47,440
and they did clarify that immature

1364
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:52,390
plants and seeds don't have to be shoved

1365
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:57,940
into an exit bag so that's nice please

1366
00:56:52,389 --> 00:56:59,710
comment on this please do i I mean

1367
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,068
anybody that was coming at this from the

1368
00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:02,108
oven

1369
00:57:00,068 --> 00:57:04,088
Peter the future canvas project had it

1370
00:57:02,108 --> 00:57:06,639
had an event we're talking about the

1371
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:08,500
becoming ecological disaster and lack of

1372
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:11,139
sense that it has that in a state where

1373
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:18,849
we outlaw plastic bags and straws we're

1374
00:57:11,139 --> 00:57:22,269
like but we're gonna package this and

1375
00:57:18,849 --> 00:57:25,059
now honestly now that the problem has

1376
00:57:22,269 --> 00:57:26,559
been even duplicated like and it's

1377
00:57:25,059 --> 00:57:28,569
difficult because as I was talking about

1378
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,640
to to the Department of Health is the

1379
00:57:28,568 --> 00:57:33,190
last thing I want is more onus put on a

1380
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:34,868
retailer who has to have both tote bags

1381
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:36,400
and exit bags and be like is this child

1382
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:40,528
resistant I don't know which one do I do

1383
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:43,539
so putting it all in X advice fine but

1384
00:57:40,528 --> 00:57:44,650
but it's super messy it's super messy

1385
00:57:43,539 --> 00:57:47,260
and there's a lot of there's big

1386
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:48,818
packaging lobbies that are the kind of

1387
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:50,289
drove that has changed it was gonna be

1388
00:57:48,818 --> 00:57:51,818
exit back so it was gonna be like you

1389
00:57:50,289 --> 00:57:53,799
know what we'll just do exit bags and

1390
00:57:51,818 --> 00:57:58,769
then the packaging god the lobby was

1391
00:57:53,798 --> 00:58:01,929
like Whitney packaging you think and in

1392
00:57:58,769 --> 00:58:03,639
it's complicated but again this is one

1393
00:58:01,929 --> 00:58:04,449
of the I had I had a great conversation

1394
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:08,108
with the Department of Public Health

1395
00:58:04,449 --> 00:58:09,879
about unfortunately we're up against

1396
00:58:08,108 --> 00:58:12,009
this timeline because the emergency regs

1397
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:13,599
are going to expire they need to have

1398
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:15,609
permanent regulations and we're going to

1399
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:17,230
have to continue to work on them I think

1400
00:58:15,608 --> 00:58:18,848
for the packaging at least from the

1401
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:21,159
Department of Public Health there there

1402
00:58:18,849 --> 00:58:23,109
seems to be this kind of openness to

1403
00:58:21,159 --> 00:58:25,899
this is an area that's going to require

1404
00:58:23,108 --> 00:58:28,779
more nuance than we have time for it is

1405
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:30,700
not a one-size-fits-all solution my

1406
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:32,109
pie-in-the-sky fantasy I think the first

1407
00:58:30,699 --> 00:58:34,298
place for us to really pull back

1408
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:35,889
packaging is not gonna be on edibles

1409
00:58:34,298 --> 00:58:37,269
because there's just too many freakishly

1410
00:58:35,889 --> 00:58:38,798
terrified people who think you're

1411
00:58:37,269 --> 00:58:42,280
they're gonna eat a blueberry and jump

1412
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:44,318
off a balcony or something but is in the

1413
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:47,260
flower market because the flower is the

1414
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:49,088
part that's just insane to think that

1415
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:51,190
it's all being prepackaged in this

1416
00:58:49,088 --> 00:58:53,230
incredibly onerous tiny little bottles

1417
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:54,880
and stuff and in one of the arguments

1418
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:58,780
that I've made to the department's is

1419
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:02,500
even in the pharmaceutical model when

1420
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:05,920
you go to CVS the big drug companies

1421
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:09,460
ship bulk powders and pills to CVS and

1422
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:11,440
the pharmacist fills your prescription

1423
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,599
and puts it a little bottle and gives it

1424
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,809
to you and that is a tracked and traced

1425
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:18,818
process and once we have track and trace

1426
00:59:16,809 --> 00:59:21,430
I think that is an area where we will be

1427
00:59:18,818 --> 00:59:23,288
able to eliminate a huge swath of

1428
00:59:21,429 --> 00:59:25,179
packaging because once they have

1429
00:59:23,289 --> 00:59:27,520
visibility on every single gram of

1430
00:59:25,179 --> 00:59:30,338
cannabis its moving through the system

1431
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:32,409
there is no reason we cannot return to

1432
00:59:30,338 --> 00:59:33,489
that system and for years I've been

1433
00:59:32,409 --> 00:59:35,259
talking to them about when they think

1434
00:59:33,489 --> 00:59:36,639
about products moving through the chain

1435
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:38,079
they're thinking about beers and

1436
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:40,239
cigarettes and they're thinking about

1437
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:42,579
things with these with shelf lives and

1438
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:44,919
just standardized processes and in the

1439
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:46,960
case of flour I keep telling them you

1440
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:48,548
need to think about a tomato you need to

1441
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,528
think about how many how many people do

1442
00:59:48,548 --> 00:59:52,838
you want to touch your tomato before you

1443
00:59:50,528 --> 00:59:54,460
can seed you know and when you go to the

1444
00:59:52,838 --> 00:59:55,869
grocery store you don't just go up to

1445
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:58,028
the guy at the counter and be like I

1446
00:59:55,869 --> 01:00:00,880
want a tomato you like to see the

1447
00:59:58,028 --> 01:00:03,579
freaking tomatoes you like to go I like

1448
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:06,160
that Apple you know that that is an

1449
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:08,710
experience and again that's one of the

1450
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:09,879
possible distinguishing things that

1451
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:11,500
would that would support

1452
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:13,298
brick-and-mortar retailers and the

1453
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:15,639
ability to be like I want to go to the

1454
01:00:13,298 --> 01:00:18,460
store because I want to choose the exact

1455
01:00:15,639 --> 01:00:21,759
you know the exact flour that I want to

1456
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:23,920
try and they seem receptive to that but

1457
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,900
who knows you know we'll see but I think

1458
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:27,159
that's something I think that's an easy

1459
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:30,010
win because the other thing is from the

1460
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:32,798
public safety perspective if a kid gets

1461
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:34,480
into a bag of flour and eats it who

1462
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:39,210
cares like nothin's

1463
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:39,210
gonna happen they're gonna be fine yes

1464
01:00:47,489 --> 01:00:52,809
well it this is a big question that I

1465
01:00:50,769 --> 01:00:56,289
have in terms of where that liability

1466
01:00:52,809 --> 01:00:58,690
lies because if they show up in your

1467
01:00:56,289 --> 01:01:00,940
retail establishment and you have

1468
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:04,690
improperly packaged labeled products on

1469
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:07,090
your shelf they may seize it they can be

1470
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:09,340
like this is this is not right in terms

1471
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:12,039
of when we see you know they've moved

1472
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:14,650
from the friendly-like tariff sheet

1473
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:17,619
warning to like certified letters now of

1474
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:20,680
like notices to comply so they've gone

1475
01:01:17,619 --> 01:01:23,380
to like stern letter writing but I think

1476
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:25,269
in January we will start to see the

1477
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:27,340
actual levying of penalties and fines

1478
01:01:25,269 --> 01:01:28,449
for first summer I mean the most

1479
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:30,670
egregious things that they've actually

1480
01:01:28,449 --> 01:01:32,139
done fines for so far has been when

1481
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:34,539
people don't allow you if they if you

1482
01:01:32,139 --> 01:01:38,529
don't let them in you will get a fine to

1483
01:01:34,539 --> 01:01:41,050
be like no he can't come in but I mean

1484
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:43,030
this is why internal compliance programs

1485
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:45,190
are so important because now that

1486
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:47,590
they've added this aspect of you can

1487
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:49,210
reject a shipment if it's not packaged

1488
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:50,860
and labeled correctly it suggests to me

1489
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:52,269
that some of that onus is going to be on

1490
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:53,559
the retailer because you've never should

1491
01:01:52,269 --> 01:01:55,719
have taken it you shouldn't have

1492
01:01:53,559 --> 01:01:57,699
accepted that product if it's not

1493
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:59,199
labeled correctly so this is why

1494
01:01:57,699 --> 01:02:00,819
everybody should have their packaging

1495
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:02,409
and labeling checklist for when the

1496
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:07,080
product arrives you sit there and you go

1497
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:07,079
through all those labeling requirements

1498
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:23,090
[Music]

1499
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:07,049
yeah it is a lot cheaper to work with me

1500
01:03:03,539 --> 01:03:08,009
than to have that moment but but but the

1501
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:10,500
other thing is they don't give you a lot

1502
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:13,140
of time those notices to comply say you

1503
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:15,179
have 15 days to inform us that this is

1504
01:03:13,139 --> 01:03:17,940
fixed not just tell us how you're gonna

1505
01:03:15,179 --> 01:03:20,099
do it it's 15 days to say it's done the

1506
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:24,090
products gone stuff is disposed this is

1507
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:24,449
how I corrected it yeah and not just say

1508
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:26,430
it

1509
01:03:24,449 --> 01:03:28,349
and don't just say like we did a

1510
01:03:26,429 --> 01:03:31,259
training it's like you have to document

1511
01:03:28,349 --> 01:03:34,170
oh it's like there's there's all sorts

1512
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:37,680
of aspects of that so I call this the

1513
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:39,690
CDP headaches because if you notice in

1514
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:40,858
the CV pH regulations the Department of

1515
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:44,220
Public Health manufacturing they were

1516
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:46,230
just confusing as all get-out because

1517
01:03:44,219 --> 01:03:47,879
they did this awesome thing where

1518
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:50,309
instead of just putting all the

1519
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:51,869
regulations in one place they put Astrix

1520
01:03:50,309 --> 01:03:53,489
ha's for the parts that weren't changed

1521
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:56,608
and just didn't print them at all and

1522
01:03:53,489 --> 01:03:59,219
then if it was added than it was in blue

1523
01:03:56,608 --> 01:04:01,079
and if it was removed it was in red so

1524
01:03:59,219 --> 01:04:02,759
you you know you got you got all these

1525
01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:04,529
calls of people being like oh there's no

1526
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:06,060
more security requirements or whatever

1527
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:08,430
this is great and it's like no no you

1528
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:10,980
got to go back so literally you had to

1529
01:04:08,429 --> 01:04:13,649
have the old version and the new version

1530
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:15,000
to figure out what changed and then go

1531
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:17,760
back and reference the parts that

1532
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,199
weren't changed so my first ask for them

1533
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,940
is could you please just put it all in

1534
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:25,019
one document because that would be a lot

1535
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:27,210
easier there's a lot of stuff in there

1536
01:04:25,019 --> 01:04:28,500
the the packaging was the kind of one of

1537
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:32,639
the biggest ones that's getting the most

1538
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:35,099
attention for this you know when win

1539
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:36,868
2020 kicks in there's gonna be all of

1540
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:41,489
these packaging requirements that kick

1541
01:04:36,869 --> 01:04:43,800
in and and even a new labeling piece in

1542
01:04:41,489 --> 01:04:47,099
2020 which is if a package is not

1543
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:48,600
intended to be inhaled or are the ones

1544
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:51,449
that are intended to be inhaled and

1545
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:54,210
aren't or topicals and aren't child

1546
01:04:51,449 --> 01:04:56,460
resistant after opened it has to say

1547
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:58,289
this package is not child resistant

1548
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:00,510
after opening so if you were worried

1549
01:04:58,289 --> 01:05:04,050
about your labeling real estate now you

1550
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:05,880
got one more line to stick in there they

1551
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:07,530
did get a little more clear on the

1552
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,150
definition of child resistance because

1553
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:13,170
people were just like is this baggie

1554
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:15,539
okay and so there is a lot more clarity

1555
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:19,230
in terms of what they are going to

1556
01:05:15,539 --> 01:05:21,539
consider child resistant I loved the

1557
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:23,670
addition that speaks so much this one

1558
01:05:21,539 --> 01:05:26,550
word that came in the cannabis product

1559
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:28,650
quantity equality of homogeneity because

1560
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:31,619
homogeneity is like the bane of the

1561
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:33,690
industry right now evidently the testing

1562
01:05:31,619 --> 01:05:36,660
labs are telling the manufacturers you

1563
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:39,510
guys are not good at homogeneity it's

1564
01:05:36,659 --> 01:05:42,029
causing a lot of problems in testing so

1565
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:43,470
there's a lot of indications that the

1566
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:45,450
Department of Public Health is really

1567
01:05:43,469 --> 01:05:47,789
drilling into those good manufacturing

1568
01:05:45,449 --> 01:05:49,980
processes and making sure that people

1569
01:05:47,789 --> 01:05:53,608
really know how to make a food-grade

1570
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:55,710
consistent product in the master

1571
01:05:53,608 --> 01:05:57,329
manufacturing protocol you know they

1572
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:59,880
kind of inserted a little more

1573
01:05:57,329 --> 01:06:01,500
information about that homogeneity word

1574
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:03,119
coming up which is mitigating through

1575
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,710
against the potential for adulteration

1576
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,390
through incorporation of incorrect

1577
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:09,420
amounts of cannabinoids unintended to

1578
01:06:06,389 --> 01:06:12,029
green ingredients hazards in the product

1579
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:13,500
quality plan potential for misbranding

1580
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:15,990
through incorporation of ingredients not

1581
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:19,050
identified on the label or the miss

1582
01:06:15,989 --> 01:06:21,029
labeling of product I didn't make a

1583
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:23,700
slide for that for this but they they

1584
01:06:21,030 --> 01:06:26,820
now reference out to like the federal

1585
01:06:23,699 --> 01:06:29,639
FDA regulations for ingredients for how

1586
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:31,800
you mark artificial ingredients natural

1587
01:06:29,639 --> 01:06:33,150
flavor these kind of aspects of what are

1588
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:36,090
the federal requirements for disclosure

1589
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:38,639
of those ingredients because you know

1590
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:41,278
people who are like it's cannabis and

1591
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:43,518
both are you have to kind of get a

1592
01:06:41,278 --> 01:06:47,818
little more clear on a lot of those

1593
01:06:43,518 --> 01:06:49,199
aspects you all will manufacturers out

1594
01:06:47,818 --> 01:06:51,239
there will soon be very familiar with

1595
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:53,578
the help and safety code if you're not

1596
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:55,139
already they've added 21 references to

1597
01:06:53,579 --> 01:06:57,720
the health and safety code now pointing

1598
01:06:55,139 --> 01:06:59,518
out mostly it was you know they they

1599
01:06:57,719 --> 01:07:01,858
articulated in their in their summary

1600
01:06:59,518 --> 01:07:03,689
that it's they're revising the good

1601
01:07:01,858 --> 01:07:05,699
manufacturing processes to provide

1602
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:07,920
greater clarity to the process and

1603
01:07:05,699 --> 01:07:11,429
documentation required when making

1604
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:14,249
cannabis products and and really went

1605
01:07:11,429 --> 01:07:17,460
deep on on pointing to the health and

1606
01:07:14,248 --> 01:07:19,288
safety code on on 21 different points

1607
01:07:17,460 --> 01:07:21,119
saying you need to follow these

1608
01:07:19,289 --> 01:07:25,109
guidelines for how to meet these

1609
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:27,720
requirements of good manufacturing most

1610
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:29,788
of it is in that 402 for Oh groans

1611
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:31,528
building and manufacturing premises

1612
01:07:29,789 --> 01:07:35,519
section that's the section that has the

1613
01:07:31,528 --> 01:07:37,619
lion's share so this was a big one that

1614
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:40,889
a lot of people I know missed because it

1615
01:07:37,619 --> 01:07:44,358
seems simple but it's super lame um in

1616
01:07:40,889 --> 01:07:47,699
my opinion they've changed the language

1617
01:07:44,358 --> 01:07:50,518
from business days to calendar days in

1618
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:52,379
the case of things such as if you lose

1619
01:07:50,518 --> 01:07:54,238
connectivity with the track and trace

1620
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:55,650
system and the system goes down for a

1621
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:58,108
couple weeks and you have to log

1622
01:07:55,650 --> 01:08:00,989
everything is put on paper and you still

1623
01:07:58,108 --> 01:08:03,960
have those three days to insert all your

1624
01:08:00,989 --> 01:08:06,749
information those are now three calendar

1625
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:08,818
days not three business days so if

1626
01:08:06,748 --> 01:08:11,548
connectivity comes back up on a Friday

1627
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:13,889
you're gonna be paying overtime for the

1628
01:08:11,548 --> 01:08:16,889
weekend for everybody to insert all of

1629
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:18,988
your documentation so in many cases and

1630
01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:19,469
especially I'm thinking about farmers up

1631
01:08:18,988 --> 01:08:22,019
north

1632
01:08:19,469 --> 01:08:24,658
these were tight timelines anyway of

1633
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:26,699
having to report every change in

1634
01:08:24,658 --> 01:08:28,920
disposition of your flowering into track

1635
01:08:26,698 --> 01:08:31,169
and trace within three days and now

1636
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:34,079
those three business days are three

1637
01:08:31,170 --> 01:08:36,750
calendar days so even something as small

1638
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:38,850
as that has a huge impact on these

1639
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:41,520
timelines a lot of it is that that track

1640
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:45,719
and trace training now is required in

1641
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:48,150
five calendar days of issue license

1642
01:08:45,719 --> 01:08:51,460
issuance so if you get that license on a

1643
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:52,719
Friday two of your days are done

1644
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:55,689
if you're not working through the

1645
01:08:52,719 --> 01:09:03,730
weekend so it's it's really critical yes

1646
01:08:55,689 --> 01:09:05,079
I there they did not I mean it doesn't

1647
01:09:03,729 --> 01:09:06,909
look like they don't know if they had

1648
01:09:05,079 --> 01:09:09,818
they did not add a definition of

1649
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:13,329
calendar day in which are exempted from

1650
01:09:09,819 --> 01:09:15,989
those calendar days so again if I may

1651
01:09:13,329 --> 01:09:19,329
highlight a really simple one for

1652
01:09:15,988 --> 01:09:21,699
commenting to say why why are you doing

1653
01:09:19,329 --> 01:09:23,140
this the thing that I love and I wanted

1654
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:26,949
to drop it in advisor and halftime is

1655
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:29,048
that there's there's a in one of the

1656
01:09:26,949 --> 01:09:31,479
instances where it's the agency's onus

1657
01:09:29,048 --> 01:09:34,000
to respond to something there's is in

1658
01:09:31,479 --> 01:09:35,559
business days so the industry has to

1659
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,600
function on calendar days but the

1660
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:41,710
agencies get business days so it does

1661
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:46,000
seem a little unfair what time is it I

1662
01:09:41,710 --> 01:09:46,659
don't know down the clock okay okay I'm

1663
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,479
almost there

1664
01:09:46,659 --> 01:09:50,920
I think so there's so much in

1665
01:09:49,479 --> 01:09:53,019
cultivation

1666
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:54,489
there were some other clarifications

1667
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:56,320
that were made one of the big ones was

1668
01:09:54,488 --> 01:09:59,289
on areas that cannot be shared by

1669
01:09:56,319 --> 01:10:01,119
multiple licensees again people who have

1670
01:09:59,289 --> 01:10:02,500
been doing licensing licensing this may

1671
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:04,238
not come as a surprise but it's

1672
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:06,699
additional clarification was made of

1673
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:09,699
that you cannot share these areas and

1674
01:10:06,699 --> 01:10:12,609
then more clarity around shared areas

1675
01:10:09,699 --> 01:10:14,380
that have to be contiguous and and what

1676
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:18,549
the designation is for what's happening

1677
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:20,500
there this has been something that many

1678
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:22,719
of us you know who have undergone the

1679
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:24,640
audits from them have seen coming they

1680
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,469
added in cultivation plan requirements a

1681
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,060
signed attestation that says you're

1682
01:10:26,469 --> 01:10:30,460
going to contact the appropriate County

1683
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:32,080
Agricultural Commission Commissioner

1684
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:35,859
regarding requirements for legal use of

1685
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:37,029
pesticides this is when the CDFA has

1686
01:10:35,859 --> 01:10:37,779
been coming with the county AG

1687
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:39,969
commissioner

1688
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:42,130
they want to know do you have your

1689
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:44,710
applicator license and your operator ID

1690
01:10:42,130 --> 01:10:46,329
so all of the cultivators have to be

1691
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:48,219
going you have to get your you have to

1692
01:10:46,329 --> 01:10:49,988
take a class you got to read a book you

1693
01:10:48,219 --> 01:10:51,819
got stuff you have to get your

1694
01:10:49,988 --> 01:10:53,799
applicator license in your operator ID

1695
01:10:51,819 --> 01:10:55,869
and the fact that they have now gone to

1696
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:58,180
put this into signing an attestation

1697
01:10:55,869 --> 01:11:00,069
just say you're going to do it means

1698
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:02,560
that they I mean they're seeing a lot of

1699
01:11:00,069 --> 01:11:04,389
non-compliance in this area that people

1700
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:06,189
are dragging their heels and

1701
01:11:04,389 --> 01:11:07,328
doing it and this was the one I was

1702
01:11:06,189 --> 01:11:09,610
talking about the importance of

1703
01:11:07,328 --> 01:11:11,618
record-keeping just to look at that

1704
01:11:09,609 --> 01:11:13,779
section in the administrative actions on

1705
01:11:11,618 --> 01:11:15,578
record-keeping the licensee can be

1706
01:11:13,779 --> 01:11:17,198
subject to a citation and sign which may

1707
01:11:15,578 --> 01:11:21,849
be issued as a notice of violation of up

1708
01:11:17,198 --> 01:11:26,078
to $30,000 per individual violation for

1709
01:11:21,849 --> 01:11:27,328
record-keeping for engaging in

1710
01:11:26,078 --> 01:11:29,859
commercial cannabis without an

1711
01:11:27,328 --> 01:11:32,738
unlicensed or with an unlicensed person

1712
01:11:29,859 --> 01:11:34,509
that's five grand for record-keeping it

1713
01:11:32,738 --> 01:11:39,029
can be up to thirty thousand dollars per

1714
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:44,139
instance so that's my ad for compliant

1715
01:11:39,029 --> 01:11:45,639
more fun stuff this is great so we all

1716
01:11:44,139 --> 01:11:48,489
knew that the temporary program was

1717
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:50,918
expiring on December 31st what is kind

1718
01:11:48,488 --> 01:11:54,998
of interesting news in there thing is

1719
01:11:50,918 --> 01:11:57,788
that once the new proposed regulations

1720
01:11:54,998 --> 01:11:59,800
are accepted in early January the bureau

1721
01:11:57,788 --> 01:12:01,630
is no longer accepting temporary license

1722
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:04,179
applications when those go under facts

1723
01:12:01,630 --> 01:12:06,010
so pretty much in this interpretation of

1724
01:12:04,179 --> 01:12:07,868
this we lose the last possible three

1725
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:09,489
weeks of December to hope that you get

1726
01:12:07,868 --> 01:12:11,380
that temporary license application in

1727
01:12:09,488 --> 01:12:15,308
and you can get that you know New Year's

1728
01:12:11,380 --> 01:12:16,510
Eve thing so they're not they're not

1729
01:12:15,309 --> 01:12:18,849
gonna accept that there seemed to be

1730
01:12:16,510 --> 01:12:20,320
some confusion Laurie was speaking at

1731
01:12:18,849 --> 01:12:22,029
the event yesterday and she's like I'm

1732
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:24,038
gonna be doing licenses and we're gonna

1733
01:12:22,029 --> 01:12:25,300
take it to the last minute you know em

1734
01:12:24,038 --> 01:12:27,488
so we'll see

1735
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:29,979
cuz what it says is that they're not

1736
01:12:27,488 --> 01:12:33,129
gonna accept it so we'll have to hope

1737
01:12:29,979 --> 01:12:34,418
that those those temporary licenses get

1738
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:35,949
in because obviously if you do not have

1739
01:12:34,418 --> 01:12:36,849
a temporary license by the end of the

1740
01:12:35,948 --> 01:12:39,759
year

1741
01:12:36,849 --> 01:12:42,779
you do not qualify for the provisional

1742
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,780
license program so

1743
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:55,110
especially finishing sequa and stuff

1744
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:57,449
like that that will become a very long

1745
01:12:55,109 --> 01:12:59,519
process for those who are not able to

1746
01:12:57,449 --> 01:13:01,710
operate through that process and make

1747
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:03,960
any income until they get their annual

1748
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:07,409
permit that's bad

1749
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:09,659
goodbye teen plants market so the the

1750
01:13:07,409 --> 01:13:12,689
BCC introduced a new definition of

1751
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:15,420
immature plant which is anything over 18

1752
01:13:12,689 --> 01:13:17,939
inches I have a lot of questions about

1753
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:19,920
this one because they say it's necessary

1754
01:13:17,939 --> 01:13:21,389
because they didn't have a definition so

1755
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:24,210
they made one up doesn't happen to be

1756
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:27,720
the same as the CDF phase definition so

1757
01:13:24,210 --> 01:13:29,460
that's cool so my questions around this

1758
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:30,990
would be if you're a retailer and you've

1759
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:32,189
taken in some plants and they grow tall

1760
01:13:30,989 --> 01:13:33,210
what do you do with them you have to

1761
01:13:32,189 --> 01:13:34,919
destroy them you can't give them back

1762
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:36,270
you can't sell them to anybody yeah you

1763
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:37,949
know I can't send them back to a

1764
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:41,760
cultivator to have a nice prosperous

1765
01:13:37,949 --> 01:13:44,970
life as an adult plant so this you know

1766
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:46,619
for that that market of you know teenage

1767
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:49,320
plants that some people like that's too

1768
01:13:46,619 --> 01:13:51,090
bad and goodbye this is actually sort of

1769
01:13:49,319 --> 01:13:53,340
a positive thing the 14 day

1770
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:56,420
reconciliation was replaced with a 30

1771
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:59,300
day reconciliation so that mandatory

1772
01:13:56,420 --> 01:14:02,010
track and trace requirement of

1773
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:05,100
reconciling every 14 days is now at

1774
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:07,710
least once every 30 calendar days and

1775
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:09,890
there was also a slight rise in the

1776
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:13,710
definition of a significant discrepancy

1777
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:15,780
in inventory it used to be $5,000 or 2%

1778
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:18,569
of your average daily sales and now

1779
01:14:15,779 --> 01:14:23,550
5,000 is struck and it's 3% of your

1780
01:14:18,569 --> 01:14:25,259
average monthly sales sorry it was

1781
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:31,140
whichever is less but they took out the

1782
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:36,360
5,000 so so now it's just 3% 2% yeah or

1783
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:37,890
2% or whatever's left like it just

1784
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:41,809
they're just making it up somebody's

1785
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:45,090
like a lot of people were responding to

1786
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:47,100
this one added to premise this location

1787
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:48,960
that shipping containers not affixed to

1788
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:51,390
the land or not any are no longer

1789
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:53,550
permitted as a structure is not

1790
01:14:51,390 --> 01:14:54,810
considered a permanent structure modular

1791
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:57,239
buildings not affixed to the land

1792
01:14:54,810 --> 01:14:58,700
structures that rest on wheels or any

1793
01:14:57,239 --> 01:14:59,969
structure that can be readily moved

1794
01:14:58,699 --> 01:15:01,319
there was some

1795
01:14:59,970 --> 01:15:03,630
panic around this because they're like

1796
01:15:01,319 --> 01:15:05,579
oh my god all the pods but part of it is

1797
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:07,109
it has to do with that a-fixing nature

1798
01:15:05,579 --> 01:15:08,819
and when you read their statement of

1799
01:15:07,109 --> 01:15:10,259
reasons it just makes me laugh because

1800
01:15:08,819 --> 01:15:11,969
you know somebody's doing it when you

1801
01:15:10,260 --> 01:15:13,350
read it you're like they saw somebody do

1802
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:15,150
that with just people with trailers that

1803
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:16,650
are like moving stuff around and being

1804
01:15:15,149 --> 01:15:18,539
like now we're over here and now we're

1805
01:15:16,649 --> 01:15:20,819
gonna put it over here so their main

1806
01:15:18,539 --> 01:15:21,420
thing is like when you submit a premises

1807
01:15:20,819 --> 01:15:23,250
diagram

1808
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:27,199
those structures need to stay where they

1809
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:29,220
are you can't move them around so

1810
01:15:27,199 --> 01:15:30,090
there's a little more clarity around

1811
01:15:29,220 --> 01:15:33,510
pre-rolls

1812
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:35,100
that that you know it had said that they

1813
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:36,960
could do it now it's just a little more

1814
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:38,730
clear that the distributor can package

1815
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,619
repackage label and re label cannabis

1816
01:15:38,729 --> 01:15:42,299
including pre-rolls for retail sale as

1817
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,739
we were discussing there's more

1818
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:45,539
questions risen because you're like

1819
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:46,979
whose brand is it is it there Brett what

1820
01:15:45,539 --> 01:15:50,729
do you do what are you labeling it with

1821
01:15:46,979 --> 01:15:52,589
I have no idea but an important part in

1822
01:15:50,729 --> 01:15:55,889
the lights in the testing sequence to

1823
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:58,560
mark here is a licensed tribute can't

1824
01:15:55,890 --> 01:16:00,600
process it but can roll it if it you

1825
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:02,880
know has that and that they have to be

1826
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:08,940
rolled prior to the compliance testing

1827
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:11,130
so it's not yeah boo boo yeah because I

1828
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:13,289
mean I have really interesting questions

1829
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:15,119
on it because like when you sample when

1830
01:16:13,289 --> 01:16:16,680
you take a representative sample of free

1831
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:19,649
rolls out of multiple packets of

1832
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:23,159
pre-rolls you can't then repack those

1833
01:16:19,649 --> 01:16:25,229
packets into full carton so you're just

1834
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:30,500
destroying like all anyway it's it's a

1835
01:16:25,229 --> 01:16:30,500
lot of I suggested

1836
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:38,970
wouldn't you think wouldn't you imagine

1837
01:16:36,449 --> 01:16:41,639
that that would be the case but like as

1838
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:43,380
we've seen with some recall efforts and

1839
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:46,440
stuff like that is there concern is that

1840
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:47,909
people are getting stuff text tested and

1841
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:49,439
they're mixing it with other stuff and

1842
01:16:47,909 --> 01:16:53,010
then that final stuff is not clearing

1843
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:56,159
testing so I mean this is this is a ripe

1844
01:16:53,010 --> 01:17:00,720
area for comments it makes very little

1845
01:16:56,159 --> 01:17:03,930
sense that if a bulk cannabis bag passes

1846
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:12,090
the COA and then you roll it that then

1847
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:14,420
you gotta test it again that is I mean

1848
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:16,770
this is where Jenga is the big the

1849
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:18,359
clarity that needs to be had around that

1850
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:21,540
because while you're able to do that

1851
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:25,679
activity if you're a distributor who's

1852
01:17:21,539 --> 01:17:27,689
buying bulk flour and rolling it exactly

1853
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:29,039
whose brand are you releasing it as is

1854
01:17:27,689 --> 01:17:30,119
or you do in gumming because they're I

1855
01:17:29,039 --> 01:17:31,829
would imagine there's multiple

1856
01:17:30,119 --> 01:17:33,630
arrangements there some you might be

1857
01:17:31,829 --> 01:17:35,729
doing it for another existing brand some

1858
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:38,039
you might be doing it in-house and then

1859
01:17:35,729 --> 01:17:40,889
are they going to consider that crossing

1860
01:17:38,039 --> 01:17:42,869
into manufacturing it's like war that

1861
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:53,430
there's a lot of questions around this

1862
01:17:42,869 --> 01:17:55,470
yeah processors gathering stuff let's

1863
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:58,970
call it stuff yeah at the bottom of a

1864
01:17:55,470 --> 01:18:01,530
container or sifting it weak we not not

1865
01:17:58,970 --> 01:18:03,180
they're allowed to roll that but I don't

1866
01:18:01,529 --> 01:18:05,639
see where they can do

1867
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:07,920
more than that right if they grind it up

1868
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:10,350
and send it downrange to the distributor

1869
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:13,440
says he can't process but he can you

1870
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:15,870
take that crappy flour they sprinkle

1871
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:16,919
little keep on it me rolled up I'm just

1872
01:18:15,869 --> 01:18:19,859
trying to see what that line of

1873
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:22,170
manufacturing yeah no and especially if

1874
01:18:19,859 --> 01:18:24,479
you know there's the aspect of people

1875
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:27,949
doing infused fuels which is you know

1876
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:27,949
that that has to happen in the

1877
01:18:27,979 --> 01:18:59,879
clarifications we need yeah yeah yeah

1878
01:18:36,300 --> 01:19:02,760
yeah yeah right yeah yeah I mean

1879
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:04,529
honestly it's like it's it's you know

1880
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:06,390
the long story short is like California

1881
01:19:04,529 --> 01:19:08,219
jumped the shark on regulations and we

1882
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:09,660
made so many regulations and now they're

1883
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:11,070
learning more about the industry so they

1884
01:19:09,659 --> 01:19:12,300
have to make more regulations to cover

1885
01:19:11,069 --> 01:19:13,769
that part of the industry and it's

1886
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:16,320
getting down to every single activity

1887
01:19:13,770 --> 01:19:17,910
and as I said we're a wily bunch and

1888
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:20,759
we're gonna exploit every loophole there

1889
01:19:17,909 --> 01:19:22,769
possibly is to be able to stay alive so

1890
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:25,020
so it's constant it's like this game of

1891
01:19:22,770 --> 01:19:27,240
whack-a-mole where it's it's you know

1892
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:29,370
we're gonna see a lot of that I mean and

1893
01:19:27,239 --> 01:19:30,659
if I had a magic wand and could wave it

1894
01:19:29,369 --> 01:19:33,000
I would have said like can we start with

1895
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:34,769
four regulations that's like you know it

1896
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,750
protects testing taxes and public safety

1897
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:39,720
and just be like let's work from there

1898
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:41,460
and it'll be great but you know now we

1899
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:44,940
have this to contend with so it's a lot

1900
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:47,039
of yeah I mean that's a baby I mean I

1901
01:19:44,939 --> 01:19:50,159
remember I remember long ago going to

1902
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:51,569
test the the first like lice the first

1903
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:53,970
when they were testing out the online

1904
01:19:51,569 --> 01:19:55,769
licensing portal in their product

1905
01:19:53,970 --> 01:19:58,860
categories for cannabis was like five

1906
01:19:55,770 --> 01:20:00,630
things and you're just like you guys

1907
01:19:58,859 --> 01:20:02,460
have no idea do you like they didn't

1908
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:06,210
know there was no like they didn't know

1909
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:08,850
that I mean it the the maturity in the

1910
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:12,539
sophistication in the ingenuity of this

1911
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:13,860
industry is baffling to them of how many

1912
01:20:12,539 --> 01:20:15,899
applications there are and how many

1913
01:20:13,859 --> 01:20:16,809
things they've had to it you know

1914
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:18,579
inventive

1915
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:20,140
what do you do with you know what do you

1916
01:20:18,579 --> 01:20:21,430
do with a breath strip like what do you

1917
01:20:20,140 --> 01:20:23,230
do is a tincture that goes under your

1918
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:26,159
tongue and it's a capsule there that

1919
01:20:23,229 --> 01:20:31,689
they didn't know that we had huh

1920
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:33,849
yes exactly we don't want it there there

1921
01:20:31,689 --> 01:20:35,769
was a big you know this will help a lot

1922
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:37,780
in testing is that you know there was

1923
01:20:35,770 --> 01:20:39,790
there was the issue of you know people

1924
01:20:37,779 --> 01:20:41,319
of sampling you know the lab shopping

1925
01:20:39,789 --> 01:20:43,000
that they want to not happen where you

1926
01:20:41,319 --> 01:20:44,439
can't send samples in multiple labs at

1927
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,899
the same time and take the results that

1928
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:50,379
you like but then we had the problem of

1929
01:20:46,899 --> 01:20:52,479
what happens when a lab goes down or if

1930
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:55,659
a lab loses their license or if the labs

1931
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:57,639
a really expensive machinery breaks and

1932
01:20:55,659 --> 01:20:59,199
then your products are stuck in this

1933
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:01,869
laboratory pipeline and there was no

1934
01:20:59,199 --> 01:21:04,329
mechanism for labs to transfer that

1935
01:21:01,869 --> 01:21:07,510
product to another lab for testing or

1936
01:21:04,329 --> 01:21:10,300
for you to be able to have another batch

1937
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:13,659
sampled so they've corrected that I know

1938
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:16,090
the big ask from the testing community

1939
01:21:13,659 --> 01:21:18,819
again for these regulations is going to

1940
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:21,190
be about Co a remediation because right

1941
01:21:18,819 --> 01:21:23,739
now if there's a typo if they got the

1942
01:21:21,189 --> 01:21:25,179
name wrong if anything happens the

1943
01:21:23,739 --> 01:21:26,889
agency is like you can't fix it you

1944
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:28,329
can't talk about it it's no good so even

1945
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:30,160
if you submit something and they can't

1946
01:21:28,329 --> 01:21:32,019
read your handwriting because of the

1947
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:34,449
prohibition on communicating with you

1948
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:36,640
with that once that process has started

1949
01:21:34,449 --> 01:21:38,590
they can't even be like what is this say

1950
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:42,510
like what did you write down here so

1951
01:21:38,590 --> 01:21:44,619
it's a some of that will get cleaned up

1952

01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:20,079

1968
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:28,900
these these this PowerPoint and then I'm

1969
01:22:27,159 --> 01:22:30,368
gonna try to create a hot list of just

1970
01:22:28,899 --> 01:22:33,488
like again these are

1971
01:22:30,368 --> 01:22:36,069
main things that I would go after it's

1972
01:22:33,488 --> 01:22:38,558
it's a real great time to team up and

1973
01:22:36,069 --> 01:22:40,988
and work collectively to draft these

1974
01:22:38,559 --> 01:22:44,760
statements letter it's it's it's great

1975
01:22:40,988 --> 01:22:47,438
for to have a whole lot of individuals

1976
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:49,659
submitting feedback it's great to pair

1977
01:22:47,439 --> 01:22:51,489
up and have these NASCAR letters of get

1978
01:22:49,658 --> 01:22:54,398
every cultivator you know every

1979
01:22:51,488 --> 01:22:56,948
dispensary you know to tag on and create

1980
01:22:54,399 --> 01:23:00,389
group statements but it's incredibly

1981
01:22:56,948 --> 01:23:03,069
important that the agencies know that

1982
01:23:00,389 --> 01:23:05,378
we're we're seeing this we're reading

1983
01:23:03,069 --> 01:23:07,299
this and the real-life impact that it

1984
01:23:05,378 --> 01:23:09,550
has on your business because those are

1985
01:23:07,300 --> 01:23:12,878
sometimes the most compelling things for

1986
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:16,029
them is when you explain what the

1987
01:23:12,878 --> 01:23:19,029
problem is and how this how this you

1988
01:23:16,029 --> 01:23:21,668
know harms your business or your ability

1989
01:23:19,029 --> 01:23:23,109
to function in this thing when you're

1990
01:23:21,668 --> 01:23:24,849
commenting always remember to comment to

1991
01:23:23,109 --> 01:23:26,438
the right agency if you're a micro

1992
01:23:24,849 --> 01:23:28,239
business don't send your cultivation

1993
01:23:26,439 --> 01:23:32,079
issues to the BCC they do not forward

1994
01:23:28,238 --> 01:23:34,628
they don't send it on that you make sure

1995
01:23:32,078 --> 01:23:36,728
that you're aligning the regulation with

1996
01:23:34,628 --> 01:23:39,908
the agency that issued it and that is

1997
01:23:36,729 --> 01:23:44,340
who you're commenting to I think I'm

1998
01:23:39,908 --> 01:23:44,339
done I think that's it yeah yeah

1999
01:23:51,328 --> 01:24:00,279
that increasingly creates a backdrop of

2000
01:23:53,679 --> 01:24:05,289
increasingly 87 or something very close

2001
01:24:00,279 --> 01:24:08,198
to that so the question is you can post

2002
01:24:05,289 --> 01:24:10,809
this on the licensees and that's great

2003
01:24:08,198 --> 01:24:14,879
but what happens on the other side I

2004
01:24:10,809 --> 01:24:14,880
mean there has to be enforcement yeah

2005
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,139
yeah I mean one of the things that it's

2006
01:24:18,488 --> 01:24:22,808
important to clarify is that the

2007
01:24:20,139 --> 01:24:25,300
regulatory authority of the agencies is

2008
01:24:22,809 --> 01:24:27,579
over licensed operators that's who they

2009
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:29,559
regulate that's who they enforce upon in

2010
01:24:27,578 --> 01:24:31,509
terms of an unlicensed operator that's

2011
01:24:29,559 --> 01:24:34,210
an illegal activity at this point so it

2012
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:36,159
is on the local law enforcement working

2013
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:38,078
with local law enforcement in the local

2014
01:24:36,158 --> 01:24:43,049
agencies to kind of work on those

2015
01:24:38,078 --> 01:24:43,049
aspects you have

2016
01:24:52,340 --> 01:25:02,329
language yeah there's an interesting

2017
01:24:59,779 --> 01:25:03,889
language shift that reminds me of it I

2018
01:25:02,329 --> 01:25:06,590
had it in there the importance of a

2019
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:08,750
single word we're in one of the sections

2020
01:25:06,590 --> 01:25:10,279
that used to say the formation documents

2021
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:12,380
and now it says all formation documents

2022
01:25:10,279 --> 01:25:14,119
where it's like where they just slip

2023
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:16,909
that in there like they don't want a

2024
01:25:14,119 --> 01:25:18,609
single contract side deal something

2025
01:25:16,909 --> 01:25:21,380
that's related to that business not

2026
01:25:18,609 --> 01:25:23,329
submitted and and again I know it's

2027
01:25:21,380 --> 01:25:27,109
ridiculous and I know lawyers are

2028
01:25:23,329 --> 01:25:30,109
expensive but like this is a critical

2029
01:25:27,109 --> 01:25:31,939
time to be looking at having good

2030
01:25:30,109 --> 01:25:34,369
contracts with people having good

2031
01:25:31,939 --> 01:25:36,349
distribution contracts good testing

2032
01:25:34,369 --> 01:25:37,729
contracts because the question is going

2033
01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:39,680
to be what happens when something goes

2034
01:25:37,729 --> 01:25:41,779
wrong like the question of is that the

2035
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:43,520
retailers whose problem is that that

2036
01:25:41,779 --> 01:25:44,960
would be something you can note you

2037
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:47,840
should negotiate in a distribution

2038
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:50,359
contract to say if the BCC comes and you

2039
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:52,880
delivered me non-compliant product guess

2040
01:25:50,359 --> 01:25:54,409
who's gonna pay my bill you are you know

2041
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:56,810
that those are the things that can be

2042
01:25:54,409 --> 01:25:58,039
negotiated obviously for a smaller

2043
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:59,510
operator it's tough because you don't

2044
01:25:58,039 --> 01:26:02,060
have a lot of power to be like darn you

2045
01:25:59,510 --> 01:26:03,650
I'm want this but you're gonna want to

2046
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:05,600
negotiate those good contracts because

2047
01:26:03,649 --> 01:26:10,009
one of my big fears is what's going to

2048
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:12,380
happen next year when they start levying

2049
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:15,440
penalties and fees and that you don't

2050
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:18,079
see the cannabis industry cannibalize

2051
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:20,359
itself in lawsuits because everybody's

2052
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:21,800
going to be blaming everybody else for

2053
01:26:20,359 --> 01:26:23,359
what they did and no this is wrong and

2054
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:25,789
this is your fault and whatever and

2055
01:26:23,359 --> 01:26:28,789
that's the stuff that can be clarified

2056
01:26:25,789 --> 01:26:31,899
through that those contract processes up

2057
01:26:28,789 --> 01:26:31,899
front yeah

2058
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:49,550
um I mean it's an interesting if I

2059
01:26:46,670 --> 01:26:51,619
convinces its own like wormhole you can

2060
01:26:49,550 --> 01:26:53,960
go down they did make an exception for

2061
01:26:51,619 --> 01:26:55,939
kind of educational events that was put

2062
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:57,680
in that don't require a license when

2063
01:26:55,939 --> 01:27:00,349
there is no consumption there's no

2064
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:01,850
retail sales there those aspects this

2065
01:27:00,350 --> 01:27:04,520
seems to be an allowance for that to

2066
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:06,650
happen and then I mean in some of the

2067
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:09,410
rules around some of the events that do

2068
01:27:06,649 --> 01:27:11,779
have consumption in retail are I mean

2069
01:27:09,409 --> 01:27:13,849
how anybody's ever gonna my favorite one

2070
01:27:11,779 --> 01:27:15,889
in there is that every bit of product

2071
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:18,079
that comes in on the transport that is

2072
01:27:15,890 --> 01:27:20,600
transported by a distributor is supposed

2073
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:22,609
to be physically checked by the event

2074
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:25,430
organiser licensee before it comes on

2075
01:27:22,609 --> 01:27:27,170
premises so load in for high times is

2076
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:28,909
going to be like a week ahead of advance

2077
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:30,739
yet you can only get a permit for four

2078
01:27:28,909 --> 01:27:32,809
days there's something so it's gonna be

2079
01:27:30,739 --> 01:27:34,760
a little rough like a compliant we

2080
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:45,830
bringing product on site when those

2081
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:47,720
those aspects are so onerous I mean that

2082
01:27:45,829 --> 01:27:49,670
kind of gets into an interesting terrain

2083
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:50,539
of like yes there's a way I mean and

2084
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:52,579
that's the other thing too I mean the

2085
01:27:50,539 --> 01:27:54,199
things did a lot of people panic about

2086
01:27:52,579 --> 01:27:56,809
in these regulations when you talk to

2087
01:27:54,199 --> 01:27:59,210
the lawyers they're like yeah because it

2088
01:27:56,810 --> 01:28:01,789
cuz again for them it's just a matter of

2089
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:03,590
I mean that's what we do all day long is

2090
01:28:01,789 --> 01:28:05,239
just going like this is what we want to

2091
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:07,430
do and here's you know here's the

2092
01:28:05,239 --> 01:28:10,899
winding route to get there and making

2093
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:10,900
sure you're covered yeah

2094
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:22,859
when I asked Lori about remediation when

2095
01:28:20,369 --> 01:28:24,569
you know the testing labs wrong my guys

2096
01:28:22,859 --> 01:28:26,639
are doing informational testing online

2097
01:28:24,569 --> 01:28:29,939
we know it's clean the testing lab -

2098
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:47,610
surveillance wait a second I don't know

2099
01:28:29,939 --> 01:28:50,309
that I'm clear yeah uh I mean there are

2100
01:28:47,609 --> 01:28:53,939
a lot of conversations about that it's

2101
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:55,580
uh I mean part of the issue again is

2102
01:28:53,939 --> 01:28:58,049
it's always like with with any

2103
01:28:55,579 --> 01:28:59,880
regulation you know my motto is always

2104
01:28:58,050 --> 01:29:01,350
like follow the money follow the fear

2105
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:03,539
you know where you're like who's paying

2106
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:05,760
for it and what are they afraid of so I

2107
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:07,350
mean one of the issues with testing and

2108
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:10,680
in the labs are super frustrated about

2109
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:12,090
this as well some of them is because the

2110
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:14,640
thing that they want to prevent through

2111
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:16,409
these aspects is lab shopping they don't

2112
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:21,539
want you you know shopping around to get

2113
01:29:16,409 --> 01:29:24,539
the results that you want but but one of

2114
01:29:21,539 --> 01:29:26,159
the issues with like say a really really

2115
01:29:24,539 --> 01:29:27,390
effective lab with really really

2116
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:29,519
sensitive equipment who's doing an

2117
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:31,050
amazing job is there's gonna be inherent

2118
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:33,690
lab shopping because if there's this

2119
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:35,579
threshold and you're you're you know

2120
01:29:33,689 --> 01:29:37,109
solvent or whatever is gonna be detected

2121
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:38,850
at this lab but it's not gonna be

2122
01:29:37,109 --> 01:29:41,579
detected to this lab because their

2123
01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:42,930
equipment isn't as sensitive that lab

2124
01:29:41,579 --> 01:29:44,609
shopping will become inherent because

2125
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:47,010
and then you'll have people gravitating

2126
01:29:44,609 --> 01:29:48,839
towards crappier labs because they're

2127
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:51,630
not gonna see the things that maybe

2128
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:54,960
you're there so you know some of that

2129
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:58,140
the increasing of the thresholds I mean

2130
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:59,310
a lot of labs I mean one of the issues

2131
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:01,560
that we're up against is looking at

2132
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:03,480
phase 3 testing coming in and not even

2133
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:05,220
knowing is anything gonna pass you know

2134
01:30:03,479 --> 01:30:07,109
once heavy metals come into the effect

2135
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:08,850
it will come into effect because this is

2136
01:30:07,109 --> 01:30:10,829
the part where we're gonna discover like

2137
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:12,570
what are your devices leaching what is

2138
01:30:10,829 --> 01:30:14,369
your packaging doing to your product

2139
01:30:12,569 --> 01:30:15,809
what are giant metal machines that

2140
01:30:14,369 --> 01:30:18,779
extract your product putting into your

2141
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:21,930
products you know that and in that if we

2142
01:30:18,779 --> 01:30:24,359
were you know again my pie-in-the-sky

2143
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:26,550
fantasies I would love to see the state

2144
01:30:24,359 --> 01:30:28,979
subsidizing and funding testing labs to

2145
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:31,170
be doing phase 3 testing right now so we

2146
01:30:28,979 --> 01:30:34,618
would collect the data to know what is

2147
01:30:31,170 --> 01:30:36,300
gonna happen when January 1 hits in in

2148
01:30:34,618 --> 01:30:37,889
and then we would love to have a counter

2149
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:39,150
thing that was like and while we're at

2150
01:30:37,889 --> 01:30:41,010
it let's look at the amount of heavy

2151
01:30:39,149 --> 01:30:55,349
metals in a banana you know it's like

2152
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:57,929
we're like what are we up against no

2153
01:30:55,350 --> 01:31:11,730
matter what the state requires you if

2154
01:30:57,929 --> 01:31:28,380
you can rule you have cartridges from

2155
01:31:11,729 --> 01:31:30,779
China kept each out in real time and

2156
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:32,310
that's one of my big concerns for the

2157
01:31:30,779 --> 01:31:35,609
industry itself because there was not

2158
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:37,760
long ago there was a law office holding

2159
01:31:35,609 --> 01:31:39,839
a continuing learning class for

2160
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:42,060
attorneys on how to see the cannabis

2161
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:44,190
industry and it was a very long list

2162
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:47,340
from things like from product liability

2163
01:31:44,189 --> 01:31:48,928
to DRAM laws to you know that they're

2164
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:50,969
gonna come after the budtender who

2165
01:31:48,929 --> 01:31:53,908
served the person the cannabis that got

2166
01:31:50,969 --> 01:31:57,539
them in an accident before so I mean

2167
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:59,638
this is most of my daily concern for the

2168
01:31:57,539 --> 01:32:01,408
industry is not against enforcement from

2169
01:31:59,639 --> 01:32:03,600
the agencies it's against enforcement

2170
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:05,789
from litigiousness crazy people out

2171
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:08,489
there like the prop 65 lawsuits that

2172
01:32:05,789 --> 01:32:10,469
that are that are that we just now that

2173
01:32:08,488 --> 01:32:13,529
we're out in the open there's a target

2174
01:32:10,469 --> 01:32:16,500
painted on us and and and protecting

2175
01:32:13,529 --> 01:32:19,019
yourself from that is is ridiculous I

2176
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:20,908
mean and in and it's a really hard time

2177
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:22,560
right now and that's as much as so many

2178
01:32:20,908 --> 01:32:24,000
people to industry feel like there's

2179
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:26,100
just all the lawyers trying to take

2180
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,618
their money it's like this this is

2181
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:30,719
survival you know and it's if you're

2182
01:32:28,618 --> 01:32:34,139
gonna survive through this incredibly

2183
01:32:30,719 --> 01:32:35,520
difficult transition and then I boot I

2184
01:32:34,139 --> 01:32:37,230
do believe that there are greener

2185
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:38,159
pastures on the other side once this

2186
01:32:37,229 --> 01:32:40,319
settles

2187
01:32:38,158 --> 01:32:42,238
and if you can make it through this I

2188
01:32:40,319 --> 01:32:44,788
always described it as the violent J

2189
01:32:42,238 --> 01:32:47,728
curve you know we're in this free fall

2190
01:32:44,788 --> 01:32:50,368
horrible graph just plummeting down and

2191
01:32:47,729 --> 01:32:52,999
then like a phoenix a few will rise you

2192
01:32:50,368 --> 01:32:56,759
know from the ashes who can like

2193
01:32:52,998 --> 01:32:59,510
withstand all these all the demands

2194
01:32:56,760 --> 01:32:59,510
being put upon us

2195
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:23,239
we are a technology firm and we in that

2196
01:33:20,270 --> 01:33:26,450
processing equipment for the industry we

2197
01:33:23,238 --> 01:33:29,589
bust out we then have to change our

2198
01:33:26,449 --> 01:33:29,590
business model

2199
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:46,380
[Music]

2200
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:57,490
yeah we did we didn't cover that before

2201
01:33:56,229 --> 01:33:59,559
and I can have like an offline

2202
01:33:57,489 --> 01:34:01,090
conversation with you about that of just

2203
01:33:59,560 --> 01:34:03,100
but I do think that that's one of the

2204
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:05,020
ones where you know as soon as that

2205
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:07,030
white labeling piece dropped I could

2206
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:08,860
hear like the whirring brains of

2207
01:34:07,029 --> 01:34:11,409
attorneys everywhere being like we're

2208
01:34:08,859 --> 01:34:12,429
gonna do this we're gonna and in part of

2209
01:34:11,409 --> 01:34:14,289
it we were talking about is

2210
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:16,180
understanding the source of what they're

2211
01:34:14,289 --> 01:34:17,859
after and part of it is they want to

2212
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:19,119
know who's behind these companies where

2213
01:34:17,859 --> 01:34:20,109
is the money coming from who is

2214
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:22,689
disclosed who are the financial

2215
01:34:20,109 --> 01:34:24,729
interested parties and bring them into

2216
01:34:22,689 --> 01:34:26,710
the gap so so part of the work that

2217
01:34:24,729 --> 01:34:29,529
we're gonna have to do in this comment

2218
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:30,850
period and and with the agency is is

2219
01:34:29,529 --> 01:34:32,259
clarifying giving them the information

2220
01:34:30,850 --> 01:34:34,120
they need and what do they need to see

2221
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:35,650
about this business arrangement to make

2222
01:34:34,119 --> 01:34:38,019
them comfortable to know that it's

2223
01:34:35,649 --> 01:34:39,909
happening to know who's involved because

2224
01:34:38,020 --> 01:34:41,620
it does seem ridiculous that you know

2225
01:34:39,909 --> 01:34:42,789
because then you do I mean that's what

2226
01:34:41,619 --> 01:34:45,099
everybody's thought is is then you'd

2227
01:34:42,789 --> 01:34:47,079
like is the nutrient guy and the you

2228
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:48,900
know light supplier and the equipment

2229
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:51,340
supplier and the POS company

2230
01:34:48,899 --> 01:34:52,869
incorporated in this and part of that is

2231
01:34:51,340 --> 01:34:54,699
that it's sloppy language and it's not

2232
01:34:52,869 --> 01:34:57,010
finessed and it's not clarified enough

2233
01:34:54,699 --> 01:35:04,000
right now to know who is truly

2234
01:34:57,010 --> 01:35:06,699
incorporated in this I mean I would say

2235
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:09,220
talk to your lawyer cuz I mean when I

2236
01:35:06,699 --> 01:35:11,769
talk to the lawyers they're like it's

2237
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:15,220
fine like well we got this you know so

2238
01:35:11,770 --> 01:35:16,870
but it but it requires navigation and

2239
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:18,280
there's no way to know in this second

2240
01:35:16,869 --> 01:35:19,779
because these regulations aren't

2241
01:35:18,279 --> 01:35:21,969
finalized and they're not and they're

2242
01:35:19,779 --> 01:35:24,069
not established and so that's the

2243
01:35:21,970 --> 01:35:27,890
clarity that has to be asked for from

2244
01:35:24,069 --> 01:35:31,549
the agency yeah

2245
01:35:27,890 --> 01:35:36,590
we do notice that in the BCP regulations

2246
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:36,590
5425 yes

2247
01:35:43,868 --> 01:35:51,969
that is a potential problem because it

2248
01:35:47,729 --> 01:35:54,669
gave instructions on consumer data yeah

2249
01:35:51,969 --> 01:35:56,139
that will one per keeping and super

2250
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:58,630
recalls how are you gonna reach a

2251
01:35:56,139 --> 01:36:00,730
customer if you're not yeah preserving

2252
01:35:58,630 --> 01:36:03,310
that data but really believing is the

2253
01:36:00,729 --> 01:36:07,289
issue and the language

2254
01:36:03,310 --> 01:36:07,289
it's removed from the defense

2255
01:36:07,578 --> 01:36:14,359
I I think I mean I've run into a couple

2256
01:36:12,229 --> 01:36:15,678
of missing sections where I'm like

2257
01:36:14,359 --> 01:36:18,529
you're referencing something that

2258
01:36:15,679 --> 01:36:21,078
doesn't exist so I think that my guess

2259
01:36:18,529 --> 01:36:23,210
is that because it seems to be referring

2260
01:36:21,078 --> 01:36:25,340
back to record-keeping and that the

2261
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:28,578
record-keeping part isn't there yet

2262
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:30,230
so that's like where we're gonna you

2263
01:36:28,578 --> 01:36:31,549
know that yes I think it'll come back

2264
01:36:30,229 --> 01:36:33,828
because there was something I pointed

2265
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:36,949
out to them previously because there was

2266
01:36:33,828 --> 01:36:38,479
those extensive directions of what to do

2267
01:36:36,948 --> 01:36:39,710
if it was a medicinal sale but they

2268
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:41,689
didn't have any record keeping

2269
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:43,520
requirements for an adulterer sale and

2270
01:36:41,689 --> 01:36:44,868
then they expanded it to both and then

2271
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,150
they took the whole thing out so I think

2272
01:36:44,868 --> 01:36:50,049
they're having some you know evidently

2273
01:36:47,149 --> 01:36:52,328
they're spitballing fuckwit there

2274
01:36:50,050 --> 01:36:57,199
there's definitely another draft coming

2275
01:36:52,328 --> 01:37:10,609
no maybe I mean we're like tick-tock

2276
01:36:57,198 --> 01:37:14,109
what's up yeah yeah cuz they'll be like

2277
01:37:10,609 --> 01:37:14,109
it was already there you knew about it

2278
01:37:18,289 --> 01:37:25,220
when they were burnt if they took it

2279
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:28,780
after they've been changed or which

2280
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:32,449
partners have to be less stage between

2281
01:37:28,779 --> 01:37:38,050
that's the least submitted to hug and

2282
01:37:32,449 --> 01:37:38,050
the release of the whale last December

2283
01:37:45,319 --> 01:37:55,618
yeah don't ol you see those final

2284
01:37:50,338 --> 01:37:57,118
regulations yeah yeah and that's a

2285
01:37:55,618 --> 01:37:59,038
difficult place to be as a business to

2286
01:37:57,118 --> 01:38:01,018
be like don't make any decisions order

2287
01:37:59,038 --> 01:38:03,688
any packaging or do anything until they

2288
01:38:01,019 --> 01:38:06,479
come out but but I would encourage you

2289
01:38:03,689 --> 01:38:08,010
like please reach out to you know your

2290
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:10,469
communities your the people who you

2291
01:38:08,010 --> 01:38:13,019
brainstorm with me our agency other

2292
01:38:10,469 --> 01:38:15,689
agencies anybody because this is just

2293
01:38:13,019 --> 01:38:18,719
it's a really trepidatious time it's

2294
01:38:15,689 --> 01:38:20,459
rough this isn't even this is not even

2295
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:22,439
half of it of the changes that are in

2296
01:38:20,458 --> 01:38:24,208
there this is all I could fit into this

2297
01:38:22,439 --> 01:38:26,999
amount of time there are more little

2298
01:38:24,208 --> 01:38:30,719
beautiful explosive nuggets dropped into

2299
01:38:26,998 --> 01:38:32,458
those regulations so so I mean I implore

2300
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:35,368
you to please like sit down with people

2301
01:38:32,458 --> 01:38:37,198
have a little study group and go through

2302
01:38:35,368 --> 01:38:40,549
the ones incredibly specifically that

2303
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:43,618
pertain exactly to your business type oh

2304
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:45,869
yeah and we are there is a discussion

2305
01:38:43,618 --> 01:38:48,328
tomorrow night a future cannabis project

2306
01:38:45,868 --> 01:38:51,509
is hosting like the next wave of this

2307
01:38:48,328 --> 01:38:54,328
discussion with Jackie and Pamela and

2308
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:56,699
hopefully me I'm we're gonna do it and

2309
01:38:54,328 --> 01:38:58,078
elected officials might be there so we

2310
01:38:56,698 --> 01:38:59,518
can just continue this conversation

2311
01:38:58,078 --> 01:39:02,488
because I also think this is the way we

2312
01:38:59,519 --> 01:39:04,619
get to solutions is by talking through

2313
01:39:02,488 --> 01:39:07,049
this and going through the scenarios and

2314
01:39:04,618 --> 01:39:09,868
seeing like that all the other impacted

2315
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:13,109
things that one change might trigger so

2316
01:39:09,868 --> 01:39:16,469
it's in Venice at the townhouse and the

2317
01:39:13,109 --> 01:39:18,659
basement speakeasy it's great it's gonna

2318
01:39:16,469 --> 01:39:21,569
be awesome the informations on future

2319
01:39:18,658 --> 01:39:24,978
canvas project just could go get all the

2320
01:39:21,569 --> 01:39:24,978
information you can get yes

2321
01:39:31,329 --> 01:39:34,729
yeah that's one things that we were

2322
01:39:33,470 --> 01:39:38,030
talking about earlier is I think we

2323
01:39:34,729 --> 01:39:40,579
might see Jarrett but but we've talked

2324
01:39:38,029 --> 01:39:42,380
about like there is a beer brand or wine

2325
01:39:40,579 --> 01:39:44,779
broker license there's models and the

2326
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:47,810
liquor of industries in the spirits

2327
01:39:44,779 --> 01:39:50,960
industries for just having an agent card

2328
01:39:47,810 --> 01:39:52,730
a broker license registering as a brand

2329
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:54,050
so that you'll give those disclosures of

2330
01:39:52,729 --> 01:39:56,479
who you are and your background

2331
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:58,699
information but you but you don't

2332
01:39:56,479 --> 01:39:59,689
necessarily I mean they make it sound so

2333
01:39:58,699 --> 01:40:01,159
easy where it's like you want to

2334
01:39:59,689 --> 01:40:05,329
participate go get a license and you're

2335
01:40:01,159 --> 01:40:06,889
like great yeah um the other thing I'll

2336
01:40:05,329 --> 01:40:08,390
say I'm probably gonna do a whole

2337
01:40:06,890 --> 01:40:12,260
separate piece on this later but this is

2338
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:14,329
my like cause of the day um the type s

2339
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:16,970
license shared facility licenses was

2340
01:40:14,329 --> 01:40:19,390
invented six months ago to date guess

2341
01:40:16,970 --> 01:40:22,760
how many Type S licenses there are zero

2342
01:40:19,390 --> 01:40:24,619
never happened there is a there is a

2343
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:26,060
pathway for small businesses which is

2344
01:40:24,619 --> 01:40:28,250
called a shared facility there's a

2345
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:31,280
pathway for the air B&amp;B of cannabis it's

2346
01:40:28,250 --> 01:40:32,720
called shared facilities and none of it

2347
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:34,609
has happened and part of it is it needs

2348
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:37,010
action on the local level for them to

2349
01:40:34,609 --> 01:40:38,719
understand how to authorize it on the

2350
01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:40,579
operational level to understand how to

2351
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:42,560
make your facility compliant as a Type S

2352
01:40:40,579 --> 01:40:43,909
it has the state level where they are

2353
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,050
receptive and they're ready they just

2354
01:40:43,909 --> 01:40:47,359
like are like we need the local

2355
01:40:45,050 --> 01:40:49,190
authorization and it was one of the

2356
01:40:47,359 --> 01:40:51,199
dreams of like this is how small

2357
01:40:49,189 --> 01:40:53,479
businesses can actually get licensed in

2358
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:55,309
function by registering with a type s

2359
01:40:53,479 --> 01:40:57,949
license type which would give you a

2360
01:40:55,310 --> 01:41:00,289
license as a shared facility participant

2361
01:40:57,949 --> 01:41:02,210
and that's a process we're working on

2362
01:41:00,289 --> 01:41:04,159
building play playbook for that to help

2363
01:41:02,210 --> 01:41:07,850
push that through but I do see that as

2364
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:09,920
an inroad to help with people getting to

2365
01:41:07,850 --> 01:41:12,470
this pathway and licensure through

2366
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:13,880
shared facilities and it just isn't

2367
01:41:12,470 --> 01:41:15,619
happening it's crazy I just went to look

2368
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:18,880
into it the other day and talked to DPH

2369
01:41:15,619 --> 01:41:18,880
and they're like you know there's none

2370
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:34,149
yeah I'm sure they did yeah I mean we

2371
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:36,100
didn't talk about it here but I know in

2372
01:41:34,149 --> 01:41:38,219
terms of the comments that was a great

2373
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:40,630
deal of concern people have in terms of

2374
01:41:38,220 --> 01:41:43,710
what's being disclosed about you and

2375
01:41:40,630 --> 01:42:02,680
we're people knowing where you live look

2376
01:41:43,710 --> 01:42:08,140
go ahead there's like a whole other

2377
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:10,289
thing the CBD market there like the out

2378
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:14,289
there market is kind of a spectacular

2379
01:42:10,289 --> 01:42:17,590
wonderful insane thing of none of its

2380
01:42:14,289 --> 01:42:19,239
okay none of that's okay it's like the

2381
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:21,909
greatest example of just cuz everybody's

2382
01:42:19,239 --> 01:42:24,819
doing it doesn't mean it's alright the

2383
01:42:21,909 --> 01:42:26,349
state is being very clear about those

2384
01:42:24,819 --> 01:42:28,449
but it is kind of like a whole separate

2385
01:42:26,350 --> 01:42:40,720
conversation of like outside of the

2386
01:42:28,449 --> 01:42:42,819
scope of this I mean anyway I would say

2387
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:45,159
it gives me great concern when once

2388
01:42:42,819 --> 01:42:47,109
Big Pharma has a stated interest in

2389
01:42:45,159 --> 01:42:48,670
controlling the CBD market I would be

2390
01:42:47,109 --> 01:42:52,679
quaking in my boots a little bit if I'm

2391
01:42:48,670 --> 01:42:52,680
just like I'm great I'm doing CBD

2392
01:43:01,369 --> 01:43:06,739
so if once those laws if they go into

2393
01:43:04,310 --> 01:43:08,660
effect they will have conflict with

2394
01:43:06,739 --> 01:43:17,630
state laws again which is something

2395
01:43:08,659 --> 01:43:19,639
we're already in the middle of yeah well

2396
01:43:17,630 --> 01:43:21,619
I mean California is its own world and

2397
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:23,329
that is a side conversation but I mean I

2398
01:43:21,619 --> 01:43:24,859
would also look into the fact that the

2399
01:43:23,329 --> 01:43:27,319
state just issued pretty clear guidance

2400
01:43:24,859 --> 01:43:30,789
on CBD and the DCR just asked everybody

2401
01:43:27,319 --> 01:43:34,779
to register for a fee TRC to self CVD

2402
01:43:30,789 --> 01:43:37,159
like that doesn't make sense

2403
01:43:34,779 --> 01:43:41,649
so thank you guys we have to cut it off

2404
01:43:37,159 --> 01:43:41,649
we've call me okay we'll talk we'll talk

2405
01:43:45,439 --> 01:43:53,419
