1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,080
all right well we're here with lindsay

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,600
from aloha humboldt and uh we're gonna

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,759
be talking with her today about her farm

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:09,519
what makes her flowers unique hi lindsay

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,519
hi russell how's it going it's going

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,679
really good excellent glad to hear it um

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,160
so maybe tell us a little bit about your

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,560
background and how you got into cannabis

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,160
at first what how did that start

10
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:24,879
um i got into cannabis when i was 16.

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,439
it was a great way to break the ice

12
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:29,678
growing up in southwest michigan we had

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,238
a lot of great cultivars some that we

14
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:34,320
still run bubblegum was one of the first

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,640
oh yeah that's a classic but i was able

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,439
to see when i was 16

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,000
and i was really just in love with the

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,759
plant right from a young age that's

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,799
amazing and then so you came out to

20
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:50,079
humble started aloha humble

21
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:51,198
and kind of started more indoors

22
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,439
so

23
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,039
ryan and i moved in

24
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:56,000
2002

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,399
and

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,480
we were in arcata for a year

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,840
and we did like

28
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:06,959
six octagons in a basement and

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,760
uh maxed out the bedrooms upstairs and

30
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,158
then

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,040
you know classic humble grow

32
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,200
in 2002 then we moved to uh another spot

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,680
that had a basement in eureka

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,320
and then in 2008 we moved to willow

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,640
creek nice yes you guys have been almost

36
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,399
20 years 20 years and you've been in

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,400
willow creek now for

38
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,478
since 2008 so yeah that's 14 just about

39
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,320
just about that's quite baker's dozen

40
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,879
yeah so you've been doing out you know

41
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:39,438
learning how that environment works for

42
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:40,719
a while now yeah um in 2008 uh we put

43
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,279
out like

44
00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:44,478
the 99 that we were allowed underneath

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,799
215

46
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:50,399
but we had smaller pots so it was like

47
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,320
45 gallons and then we sized up to 100

48
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,719
gallons smart pots

49
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,959
and then transitioned into having some

50
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,039
beds and greenhouses and started doing

51
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:01,199
depth we kind of held back on doing

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,360
light up because it meant that you

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,640
didn't get to go to the river as much

54
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,599
because you had to be at home in the

55
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,239
evening

56
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:09,118
um so we were in the valley close to the

57
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,759
river

58
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,598
and so the climate was really

59
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,479
drastically different from where we're

60
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:17,839
at now um so then we got the property in

61
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,679
2016

62
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,319
anticipating um the rack market we knew

63
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,560
that we wouldn't be able to afford um

64
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:29,919
agricultural land so we just went for

65
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,159
whatever we could get which was a 141

66
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,439
acre parcel of tpz land that we

67
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,919
converted

68
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,800
and i did a bunch of remediation on and

69
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:41,359
and we're at 2600 feet now interesting

70
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,599
2600 feet elevation yeah so that's

71
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,080
pretty high so i mean transitioning into

72
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,439
that i mean what makes so that your farm

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,120
is pretty unique because you've

74
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:50,959
developed it it was tp zlan you've

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,319
obviously like done a lot

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,280
of work

77
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,958
with just ecological repair

78
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,840
a lot a lot of work with ecological

79
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,080
repair so the farm has been was

80
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,959
cultivated on since the 80s

81
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,200
and it was kind of just like um

82
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,719
they put in the different flats when

83
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,399
they were doing the logging so they were

84
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:14,479
logging uh flats and then um there were

85
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,959
old school dugout greenhouses that were

86
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,598
put out oh wild because um they're a lot

87
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,759
easier to be hidden from the helicopters

88
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,238
yeah so really low profile

89
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,639
um easy to pull tarps terrible for

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,799
canopy um

91
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,878
but the ones we have

92
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,360
we have like 11 different cultivation

93
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:35,439
zones on our property so instead of

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,680
having just one big flat where we have

95
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,079
greenhouses we actually have

96
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,560
you know six different areas that are

97
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,519
then pieced out and our lower flat we

98
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,840
did

99
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,120
three greenhouse removals and fixed a

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,759
rock slide

101
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,158
and did a lot of environmental cleanup

102
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,438
down there wow interesting that's really

103
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:54,719
interesting do you feel like in your

104
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:56,479
farm you've

105
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,799
uh incorporated any interesting

106
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,878
methodologies you know that would you

107
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,560
know intend to have your give your

108
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,719
flower some type of interesting

109
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,360
definitely quality um well over the

110
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,519
course of just getting to know the plant

111
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,920
more and being outside

112
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,759
um like i said we were in smart pots for

113
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,280
a long time and then realized that we

114
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,599
really needed to just have all of our

115
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,600
roots in the ground so we transitioned

116
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,400
to having everything out of smart pots

117
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,960
everything's in raised beds yes

118
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:27,198
yeah awesome yeah that's cool and you've

119
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:29,120
been doing some level of you know inner

120
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,960
cropping or companion planting do you

121
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,360
feel like what do you have any you know

122
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:36,319
we love cover crops well and then you're

123
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,199
one of the experts on ipm you know so we

124
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,759
get to you know work together yeah um

125
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,759
but we've been doing cover crops since

126
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,919
you know 2010 we would even do them in

127
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,120
our smart pots and it was a lot more

128
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:51,039
work but you get a lot more biodiversity

129
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,000
and the plants are a lot healthier the

130
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,680
soil building process fpf really helps

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,720
that organic matter

132
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,879
just year after year it's like the

133
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,639
plants deplete the organic matter and

134
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,038
then you have to rebuild it and cover

135
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,240
crops help with that yeah it just is one

136
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,879
of the things that we learned from

137
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,319
friends and that's the great thing about

138
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:10,399
our community in the willow creek

139
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:12,959
cannabis alliance is because we get to

140
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,279
do a lot of exchange of knowledge see

141
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,680
what's working what's not in genetics

142
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:20,159
and cultivation practices nice well

143
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,199
speaking of genetics

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,680
well

145
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,800
you got them over there i do yeah well

146
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,160
here we have um our apple fritter okay

147
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,478
and then a couple of collaborations we

148
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,479
did with cookies we've got the london

149
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,560
pound cake and cake mix

150
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,719
but half of our product that we grew for

151
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,800
them we decided to put in our own

152
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,080
packaging that can i crack those oh yeah

153
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
please

154
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,159
so these are pre-rolls they're you know

155
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,239
a little bit more desirable right now in

156
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,560
the market because it's a lower price

157
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,000
point and you know that's good

158
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,199
and it's just ready you can just take it

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,038
to the beach

160
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,319
um these have really similar terpene

161
00:05:55,038 --> 00:06:00,560
profiles uh it's the uh

162
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:02,000
beta-caryophyllene linoleul and humulene

163
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,120
and then the other one has just got the

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,720
humulin and limonene so it's uh

165
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,959
out yeah check this out this is what i'm

166
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,880
smoking uh is apple fritter a lot it's

167
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,038
one of my favorites

168
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,079
nice yeah yeah it seems like it's i've

169
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:15,199
uh

170
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,599
i've

171
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,919
heard it's pretty decent yielder yeah

172
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
it's really dense it's got a spicy

173
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,198
earthy tone

174
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,759
something that i'm really into i love

175
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,759
that tone

176
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,039
what else do we have here

177
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,800
yep this is another jar oh yeah i'll

178
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:35,519
check it out i'm always like looking at

179
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,319
different cars um do you think do you

180
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,560
have any you know interesting uh

181
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,080
techniques you know obviously growing is

182
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,160
half the battle and almost harvesting

183
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,519
and drying is the other half right you

184
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,800
have any interesting you know things you

185
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:49,839
do to try to help

186
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,759
preserve terpene yeah we like to make

187
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:53,839
sure that our room always stays really

188
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,000
cold you know even in the summer when

189
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,839
we're running our light up we run air

190
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,759
conditioners in our drying rooms to make

191
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,679
sure that it's climate controlled

192
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,960
controlled system we don't let it get

193
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,199
back over

194
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,120
you know a high humidity once we pull it

195
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,400
this is the london power so good

196
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,319
thanks yeah that's a favorite for me um

197
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,839
really similar to profiles but that

198
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,759
one's got a little bit more lemon right

199
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:19,758
wow yeah yeah it really it really pops

200
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,919
oh wow it's like really pretty and

201
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,680
fluffy and like it turned really nice

202
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,000
and purple it's weird yeah

203
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,639
um you know as far as

204
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,519
different cultivation methodologies we

205
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:34,478
do a pretty extensive prune

206
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,639
we're cutting back a lot

207
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,879
we still incorporate super cropping

208
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,319
which is um you know just a method of

209
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,519
twisting the stem

210
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,400
and

211
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,959
i really enjoy doing foliar feeds on the

212
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,478
plants i can smell this all day

213
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,318
it smells good it's like it's weird it's

214
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,878
almost like a london pound cake like the

215
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,680
name actually reflects it has a really

216
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,039
it's like a dessert smell

217
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,038
yeah

218
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:02,000
that's cool have some of it yeah yeah i

219
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:04,478
know i definitely so wow these these uh

220
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,918
so you've these are the varieties yep

221
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:07,519
and um

222
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,799
do you is there a place where people can

223
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,359
buy these or would you do normal

224
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,560
wholesale or yeah well uh you know for

225
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,800
people that are looking to carry it in

226
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,959
their shop we do our distribution

227
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,038
through up north distribution and

228
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:22,000
they're statewide and we actually have

229
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:24,800
around 240 uh dispensaries that carry

230
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,800
our product awesome off and on

231
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,079
almost every place in humboldt carries

232
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,439
us as far down as san diego area and

233
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,439
actually the bay area is really

234
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,838
supportive and um i was really surprised

235
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,839
sacramento smokes a lot of weed

236
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,240
so that's a good sign especially for the

237
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,159
small farmer yep it is well speaking

238
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,759
about the small farmer i mean you know

239
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,319
we're dealing with a lot of corporate

240
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:49,679
cannabis we're trying to balance

241
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,760
balance that very carefully um

242
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,039
do you have anything specifically you'd

243
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,720
like to talk about your product that

244
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,838
stands out you know what what makes your

245
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,200
product different than corporate

246
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,519
cannabis

247
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,519
i think that a lot of it is to do with

248
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,240
the way it's grown and the intention

249
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,639
that's put into it and i know that's not

250
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,320
measurable in numbers i think we talk a

251
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,399
lot about thc and the different

252
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,160
cannabinoids that's really important too

253
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,679
but i think there's a real energetic

254
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,639
exchange between the farmer and the

255
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,719
plant

256
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,399
that can then carry over to the end

257
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,120
product and experience

258
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,759
i think that as the market matures we'll

259
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,560
talk more about the experience

260
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,399
and less about just the numbers i think

261
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,319
that it makes a big difference how it

262
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,559
actually makes you feel totally and i

263
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,920
think in you know the 90s and early

264
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:38,879
2000s people were more interested in

265
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:41,519
smoking the herb and experiencing it

266
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:44,159
before purchasing it and you know now we

267
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,679
can't smell it i know we can't you know

268
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,159
the nose knows

269
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:50,879
so i just think that it's a miss to not

270
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:54,240
be able to have your consumer smell the

271
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:55,759
flower and understand what is going to

272
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,560
work with their chemistry i think

273
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:00,720
there's a lot of knowledge in in that

274
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,559
that's being lost i'd like to see that

275
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,920
yeah interesting yeah yeah that's really

276
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,759
cool so that's a good change and we kind

277
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,838
of went into that but if i had to ask

278
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,120
you any other changes you'd like to see

279
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,839
like a specific thing if you could

280
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,759
change one thing about regulations or

281
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,920
education what would be the positive

282
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:20,078
outcome you'd like to see out well i

283
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:23,360
love wine and so when i think about how

284
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:25,199
ryan and i used to travel and go down to

285
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,399
dry creek specifically for those

286
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,000
infandels

287
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,078
i think that something that could be

288
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,519
really exciting for people that love

289
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:36,239
wine and food would be to find a way to

290
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,639
say you know well in willow creek

291
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,839
the expression of the

292
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,000
terpenes that are more like gassy and

293
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,480
spicy those really stand out i think

294
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,399
that those more hearty terpenes are

295
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,480
going to be able to withstand our

296
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,078
diurnal swing because we've got really

297
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,920
really hot days

298
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,559
really really cold nights and so it

299
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:59,120
takes a hearty 50 degrees

300
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:01,278
we'll have a huge swing in temperature

301
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,278
and so our climate only really allows

302
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,759
for the most hardy plants you know it's

303
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,439
it's a rugged community you know so you

304
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:10,159
think like in terms of like having the

305
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,000
ability to like to basically direct to

306
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,240
consumer sales where people can come

307
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,159
visit the farm experience i think that

308
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,159
cannabis farmers should have all of the

309
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,799
same allowances that people that make

310
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:23,120
wine do and craft brewers i also think

311
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,559
that a big huge thing that would help is

312
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,440
a way to

313
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,838
mitigate taxes for craft producers so we

314
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,320
can't compete at a commodity scale but

315
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,800
we can compete in quality and experience

316
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,959
so if we're able to have

317
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,679
the first thousand pounds

318
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,599
have a tax rebate in q1

319
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,679
you know that way the people that are

320
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,839
selling bulk then when they need to plan

321
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,519
for the year they have a return of funds

322
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,200
i think that that would be a wonderful

323
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,679
way to do it or if they wanted to just

324
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,360
remove those taxes right away for us

325
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,479
that would be fine with me too are you

326
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,200
sure you don't want to run for

327
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,920
supervisor or send you know

328
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,839
gubernatorial positions well i actually

329
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:05,278
did apply for the cannabis advisory

330
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,360
committee i don't know if it was

331
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,759
something i think that it's something

332
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,720
where we need to have equity and legacy

333
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:14,879
producers represented and it doesn't

334
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,600
mean that it should be me but i think it

335
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,759
should be someone that has a perspective

336
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,839
that can represent farmers authentically

337
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,720
absolutely not from a special interest

338
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,160
place or being an ancillary company

339
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,240
because i don't think you have the same

340
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,879
view exactly and it's the same with

341
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,680
whoever made metric was never a farmer

342
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:33,360
right

343
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,120
well and then you have to look at who

344
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,720
you're aligning with because then when

345
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,159
you have someone that's you know doing

346
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,720
your marketing or things that are

347
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,679
representative of the community it

348
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,000
really should be authentic um indeed

349
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,919
cool well uh i think that pretty much

350
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,480
wraps it up here today

351
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:53,519
so i did want to talk to you guys about

352
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,320
our rosin so it's over here let's check

353
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,000
it out

354
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,360
the other thing that i think i always

355
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
love to touch on is collaboration so

356
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,519
especially um working with getting our

357
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,278
products to market

358
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,519
and not just selling in bulk but selling

359
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,759
with you know representation

360
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,959
um i think that piece is so important oh

361
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,399
cool you're working with humboldt chirp

362
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,799
count yeah i've known rob since like

363
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,440
2002. yeah we used to do fish tour

364
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,679
together oh hilarious oh wow that's so

365
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,200
funny well like we would both go we

366
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,879
weren't going to get there yeah no

367
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,240
totally yeah

368
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:28,799
but this is our papaya um so the papaya

369
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,519
turned out really nicely it's actually

370
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:34,958
dropping on the up north menu on monday

371
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,959
which will be the

372
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,040
hca

373
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,360
cbd

374
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:44,399
nice it has a really interesting terpene

375
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,159
at the top that's um gwyol that i hadn't

376
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,639
really heard of that much but i did a

377
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,719
little research so it's got pinene

378
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,879
limonene and then this guy all right

379
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,040
maybe i'm saying it wrong i'm a sucker

380
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,519
for isn't it elite it's like one of

381
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,439
those nice the papaya is so nice i'm

382
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,240
excited about it so the wild is similar

383
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,279
to

384
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,919
pinene in flavor but it has more of a

385
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:10,240
eucalyptus yes and then can kind of lean

386
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:12,240
towards like woodsy rose oh my god

387
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,320
i've never smelled a terpene profile

388
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,720
like that awesome so the other thing i

389
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,760
want to mention is the wine and the food

390
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,560
pairings so we've done for all of our

391
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:25,120
cultivars that hit the market we've got

392
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,359
a sommelier down in the bay area that we

393
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,560
work with and she's a

394
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,039
has passed her french scholars exam and

395
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,919
so she's literally studied how to

396
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,879
describe flavors and smells and so she

397
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,599
does our

398
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,879
strain descriptions and then pairings

399
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,079
and so

400
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,439
like wine

401
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:48,000
a lot of the fuelly and more robust

402
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,600
flavors actually pair well with reds and

403
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,639
then the things that are more floral and

404
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,639
fruity pair better with whites very

405
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,919
interesting that's an interesting

406
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,560
development

407
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,879
fun way to experience your cannabis

408
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:04,559
that's amazing i love that that's

409
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:06,720
quite phenomenal are you guys doing much

410
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,439
flour rosin production

411
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,800
so

412
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,920
last year we did a lot of flour and then

413
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:16,159
you know trying to be more market savvy

414
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,240
you know thinking about doing a bigger

415
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,319
batch seem to make sense because then

416
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,879
you're cutting your testing costs but

417
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,920
once it's in a jar it's going to degrade

418
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,439
quicker and so i found this year that i

419
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,599
really wanted to make sure that by the

420
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,480
end of the first quarter that we weren't

421
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,920
going to have any more flour to sell

422
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,079
i wanted to have

423
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,838
we're doing bubble hash with

424
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,159
actually the guy that's playing in the

425
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,959
band tonight my friend matt engel he's

426
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,319
opening a store in eureka called mocha

427
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,799
awesome and it stands for modern

428
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,519
cannabis and he's doing a product called

429
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,439
basic bubble it's like oh basic bubble

430
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,120
but we're collaborating on the london

431
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,040
pound cake

432
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,519
it's a bubble gum guava

433
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,639
and then we also have the cake mix

434
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,240
and so we're going to make some hash

435
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,759
infused pre-rolls out of the bubble hash

436
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,799
that we do with them

437
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,759
with peak and then i think we're going

438
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,679
to still

439
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,639
jar some wedding cake

440
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,679
and

441
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,480
do another batch we've got this

442
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,638
zev

443
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,240
and that's going to come out as rosin

444
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,680
from terp council and then we're going

445
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,600
to do a batch of papaya resin cool well

446
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,078
it's all about collaboration bob's

447
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,720
