1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:13,049
[Music]

2
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:18,358
we ran into each other at state of

3
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,050
cannabis

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:25,740
I think it's CWC be a new West Summit

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,089
now here at CCIA in SoCal I'm now based

6
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:29,729
out of Southern California you're still

7
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:30,899
based on Northern California but you

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,210
have been going to show we've been going

9
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:35,519
to show us for years oh yeah and it has

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,590
changed huh it's just like the

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,690
demographic the traffic yeah it seems

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,370
like not quite as busy because I think

13
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:43,439
partly because there's so many more

14
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:45,299
shows like yeah like I said we've been

15
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,579
seeing each other every week so I mean

16
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,649
it's hard to keep up in run business if

17
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,439
you're trying to go to shows every every

18
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,600
week as well so I think that brings the

19
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,640
attendance down per show when you're

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,530
scrambling to go to so many shows and

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,049
then we got to start to see an

22
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,850
oversaturation of the elements that are

23
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:04,978
at that show you know everybody needs

24
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,739
insurance but I think half the booths

25
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:09,239
here are insurance brokers and there's

26
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:11,938
only one or two companies that even

27
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,618
write insurance policies so between

28
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:16,289
insurance and packaging it seems to be

29
00:01:13,618 --> 00:01:18,150
what what the majority of what goes on

30
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:20,130
to these shows these days are where as

31
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:23,880
I'm looking for innovative product

32
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:25,798
packaging retail outlets type stuff

33
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:27,839
definitely yeah I agree and it's you

34
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,360
know we talked about it been doing the

35
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,340
show circuit since 14 myself and and

36
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,078
2016 is kind of when we felt like it's a

37
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,790
point of saturation like to your point

38
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,399
all of a sudden it was this show this

39
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,930
show this show you know I'm always an

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,728
advocate for supporting the

41
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:45,000
organizations that are supporting the

42
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:47,640
industry so like I love CCIA I love NCI

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,590
a you know even new West Summit with

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,540
Jim's doing I mean what Peter's doing

45
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,549
with his with his series with bringing

46
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,079
the right people together I mean those

47
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,049
are the shows that really make sense to

48
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:59,429
me well you have some shows that they're

49
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,500
johnny-come-lately they've done

50
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,840
conventions in the tech industry or the

51
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,659
diamond industry or the this industry

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,179
and they see it as this is such a played

53
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,649
out term you'll agree the green rush so

54
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,680
they want oh we can do this show so

55
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,390
we'll do that show

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,950
and it doesn't have the same but you

57
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:16,839
said grit we're talking just now and

58
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:18,609
you're like I like New West it had the

59
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,739
grit like it had like Jim bring some

60
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,500
edgy stuff he brings tech he brings

61
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:24,789
media he brings innovation and then you

62
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,378
come to other shows where it's cookie

63
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:28,359
cutter you're like how many more

64
00:02:26,378 --> 00:02:29,078
insurance how many more marketing

65
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,540
agencies

66
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:33,189
how many more packaging companies and I

67
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:35,128
was one of the best when I was down here

68
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:38,199
last with one of Peters events I think

69
00:02:35,128 --> 00:02:41,500
focusing on one like criteria or

70
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:43,328
developing a panel or something super

71
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,219
specific because going to this that

72
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:48,790
breeders panel that you did down here in

73
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:50,799
Venice was always epic and yeah it's

74
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:52,870
just I think it's finding more unique

75
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:56,079
niches to do shows or panels or

76
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:59,109
conferences about and just fill in those

77
00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:00,189
niches you know like so around growing

78
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:04,000
and breeding is something that I'm

79
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:05,560
really interested in packaging just kind

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,139
of fine-tuning what everybody's doing I

81
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,329
think yeah I agree we watched that show

82
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:13,149
I tend to that show and I love how he

83
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:15,129
even did it in a speakeasy as ironic I

84
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,889
don't think a lot of people absorb that

85
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:20,768
yeah that here he had it in a venue that

86
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:23,230
was a huge part of the original

87
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:26,079
prohibition in this country the whole

88
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:27,818
alcohol situation so for it to be back

89
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:29,620
in the basement yeah it's back in the

90
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:31,328
basement and then to get people like

91
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,549
eyes I was very impressed because Kevin

92
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:35,919
Joe jury who's a good friend who I mean

93
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:37,659
I love Jorge Cervantes not very good

94
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,700
friends with Ed Rosenthal but someone

95
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:40,810
like Kevin Joe jury who you know he's

96
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:42,488
been working with people like Gavin

97
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,169
Newsom one of the few politicians that

98
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:47,109
came out of the proverbial green closet

99
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:48,609
to support us with prop 64 you know and

100
00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:50,739
then people like Mowgli who's just this

101
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:53,049
almost dare I say cyan't you know kind

102
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:54,699
of mad scientist he's so so brilliant

103
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:56,620
and what he's doing with the pilot

104
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:59,139
project and the people that were in the

105
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,449
room made a few friends like Tom Himes

106
00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:03,519
from mg a couple others you know or like

107
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:05,049
this is the 2.0 stuff like this is a

108
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,389
next-level stuff that this industry

109
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:09,310
needs yeah enough of us know cannabis

110
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:10,870
101 we grew up around at uni from

111
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,729
Northern California it's been around us

112
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,859
for years but that's the kind of stuff

113
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:17,228
that I agree I feel like I get out yeah

114
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:18,730
cuz I already have any folks right back

115
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:21,189
to the plant the plant

116
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,800
so yeah and genetics and variety and

117
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:25,930
where that's all going it's super fun

118
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,100
yeah that's like a moving target that's

119
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,860
never gonna end

120
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,720
yeah you know what's the hot new genetic

121
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,970
profile that's going into everything you

122
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,210
know yeah that's that's exactly I was

123
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:38,770
just talking actually to Tom from mg and

124
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:40,599
you know I did this show in Utah we did

125
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:42,819
the Utah can first-ever canvas show out

126
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,620
there it was kind of cool because of the

127
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:48,490
whole it's an emerging market right so

128
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:51,430
there one like Michigan and Oklahoma you

129
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,139
know that are voting in November and it

130
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,350
was cool to see that energy and there

131
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:58,120
was such a it's an you know it's not a

132
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:59,980
mature market so everyone was so

133
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,629
open-minded to learning things and to

134
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,340
learn him the right way right you know

135
00:05:01,629 --> 00:05:04,540
which again that's something I thought

136
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:07,119
was kind of cool was when there's like

137
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,040
real thirsty for information and it was

138
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,199
like wow this has taken me back to and

139
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,480
again not to date ourselves but we were

140
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:16,360
both I know I was of legal age to vote

141
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:22,270
on prop 215 back in 96 you probably were

142
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:23,980
to us clothed so I mean but for us to be

143
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:26,079
around that and then of course seen

144
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,150
medical just kind of take off from there

145
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,800
in the states but they see that that's

146
00:05:28,149 --> 00:05:30,939
still something that's evolving yeah

147
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,370
that people are doing I think it's

148
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:34,959
pretty cool as well super cool so so

149
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,600
where to after this what are you where

150
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:39,909
you head to after trying to buckle down

151
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,830
and back home and handle the harvest

152
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:46,590
season and get all the packaging and the

153
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:48,759
branding and focus on hitting the market

154
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:50,639
sure one of the guys hustling I mean

155
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,769
you're yeah we don't see a lot of guys

156
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,839
literally individuals that are making

157
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:57,159
the trek down from NorCal to SoCal and

158
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,109
that's I think is interesting a lot of

159
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,850
people don't know when I think a

160
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,460
California they they get just this one

161
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:05,260
state that San Diego's right next to LA

162
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:07,000
LA is right next San Francisco but I

163
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:09,279
mean you're coming from the triangle I

164
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,329
know I went up there for HCG AI think I

165
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,189
saw you at Humboldt County growers

166
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:15,849
association another great show no local

167
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:17,889
supported show and I drove it was a

168
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,620
five-hour drive I had to fly in Oakland

169
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:22,449
Airport and I drove up from there and

170
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,069
you don't see a lot of people that you'd

171
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:26,259
see at a venue like that down here

172
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:28,509
getting out in front of these customers

173
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:30,250
and in this instance your customers mean

174
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:30,909
dispensaries right yeah yeah next saying

175
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,279
hey I'm bringing

176
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,020
fire from from the epicenter to your

177
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,609
front door right you know and we think

178
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,810
of like oh it's all in California but

179
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:39,610
when you think about it say to the East

180
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:41,050
Coast it would be like I'm coming to a

181
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:45,400
chill event in Georgia and I'm from New

182
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:47,680
York that's exactly and I think the fact

183
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:49,239
that you know a vast majority of

184
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,740
northing people aren't aware of yeah we

185
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,199
have 39 and a half million people in

186
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,210
this in this state but again a vast

187
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,439
majority are in the LA basin I think

188
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:59,529
it's something like 26 million people

189
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:01,660
alone in LA so you look at that compared

190
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:04,329
to San Francisco metro or Sacramento

191
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:06,700
Metro or even San Diego I mean this is

192
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:08,289
where a majority of the buyers on ya

193
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:10,779
know so you're smart for making that

194
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:12,730
track down it taking it to the largest

195
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:16,349
audience yeah I just got to break those

196
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,350
doors down into the hardest Barbara

197
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:32,858
