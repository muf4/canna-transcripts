1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,070
I don't have any main strain I grow so

2
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,650
many different strains I mean definitely

3
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,289
we try to stick with fuels because

4
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:28,528
that's where the market is whether it's

5
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:32,308
white or black at this point so a lot of

6
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:33,899
Sour Diesel different oh geez doing bond

7
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,959
of doing a lot of Sour tangi this year

8
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,000
it's been great kind of right in line

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,710
with the sour I mean sometimes the tangi

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,299
doesn't even come at us so it's a good

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:47,960
sour also grow a lot of CBD so right now

12
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:50,669
I'm trying to just find out the one CBD

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,100
that I can grow and do well with that's

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,870
at least in eighteen to one because

15
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,350
right now mostly a two to one the

16
00:00:54,869 --> 00:01:00,929
pineapple tsunami Turkey awesome CBD but

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,789
two to one so I can't get to 18 to 1 if

18
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:04,819
I had a 18 to 1 I could make one to one

19
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,989
or one to one to two one six to one

20
00:01:04,819 --> 00:01:10,019
products or offer that to other people

21
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:13,500
so right now I'm looking for just like

22
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:18,478
the right high CBD 18:22 one that I can

23
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:21,478
grow a lot of so they're out there just

24
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:24,539
kidding I'm lucky right now with you how

25
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,069
the how the cut I have comes out it's

26
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,420
not the funnest plant to grow it's real

27
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:32,758
floppy and flimsy yeah

28
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,409
and I did I grew a lot of time I grew

29
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,269
like 200 these pineapples seen on you

30
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,829
see last year and then we kept clones of

31
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:40,048
each one to try and do you know hunting

32
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:41,868
on which one we'd want to stick with and

33
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,270
I did find one that was eighteen to one

34
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:47,099
and I'm growing it right now and it's

35
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:49,828
totally wigging out at the late flower

36
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:54,140
putting off all these calyx you veg hair

37
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:59,118
gross I better explain it but it's a

38
00:01:54,140 --> 00:02:01,259
yeah it's yeah it's just not stable so

39
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,090
yeah I even went to a HAMP Expo in

40
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:05,780
Colorado this spring about some seeds

41
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,780
out there and

42
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:09,250
and they're all high-cbd you know

43
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:10,569
they're cannabis strains are calling it

44
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,759
hemp out there just cuz they pull them

45
00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:15,549
early so the THC levels don't get high

46
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:17,349
so I bought some seeds and nothing

47
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,520
nothing worth working with I don't see

48
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:21,250
how they're working within their auto

49
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,230
flower and you know you don't need that

50
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:25,240
you want to you want it CBD to produce

51
00:02:23,229 --> 00:02:29,319
quite a bit more we go into auto flower

52
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:33,040
you got smaller plants so ya still

53
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:37,030
looking for a unique chirpy high CBD

54
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:38,560
that we can run with cuz I want to be a

55
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,270
full spec I'm all about them you know

56
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,969
Kent I'm all about cannabis as well

57
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:45,430
being just as much as medicine and I

58
00:02:42,969 --> 00:02:48,909
think everybody can use CBD in their

59
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:51,569
life as well as THC so I want to cover

60
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:51,569
both spectrums

61
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,080

[Music]

63
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:09,248
I mean Marley know if you can have that

64
00:03:07,658 --> 00:03:12,039
conversation anymore it's not about

65
00:03:09,248 --> 00:03:15,188
strains it's all about products these

66
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:18,328
days not it's the new vape pens and the

67
00:03:15,188 --> 00:03:22,150
oils and infused products I mean flowers

68
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:24,430
flower is hard to sell these days if

69
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:27,069
you're using it into a product and then

70
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:30,579
you just go into the generic sativa or

71
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:32,828
indica I mean the only now give it props

72
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:36,760
not a fan of their growing methods but

73
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:39,400
jungle boys how they've really just

74
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:42,280
killing it with their strain releases

75
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,239
and marketing and grow how they how they

76
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:50,079
do their thing so I mean it's all up to

77
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:54,250
the brand and how you can display that

78
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:57,389
marketing that'll kind of determine

79
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:00,359
which trains are popular or not you know

80
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:02,290
everyone wants something new and I'd say

81
00:04:00,359 --> 00:04:03,879
especially has been really good with

82
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:06,158
putting out the winner strength the win

83
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:09,310
the winner strains like Girl Scout

84
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:13,030
cookies cherry pie they did the sunset

85
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:15,280
sherbert gelato and then the dozy doats

86
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:19,529
coming from that so I think the cookie

87
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,418
spam definitely has topped out and and

88
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:23,739
dominating the strain game and don't

89
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:25,000
really take too much credit for it I

90
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,098
don't think they sell seeds or put their

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,379
strains out there but people that have

92
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:34,180
worked with their strains are creating a

93
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:36,038
lot of unique fruity gassy girls gallery

94
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,709
type strains and it seems like those are

95
00:04:36,038 --> 00:04:42,038
going really well I haven't seen too

96
00:04:38,709 --> 00:04:44,189
much of them but I heard Osito all these

97
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:46,990
strains online

98
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:50,540
[Music]

99
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:52,699
yeah it's like you want to learn how to

100
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,439
succeed in the candidates business just

101
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:57,219
like it jungle boys and take some

102
00:04:54,439 --> 00:05:01,850
lessons they are killing it

103
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:06,190
yeah and I just grow pure salt I mean

104
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:06,189
it's all synthetic soul

105
