my name is vincenzo di marzo i'm a

15
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:34,000
research director at the

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,799
national research council and currently

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,600
i'm actually

18
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,558
a canada excellence research chair in

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,120
quebec city

20
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:43,519
in canada i've been working on the

21
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:46,718
endocannabinoid system since

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,160
basically its discovery at the

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,879
at the beginning of the 1990s and

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:56,078
i've been working on the biochemistry

25
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:59,119
chemistry pharmacology

26
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,359
development of new tools uh analytical

27
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:04,079
tools pharmacological tools to

28
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,840
investigate this system and uh more

29
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,640
recently i've become

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,560
interested in investigating the

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,519
expansion of the endocannabinoid system

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,200
into a larger

33
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:17,599
larger uh chemical uh signaling system

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,439
uh which we we define as the

35
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,839
endocannabinoid dome

36
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,279
and the relationship between the

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,280
endocannabinoid dome

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,320
and the gum microbiome which is what i

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,239
do in

40
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,239

44
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:45,039
hey everybody this is jason wilson with

45
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,519
the curious about cannabis podcast

46
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,840
thanks so much for tuning in once again

47
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,280
and so today i am beyond delighted to

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,478
connect with somebody i've been wanting

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,960
to talk to for

50
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,640
many years since i started studying

51
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,039
cannabis and cannabinoid science i'm

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,320
with

53
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,360
dr vincenzo dimarzo who if you haven't

54
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,879
heard of him

55
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,239
by the time you finish listening to most

56
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,000
of my podcast episodes you will

57
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:07,599
definitely have heard of him

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,199
thanks so much dr dimarzo for being

59
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,199
willing to come on the podcast today and

60
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,598
talk to me about cannabinoid science

61
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,439
my pleasure thank you for inviting me

62
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:18,560
yes absolutely so

63
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,639
one of my first questions um in

64
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,039
the beginning of your book the

65
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,039
endocannabinoid dome in your dedications

66
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,239
uh one thing that you admit is you have

67
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,878
an obsession

68
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,599
about endocannabinoids and cannabinoids

69
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,799
so i guess my first question to you is

70
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,119
why are you so obsessed with

71
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,280
cannabinoids well

72
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,878
i would say more than cannabinoids i'm

73
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,878
obsessed with the the endogenous

74
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:41,439
counterparts of the cannabinoids which

75
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,399
uh

76
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,280
which are the endocannabinoids and uh

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,800
and uh

78
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,959
in fact um since the beginning when we

79
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,920
started investigating this uh this

80
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,479
chemical

81
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,919
signaling system we were intrigued and

82
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,439
fascinated by

83
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:02,958
its involvement in basically all uh

84
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:05,120
physiological uh aspects of of mammalian

85
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,360
life and then

86
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,480
we also understood that in fact this is

87
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,280
a system

88
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,719
uh so deeply involved in physiology that

89
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,000
becomes also deeply involved in

90
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,120
pathology

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,878
and and it seemed to be quite

92
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,480
complicated to study but then it became

93
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:23,518
even more complicated

94
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,000
uh when we we could see that this system

95
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,239
was not

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,959
as simple as we thought at the beginning

97
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:32,239
but it was easily to be expanded into a

98
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,439
much bigger uh signaling systems which

99
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,480
probably we will end up discovering

100
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,519
controls uh uh all aspects of human

101
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,719
physiology

102
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,200
and pathology and um

103
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,400
the other reason why i became so

104
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,518
interested in this system is because

105
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,039
there is a lot of

106
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,239
space for for uh chemistry i'm a chemist

107
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:55,679
to start with

108
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,840
and and there is a lot of chemical

109
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,640
variability and biodiversity in chemical

110
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,479
diversity in

111
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,479
not only the cannabis plant but also in

112
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:07,119
the in the endogenous

113
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,280
signals that we discovered uh starting

114
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,640
from studies on on thc

115
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,479
so the more we started it and the more

116
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,959
complicated it looked so it

117
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,560
i really like complicated things uh i

118
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,918
like things that can explain

119
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,918
in in a mechanistic way uh things from

120
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:26,000
you know the the functioning of a single

121
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:28,079
cell

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,600
to up to the behavior of a complex

123
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,039
organism like

124
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,080
like uh laboratory animals and humans so

125
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,600
um i still think that there is we've

126
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:41,120
probably done less than 10

127
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,120
or 15 percent uh and and one lifetime

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,399
will not be enough to

129
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,800
to to study though yeah

130
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,879
absolutely well and that just gives uh

131
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,600
plenty of work to the future generations

132
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,560
something that's been on my mind a lot

133
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,720
um

134
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,319
that i was i was emailing um raphael

135
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,919
michelle just a couple of days ago and

136
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,240
asking him about

137
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,918
um i don't know what he hopes that

138
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,038
people take away from the work

139
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,639
that you know uh himself and and you

140
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,159
and you know other people like roger

141
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,038
perchway and others you know who were

142
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,720
really

143
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,879
kind of at the beginning of a lot of the

144
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,160
stuff um where it hopes to go and we

145
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,000
were talking a little bit about

146
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,080
the future generations of cannabinoid

147
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,720
scientists that are you know coming on

148
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,918
the

149
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,800
on on board with new opportunities to

150
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:27,198
study

151
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,560
uh cannabinoids that um you know is much

152
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,879
more difficult

153
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,240
back in through the 60s the 90s or so

154
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,000
when we're really

155
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,240
getting a lot of this grounding

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,160
established it's a really

157
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,519
exciting time to see what the future the

158
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,160
subsequent lifetimes

159
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,719
um unveil that we won't be around to to

160
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,720
see and

161
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,840
i would i was very lucky to start to

162
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,400
start uh

163
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,439
in this field when the pioneers of this

164
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,000
field like

165
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,959
rafi meshulam and roger perth and allen

166
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,439
all it was

167
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:56,478
were really still very very active in

168
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,399
this field

169
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,159
uh they're still active of course but

170
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,758
and obviously those were the times when

171
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,319
they were making also

172
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,600
themselves the major discoveries uh in

173
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,240
this field and it

174
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,199
this also explains my excitement of

175
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,600
being there

176
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,560
and i've been very lucky because i i

177
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,160
when i think about

178
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,918
my involvement in this field i thought i

179
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,639
was in in the right place at the right

180
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,879
time

181
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:23,519
so i very much a lot of of what we did

182
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,918
in in my group to the the work of rafi

183
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:29,680
and roger and ali knowledge

184
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:31,599
and how uh so talking about

185
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,600
your start in doing some of this

186
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,639
research um

187
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,120
how did you start to get clued into i

188
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,600
mean

189
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,240
you know obviously you were involved in

190
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,639
um

191
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,639
foundational research that characterized

192
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,600
the concept of the entourage effect

193
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,160
and as well as your paper in 1998 that

194
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,919
sort of

195
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,000
described for the first time what the

196
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,318
endocannabinoid system does

197
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,199
and that sort of thing but when did you

198
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,479
start to

199
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,240
um when did the idea

200
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,159
of the endocannabinoid system start to

201
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,199
expand for you um

202
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,720
when did you start to think about um

203
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,400
it seems like there was a perceptual

204
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,639
shift in how we saw

205
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,000
fatty acids and all these other

206
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,840
components of the body

207
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,360
once you know we started studying these

208
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,038
cannabinoid receptors and

209
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,879
how the vanilloid receptors are part you

210
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:20,478
know all these things so when did that

211
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,719
start to really expand for you where you

212
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:26,399
realize this is something way bigger

213
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,800
than just cb1 cb2 anandamide 2ag all of

214
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,198
that

215
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,879
well yeah that's that's a difficult

216
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,800
question but obviously

217
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,639
the realization of the importance of the

218
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,079
endocannabinoid system came

219
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,478
i would say between uh in my case at

220
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,240
least

221
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:44,079
1995 and and 2000 because this at those

222
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,560
times those times we actually developed

223
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:49,439
uh analytical methods to measure the

224
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,879
endocannabinoids and undermited 2hg

225
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,478
in biological fluids and and tissues

226
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,720
and we were very very lucky to

227
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,000
collaborate with tens i would say even

228
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,639
probably hundreds

229
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,360
of of uh of scientists all over the

230
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,519
world

231
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,919
who would provide us with samples from

232
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,399
uh from patients with various disorders

233
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,719
or from

234
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,679
uh from animal models of disorders so we

235
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,879
basically

236
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,400
started analyzing tissues and and blood

237
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,199
uh like like meds uh all over the world

238
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,239
and uh and

239
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:23,360
we we realized that this system was

240
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,400
very easily perturbed by several

241
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,280
different

242
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,239
uh not only pathological conditions but

243
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:32,240
also

244
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,399
um changes in in the in the equilibrium

245
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,000
in the physiological equilibrium even

246
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,918
physiological changes

247
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,200
would change the the endocardia system

248
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,838
so

249
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,959
i and others came to the conviction that

250
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,560
this this system is

251
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:49,039
is a pro-miostatic system uh present in

252
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,199
all cells and tissues

253
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,159
and especially if you if you expand this

254
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,320
system beyond

255
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,719
cb1 and cb2 you will find

256
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,080
endocannabinoids like anandamide and 2hg

257
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,360
in all tissues

258
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,600
in all tissues from from not only from

259
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,039
mammals but also from higher vertebrates

260
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,000
and in some cases also from the

261
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,559
vertebrate so

262
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,919
you we we noticed that we started

263
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,719
working also in

264
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,079
in some very uh primitive forms of life

265
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,040
like a hydro

266
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,839
or some molluscs or or echinoderms and

267
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,439
and we could see that the

268
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,200
endocannabinoids were there even though

269
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,440
the cannabinoid receptors

270
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,120
as we know as we knew them cb1 and cb2

271
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,279
were not there so

272
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,639
we wondered why why do we make these

273
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,320
molecules and

274
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,679
and we also realized that the the

275
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,640
amounts of these molecules

276
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,679
were subject to be altered by by the

277
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,879
diet

278
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:41,759
and and by the intake of some

279
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,799
particular fatty acids in the diet so we

280
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,039
we we wondered

281
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,319
how how come that there is such an

282
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,799
important system and

283
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,240
this system can be changed by something

284
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,919
as simple as as

285
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,159
eating uh one oil rather than other

286
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,759
than another so you know we were really

287
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,759
intrigued and we we thought that this

288
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,958
maybe was really the response of the

289
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,439
organism

290
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,439
if not the only one but one of the the

291
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,920
most important responses of the organist

292
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,240
to

293
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,240
all forms of uh um

294
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,199
going far from the from the equilibrium

295
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,838
from the homeostasis

296
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,000
and and this system would be activated

297
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,959
to to bring back homeostasis in

298
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,240
in cells and also at the organismal

299
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,278
levels and then

300
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,799
uh we realized that several forms of

301
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:32,799
stressful conditions

302
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,240
would would also alter this system in a

303
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,120
way that this system

304
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,720
could change the output of other

305
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,959
chemical signals

306
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,879
so in those years we came to the to the

307
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,919
hypothesis it was still a hypothesis

308
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,039
that

309
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:50,719
has been since then

310
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:50,719
i would say largely

311
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:55,120
proven that this system is a system made

312
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,958
of local

313
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,039
chemical signals because you know the

314
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,958
endocannabinoids cannot really

315
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,199
travel from one organ to the other so

316
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:07,119
they act where they are produced

317
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:10,560
um produced and and and triggered by

318
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,639
by stressful even kind of benign forms

319
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:16,000
of stress you know

320
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:19,439
subtle perturbation of of the of the the

321
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,278
of the status of the cell um but also

322
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,399
environmental stress

323
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:26,958
uh like physical exercise

324
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,320
diet changes in the in the light the

325
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,759
dark cycles

326
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,560
um in order to re

327
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,039
retune the output of other chemical

328
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,439
system

329
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,879
signals but in turn since this this

330
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,440
system was present in

331
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,120
in different part of the the organism

332
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,240
the system was also

333
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,320
itself being uh controlled by by many

334
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,360
other chemical signals so

335
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,519
it's like uh we we made a comparison you

336
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,278
know it's it's like an orchestra

337
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,519
it's like the director of the orchestra

338
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,078
which is also directed by the

339
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,720
the musicians of the orchestra so it's

340
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,239
it's it was quite an intriguing

341
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,160
hypothesis that we're still

342
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,159
investigating and of course now with the

343
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,159
discovery of the endocannabinoid

344
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,719
this is this is becoming more difficult

345
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:15,439
to to prove

346
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,000
yes yeah absolutely and for those

347
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,279
listening

348
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,799
that um maybe don't have such a

349
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,159
techno technical background on

350
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,599
cannabinoid science how would you

351
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,159
describe

352
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,600
the concept of the endocannabinoid dome

353
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,399
to somebody

354
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,120
okay so basically you know with the word

355
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,240
dom now

356
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,839
we make new words containing the the

357
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,600
the prefix the suffix ohm to identify a

358
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,600
very large system

359
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,680
um so we have the genome we have the

360
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,759
metabolome we have the proteome

361
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,278
and so on and so forth so the endo the

362
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,480
endocannabinoid

363
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:53,120
um came in a way from

364
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,600
you mentioned before the the the study

365
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,200
that

366
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,440
rafi meshulam in which we're

367
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,240
collaborating collaborated on the

368
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,079
entourage effect so basically what rafi

369
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,720
perceived is that

370
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:06,479
and what we were measuring in fact uh

371
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,160
when we were measuring endocannabinoids

372
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,440
is that this these two molecules and

373
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,719
undermined to a g

374
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,360
were accompanied by uh by a plethora of

375
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,200
other

376
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,200
uh compounds and these compounds these

377
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,639
metabolites were chemically

378
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,959
and biochemically similar meaning that

379
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,519
the you know anandamide and 2g belongs

380
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,838
to belong to two different families

381
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,679
of metabolites and these are the an

382
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,399
asylum anonymites and the and

383
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,919
the monocyte glycerols some of which

384
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,879
were already

385
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,319
known in fact even one or two decades or

386
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,159
even

387
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,480
longer than that before the

388
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,399
endocannabinoids were discovered so

389
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,159
but nobody knew really how these

390
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,600
molecules were acting so

391
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,480
rafi in a very imaginative way that this

392
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,120
is really

393
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,480
uh is his main feature is creativity in

394
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,839
my imagination

395
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,600
uh thought well this these are

396
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,399
accompanying uh

397
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,199
molecules that are there to protect to

398
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,078
to make

399
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,759
make the two big actors look even more

400
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:06,799
important than they are so it's an

401
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,600
entourage

402
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,399
or you know when politicians go around

403
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,639
and they

404
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,078
take with them a lot of a lot of

405
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,639
accompanying people

406
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,559
and that that's certainly part of the of

407
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,879
the picture but that

408
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,879
then we started realizing that these

409
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:26,399
compounds in fact do have

410
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,278
molecules uh do have targets of their

411
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,679
own so

412
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,600
the endocannabinoid if you wish is is a

413
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:36,879
kind of evolution

414
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,879
of the of the entourage effect um

415
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,839
molecules like the enocytomines or the

416
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,120
monoxide glycerol started being

417
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,160
investigated

418
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,799
receptors were being found and and this

419
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,480
created

420
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,919
of course exciting but also

421
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,000
complications

422
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,159
uh because you know the the

423
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,399
pharmacologists

424
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,919
and the drug developers where the

425
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,198
therapeutic drug developers where we're

426
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,599
thinking okay we can

427
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,639
we can uh manipulate the levels of the

428
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,320
since they are so

429
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,399
strongly involved in pathology we can

430
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,519
manipulate the levels of the

431
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,879
endocannabinoids

432
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,039
of anandamide and 2hg in order to

433
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,120
make more of these compounds where

434
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,719
they're needed or to reduce the amount

435
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,919
their amounts where they are produced in

436
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,519
an excessive

437
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,120
manner so you can do that by

438
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,600
manipulating the

439
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,120
the degradation of the biosynthesis of

440
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,839
endocannabinoids but then

441
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,198
when it was found that and we found we

442
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,440
and many others that

443
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:32,559
anandamide has the same biochemical

444
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,959
pathways

445
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,638
as other enacelateral minds which have

446
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,159
different receptors from the cannabinoid

447
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,399
receptors

448
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,159
this created a strong complication we

449
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,679
cannot really manipulate the levels of

450
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,519
an undermine in this way

451
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,958
without manipulating the levels of the

452
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:52,399
other previously

453
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:55,039
known as entourage compounds but having

454
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,000
an identity and and in the mechanism of

455
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,399
action of of

456
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,360
independent from the endocannabinoids of

457
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,839
their own so

458
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,399
the endocannabinoid dome is basically

459
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,759
the

460
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,480
uh the the bigger system including not

461
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,440
only an undermine and 2g

462
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,720
their main receptors which are cb1 cb2

463
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,079
but also

464
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,240
some of the other receptors for

465
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,879
anandamide and 2g because these are two

466
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,720
very promiscuous molecules unlike thc

467
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,879
this is one major difference from

468
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,879
between between the endocannabinoids and

469
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:27,120
the plant and cannabinoids

470
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,519
uh or at least between between the

471
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,360
endocannabinoids and thc

472
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,879
um and then uh it was found that

473
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,039
in fact even the biosynthesis and

474
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,480
degradation of of these two compounds

475
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:42,159
could not be only

476
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,480
uh mediated by one or two enzymes there

477
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,159
was a redundancy of biosynthetic and

478
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,079
degrading enzymes

479
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:49,600
and and sometimes the ingredient enzymes

480
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:50,239
were not degrading enzymes because they

481
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,199
were

482
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,120
simply converting anandamide and 2g into

483
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,078
molecules which had different receptors

484
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,240
and this is

485
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:59,679
you know this is this may seem strange

486
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,240
but not to people like

487
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,679
like me who have investigated the

488
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,679
bioactive lipids

489
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,879
all their life you know all bio

490
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,679
bioactive lipids

491
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,000
are transformed into something different

492
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,600
and

493
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,838
come from something different with the

494
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,759
different biological activities so

495
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:17,359
uh and then there is the congeners of

496
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,519
anandamide and to agita

497
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,599
what we called previously the entourage

498
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,279
compounds which

499
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,279
have their own receptors even though

500
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,160
they share with the endocannabinoids

501
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,798
the same biosynthetical pathways and

502
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,840
then

503
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,879
finally there were other molecules which

504
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:37,199
have a

505
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,520
different biochemical

506
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,120
pathways as the endocannabinoids but are

507
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,038
nevertheless

508
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:44,719
they're not congeners they're not like

509
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,240
cousins

510
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,400
they're not like brothers and sisters

511
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,679
but they're cousins so you have

512
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,798
other anastile uh amides

513
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,919
uh and in fact um

514
00:17:54,798 --> 00:18:00,480
when we collaborated with the

515
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,640
uh with the with the with the other

516
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,120
groups we we found that in fact

517
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,240
um in particular with the group of

518
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,479
michael walker

519
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,279
the late michael worker we we found that

520
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,839
many

521
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,399
uh many compounds many amino acids could

522
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,240
make amides with fatty acids and this

523
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,038
could create

524
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,720
an almost an incredible number of new

525
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:24,079
combinations between

526
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,038
the 10 or 15 fatty acids and 20 amino

527
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,240
acids so just

528
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:31,119
just imagine all the permutations and

529
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,880
and so these compounds actually exist as

530
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:36,239
as the group of other brands show

531
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:39,200
us as also uh recently uh

532
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,319
investigated and and so it's really

533
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,759
we're talking now

534
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,918
about a a huge number of chemical

535
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:46,480
mediators so the endocannabinoids their

536
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,000
con

537
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,558
their congeners their analogues

538
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,440
which may or may have not different

539
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,399
similar

540
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,840
biochemical pathways normally have

541
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,480
different receptors

542
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,798
we we talking about the several other

543
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,440
targets that anandamide and 2hg have

544
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,558
beyond cb1 and cp2 we're talking about

545
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,480
other enzymes

546
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:11,918
so we're talking about something

547
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:15,519
something about more than 250 chemical

548
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,360
mediators more than 50 enzymes and

549
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,038
and receptors and some of these

550
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:22,079
receptors were actually

551
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,440
known previously like the the trip

552
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,240
channels or the

553
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,440
or the p-bars and and and the

554
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,079
interesting thing is that you know of

555
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,679
course with

556
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,519
when the endocannabinoid system became

557
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,280
so big

558
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:38,558
then the next question was okay thc

559
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:40,399
is the only out of 100 and more

560
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,399
plant cannabinoid that interacts with

561
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,200
the endocannabinoid system what about

562
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,798
maybe maybe if we don't look only at the

563
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,000
endocannabinoid system but we look at

564
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:49,759
the expanded endocrine

565
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
system at this endocannabinoid maybe the

566
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,759
other cannabinoids will interact

567
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,359
with the endocannabinoid dome even

568
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,200
though they don't interact with the the

569
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,399
endocrine system this is true

570
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,240
uh to a large extent uh for

571
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,080
for things like cannabidiol or

572
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,120
cannabinoid

573
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:10,319
the other minor

574
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:13,359
not so minor anymore uh cannabinoids

575
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,720
uh and and in fact in the case of

576
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,319
cannabidiol

577
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,839
even the endocannabinoid is not

578
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,678
sufficient to to explain its

579
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:21,918
pharmacology because it

580
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,798
it has been suggested to interact also

581
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,440
with the

582
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,400
with receptors and proteins outside the

583
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,919
endocannabinoid

584
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,159
not just outside the endocrine system

585
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,240
but even outside the endocannabinoid

586
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,320
so i think the endocannabinoid is a

587
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,880
complex complex con

588
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,918
concept which however has the merit of

589
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,400
explaining

590
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,480
the mechanism of action of a much higher

591
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,200
number of cannabis of plant cannabinoids

592
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,360
than the endocannabinoid system

593
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,360
yeah yeah absolutely and it's it's

594
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:52,158
definitely a very tangled web

595
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,839
that you can't uh so many things are

596
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,360
interconnected that it is

597
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:59,439
tricky to manipulate one piece i saw

598
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,959
um wasn't there research i can't

599
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,640
remember what year it was now there's

600
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,640
research i think in france

601
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,799
where they tried to do i think it was a

602
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,600
fah in their inhibitory

603
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,158
study and ran into some problems there

604
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,079
um

605
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,640
unexpected consequences and things yeah

606
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:17,599
even though in that particular case

607
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,919
the problem was not uh due to the fact

608
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:19,599
that

609
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,440
by inhibiting the degradation of an

610
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:24,319
undermine they were also inhibiting

611
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,880
degradation of other fatty acid amides

612
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:27,279
um

613
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,919
they basically were hitting with this

614
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:30,399
with this

615
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,120
new chemical they were eating a

616
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,400
completely different set of proteins

617
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,719
and enzymes that that

618
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,480
for which there is less redundancy in

619
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,279
the brain so when you get rid of that

620
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,519
enzyme you have serious problems

621
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,759
yeah fortunately when you inhibit far

622
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,319
you you have much less

623
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,480
side effects because as i mentioned for

624
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:55,599
the degradation of the endocannabinoids

625
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,960
there are many enzymes so

626
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:02,158
this this is a system so strongly

627
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:06,240
uh and deeply involved in

628
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:09,679
in mammalian and animal physiology that

629
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,440
it's it's not enough to to kick out one

630
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,320
of the enzymes of the receptors to see

631
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,519
major

632
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:17,439
major problems right yeah yeah and

633
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:18,960
and one and one thing that's come up in

634
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,240
several discussions i've had

635
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,840
um both with raphael michilim

636
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,038
and another colleague of yours ethan

637
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:29,839
russo yeah um was

638
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:30,798
how do we i guess taking this to a

639
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:32,158
practical level

640
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,000
uh because what physicians are

641
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,559
interested in is okay this is all

642
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,640
interesting we see it's connected to

643
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:40,879
um all these aspects of physiology but

644
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,679
how do we measure it

645
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,960
when these compounds are so um kind of a

646
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,640
femoral they

647
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,640
they get built when they're needed and

648
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,400
then they get broken down quickly and

649
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,159
i know that in the past there have been

650
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,798
like spinal taps and stuff like that to

651
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,440
try to see

652
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,319
what endocannabinoids are circulating at

653
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,000
the moment

654
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:03,439
um but can you speak at all to the

655
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
um the challenges to trying to

656
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,360
characterize the endocannabinoid system

657
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,480
or the endocannabinoid dome

658
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:12,240
in a human being yeah it's it's it's uh

659
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,360
you're perfectly right it's it's very

660
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,359
complicated

661
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,279
it's a system that undergoes uh the

662
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:20,479
levels of these mediators

663
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:23,678
uh undergo changes uh by the hour

664
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,200
um as i said you know they're affected

665
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,679
by whether or not you

666
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,400
you eat foods or what kind of food you

667
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,000
eat

668
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:35,038
um like like with all the

669
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,319
other homes uh the the

670
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:41,519
real picture of the of the system uh

671
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:44,879
can only be taken at a certain

672
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:48,319
time frame thanks to the

673
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,919
very sophisticated new machines that

674
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,240
have been really uh have characterized

675
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,278
the

676
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,558
the more recent years of of scientific

677
00:23:55,278 --> 00:24:00,798
development

678
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:03,038
as you know the the means by which we we

679
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:06,319
can look into the cell into the

680
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:07,599
biological fluids have become very

681
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,879
sophisticated

682
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:14,240
and very sensitive and very specific so

683
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,799
we can now measure the levels of

684
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,880
of anandamide and we can distinguish

685
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:22,079
anandamite which is a very

686
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,720
uh minor uh compound in fact

687
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,240
uh rafi meshulam always jokes about that

688
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,519
that you know he could only discover an

689
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,400
undermine because

690
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:33,038
he was probably using a big brain that

691
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,159
had been

692
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:38,558
laying in the slaughterhouse for hours

693
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,440
and and this this was later shown to be

694
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,038
a process that

695
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,759
increases the levels of

696
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:47,919
dishes so at that time when he

697
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:51,200
discovered an andamite there were no

698
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:54,559
uh mass spectrometers

699
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,679
sensitive enough to measure uh

700
00:24:54,558 --> 00:25:00,399
picomolar or femtomolar amounts

701
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,400
of these compounds now we do and we can

702
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,840
distinguish anandamide from

703
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,640
from its brother which has 20 carbon

704
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,359
atoms but

705
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,679
only three double bonds instead of four

706
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,879
and

707
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,720
uh and maybe that difference is enough

708
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,440
for that compound to hit another

709
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,120
receptor rather than just cb1 and cb2

710
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,038
so clearly um we we have the

711
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,639
these days the the possibility of

712
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:25,759
measuring with high sensitivity

713
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,880
specificity

714
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:31,599
high rapidity as well

715
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,240
these compounds in all in all tissues we

716
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:34,240
can

717
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,798
we can measure the expression of the

718
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:41,120
enzymes that make these compounds

719
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:43,679
with even at the single cell level

720
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,399
we we can measure the proteins that are

721
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,440
made by

722
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:51,120
uh by this uh but by the arena

723
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,880
the rnas uh through the rnas of the

724
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,839
various proteins and enzymes and

725
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,760
receptors so

726
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,759
we can have a real uh

727
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,400
real time almost real-time picture

728
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,960
what's happening in a given tissue

729
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,919
or a given biological fluid in a given

730
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,120
animal with a

731
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,440
with a with that which is undergoing a

732
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:14,558
physiological or pathological

733
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,240
condition so and then of course all

734
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:19,119
these data these days

735
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,079
these are also the days of of big data

736
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,639
of

737
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,720
artificial intelligence so all this data

738
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,960
can be put together there is the new

739
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,278
approaches of the systems biology

740
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,319
so all the networks can can be made

741
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:31,919
sense of

742
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,240
and there is a lot of space for

743
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,360
mathematics not just for analytical

744
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,319
uh chemistry and molecular biology so we

745
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:40,000
can have a picture

746
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,839
and at the same time we have very

747
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,119
sophisticated ways

748
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:47,038
to modify uh if not one single

749
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,798
mediator of the endocannabinoid because

750
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,440
that would be very difficult to do

751
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:54,000
but at least one single receptor in a

752
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,038
single cell

753
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,079
for for those endocannabinoid mediators

754
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:02,158
and by modifying that and then you know

755
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:03,359
controlling you know like in an on and

756
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,440
off

757
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,959
situation we can then understand what

758
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,798
the endocannabinoid

759
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,038
mediators in the endocannabinoid system

760
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:12,798
is doing this has been done to a large

761
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:14,079
extent in the brain because that's where

762
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,798
all the research

763
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:18,319
started but it's now being done also in

764
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,000
peripheral organs

765
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:22,000
and this is where we really appreciate

766
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,440
the importance of the

767
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,839
of the endocannabinoid dome and the

768
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,960
endocannabinoid system they're not brain

769
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:30,398
uh systems they're really pleiotropic

770
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,240
they're doing a lot of things in a lot

771
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:34,239
of places

772
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,839
and it's yeah it's difficult to

773
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,759
understand because of course

774
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:40,158
you have lots of molecules being

775
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,599
produced and degraded at the same time

776
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,399
but we must

777
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:46,000
uh imagine that if these molecules are

778
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:49,038
doing something important and we have

779
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,038
evidence that they are

780
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:54,798
they must have a way of coordinating

781
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,599
themselves and being coordinated by

782
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,720
by other mediators by other systems

783
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,759
physiologically

784
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,440
and pathologically yeah and

785
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:06,319
and since um all of this activity is so

786
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,840
localized

787
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,879
if let's say five ten years down the

788
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,558
road

789
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,720
if some of these analytical technologies

790
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:17,918
become more accessible to

791
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,519
hospitals and things you know worldwide

792
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,480
would someone essentially have to have a

793
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,720
biopsy on a particular

794
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,159
set of tissues or you know particular

795
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,880
organ that sort of thing

796
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,000
in order to get some sense of what's

797
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,880
going on

798
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,079
um with endocannabinoids or receptors

799
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,679
and that sort of thing

800
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,199
um since they're not being circulated is

801
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,600
that really the only way to

802
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,120
to kind of do that yeah this is yeah

803
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:42,759
unfortunately this is why we still need

804
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,439
the animal studies

805
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:46,480
um we we've been uh this is one of the

806
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,600
reasons why i've been

807
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:53,360
working on on less invasive uh

808
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:55,678
and more ethically valid

809
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:57,119
uh systems like you know invertebrates

810
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:01,519
or zebrafish

811
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:03,759
um but at the end of the day

812
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,679
you you cannot do without the animal

813
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,919
studies also because there is

814
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,038
genetic manipulations that you can do

815
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,240
only

816
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,278
in animals fortunately and at least for

817
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,720
now

818
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:18,720
and and obviously it's mark we've done

819
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,640
lots of studies with biopsies

820
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,640
the blood when we when we look at the

821
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,320
blood of course we have we get very

822
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,960
interesting information from from the

823
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:27,678
plant

824
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,480
the plasma from the csf now also from

825
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,960
the saliva saliva from the feces

826
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,679
but uh but obviously we don't really

827
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,880
know where

828
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:40,000
where what we measure comes from and

829
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,520
uh and and this is therefore we can make

830
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,359
correlations we can

831
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,839
we can make hypothesis but we cannot

832
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:48,639
really have a mechanistic link

833
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,639
between what we see and the pathology or

834
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,000
the physiological situation

835
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,600
biopsies offer uh

836
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,440
a better way but then you have to be

837
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,038
very of course you cannot always take

838
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,360
biopsies from from humans

839
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:04,879
certainly not from the prey and and and

840
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:06,479
i've been trying to convince students to

841
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,440
do that but i haven't managed

842
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,440
yeah i mean geez

843
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,119
but you have to be careful even with

844
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,319
biopsies because you know they need to

845
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,639
be

846
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:19,119
taken in the right way kept and stored

847
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,440
in the right way

848
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,558
so there are less invasive ways there is

849
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,558
imaging

850
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:29,038
techniques that are emerging like pet

851
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,759
techniques due to image receptors

852
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:31,919
enzymes

853
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,519
now you see that for the endocannabinoid

854
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,240
system

855
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,599
and that's that that's really raising

856
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,880
the possibility of

857
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:42,719
of doing uh studies in vivo in real time

858
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,360
also in human beings and human

859
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,159
volunteers so

860
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:50,000
i i i see honestly no limit if not the

861
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,679
technological limits of the time

862
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,679
which are probably going to be surpassed

863
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,559
tomorrow or the day after tomorrow

864
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,240
uh yeah the only the only thing we need

865
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:58,879
is the realization that this is an

866
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,679
important

867
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,480
topic to to analyze because when you

868
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,880
have

869
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,679
hundreds of mediators coming more or

870
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,320
less from the same pathway or

871
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,759
having to do with the same pathway which

872
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:13,678
originates from the endocannabinoid

873
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,879
system but simply because that was the

874
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,440
one we discovered first uh but eating

875
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,559
different uh completely different uh

876
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,798
targets

877
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:24,558
and then you you when you realize that

878
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,158
this is important then you you will find

879
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:29,678
a way of

880
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,679
of addressing the experimental problems

881
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,640
and challenges

882
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:36,159
so just it's just a matter of having the

883
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,880
right questions and

884
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:40,159
you can get uh you can get answers at

885
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,159
least partial answers

886
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,440
as we said at the beginning you know a

887
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,840
lifetime would probably not be

888
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,600
sufficient to understand all these

889
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:49,278
what all these mediators are doing and

890
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:52,480
how and how do they

891
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:53,119
interact with each other yeah and one of

892
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,880
the

893
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:57,278
most important things in the scientific

894
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,840
process is finding better questions to

895
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:00,480
ask

896
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,359
than you necessarily started out with

897
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,960
and always

898
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:04,398
always having the right hypothesis

899
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,440
because i'm very much

900
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:08,079
even though you know with the omics you

901
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,440
you

902
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:11,439
you go fishing a little bit

903
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:16,398
i'm still a believer in the hypothesis

904
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:18,159
driven research so

905
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:21,119
it's nice to have an hypothesis and then

906
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:23,919
of course if you're lucky

907
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:26,639
you can get you can get an answer to

908
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,840
your hypothesis

909
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,399
and even if if the answer is negative

910
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,678
the secret is not getting too attached

911
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:36,719
to your hypothesis

912
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,798
exactly exactly yeah yeah being more

913
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,000
interested and just trying to understand

914
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:45,200
yeah what's happening hypothesis to to

915
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,640
to start with yeah to have a focus yeah

916
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,640
absolutely

917
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,759
um one thing i wanted to make sure to

918
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,600
talk to you about because i know it's a

919
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,960
focus on a lot of your research right

920
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:54,240
now which is

921
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,000
the connection between the

922
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,278
endocannabinoid dome and

923
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,679
the gut microbiome um and this is once

924
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:01,440
again

925
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,360
something that when i spoke with ethan

926
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,919
he kind of teased a little bit

927
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:06,719
um of some of the work that's going on

928
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,038
now but

929
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:13,519
can you speak a little bit to um

930
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:15,919
i mean obviously research these days is

931
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,839
showing how the gut microbiome the

932
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,519
all the gut flora affects so many

933
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:22,000
different things and

934
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,278
how the immune system and psychology and

935
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
all these other things are

936
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:27,599
interconnected

937
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,319
with it but um what is your uh

938
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,519
research focusing on and what are what

939
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,599
are you currently

940
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,278
um learning about those connections

941
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:36,639
between the endocannabinoid dome and the

942
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,759
gut microbiome

943
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,278
yeah yeah the yeah this is as

944
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:43,200
as i said at the beginning i like

945
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:45,440
difficult things and

946
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,720
it was given a big one i was given the

947
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,159
opportunity

948
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,558
uh four years ago to start on on a new

949
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,159
uh project and i must say i was

950
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,599
immediately attracted

951
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,200
because you know the grand microbiome uh

952
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,278
i i saw it a little bit like the

953
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,080
endocannabinoid i don't because it's

954
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:05,679
it's it's not really an external part to

955
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:08,398
our body

956
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,760
it's something that has been selected

957
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:13,838
through generations

958
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:17,040
passed on uh genetically but not only

959
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:21,599
genetically from from mothers to to to

960
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:24,159
children and uh uh it's there for if

961
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,359
to to to play an important faction has

962
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,960
been concerned

963
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,440
it's not been fought by the immune

964
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,639
system so it's clearly something that

965
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,039
that we need and

966
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,559
all animals that have microbiomes

967
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:37,440
microbiota

968
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:40,239
need them so it's a ideally it's a it's

969
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:44,000
a wonderful symbiotic symbiotic

970
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:47,759
uh relationship um with the with the

971
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:51,358
with another organ there is several more

972
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,320
cells microbial cells in our body than

973
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,358
our own

974
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:59,838
uh eukaryotic cells so

975
00:34:55,358 --> 00:35:02,319
so clearly this offers the opportunity

976
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:05,519
if you think of it of and expanding a

977
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,720
lot the potentiality of our own body

978
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:11,519
there's there is thousands of genes more

979
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:13,039
than the ones we have

980
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:15,440
lots of more proteins and small

981
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:16,559
molecules and obviously what the gut

982
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,240
microbiota

983
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,358
does to to help us first only does it to

984
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:23,439
help itself

985
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:25,598
but obviously in the process they they

986
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,838
produce molecules that can be

987
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,000
useful to our own functions uh by

988
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:32,239
reinforcing

989
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,679
our own molecules our own signals but

990
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:37,838
also by creating

991
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:39,919
uh something that we don't have um

992
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:41,519
but you know the the experience of the

993
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,159
endocannabinoid dom told me that you

994
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,440
know

995
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:48,159
you never enough the chemical signals to

996
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,559
to deal with the complexity of life

997
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,199
and experience especially when it comes

998
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:53,519
to

999
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,919
dealing with the the environment and the

1000
00:35:53,519 --> 00:36:00,320
environmental challenges you know

1001
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:02,400
uh having a few thousands genes more

1002
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,440
actually quite quite more than a few

1003
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,000
thousands more

1004
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,000
definitely helped helped us and many

1005
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,679
other animals to survive

1006
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
and to better respond to the to the

1007
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:15,440
environment to the changing environment

1008
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,559
um our our own bodies itself

1009
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,760
a an environment for for these these

1010
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,719
microbes

1011
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,160
uh who live in in completely different

1012
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:26,159
conditions like you know

1013
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:28,480
for us would be living in the north pole

1014
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:30,480
or or in the on the equator

1015
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,400
so it's it's really fascinating and it's

1016
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,719
uh and then you know you start thinking

1017
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,160
oh

1018
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:36,239
seeing all these papers on the ground

1019
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,960
microbiota and the grand microbiome

1020
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:39,199
again

1021
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,880
here the difference between the word has

1022
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,239
to do with the fact that the microbiota

1023
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,640
are the microbes

1024
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:46,399
the microbiome is the microbes it's

1025
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:47,598
their genes it's their proteins it's the

1026
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,039
small molecules

1027
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,039
and so on and so forth it's a bit like

1028
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:54,159
the endocannabinoid so

1029
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:56,559
beyond the the

1030
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:57,759
the the names what i saw and what

1031
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:01,838
everybody can see is that

1032
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,000
the microbiome uh is involved

1033
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:05,039
is potentially involved not just in

1034
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,838
controlling

1035
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:09,599
the function of our gut helping us with

1036
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:12,000
metabolizing things

1037
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,800
but also in behavior in the immune

1038
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,920
system

1039
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,000
and in most of our functions a little

1040
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,200
bit like the endocannabinoid system and

1041
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,320
the endocannabinoid

1042
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:26,319
if you think of it but it was really

1043
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,240
patrice kanye in the uh

1044
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,599
in a nice paper that was published i

1045
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:33,279
think uh

1046
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,880
before 2010 um we put the two things

1047
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,000
together the endocannabinoid system the

1048
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,079
gun microbiome

1049
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,039
but this can is a scientist a brilliant

1050
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,760
scientist

1051
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:42,800
in belgium and he showed that some of

1052
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,400
the effects of

1053
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,240
of intestinal dysbiosis the perturbation

1054
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,880
of the gum microbiome because like all

1055
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:50,959
things

1056
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,280
also like the endocannabinoid system

1057
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:56,320
also the gut microbiome is perturbed

1058
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,440
and the perturbation uh known as

1059
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,838
dysbiosis

1060
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,200
produces some of its effect its negative

1061
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:03,599
effects on metabolism

1062
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:05,118
through the endocannabinoid system

1063
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,480
through the cp1 receptor so he was

1064
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,680
really a pioneer in this

1065
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,519
in this uh in this in this field and

1066
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:13,279
at that time i i looked at the paper it

1067
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:14,960
was very interesting very nice paper it

1068
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,960
published a few more but then i was

1069
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,320
given the opportunity to to work on a

1070
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,280
more or less similar

1071
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:22,880
uh subject and i honestly didn't uh want

1072
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,599
to lose the opportunity also because it

1073
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,880
came with

1074
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,359
with very nice funding and uh which

1075
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,240
which

1076
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:32,239
we don't always uh have in italy we

1077
00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:36,319
almost never have in italy and

1078
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:38,000
uh and so i i took this opportunity

1079
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,119
but it's very complicated because you

1080
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,119
know i i'm not my

1081
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:48,400
microbiologist and and the microbiota

1082
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,920
is very complicated although it's not

1083
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,920
there by chance

1084
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:57,119
there are rules but every person has a

1085
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,200
as a different microbiota and

1086
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,358
but again you know every person has a

1087
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:02,559
different profile of endocannabinoid

1088
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:04,719
mediators so

1089
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:06,078
again maybe you know there are things

1090
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:09,118
that these two systems

1091
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:11,599
do together in collaboration or one

1092
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,599
through the other and uh and there there

1093
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,320
were many many evidences

1094
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:17,519
that that there could there would be a

1095
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,039
triangle between the

1096
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:20,719
the endocannabinoid dome the gun

1097
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:24,639
microbiome and

1098
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:27,118
mammalian physiology and pathology

1099
00:39:24,639 --> 00:39:29,519
so initially we we're still focusing on

1100
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,119
the metabolic

1101
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:35,679
on obesity and metabolic disorders

1102
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,720
uh which are obviously the first place

1103
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:38,639
to look

1104
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:40,000
uh for when you're talking about the gum

1105
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,879
microbiome but also when you're talking

1106
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,719
about the endocardium system and

1107
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,519
what we're doing now is trying to prove

1108
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:49,838
that these two systems communicate

1109
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,199
and again and again there are there are

1110
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:52,799
things there are easy

1111
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:54,559
relatively easy things that we could do

1112
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,599
for example uh

1113
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:59,199
use animals which don't have

1114
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,640
a gut mic which we don't have a

1115
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:02,879
microbiota at all

1116
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:04,159
so they were raised in steroid

1117
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,760
conditions

1118
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:06,960
and so we went and looked at their

1119
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,839
endocannabinoid system their

1120
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:10,800
endocannabinoid and it's completely

1121
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:13,199
different

1122
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,720
and this could be due to too many i mean

1123
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:15,439
that doesn't really create a cause

1124
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:17,439
effect

1125
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,480
relationship but then when we reign

1126
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,720
stated

1127
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,599
the gut microbiome in these gem free

1128
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,480
animals into

1129
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,359
these gentry mice it took it took only

1130
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,240
one week

1131
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:30,639
to see almost at least in the gap almost

1132
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:32,879
exactly the same situation as

1133
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,480
uh conventionally raised in mind so that

1134
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,039
was really the evidence we were looking

1135
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,240
that was the first experiment we did

1136
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,639
that was really the

1137
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:42,559
the span we did to say okay we we stop

1138
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,799
here or we go

1139
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:47,358
we work harder and we're moving forward

1140
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,200
you need to go further okay

1141
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:50,639
and then you know there are other things

1142
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:52,399
you can do like knocking down

1143
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:54,480
enzymes of the endocannabinoid system

1144
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,280
specifically in in different parts of

1145
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,599
the body

1146
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,519
or in the gut and see if the

1147
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,000
endocannabinoid system is modified and

1148
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:03,119
again

1149
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,960
we find changes sorry if the

1150
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,160
gum microbiome is modified and we found

1151
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,679
changes

1152
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:11,039
but uh it's a complicated field because

1153
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:12,559
like with the endocannabinoid

1154
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:14,480
almost everything can change the gut

1155
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:18,000
microbiome yeah yeah

1156
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:20,240
and and there's still no

1157
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,599
exact definition what is a healthy or a

1158
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:23,919
pathological

1159
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,680
uh gut microbe exactly like the

1160
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,519
endocannabinoid system

1161
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:32,838
so and possibly also many other

1162
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:35,679
endogenous systems that we have so

1163
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:37,199
um there are many experiments we're

1164
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:38,239
doing we we find very interesting

1165
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:41,118
correlations

1166
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:43,118
in human styles following interventions

1167
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:47,280
between changes in the endocannabinoid

1168
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:49,440
and changes in the in the gut microbiome

1169
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:52,400
we find that if we modify the gun

1170
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:56,000
microbiome with probiotics or prebiotics

1171
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,920
or antibiotics we we see strong changes

1172
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,159
in the endocannabinoid system

1173
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,760
uh we're now investigating whether the

1174
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:03,199
changes we see in the endocannabinoid

1175
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,000
system when we

1176
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:07,118
modify the gun microbiome are partly

1177
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,519
responsible

1178
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,960
for the effects of the modification of

1179
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:13,920
the gun microbiome

1180
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,199
and the other way around we try to if if

1181
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,280
when we change the

1182
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,559
the endocannabinoid dominant in a

1183
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,560
specific manner

1184
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:21,920
the changes we see in the gun microbiome

1185
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:25,279
participate

1186
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,440
in in in the effects of the

1187
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,760
the changes of the endocannabinoid so we

1188
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,280
can do that using exactly the same tools

1189
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,440
we were mentioning before

1190
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,920
plus more omics

1191
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,039
technologies like metagenomics to

1192
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,760
investigate the

1193
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:44,000
composition of the of the gun microbiome

1194
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,599
and the proteomics to investigate their

1195
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
proteome so

1196
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:49,519
and eventually we will have to ask to

1197
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,119
mathematicians to

1198
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:55,599
to to to look for algorithms that that

1199
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,760
explain that these correlations we find

1200
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,519
but there are mechanistic ways to look

1201
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,119
at the the relationship between these

1202
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,000
two worlds

1203
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,480
it's it's yeah it's really fascinating

1204
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,318
uh

1205
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,079
and the the crosstalk is super

1206
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:09,679
interesting um

1207
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,240
you know that it's it's not a one-way

1208
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:13,919
street that endocannabinoid doesn't just

1209
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:14,318
affect the microbiome or vice versa that

1210
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,358
it's

1211
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:18,639
back and forth and i would imagine too

1212
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:20,639
you know going back to something you

1213
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:24,159
mentioned very early on about the diet

1214
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:26,799
and you know that we have certain um

1215
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:28,639
requirements to have precursors for

1216
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,200
different things that our body needs to

1217
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,440
either construct the enzymes necessary

1218
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:35,519
to build up and break down

1219
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,280
um endocannabinoids or receptors or

1220
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:40,719
whatever so i imagine

1221
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,680
in just a simple manner the microbiome

1222
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:45,519
would be involved

1223
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:47,679
in influencing um

1224
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:49,358
how some of those precursor those

1225
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:50,318
building blocks that we get from our

1226
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:52,799
foods

1227
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:54,639
are actually made available to the body

1228
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,160
to even use for some of those

1229
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:59,118
biosynthetic pathways

1230
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:59,519
absolutely absolutely the the you know

1231
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,160
there is

1232
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:05,358
such a large biodiversity in the in the

1233
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:09,118
in the gun microbiome that

1234
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:09,679
obviously you can imagine these bags to

1235
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,480
do

1236
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,679
a lot of things a lot of things yeah

1237
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:17,440
they they

1238
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:18,480
they uh they were discovered because you

1239
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,240
know we could

1240
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,760
we could see how some of these

1241
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:23,598
microorganisms helped us

1242
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,119
processing stuff that we're not able to

1243
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,680
process

1244
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,440
uh what came out after that was that in

1245
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:32,639
the process of processing this

1246
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,880
for example complex uh fibers

1247
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:36,000
uh which we cannot process because we

1248
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,480
don't have the enzyme to make

1249
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,159
them this this uh these microorganisms

1250
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,760
this bacteria make

1251
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:44,078
molecules like the short chain fatty

1252
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,760
acids that are strongly active

1253
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:50,000
both on the gut but also on the on the

1254
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,000
uh on the brain because they can travel

1255
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,838
uh in the bloodstream in which enrich

1256
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,079
the brain or act on the

1257
00:44:53,838 --> 00:45:00,318
on the peripheral nervous system and and

1258
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,240
influence the behavior as well so

1259
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:05,279
clearly there are many many

1260
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,479
possibility that uh the microbiome can

1261
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:09,119
modify

1262
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,079
the endocannabinoid dome that they the

1263
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,318
microorganisms make

1264
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:13,680
enzymes that are similar uh to the

1265
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:14,880
enzymes that degrade the

1266
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:17,598
endocannabinoids

1267
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,480
in fact some of some of the commensal

1268
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,318
bacteria

1269
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,480
they also make endocannabinoid-like

1270
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:25,039
mediators so they make compounds

1271
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,039
mediators that are very similar to the

1272
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:28,800
the the sisters and cousins of the of

1273
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:31,199
anandamide and to a g

1274
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,000
so and they were shown to act on the

1275
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:35,199
same receptors

1276
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,079
so the chemical differences between the

1277
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:38,879
these molecules when they're made by the

1278
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:42,240
microbes

1279
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,760
are not such to impede them from to

1280
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,598
to prevent them from interacting with

1281
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,119
the same receptors so

1282
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,680
there is there is really a lot of

1283
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:53,599
possibilities for for crosstalk

1284
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:55,279
um and of course as you mentioned

1285
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:56,640
the even though we're perfectly capable

1286
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,440
of processing most

1287
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:01,118
most fatty acids there are fatty acids

1288
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,679
that we cannot make

1289
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:05,680
like the the pollen saturated omega-3

1290
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:08,719
and omega-6 fatty acids

1291
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:09,118
so for that we rely on the diet and and

1292
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:12,559
these

1293
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:15,358
fatty acids uh can change the function

1294
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:17,599
of the of the microbiome so the the

1295
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:21,039
omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil

1296
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,640
for example uh we know we knew already

1297
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:24,639
that when you supplement them in the

1298
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:26,879
diet they can change the endocannabinoid

1299
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:26,879
dome

1300
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,480
now we know that they can also change

1301
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,358
the ground microbiome and some of the

1302
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,119
changes

1303
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,920
we see in one or the other are probably

1304
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:38,160
due to the fact that they're changing

1305
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,760
the other rather than than the former so

1306
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:42,159
the latter rather than the form so

1307
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,800
it's it's really uh it's really

1308
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:45,679
interesting

1309
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:46,800
we have um what is really difficult here

1310
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:49,440
is to

1311
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,440
to find models to study this uh this

1312
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,920
interaction because we cannot really do

1313
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,800
it

1314
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:56,800
in an in vivo setting so we we're

1315
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:00,079
developing in vitro

1316
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,720
systems uh for example the organoids

1317
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,960
where we can

1318
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:05,759
uh keep pieces of gut alive for several

1319
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,280
months

1320
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,800
we're now trying to find a way of

1321
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,760
inoculating them

1322
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,880
uh with with gut bacteria without

1323
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,040
killing them

1324
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,720
because all normally organoids are grown

1325
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:19,039
in antibiotics so

1326
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:20,558
uh so we need it's really challenging

1327
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:23,199
yes it's a big challenge

1328
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:25,760
but you know we can we can at least we

1329
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:27,838
can do this in an indirect way so we can

1330
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,839
take the media of the bacteria and see

1331
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:31,519
the effects that they have on the on the

1332
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:34,880
organoids

1333
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:38,480
but we can also do experiments

1334
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,760
on the on the microbiome outside

1335
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:44,159
the the organism using the so-called

1336
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,680
simulator of the human intestinal

1337
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:50,639
microbiome ecosystem or shine

1338
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:50,960
so we have a shine in in quebec where we

1339
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:55,440
we

1340
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:58,800
basically in state

1341
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:01,838
a real human microbiome so there is

1342
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,519
several flasks each of them mimicking

1343
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:05,358
the conditions you find in the stomach

1344
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:08,559
in the duodenum in the helium

1345
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:10,239
in the in the column so we we and if you

1346
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:13,680
put the fecal sample of

1347
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:16,879
of human being in in this system

1348
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:19,279
after a couple of weeks the bags will

1349
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,680
start populating the different parts of

1350
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,760
the of the shine

1351
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:25,679
in a way similar to what they do in a

1352
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,520
human uh

1353
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:29,838
gastrointestinal system and at that

1354
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:34,318
point when we have this shine

1355
00:48:29,838 --> 00:48:36,239
we can give it foods we can give it uh

1356
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:37,920
fish oil for example we can give it

1357
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:39,919
polyphenols we can give it

1358
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,960
many many dietary stuff and see what

1359
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,240
happens independently of the host

1360
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,559
and then we can find a way of

1361
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:48,239
introducing the host cells in this shine

1362
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,599
and this is more complicated but people

1363
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:51,598
are working on this

1364
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,200
there are very strong groups in in the

1365
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:56,720
netherlands were working in

1366
00:48:53,199 --> 00:49:00,639
in simulating uh the the microbiome in

1367
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:03,039
uh and the host interactions on a chip

1368
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:05,759
for example or in very small systems

1369
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:06,639
so once again technology is just waiting

1370
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,559
for us

1371
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:10,239
uh to ask the right uh the right

1372
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,240
questions

1373
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:13,759
absolutely yeah that is that is so

1374
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:15,039
fascinating to learn about how that

1375
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,960
research is done that's

1376
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:18,639
been something i've wondered for a while

1377
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,159
exactly how you

1378
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:22,159
start to piece all that out because it

1379
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:24,399
is so complicated and it sounds like

1380
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,799
you and i both share uh an interest in

1381
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,960
complex systems that's something that um

1382
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,240
yeah i definitely like as well i like

1383
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,960
puzzles and

1384
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:34,719
so all of this is uh yeah very very

1385
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,318
fascinating and i want to be sensitive

1386
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:39,439
to your time i know we're

1387
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:41,119
we're creeping over um over the hour

1388
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,119
here i've got one last question

1389
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,240
one thing that i think people

1390
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:47,119
misunderstand

1391
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:48,479
about the entourage effect is that in

1392
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:49,358
the research that was originally

1393
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,440
published

1394
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:52,960
that you were an author on that first

1395
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,920
described this effect as you were

1396
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,119
looking at

1397
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,599
2ag and you noticed that there were

1398
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,640
these

1399
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:02,160
other compounds that

1400
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:04,078
didn't seem to have much activity of

1401
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:06,558
their own on these receptors but when

1402
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,920
they were present with 2ag

1403
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:12,000
you got unique effects is it fair to say

1404
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,519
that the concept of the entourage effect

1405
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,559
has been a little manipulated

1406
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:20,079
in popular culture to sort of take on a

1407
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:21,519
meaning that is different than what was

1408
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,640
originally intended

1409
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:26,559
yeah absolutely i i agree and and both

1410
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:29,039
rafi and i wondered

1411
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:32,480
sometimes whether or not the the

1412
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:36,159
entourage idea had not been kind of uh

1413
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:38,559
mis misinterpreted or misunderstood in

1414
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:39,519
in many cases because you know it has

1415
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,400
been applied to

1416
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:43,838
to cannabis and to the pharmacology of

1417
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,358
cannabis which is a

1418
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:47,679
which is something that for a

1419
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:50,400
pharmacologist has really no meaning

1420
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:52,239
uh because you cannot speak about the

1421
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:53,760
pharmacology of a plant you can speak of

1422
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:55,358
the pharmacology of the

1423
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,359
of the components of the chemical

1424
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:59,358
components of the plant and even that is

1425
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:02,880
is quite difficult to to do

1426
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:07,358
so uh clearly the entourage effect as we

1427
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:10,400
conceived it was was

1428
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:12,400
was born to to explain why

1429
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,519
an undermined and to a g2 a gene

1430
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,400
particular

1431
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:17,199
was accompanied by in tissues in in

1432
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,160
blood in

1433
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,960
wherever we analyze it by congeners by

1434
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:23,519
by

1435
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,440
other monocyclists which at that time

1436
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,759
were thought to have no receptors so

1437
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:31,358
they were orphan of receptors okay so

1438
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,640
we wonder why would the cell make uh 2g

1439
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:34,558
together with these compounds or

1440
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:36,879
anandamide together with the its

1441
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:40,400
congeners if these congenitals have no

1442
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,280
uh no biological action that would be a

1443
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,800
waste

1444
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:47,359
of a of a biochemical machinery

1445
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,160
and then you know and he said okay maybe

1446
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:50,639
they're they're

1447
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:51,598
doing something to the main actor of of

1448
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:53,679
the scene

1449
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:56,480
and i thought that that something could

1450
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:59,440
be to their degradation because

1451
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,760
uh as as i mentioned both the anastasia

1452
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:06,400
and the monocyte glycerols can

1453
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:09,280
be degraded by the same the same

1454
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,240
enzymatic pathways as an undermined and

1455
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,119
to a g

1456
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:15,199
so clearly they can compete for their

1457
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:17,200
degradation by this enzyme

1458
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:18,480
and through these means they can enhance

1459
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:21,358
their they can prolong

1460
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,119
their lifespan and then then then

1461
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:24,159
enhance their activity and this is what

1462
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,280
we found that this is what we

1463
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:28,639
demonstrated

1464
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:31,680
in that paper but then uh we

1465
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:33,679
you know the concept went on forward and

1466
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:35,279
since for for some of these compounds it

1467
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:37,118
was really difficult at the beginning to

1468
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,200
find a receptor we

1469
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,160
we we carried out other different kind

1470
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:42,558
of of uh

1471
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:44,838
experiment for example whether these

1472
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:47,280
compounds could act as allosteric

1473
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:48,239
modulators of the receptors and in fact

1474
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,040
we found that

1475
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:51,519
one of them palmitoylethanolamide later

1476
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:53,920
on

1477
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:54,960
we showed would enhance the activity of

1478
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,079
anandamide

1479
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:01,199
at 3d1 channels so these were really the

1480
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,160
early times of endocannabinoid research

1481
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:04,078
and then

1482
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:05,519
many groups including the group of

1483
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,920
danielle piomenli

1484
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:09,679
and and others showed that in fact these

1485
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,559
congeners were not inactive

1486
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:14,639
they had their own receptors and these

1487
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:17,519
receptors in some cases did

1488
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:19,598
uh things uh quite different from uh

1489
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:20,079
from the cb1 and cb2 in some cases

1490
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,039
things

1491
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,240
even opposite so the entourage effect

1492
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:26,838
was kind of uh

1493
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:28,558
crushed by by this idea because if if

1494
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:31,759
28g

1495
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:33,680
acts on cb1 and by acting on cb1

1496
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,920
stimulates food intake stimulates fat

1497
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:38,558
accumulation and its congenital act on

1498
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,039
another receptor known as gpr119 which

1499
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,800
is

1500
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:43,119
which is doing exactly the opposite

1501
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:47,200
there is no no more entourage effect

1502
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:49,440
at the organismal level so

1503
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:51,118
that was really something to be

1504
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,960
interpreted for the

1505
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:57,200
particular historical situation and

1506
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,318
i think it's still valid in some cells

1507
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:00,000
for example when

1508
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,599
because in all cells these compounds are

1509
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,760
produced together with their and

1510
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:04,960
congenitals and not necessarily the

1511
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,720
receptors of these

1512
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,960
congenitals are there so when they're

1513
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:10,959
not there maybe and when cb1 and cb2

1514
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,199
receptors that may be they're actually

1515
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,119
acting as entourage compounds the

1516
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:17,118
situation in the plant where it has been

1517
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,760
proposed that some terpenoids

1518
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:20,640
could enhance the activity of of thc or

1519
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,480
cbd

1520
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:24,159
or that other phytocannabinoids could

1521
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:28,318
enhance the

1522
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:29,838
is completely different and and and

1523
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:32,318
i don't know if there is an entourage

1524
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:33,679
effect in cannabis

1525
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:36,318
i don't know whether it explains

1526
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:38,879
anything if there is one

1527
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:40,400
but but clearly it's different from from

1528
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,519
what we did what we

1529
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:46,240
uh conceived uh in the 1990s with

1530
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:47,679
with rafi yeah absolutely and i think

1531
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:49,439
that's a really big thing

1532
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:51,759
that a lot of people listening to this

1533
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,000
are unaware of uh mostly because i mean

1534
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,799
a lot

1535
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,079
of casual you know lay people that are

1536
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:56,400
interested in cannabis a lot of them

1537
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,798
aren't

1538
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,798
going to the original research papers

1539
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:02,318
and and reading the technical details on

1540
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:04,079
how these things came about

1541
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:05,679
so i think i think that's very important

1542
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,960
to point out because a lot of times what

1543
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:08,879
i teach is that

1544
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,079
we now know enough to realize how much

1545
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,160
we don't know

1546
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,440
and you know and and we and we have

1547
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:16,960
learned a lot

1548
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:18,880
um but a lot of times in the industry

1549
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,720
a lot of claims are made that we know a

1550
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,480
lot more i think the emperor

1551
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:23,838
effect as it has been used today is

1552
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,519
something different

1553
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:31,039
uh it's it's basically stating

1554
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:34,480
another potential truth is that the the

1555
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:38,159
the the effect of the

1556
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:41,039
of the the the sums of the effect

1557
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:41,679
okay the effect of the single components

1558
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:44,318
together

1559
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:45,118
is stronger than the sums of the effects

1560
00:55:44,318 --> 00:55:48,239
taken along

1561
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:50,240
right uh this is this is

1562
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:51,519
this could be true but it's not the

1563
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:53,358
entourage effect that uh

1564
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:54,960
that rafi and i thought about okay the

1565
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:56,798
entire effect

1566
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,480
something that comes together with the

1567
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:01,759
with the main actor and is

1568
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:03,280
protecting it uh from being uh

1569
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,960
it's a real entourage effect if you

1570
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,880
think of it from being degraded

1571
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:08,240
from it's it's enhancing its activity

1572
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,358
it's visibility

1573
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:13,759
uh and uh and the entourage the the

1574
00:56:11,358 --> 00:56:16,159
synergistic effect that you find in some

1575
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,280
plant preparations it's probably i'm not

1576
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:19,679
saying it's not true

1577
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,720
but it's different from what we what we

1578
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,719
we found and it's probably due to

1579
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:27,279
different components acting on different

1580
00:56:24,719 --> 00:56:30,078
receptors in a synergistic manner

1581
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,440
rather than in an additive or a

1582
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:34,559
counteractive

1583
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:36,400
manner yeah yeah absolutely the way i

1584
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,440
always describe the entourage effects

1585
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,760
i'm always kind of

1586
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,639
a hyper analytical person anyway but i

1587
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:42,160
always say that

1588
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:44,798
the entourage effect was initially

1589
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:46,879
conceived to describe an effect

1590
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:48,719
that that has components that generally

1591
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,200
you couldn't identify their effects

1592
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:53,279
yeah by themselves and then in together

1593
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,879
they had unique effects which is

1594
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,960
slightly different than this sort of

1595
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,440
herbalism synergy kind of

1596
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:01,280
exactly kind of concept yeah that's

1597
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,240
that's really great to clarify

1598
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,960
well before um any more hurricanes come

1599
00:57:04,239 --> 00:57:08,000
your way

1600
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,519
and uh and knock us out here i hope it's

1601
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,960
in you for today

1602
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:15,358
i know yeah yeah um off

1603
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,318
off uh recording we were talking about

1604
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:17,920

and we've been struggling to finish the

1607
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,400
interview because of uh thunderstorms

1608
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,440
coming through but you can put things

1609
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,039
together right

1610
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,039
oh yeah i'll edit it together no one

1611
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:29,440
will know the difference but um

1612
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,880
