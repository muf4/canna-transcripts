1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,140
I grew up in Jersey so you know the war

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,689
on drugs was really real you know where

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:08,518
I grew up I had the scene people getting

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,530
locked up or I was always taught to

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,320
believe that cannabis or marijuana at

6
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:15,808
the time or reefer as I was written you

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,899
know how people's to talk about it where

8
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:20,820
I'm from was a gateway drug so you know

9
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:22,288
throughout my whole life you know and

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,719
especially you know me going you know to

11
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,000
the NBA you out of high school I was

12
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,288
always afraid of cannabis and when I got

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,178
in the NBA that was the first time that

14
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,219
I saw actually like you know top-notch

15
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:33,689
players actually using cannabis but at

16
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,670
the time I still didn't understand it I

17
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:37,289
said that makes sense to me and I look

18
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,950
down on our teammates that use cannabis

19
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:42,299
but in 2011 my grandmother had come to

20
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,280
see me play when I was playing for the

21
00:00:42,299 --> 00:00:45,959
Denver Nuggets and you know Denver is

22
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,329
obviously one of the first Marcus to you

23
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,370
know happen but medical program and she

24
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,140
suffered from glaucoma and you know

25
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:54,238
glaucoma was always the first you know

26
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,219
thing that cannabis was you know they

27
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,959
actually healed was I you know was it

28
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,879
was something that considered to heal so

29
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,009
I was able to convince her to try

30
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:03,839
cannabis and it was hard because you

31
00:01:02,009 --> 00:01:07,019
know she was the main person growing up

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,450
telling us that you know we was a was a

33
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,340
gateway drug and um when I was able to

34
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,439
get her to try it and I checked on hour

35
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,960
and a half later and uh when I went

36
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,149
downstairs she was downstairs reading

37
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:20,309
her Bible and you know when I asked her

38
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,960
how she was doing she said I'm healed

39
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,340
she that's the first time I've been able

40
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,559
to read my Bible in over three and a

41
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,210
half years and for me that correlation

42
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,310
was just crazy that you know from

43
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:30,719
someone like her and I always say like

44
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,659
if my grandmother's not going to heaven

45
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,340
we're all going to hell and you know for

46
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,109
the first thing that she would do would

47
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,540
actually go down and read her Bible

48
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:41,090
you know she spoke volumes to me and at

49
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,950
that point I started to educate myself

50
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:46,409
the end of that season I she had a knee

51
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,960
surgery and got a staph infection and I

52
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,670
was in hospital for you know ten days I

53
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,069
have you know four surgeries in a week

54
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,759
and at some point I thought I was gonna

55
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:57,898
die but uh when I was sitting in there

56
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,209
you know obviously I'm taking all this

57
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,519
pain medication and this lady that I had

58
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:05,639
knew in Colorado came to see me and she

59
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:07,349
introduced me to CBD and she gave me all

60
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,959
these topical she gave me tinctures

61
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:12,370
capsules and you know ever since that

62
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,530
day I haven't taken a hat friend

63
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:17,289
taking an Advil I haven't taken any

64
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,068
pharmaceutical drugs to manage my pain

65
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:20,068
away from the game
