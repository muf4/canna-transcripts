2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:13,919
if I'm watching you know a news channel

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:16,640
and there's a doctor who um wants to

4
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:18,519
kind of discredit cannabis as medicine

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,480
you know often you'll hear them use the

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,879
term well a lot of people just use it to

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,560
get high and the journalist or the host

8
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:29,599
of the show or whatever goes oh right

9
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:31,839
right right I I understand um but is the

10
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,000
doctor and that journalist even sharing

11
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:36,039
the same definition of what getting high

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,039
means or they have completely different

13
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:41,039
ideas of how to define getting high and

14
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,679
they just nod their head and agree on it

15
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,600
without really having any sort of

16
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:48,558
discourse to Define what getting high

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,960
means you know when when I hear people

18
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:53,358
use the term you know getting high I

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,679
always like to say what does that mean

20
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,359
you know and I think it would be

21
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,039
interesting to get a huge different

22
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,559
cross-section of people and ask him what

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,600
does that term mean

24
00:01:00,558 --> 00:01:04,640
to some people getting high means up to

25
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,680
no good to other people getting high

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,280
means temporarily forgetting about your

27
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,920
problems to you know relieve stress to

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,759
other people um getting high means to

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,040
avoid your problems which is a Bad Thing

30
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:20,680
some people getting high means um you

31
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,799
know those people who dodge the draft

32
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,200
and aren't Patriots or there's just so

33
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:28,600
much tied up in what getting to some

34
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,280
people getting high means I'm a rebel

35
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:33,239
you know what I mean or getting High

36
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,920
means you know I I think for myself to

37
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:39,679
other people getting high means you know

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:42,000
I I I disagree with my parents so it's

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,680
like there's no real clear-cut

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
understood definition of what getting

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,920
high means so I think it's a really

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,239
dangerous

43
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:55,359
uh kind of irresponsible term to use um

44
00:01:53,239 --> 00:02:00,359
especially if you're a medical

45
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:02,599
professional um so uh I I just think you

46
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,560
know our word choice it's like it's real

47
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:07,759
easy to come up with a term that can u

48
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,560
mean so many different things

49
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,639
and that's to me that's an interesting

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,280
conversation whenever someone uses the

51
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:17,119
term getting high and I say what's that

52
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,439
mean I always get a a completely

53
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,640
different answer from everybody one of

54
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,959
the big things we hear against um people

55
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:26,518
who are against the use of cannabis is

56
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,159
that well a lot of people just want to

57
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,280
use it to get high and I hear doctors

58
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,159
use this term a lot oh people use it to

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,039
get high but I think that's such a

60
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,479
non-medical term and if we're talking

61
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,239
about cannabis in terms of you know

62
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:42,318
wellness and medicinal use I would like

63
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,640
to know I would like to hear what a

64
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:49,399
thousand different people thought or

65
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:51,679
think the word getting high means

66
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:56,599
um because I think it means something

67
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:59,360
different to almost everyone and

68
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:01,439
uh you know I think a bunch of people

69
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,120
attribute whatever negative thing they

70
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,359
want to the term getting high and some

71
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,799
people think of getting high as a

72
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,360
positive thing but what does what does

73
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,480
it mean to get

74
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,680
high I think another thing that would be

75
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:18,318
interesting to to have journalists

76
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:22,200
explore is um due to the rise of these

77
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:25,359
CBD only laws in certain States

78
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,598
um uh where you know CBD because it's

79
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,319
been on CNN and Sanjay gup has heralded

80
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:33,518
it and it's non psychoactive it's

81
00:03:29,318 --> 00:03:35,158
getting a of good press right now um and

82
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,599
the there's kind of this

83
00:03:35,158 --> 00:03:41,199
misunderstanding that's being formed and

84
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:45,839
perpetuated in Congress and other places

85
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:49,000
where CBD is the medicinal component of

86
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,239
marijuana and THC is the recreational

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,560
component of marijuana and that's not

88
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,560
true they're both very therapeutic you

89
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,079
know

90
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,799
molecules and um the two of them

91
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,439
together when combined are more

92
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:08,040
effective than either one um used

93
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:10,280
alone and so I think one of the things

94
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:13,400
that one of the conversations that

95
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:18,560
cannabis also starts is the the rise of

96
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:22,120
uh whole plant medicine or um maybe the

97
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,839
um the notion that something Beyond a

98
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,079
single molecule medicine can be more

99
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:28,758
effective right like the whole reason

100
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:32,758
Whole Foods called their supermarket

101
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:34,840
Whole Foods is because you know why take

102
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,038
vitamins from a pill when you can get

103
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:40,198
your vitamins from Whole Foods right and

104
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:42,839
a carrot or a or a beet or you know

105
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,919
different foods they have a whole Litany

106
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,839
of of uh different nutrients in them

107
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:52,319
rather than just a single molecule you

108
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:55,879
know rather than a single nutrient so um

109
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:58,120
that's another aspect of um how cannabis

110
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:00,279
is pushing a conversation forward is you

111
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:04,160
know plant-based medicine

112
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:05,519
um the popularity of you know medicines

113
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,720
that aren't just single molecule

114
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:11,478
medicines that can have you

115
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,880
know a multitude of beneficial effects

116
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:17,000
and then of course we've all heard of

117
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:24,620
the term the Entourage effect so

118
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,620
