2
00:00:04,609 --> 00:00:10,710
in retail right now there's probably

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,109
only about 800 plus retail permit issued

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,990
by the state the state thought that they

5
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:19,129
would have almost three thousand retail

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,710
locations so they didn't have as many

7
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:25,799
places for cultivators or manufacturers

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,800
to put their products in so of course

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,089
there's been somewhat of a fall out of

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,000
people expecting this market to

11
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:36,238
literally right at the get-go be a

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,469
booming industry we each have our own

13
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:42,419
set of struggles in the retail area

14
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:45,960
mainly it's the resistance that cities

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,239
and counties are not writing rules or

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,210
regulations and of course they hang

17
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:54,959
their hat on a California Supreme Court

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:58,289
ruling saying that locales can in fact

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,948
ban or put a moratorium in place at

20
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:04,500
locations so currently only 20% of the

21
00:01:01,948 --> 00:01:07,319
California cities are actually opening

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,200
up their market delivery was another

23
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:12,478
issue where delivery you had to have

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,570
either a retail storefront or a

25
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,759
warehouse to originate from and the

26
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:21,658
state says basically you could deliver

27
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,599
across any city property line however

28
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,570
I'm in Ventura County a very hostile

29
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:31,859
County the Chief of Police of Ventura

30
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:35,069
who is name is Ken corny he told me in a

31
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:37,769
meeting about two years ago that 2019

32
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:41,219
and 2020 would be in the most profitable

33
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:43,938
year for his Police Department for civil

34
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:48,060
forfeiture and it's looking like that

35
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:50,819
Ventura Oxnard and the ten cities inside

36
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,810
Ventura only to have opened up their

37
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:57,959
hearts to offer cannabis as an access

38
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,868
portal either delivery or retail that's

39
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:02,519
Ojai and Port Hueneme the next city

40
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:05,549
that's going to open up is going to be

41
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:08,030
oxen Arden with six permits this year

42
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:11,280
maybe two more the following a year

43
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,560
Ventura still has not opened up the

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,909
conversation and I'm not sure whether

45
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,390
they

46
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:20,449
ever will because of the embedded

47
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:23,989
Republican conservative party against

48
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:26,869
just say no to drugs I have a raised

49
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:30,230
already about four and a half million

50
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:34,250
dollars to for a legal war chest to

51
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:36,949
challenge the state act of banning at

52
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:42,469
city and county level I have a vast

53
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:46,099
legal background I was rated in 2019 I'm

54
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:48,800
sorry raid in 2015 it took 21 months to

55
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:50,599
get out of that mess but basically they

56
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,510
threw every felony count they could

57
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:55,960
think of against me and spent five days

58
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:59,120
in jail forty four felony counts

59
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,969
mandatory sixty three years and every

60
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,330
count was dismissed I wasn't sure if I

61
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:09,020
was going to get a fair trial in Ventura

62
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:12,080
County we changed our corporation from a

63
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:14,960
not-for-profit which is what almost all

64
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,790
of the organizations were in California

65
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:21,950
and when a b-26 six came out we

66
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:25,849
basically did not want to rewrite the

67
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:28,759
rules of land use and zoning laws so

68
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:32,090
they basically wanted you to convert to

69
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:35,389
a full for-profit corporation we are now

70
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:38,150
that as shangri-la care centers with

71
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:41,539
announced so we've merged with two other

72
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:44,090
states with multiple permit holders when

73
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:46,729
the gauntlet of the federal control

74
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,500
substance act changes so we will be

75
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:50,629
opening up centers not only in

76
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:55,400
California but in other states New

77
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:57,829
Mexico Arizona and also Colorado well we

78
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,110
will have a micro license the city of

79
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,680
Ojai has authorized that we will have a

80
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:06,650
micro which will allow us to add

81
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,260
manufacturing and also distributing you

82
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:17,660
could add only four licenses under type

83
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:19,969
12 yeah so we are we just opened up the

84
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:22,640
pharmacy which is the first 21 Plus out

85
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:25,310
all used to dispensary in the history of

86
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,079
Santa Barbara so as a hometown Santa

87
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,470
Barbara boy that was that was a pretty

88
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,870
fun

89
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,430
thing for me to put in the books they

90
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,490
have a three permits total for the

91
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,079
entire city which you know 45 minutes

92
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,790
from santa barbara ohio so basically

93
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,490
it's the only three dispensaries within

94
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,960
a 45-minute radius in any direction that

95
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,699
are out all use so it's actually you

96
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,930
know a pretty big deal and i think it's

97
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:46,579
you know the response from the community

98
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,139
in santa barbara has been amazing i mean

99
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:50,629
to the to the point that i had somebody

100
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:53,479
at a restaurant buy me lunch to thank us

101
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:55,399
for what we've done because she uses it

102
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,100
as a medical treatment and she was

103
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:59,750
driving you know to Port Hueneme or LA

104
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,180
or Ojai I mean it's you know a long

105
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,759
drive and now she can she can find it in

106
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:08,420
town so she really appreciated that um I

107
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:10,909
mean I think it's an interesting micro

108
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,830
example of the macro process that's

109
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,930
going on which is a you know I think the

110
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:16,430
state vastly underestimated the friction

111
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,980
that was created with a dual layer

112
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,139
licensing policy they you know prop 64

113
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:24,290
when it was voted on two and a half

114
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:25,819
years ago went into effect in 2018 Santa

115
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,189
Barbara is a progressive City and

116
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:30,918
because of the process of writing those

117
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:33,050
local regulations just a month ago to an

118
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:34,849
you know two years after prop 64 went

119
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,410
into effect basically we got our first

120
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,520
dispensary and I think that's part of

121
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,040
you know you're seeing that at a

122
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,569
statewide level there's you know six

123
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,490
hundred and thirteen dispensaries that

124
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:44,509
are actually have their doors open adult

125
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,939
use you know perhaps sixty-four

126
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:48,769
dispensaries in Colorado Washington

127
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:50,839
Oregon you've got a dispensary for every

128
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:53,000
5,000 people in California have a

129
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:54,829
dispensary for every 35,000 people if

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,290
you did the math California should have

131
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:58,759
probably you know seven to nine thousand

132
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,410
dispensaries right now they've got a

133
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,478
tenth of that right and I think that's

134
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,220
you know I should say they have the six

135
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:06,050
thousand dispensaries it's just 80% of

136
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,910
them are unlicensed illicit market

137
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,949
dispensaries right so on the on the

138
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,479
legal side and the license side you've

139
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:13,490
got a tenth of the dispensaries that we

140
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:16,279
should have right and if you look at the

141
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,900
stats 2018 was actually a contraction in

142
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:20,719
the market cannabis sales were the last

143
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:22,339
in 2018 than 2017 it's come back now but

144
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,419
that was basically the opposite of what

145
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:25,159
everyone thought was going to happen

146
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:27,349
with prop 64 they thought it was going

147
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,200
to you know be as huge immediate booming

148
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,490
market the reality is you know 60% of

149
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,680
counties and cities aren't allowing it

150
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:35,300
and then the 40% that are it's taking

151
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,769
them years to write the ordinances and

152
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,728
go through a permitting process that

153
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:39,288
ends up eventually

154
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:40,609
like Santa Barbara you know two and a

155
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:41,060
half years later that we finally opened

156
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,830
the doors

157
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,420
the public has you know safe legal

158
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:45,979
access again so it's been really

159
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,840
interesting to watch out things got

160
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:54,620
tighter not looser where the politics

161
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:56,719
the poor so far from it

162
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:01,790
three for medical and three for

163
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:14,270
recreation so the county has zero

164
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:15,800
dispensaries open right now yeah so a

165
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:18,500
little bit more nuance said they will

166
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,060
have retail but again the process of

167
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,290
writing these local ordinances it's very

168
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,730
different than like for example in

169
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,319
Nevada where the state said okay it's

170
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,060
legal in Nevada that's the rule in

171
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,069
California they said it's here's the

172
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,290
state rules up here and then all of that

173
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:32,389
is predicated on municipalities City and

174
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,610
counties down below so for Santa Barbara

175
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:36,199
County for example just decided a month

176
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,790
ago that they're going to switch from a

177
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,259
lottery process for awarding the eight

178
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,939
permits that they're gonna have to a

179
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:43,490
merit-based process so it will now take

180
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:45,469
them six to nine months to debate what

181
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,970
the merit-based process looks like then

182
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,410
they'll put that in ordinance and then

183
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,060
they'll have you know three to six month

184
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,950
window to submit your applications and

185
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,649
then they'll have a three to nine month

186
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:56,000
application analysis process and then

187
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:57,439
they'll issue that permits and then

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,670
you'll take six months to get a building

189
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,949
permit and then you'll take six months

190
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:02,810
to do your your build-out right so those

191
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:06,680
Santa Barbara County dispensaries that

192
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:08,810
will come you know that's a 2021 2022

193
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,280
prospect before a customer walks in the

194
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,509
door which again I think is that you

195
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:13,699
know that really interesting thing that

196
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:15,589
California is on one hand the most

197
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:17,060
interesting the biggest miss probably

198
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:18,889
twenty it's 27 percent of the national

199
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,959
market on the other hand it is the most

200
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:22,969
immature because of the way that they

201
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,909
set the licensing up and how slow the

202
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:27,290
process is so you know again if Colorado

203
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,790
is decides California be nine thousand

204
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,990
Spencer its California six hundred like

205
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,430
that's where we're at and it's going to

206
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,730
stay it's give me a slow process for the

207
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,730
next two years

208
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,940
tickets right because you have

209
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:43,689
you know three or six maybe in total and

210
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,560
you're well we have three in ojai

211
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:51,820
allowed

212
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:53,948
we're both medical and recreational well

213
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,910
let me let me share something he just

214
00:08:53,948 --> 00:08:59,828
opened up my hat is off to him because

215
00:08:57,909 --> 00:09:03,278
even though he's a competitor of mine

216
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:05,349
and has helped or basically I've lost a

217
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:07,509
little bit of my retail market because

218
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,790
he's open now but let me tell you the

219
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:13,509
similarities of what we have in common

220
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:16,539
is both of us are pit bulls you have to

221
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:19,389
be a pit bull in this industry to just

222
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:23,049
weather the storm and the rockiness of

223
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:26,860
all the stuff we have to deal with we

224
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:30,250
can't even describe the hours and hours

225
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:32,289
of due diligence that we've done and the

226
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:35,679
challenges that have been put before us

227
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:38,289
as he mentioned about lottery it you

228
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,750
know I was able to acts that with our

229
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:43,539
city government basically by saying a

230
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:46,539
simple phrase is it the luckiest that

231
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:48,610
win the ticket together store or the

232
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:50,409
most qualified which would you rather

233
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:51,310
have especially in Santa Barbara I mean

234
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:53,230
that you know there's a library

235
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:54,458
intelligent market yeah there's a lot of

236
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:56,649
oversight going in there and what they

237
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:58,929
decided they didn't want was the luck of

238
00:09:56,649 --> 00:10:01,028
the draw they wanted to analyze the

239
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:02,888
operators and pick the ones that best

240
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:04,720
fit their you know criteria that they

241
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:06,759
were looking for so you know I think in

242
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,410
cannabis in all areas a cannabis retail

243
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:10,389
included you know you have to have

244
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:11,889
persistence as a philosophy right is

245
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:13,299
there there will be a thousand

246
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:15,250
roadblocks that will blow up some of

247
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:16,629
them totally inequitably not your fault

248
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,828
I mean as an example when we were going

249
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:19,778
down their path with a pharmacy of

250
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:21,849
opening up the medical and we completed

251
00:10:19,778 --> 00:10:23,860
the entire medical application process

252
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,120
after we'd finished that while we were

253
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,350
waiting for them to review it they

254
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,060
decided they were going to rewrite the

255
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,620
ordinance I'm glad they did because they

256
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:31,239
reconciled it with adults and all that

257
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,769
but we'd spent you know we had a

258
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,870
property under contract paying a lease

259
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:36,310
for three years as they changed the

260
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,500
rules while we were going through the

261
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:40,239
process right and so it would be really

262
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,190
easy to say screw this I'm out of here

263
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,480
but at the end of the day we were you

264
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:46,019
know both of us were able to get it over

265
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,019
the line and

266
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:53,120
yeah and it has to be if you don't own

267
00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:55,969
it and it's a landlord or type a lease

268
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,250
property you have to have approval yeah

269
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,319
yeah the problem will crawl the property

270
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,429
to even submit your application which is

271
00:11:00,318 --> 00:11:04,099
I mean if you think about what that

272
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:05,419
means that means yeah science sign a

273
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,490
lease for two years then submit your

274
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:08,929
application to find out if you get it

275
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,039
right I mean and through that process

276
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:11,149
they were gonna have five in Santa

277
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:12,919
Barbara they cut it down to three right

278
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:14,448
so all along this the rules are just

279
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:16,039
constantly changing underneath you and

280
00:11:14,448 --> 00:11:17,659
but now you know we're in a good we're

281
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:19,759
in a good spot and you know as you

282
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:21,860
mentioned like this market is so new and

283
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,959
so nascent that it's not a it's not a

284
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:25,850
its competitor help each other market

285
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:27,018
out not a not a competitor fight with

286
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,399
each other kind of market I mean we're

287
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,399
all high tides are lifting all boats

288
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,419
[Music]

289
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:55,818
well brands are interesting because I

290
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,519
have two competitors that are within 200

291
00:11:55,818 --> 00:12:01,549
feet of me so we're all within on the

292
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:04,339
same street the key here is to have

293
00:12:01,549 --> 00:12:06,620
unique brands for each store that way

294
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:08,360
you're not competing on price point and

295
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,149
what happens is you end up in a price

296
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,430
bidding war one guy lowers the price

297
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:16,370
then you lower it you lower it doesn't

298
00:12:13,429 --> 00:12:19,338
help us meet the challenges of finances

299
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:22,220
with the 280e rule preventing us from

300
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:26,990
writing off expenses we are not making

301
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:29,629
money as everyone is so thing the 280e

302
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:33,110
rule prevents us from writing off rent

303
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:35,360
phone salaries the only write off

304
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,818
technically that we can write off is the

305
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,220
cost of goods so if you do a million

306
00:12:37,818 --> 00:12:42,469
dollars and we're forced in the state

307
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,420
level to be sixty percent profit margin

308
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,490
you're going to pay six hundred thousand

309
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:48,769
for your inventory that leaves four

310
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:51,230
hundred thousand to cover all of your

311
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:53,808
yearly expenses if you're a million for

312
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:55,610
the year then on top of that you have

313
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:57,889
all your salaries you may have two

314
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:58,490
hundred and fifty thousand in salaries

315
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:02,839
for your

316
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:05,709
gender and supervisors and so forth but

317
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:11,120
at the end you may end up spending 70%

318
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:12,289
taxes on the net dollars so you really -

319
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,899
80 is something that they're you know

320
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:16,699
that they will change yeah it's it's

321
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:18,230
completely an equitable we were forced

322
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,730
to pay taxes but we paid at a rate

323
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,560
that's you know two to three times what

324
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,909
anybody else pays so it really doesn't

325
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:24,199
make a lot of sense well you know while

326
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:25,309
having the friction of not having bank

327
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,200
accounts and all the other stuff that

328
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:29,599
goes along again persistence has to be a

329
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,709
philosophy in this but I think one of

330
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,180
the things you to your question one of

331
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,889
the things we're seeing particularly in

332
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,519
Santa Barbara is we really over index

333
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:36,409
for flour

334
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,028
I think people it's a it's kind of a

335
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:40,159
traditional cannabis market from that

336
00:13:38,028 --> 00:13:42,139
point of view we sell our biggest

337
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,419
category is flour which is probably not

338
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:46,220
the case for a dispensary down in LA

339
00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:47,870
where its contents extracts and vapes

340
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,070
and things like that the other thing

341
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,330
that we see is people actually really

342
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,820
care about where the product comes from

343
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:55,278
we have a local section and the pharmacy

344
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,379
and it's one of the areas that consumers

345
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,730
walk in the doors and what what can I

346
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:00,528
get that's grown in Santa Barbara and

347
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:04,789
that's actually really fun to see it's

348
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:05,958
you know it's along the vein yeah they

349
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:07,189
want to know their farmer you know it's

350
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,629
the farmer's market kind of mentality

351
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,240
and that's I think because the

352
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:13,730
demographic that we have and that that

353
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,579
that's good for all of us actually and

354
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:19,100
of course in Santa Barbara and some of

355
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:23,078
the other areas there's a big focus on

356
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:25,670
organic growing and using pesticides

357
00:14:23,078 --> 00:14:27,528
pesticide free recycling water all kinds

358
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:29,990
of great stuff natural sun-grown that

359
00:14:27,528 --> 00:14:32,570
this is just way the industry is going

360
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,789
to go for the kind of the connoisseur of

361
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:51,528
this industry were the people who really

362
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:54,169
care about their health more money

363
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:57,230
because you have all these 280e issues

364
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:58,740
and other things what are you doing in

365
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:02,070
your shops are you

366
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:04,169
well I just some furniture my brands

367
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:06,780
different from the other two competitors

368
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:09,479
that I have they have some products that

369
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:13,579
I wish I had but it's just not worth it

370
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,580
for me to end up in being a pricing war

371
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:20,669
[Music]

372
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:22,889
in in my area it's a little different

373
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:26,729
because Ohio was one of the few cities

374
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:28,799
that did not employ a city tax there

375
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:32,159
were two methodologies about getting

376
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,479
taxes one was having voter approval some

377
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,360
cities have already gone through that

378
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,810
process or counties and they are already

379
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,360
set to add a certain tax on a good

380
00:15:39,809 --> 00:15:44,009
example as oxen are we have a 6% tax and

381
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,480
a cannabis specific tax and said the

382
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,399
city of Santa Barbara for example so

383
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,120
sales tax plus six point which I don't

384
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:52,740
have right by the time you take

385
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,740
something off the shelf in California

386
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:59,070
it's about half the prices taxes yep so

387
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,200
that hurt us as the industry grows I was

388
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:03,180
the black market a lot though well

389
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,240
that's our biggest competitor I don't

390
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:06,959
feel he's my competitor as a retailer in

391
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,019
Santa Barbara

392
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,780
he's a helper in getting this industry

393
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:15,299
out in the open and getting it to where

394
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:16,860
we have down stigmas educating consumers

395
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:19,490
and those are the challenges that we

396
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,710
share together exactly as opposed to

397
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:24,629
I've been in laboratory requiring

398
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:27,690
laboratory testing all the way back to

399
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:29,840
2009 now of course it's mandatory in the

400
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:32,640
regulated market and with the vape

401
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:36,360
controversy going on right now it's even

402
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:40,860
more critical that proper testing have

403
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:42,810
done so another thing I'm talking to

404
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,909
brands about is like let's say they sold

405
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:47,009
you know typical retail as I sell you

406
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:49,529
something for 10 you sell it for 20 out

407
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:51,389
the door a lot of times they're seeing

408
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:53,169
kind of like I sell the retail or

409
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:56,528
something for 10 and I look I don't

410
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:59,620
shop and it's selling for 30 so what's

411
00:16:56,528 --> 00:17:01,360
kind of that's hard for me to do yeah

412
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,860
that's no we're not we're not doing that

413
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,630
I'm and if we're not doing it I'd be

414
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,640
real surprised if somebody in LA with

415
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,980
the cowboy shop next door not paying any

416
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,990
taxes is able to do that I mean they may

417
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,578
might look like that because it's

418
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,599
basically a third for the brand a third

419
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:15,578
for the shop and a third for the

420
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,048
government so maybe maybe that's what

421
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:19,000
they're seeing but we're certainly not

422
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:20,588
doing more than Keystone or you know

423
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,279
hundred-percent kind of typical retail

424
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:26,048
markup and even then you're taking out

425
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,389
15% for your excise tax and you're

426
00:17:26,048 --> 00:17:31,629
paying whatever your County tax is or

427
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:45,070
that city tax for sale tax and then on

428
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:46,630
top of that the city tax I think in

429
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:48,939
general in the cannabis supply chain

430
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,320
there's there's a lot of people figuring

431
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,759
it out I mean cannabis is a tough

432
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,990
business because the rules change and

433
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:54,490
there's a ton a ton of external

434
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,919
frictions that you're not used to having

435
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,890
so I you know one of the frustrations is

436
00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:04,080
that nobody has really got it nailed yet

437
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:06,759
right so we probably work with 8 to 15

438
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,439
distributors there's some bet some good

439
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:10,179
ones and there's a whole bunch of not

440
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,070
very good ones right and and by the not

441
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:13,419
very good I mean you know you ordered 20

442
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:14,950
of something on a toot and it's supposed

443
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:16,870
to be there on Tuesday and it shows up

444
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,400
on Friday and there's 8 of them right or

445
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:19,869
it's the wrong 20 or whatever it's like

446
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,070
the number of times the distributor

447
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:22,869
shows up at the right time of the right

448
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:25,659
day with the right in manifest an

449
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:27,519
inventory list is you know 10 percent of

450
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,320
the time so that's hard to run a shop

451
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,418
based on that kind of inconsistent

452
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:32,829
supply chain they're getting better but

453
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:35,320
that's it's a challenge every day

454
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:37,960
the other thing changes with the BCC and

455
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:41,710
the regulation about testing when we

456
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:44,650
went from testing only 12 pesticides to

457
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:46,929
22 pesticides the list of the national

458
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:49,330
there were quite a few distributors that

459
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:52,360
lost millions of dollars in inventory

460
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:55,058
that had to be destroyed because as a

461
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:57,308
retailer I'm not allowed to touch the

462
00:18:55,058 --> 00:18:59,950
raw products they all have to be

463
00:18:57,308 --> 00:19:02,339
prepackaged so they have to be

464
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,610
childproof and so forth so there were

465
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:05,859
warehouses of

466
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:07,329
hundreds of thousands and millions of

467
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:09,819
dollars worth of em

468
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:12,099
that was gathered up by the BCC and

469
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:14,079
destroyed a year ago

470
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:16,449
that really hurt a lot of distributors

471
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,549
the one that seemed to be standing out

472
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,160
are the ones who have a network already

473
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:23,409
like they were alcohol they were already

474
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,710
in some sort of distribution framework

475
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:29,440
before they had the logistics already

476
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:31,660
set in play one of my distributors comes

477
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,700
from Sacramento their warehouse is

478
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,580
100,000 square feet there's four

479
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,740
different distributors taking 25,000 and

480
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:41,019
there are a hundred and sixty-five

481
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:43,299
vehicles that leave every morning at

482
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:45,730
3:30 half them to Southern California

483
00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:49,180
market and the other half to Northern

484
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:51,400
California so that logistics is the

485
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,269
nightmare alone for a distributor and

486
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,470
putting us in an outlining area is even

487
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:58,180
challenge and wait until we get to the

488
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,009
number of dispensaries that we should

489
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,840
have versus you know the 6,000 we should

490
00:20:00,009 --> 00:20:03,250
have instead of the 600 we do I think

491
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:04,899
distribution it doesn't it's not a

492
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,309
linear increase it's not 10 times as

493
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,860
hard it's probably two though you know

494
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:10,990
order the 10 10th magnitude right I mean

495
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:12,069
it's the logistics of that the one you

496
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,990
know the distributor we work with the

497
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:16,029
most is herbal the president of herbal

498
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,799
comes out he was a former president uNFI

499
00:20:16,029 --> 00:20:19,029
which did you know all of the whole food

500
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,399
shops right so they're dealing with a

501
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:23,019
lot of similar challenges of product

502
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,900
that needs to be fresh product with high

503
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:27,460
QC standards 2300 stores or something

504
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,990
like that that Whole Foods has and it's

505
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,660
going to be those I think those types of

506
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:34,059
companies with a high cannabis IQ and a

507
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:44,170
high business IQ that succeed long term

508
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:46,269
and distribution and weed they're trying

509
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:48,160
to take advertising dollars from

510
00:20:46,269 --> 00:20:50,200
retailers but then they're also taking

511
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,600
advertising dollars from your

512
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,769
you know you're illegal competitors they

513
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:55,329
get four and half billion dollars a

514
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:57,489
month just to give you the idea of what

515
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:59,288
their gross income is and they're based

516
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:01,090
in Irvine and they were given a letter a

517
00:20:59,288 --> 00:21:02,858
year and a half ago by the state

518
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:04,839
attorney general deceased and assist

519
00:21:02,858 --> 00:21:08,499
because they were aiding and abetting a

520
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:16,898
class 1 felony just recently they said

521
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:18,579
they're no longer gonna do I guess in

522
00:21:16,898 --> 00:21:19,689
fairness if someone said when do you

523
00:21:18,579 --> 00:21:21,668
when to stop getting four million

524
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,409
dollars a month I might take my time

525
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:24,879
coming up of that day too what you're

526
00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:26,980
gonna come up with is another

527
00:21:24,878 --> 00:21:29,199
bureaucracy or another system that

528
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,839
replaces that money from the legal shops

529
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,590
so unfortunately we may see an increase

530
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,939
in our on our weed maps and some some

531
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:39,878
illegal shops are paying four or five

532
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:42,429
thousand dollars a month so how do we

533
00:21:39,878 --> 00:21:44,230
create a future where like it doesn't

534
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:48,509
turn into every other industry where

535
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:49,749
it's like Mad Men owns all retail and

536
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:52,569
Condesa

537
00:21:49,749 --> 00:21:54,579
and whoever else like they're like the

538
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:57,038
coca-cola and Pepsi of retail

539
00:21:54,579 --> 00:22:01,178
distribution then you have like the

540
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:06,038
Walmart and Amazon like how do we keep

541
00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:08,109
kind of a thriving well and I know my

542
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:10,509
course and the course is basically did

543
00:22:08,108 --> 00:22:13,538
I'm not after the whole national market

544
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:15,970
it really did be be specialized to serve

545
00:22:13,538 --> 00:22:18,908
the clients and the customers that you

546
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:20,950
serve in that area because without them

547
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:22,480
you're you don't survive I mean I know

548
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:25,058
the approach that we've taken in Italy

549
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,190
on the retail levels to be a boutique

550
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:29,710
right I mean our our approach is that

551
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,480
ninety seven percent of people have

552
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,528
never been in a dispensary before and so

553
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,778
they're walking them for the first time

554
00:22:32,528 --> 00:22:36,878
and so what you really want is the you

555
00:22:34,778 --> 00:22:38,769
know the best five to ten products in

556
00:22:36,878 --> 00:22:40,058
every category you don't need to be the

557
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:42,399
Walmart of weed that's actually a

558
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:43,628
negative because if you're totally lost

559
00:22:42,398 --> 00:22:45,548
in something's completely new to you

560
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:47,709
having eight thousand choices isn't

561
00:22:45,548 --> 00:22:49,599
helpful what you want is if someone

562
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:51,038
walked up and said hey what's you know

563
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:52,238
what's your favorite edible here's the

564
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:53,499
five things I would recommend to them

565
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:55,058
right if it's your favorite flower

566
00:22:53,499 --> 00:22:56,649
here's the ten flowers that I would say

567
00:22:55,058 --> 00:22:58,658
you choose from right and I think that's

568
00:22:56,648 --> 00:23:00,518
a lot more helpful for the next at least

569
00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:01,940
five to ten years then this you know

570
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:03,710
Megastore of

571
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:05,538
of cannabis so I think the market will

572
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:07,308
ask for it and I think one place where

573
00:23:05,538 --> 00:23:09,470
the local licensing may actually have a

574
00:23:07,308 --> 00:23:11,329
benefit is it's gonna force at least

575
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,620
some level of local operators because

576
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:14,298
those are gonna be the folks in a lot of

577
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:16,308
cases that get these licenses and

578
00:23:14,298 --> 00:23:18,019
permits and so that's gonna I think give

579
00:23:16,308 --> 00:23:19,878
us a little bit more hometown small-town

580
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:21,980
field and we might have for coffee or

581
00:23:19,878 --> 00:23:23,928
who knows something like that and that's

582
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:26,599
one reason why we're going for a micro

583
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:29,480
license a type 12 is to add a little bit

584
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:32,509
more control over our manufacturing for

585
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,659
our own brand basically and kind of

586
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:38,179
control our quality and just choose the

587
00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:40,850
very best cultivators that are out there

588
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:42,919
and the best manufacturers and the ones

589
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:47,079
who actually stand behind their products

590
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:49,759
and have the science and the reputation

591
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:52,939
this the vape controversy have not

592
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:56,538
really impacted us much because that's

593
00:23:52,940 --> 00:24:02,480
basically about 20% of my market oh and

594
00:23:56,538 --> 00:24:03,980
you know a little but not much that's

595
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,659
not I mean I think you know really

596
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,339
anything the vape highlights why a

597
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:09,200
regulatory framework is better than a

598
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:10,278
better prohibition framework isn't a

599
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,509
prohibition framework you pretend like

600
00:24:10,278 --> 00:24:13,099
it doesn't exist and a regulatory

601
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:14,329
framework he acknowledged that it's

602
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:16,250
there and then you try and control it

603
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:18,278
right I mean all these vape stories are

604
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,720
coming out of unregulated shops

605
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:22,369
vitamin-e acetates one of the culprits

606
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,200
they've identified we have no product

607
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:25,729
that has vitamin E acetate right I mean

608
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,080
through this they've actually started

609
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,878
doing some testing one of the things

610
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:30,398
they found is like the jewels and the

611
00:24:28,878 --> 00:24:33,648
e-liquids and all the nicotine stuff

612
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:36,319
wildly dirtier than any cannabis product

613
00:24:33,648 --> 00:24:38,778
right I mean the the the average eliquid

614
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:40,369
has four times the pesticide limits in

615
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:41,869
them than would be allowed in cannabis

616
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:43,158
right which is kind of a mind-boggling

617
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:47,628
thing if you think about it it

618
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:49,220
everything yeah far higher level and

619
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:50,689
they're for sale in every single gas

620
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,339
station right so on the one hand you

621
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,230
have cannabis which has arguably a

622
00:24:52,339 --> 00:24:59,138
cleaner supply chain than our food and

623
00:24:54,230 --> 00:25:01,069
it's sold but this is the same thing

624
00:24:59,138 --> 00:25:02,808
it's one thing are you talking

625
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:04,278
strawberries to vapes right this is

626
00:25:02,808 --> 00:25:06,589
babes to babes and all of a sudden you

627
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:07,909
see these same pesticides I mean none of

628
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:09,859
these products would pass cannabis

629
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:11,869
testing yet they're distributed to

630
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:13,009
hundreds of thousands of stores versus

631
00:25:11,868 --> 00:25:14,299
the 600 that we have

632
00:25:13,009 --> 00:25:16,220
and everyone worries about right it

633
00:25:14,299 --> 00:25:18,139
means yeah it's it's kind of amazing how

634
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,059
what is allowed in that traditional

635
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,310
there's a simple statement of saying

636
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:24,919
cannabis products is safer than your

637
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:27,470
drinking water and that's a fact and

638
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,269
it's safer than your produce if you do

639
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,920
not even you've heard about people dying

640
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:32,299
of E coli from lettuce literally

641
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,640
couldn't happen in cannabis because we

642
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:37,639
test every 50-pound bag in advance yeah

643
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,710
not after people die and then try to

644
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:43,130
find the trucker and the farm that

645
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:45,650
caused the contamination so anyway I do

646
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:49,400
think the vape industry will actually

647
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:51,350
increase with regulation my sales will

648
00:25:49,400 --> 00:26:01,970
probably go up because I think people

649
00:25:51,349 --> 00:26:04,719
will especially with more of the yeah

650
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,720
and that's when they
