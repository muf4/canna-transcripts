1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,830
one of the things I wanted to talk about

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,139
was you know I had like my my mixed

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,240
martial arts analogy where you know

4
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:13,138
someone's the college wrestler at Ohio

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,570
State and they get into MMA and you know

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:17,189
when it comes to a ground game they're

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,019
amazing but they need to learn how to

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,390
box they need to learn how to kick box

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:23,579
jujitsu Maitai all these other kind of

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,740
languages to get in the ring and fight

11
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:30,928
and in growing plants I feel like you

12
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:33,750
know there's not one right way of doing

13
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:35,460
it and people are kind of gravitating

14
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,269
towards different languages or

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:44,189
methodologies and so for example Korean

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:51,120
natural farming and we have our second

17
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:54,988
we have our mastered show and so Scott I

18
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:57,769
was hoping you could kick it off and I I

19
00:00:54,988 --> 00:01:01,140
want to talk about kind of the roots of

20
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:04,530
Korean natural farming in the 50s in

21
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:08,368
Korea you know in a specific period and

22
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,368
time and geography and how you've seen

23
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:16,799
kind of the cannabis community embrace

24
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:21,060
it you know here in the US and any

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,460
issues or concerns you you have with how

26
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:30,750
you see people applying it practically

27
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:34,319
here in the US well so well I'll start

28
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:37,228
with the preface you know I'm a huge

29
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,059
advocate of any sustainable strategy I'm

30
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:41,849
a huge advocate of any regenerative

31
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,170
strategy I'm a huge advocate of anybody

32
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:49,618
that wants to pursue low-cost

33
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:51,390
sustainable solutions and I feel that

34
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:53,069
you know I've got some friends that are

35
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,129
big into KNF and they've met the Cho's

36
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:57,688
and I feel like you know they were in

37
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:00,390
essence trying to communicate the same

38
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:03,059
message I think there's some obstacles

39
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,489
with context with KNF that are really

40
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,209
problematic in the regulated space

41
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:13,109
especially but then there's also some

42
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:16,259
problems with just cultivation

43
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:21,600
with some of the KNF for cannabis one of

44
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:23,429
my biggest obstacles with it is you know

45
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,259
there's the issue of having enough raw

46
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,780
materials within your own property or

47
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:30,599
farm to create your ferments and most

48
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,750
humans are relying on some outside

49
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,650
source to provide either the fruit the

50
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,599
vegetables or the milk or the sugar or

51
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:42,510
whatever the inputs are used to make

52
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,370
those kenaf immense and when we work in

53
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:47,429
the cannabis cultivation space and we

54
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,680
take flour and we concentrated into oils

55
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,420
you know the flour might pass but the

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,370
trims gonna fail and the oil is

57
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:55,319
definitely going to fail and so we see

58
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,909
phenomenons and other areas of cannabis

59
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:59,489
where we take a large amount of biomass

60
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:03,090
and concert drought concentrate it down

61
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:05,189
into an oil or other product and you see

62
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:07,319
pesticides chemicals or compounds that

63
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:12,389
were in that flower to become higher

64
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:14,909
level of detection and so I I think one

65
00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:17,579
of the major obstacles the KNF right now

66
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:20,519
is you know Sarah and I have worked with

67
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,590
large organic farms with we've seen

68
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,420
pretty good ideas to the cheating that

69
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,700
goes along and you know there's study

70
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:28,349
after study that shows you know I

71
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,268
remember one where they took some

72
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:32,669
produce from outside the United States

73
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:35,129
that was deemed organic and like of the

74
00:03:32,669 --> 00:03:37,199
12 products all 12 had something that

75
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:39,329
shouldn't be on it you know and so we

76
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,969
have a industry-wide issue with

77
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,489
contamination we have an industry-wide

78
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:46,349
issue with unregulated agricultural

79
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:48,569
activities that are using other products

80
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:51,979
that they shouldn't be doing that people

81
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:54,269
in the effort to apply regenerative

82
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:56,189
tactics to the cannabis space or then

83
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:59,280
concentrating these pesticides and

84
00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:00,930
applying them to their plant so I'm kind

85
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,959
of curious as to what maybe Lydia is

86
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:07,170
seen in her analytical work the obstacle

87
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,909
with KNF is I suggest these concerns I

88
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:10,409
have two people that do kaf and I go

89
00:04:08,909 --> 00:04:13,169
well I'm trying to save money so I'm not

90
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:16,649
going to spend $150 to test for

91
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:18,779
pesticides on my ferments which makes

92
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:21,929
perfect sense that makes perfect sense

93
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:25,619
you know but like I saw one the other

94
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,730
day so I haven't had a can F farm that

95
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,530
then sends there

96
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,140
their product and for testing because

97
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:32,669
yeah it doesn't make sense financially

98
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:36,000
but like I saw an Instagram the other

99
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:39,300
day where a guy had a bunch of bananas

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,129
and it had the sticker on it the PLU

101
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,840
stick drink you could read it very

102
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:44,819
clearly it was forty 11 which is

103
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:47,149
conventional banana and if there's a

104
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:51,139
nine before it it's organic and so dudes

105
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:54,299
fermenting conventional bananas and and

106
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:56,430
if you look into how bananas are grown

107
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,949
like they actually take a plastic bag

108
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,019
that is infused with pesticides and

109
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:03,569
insecticides and then as the banana

110
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:06,389
flower starts to shoot shoots they wrap

111
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:09,889
it in the pesticide and it grows inside

112
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:13,199
of a pesticide bag because they're so

113
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:15,569
ridden with pests and so I think there's

114
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,079
a there's a considerable disconnect

115
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:22,290
between the agricultural process the

116
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:25,800
areas of contamination and how that then

117
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:29,939
affects your plants and I just you know

118
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:32,040
I haven't seen a KNF garden survive more

119
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:35,069
than a couple harvests in the regulated

120
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,629
space because of these phenomenons but

121
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:38,790
that's something that's nobody's talking

122
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:40,680
about so there's the history of

123
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:42,390
pesticides but there's also the issue of

124
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,730
sort of the way that they're using it

125
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:49,699
ecologically in microbially speaking in

126
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:52,770
the balance of that is may or may not be

127
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:54,959
scientifically sound as far as results

128
00:05:52,769 --> 00:06:00,449
and what they what they get how they use

129
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:03,379
it and then the other issue is in just

130
00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:05,759
being able to make the products

131
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:07,589
consistently with knowing what the end

132
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,569
product does they have alcohol in it

133
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:12,659
even you know those kinds of things that

134
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:15,540
I think if you're using it in a

135
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,340
commercial space or any space you

136
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,890
actually need to sell the product and

137
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:21,859
have a good harvest or need that money

138
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:24,839
from them from the harvest that it would

139
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,879
be good to know and get that process

140
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:28,589
down so you know what you're making well

141
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,719
that I think that you know I come from a

142
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:32,279
business background like I come from fat

143
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,670
what you know what Sarah's saying is

144
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:37,589
that you know part of being regenerative

145
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,000
and sustainable is that your business

146
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:42,060
needs to be regenerative

147
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,759
and sustainable and so you know one of

148
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:48,240
the core components of our business is

149
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:50,509
helping farms stay in business and so in

150
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,560
order for organic or sustainable

151
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:56,490
practices or with the regenerative

152
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,930
movement to be sustainable and have an

153
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,269
impact on the market

154
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,699
we need those farms to make it more than

155
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:04,769
three harvests we need these farms to

156
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:08,240
stay in business and you know I think

157
00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:10,829
that's been one of my gripes that people

158
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,199
other people in the industry of a large

159
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:15,089
objection to how volkl I'm being but I

160
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,789
don't think people would people

161
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:20,009
understand why I'm coming from is that

162
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,660
you know if there's bad advice given to

163
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:24,029
farmers that puts farmers out of

164
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:26,820
business you know that's not sustainable

165
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:28,889
and we need to first be a business that

166
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,259
can make it from harvest to harvest to

167
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:32,729
harvest so that we can stick around so

168
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:35,459
that we can produce products on the

169
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,560
market so our voice can be heard so that

170
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:40,409
we can actually make a lasting impact on

171
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,519
the market wide and if all of our farms

172
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,560
are going out of business because

173
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:47,069
they're concentrating banana pesticides

174
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,780
like that does not help sustainability I

175
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:52,110
was just gonna say I mean there are some

176
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:53,699
tenants that go along with KNF you know

177
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:56,040
that are similar to permaculture they're

178
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:58,500
similar similar to regenerative AG is

179
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,750
you know you're being able to use

180
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,339
indigenous micro organisms not using

181
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,910
synthetic herbicides pesticides

182
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:07,560
fertilizers you know improving your

183
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:11,430
growing environment creating a more

184
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,949
sustainable culture as best you possibly

185
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,560
can with your facility is gonna lead you

186
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:20,129
down the proper direction in the long

187
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,209
run but you know we see a lot of issue I

188
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:23,430
mean if we're not even talking about

189
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:27,029
cultivation we see an issue you know

190
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,829
with the sourcing of chocolate and using

191
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:30,839
chocolate for edibles and then that

192
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:33,899
results in you know heavy metals failure

193
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:35,639
or you know you're talking about

194
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:37,110
Cavendish bananas you know how many

195
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,848
different types of bananas do they

196
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,700
regularly ship around the world like

197
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,020
literally three and the Cavendish are

198
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,759
the ones that are the most popular and

199
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:46,259
it's because you know we all know the

200
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:49,588
reasons why I've works the way that it

201
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:51,269
does but you know trusting that the

202
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:52,500
source of material that you're getting

203
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:55,379
is gonna

204
00:08:52,500 --> 00:09:00,120
be clean and that you're not gonna have

205
00:08:55,379 --> 00:09:02,279
an issue is poor planning you know in no

206
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,230
offense it's just not something that you

207
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:06,809
know if it were me even whenever I'm

208
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,240
buying or recommending that someone

209
00:09:06,809 --> 00:09:10,619
purchase and you that pesticides it's

210
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,529
like you make sure that you get that

211
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,909
material tested in the laboratory

212
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:17,490
against the standards that you are going

213
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:18,870
to be up against as a cultivation

214
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,899
facility trying to get your product to

215
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:24,659
market because mistakes happen you know

216
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,490
manufacturing mistakes happen there are

217
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:29,490
problems where things could adulterated

218
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,659
and they're not meant to be even without

219
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,430
it being the intention of the

220
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:33,750
manufacturer and so that's just

221
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:36,359
something that you know I've seen a lot

222
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,610
of and you know as we all know it's like

223
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,009
the horror stories of using minute

224
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,139
municipal compost you know and using

225
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:44,370
that material to start a compost pile

226
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:46,289
and what you're going to be dealing with

227
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,919
is totally different than if all of your

228
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:52,139
materials come from your land which

229
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:56,069
Scott was saying turns into a pretty big

230
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:57,539
sourcing issue I see the reason why I

231
00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:00,180
don't work with K enough is that I don't

232
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:03,389
think I'm qualified at this time where

233
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:07,259
my understanding of using fermentations

234
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:09,629
to drive my plants direction to me is

235
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:12,450
too risky with this crop at the level

236
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:14,429
and I need to perform but I know farmers

237
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,710
that run K and F operations that are

238
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:20,370
succeeding in terms of their products do

239
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:24,420
pass CoA and in their killer products

240
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:27,750
but they're also some really dedicated

241
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:31,169
hard work and driven to understand those

242
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:33,210
methodologies type people and I think

243
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:35,429
that the reason where you see a fall-off

244
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:38,100
is that someone throws that word on top

245
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:41,039
of it K and F and automatically oh it

246
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,839
must be it's better and so it's they

247
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,980
approach it and they don't understand it

248
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,710
and that's where you start sourcing

249
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:48,300
regular bananas you find out that you

250
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,580
don't have enough diversity on your

251
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:52,349
property to do fermentation so you have

252
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,450
to acquire material from somewhere else

253
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,250
and now you're picking up stuff that's

254
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:58,500
covered in insecticides fungicides

255
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,350
whatever because it's just it's just add

256
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,149
products but I I know people who are

257
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,290
successful with it and the people that I

258
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:05,789
think of that you know the top of the

259
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:07,919
food chain with that would to be like

260
00:11:05,789 --> 00:11:10,339
you know in our world Chris Trump and

261
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:12,870
the crew that rolls are under Chris

262
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,970
they're growing some fire and they're

263
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:17,549
there doing it but I think they're it's

264
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,950
way more in-depth than people want to

265
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:21,719
admit and that you have to say that

266
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,250
there's a level of professionalism in

267
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,050
every aspect of what we do as

268
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:27,539
cultivators and you have to kind of

269
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:29,729
define your success and you can have

270
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:31,049
ideas of how other things operate but

271
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,810
you have to work with what you're good

272
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:35,099
at when you start to play a little of

273
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:36,089
this a little and at whatever said the

274
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,889
other day you guys are talking about

275
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:39,240
they were going to do the operation and

276
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:41,759
they're really going to do 10% of the

277
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,669
operation correctly the rescue had 90

278
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,830
percent of the operation was going to be

279
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:49,139
just you know wing it that's the same

280
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,730
situation here that just because it's

281
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:51,990
organic doesn't mean it's safe and just

282
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,480
because it's organic doesn't mean it's

283
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,039
better it's just another method of

284
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,930
working with it and I think that when

285
00:11:56,039 --> 00:11:59,159
people start to put the buzzwords on it

286
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:01,379
makes them feel like they're gonna do

287
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:03,990
something so like you're competing for

288
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:05,939
who's most organic and that's not the

289
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:09,200
point we're trying to deliver a crop to

290
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:12,840
a customer consistently profitably and

291
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,460
morally it's kind of like aquaponics you

292
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,860
know what I mean aquaponics you've got

293
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,230
to have a water scientist on board and

294
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,269
there's a whole nother thing people want

295
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,460
to do alkaline and I think it's cool we

296
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:25,980
did it in our office on a small level of

297
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:28,470
dr. Allen that was super difficult on

298
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,720
that level so you know trying to scale

299
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:33,480
up and I even watched vegetable farmers

300
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,700
I've done a my wife did a class in

301
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,470
Florida with the Maine aquaponics farm

302
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,960
they did it in greenhouses and it's

303
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:42,810
totally impressive but and super

304
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,970
sustainable but the level of risk and

305
00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:47,939
how hard it is of how you got to be so

306
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:51,649
sharp to do it is unbelievable and I can

307
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:58,070
tell why people don't do it in cannabis

308
00:12:51,649 --> 00:13:03,659
yeah Steve raised a good you know as the

309
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:06,120
podcast and stuff you know yeah he's a

310
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:08,159
fish wizard man and but the thing is

311
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,379
what he was you know when I got from him

312
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,329
in the last time we were hanging out yes

313
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:14,879
you use a composite system in order to

314
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:17,100
get the yields that he needs because you

315
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,500
can't drive the fertility from the fish

316
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,840
end of it safely or the fish

317
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,889
becoming damaged from too much

318
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:27,330
concentration of ammonium in their tank

319
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:29,100
so you end up having a sick fish

320
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,840
population if you want to drive the

321
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,860
fertility so they have to use a hybrid

322
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:37,290
system of mineral nutrition in some form

323
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,450
of pot that's put into it the irrigation

324
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:41,879
system where it's aquaponics so it's not

325
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:44,850
a pure aquaponics system so you can use

326
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:48,419
aquaponics to drive wheatgrass

327
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:51,899
but wheatgrass is a far lower value of

328
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:53,639
nutrient load than cannabis does you

329
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,519
know so every every one of these systems

330
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,889
is incredible if you just admit that

331
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,870
they have limitations in specific areas

332
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:10,019
and you address it but people get

333
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:11,370
romanticized with this shit I'm gonna be

334
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,579
somebody I'm not gonna be fucking

335
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,470
bankrupt it's that alone doesn't make

336
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:18,389
you somebody it's just a tool and I

337
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,639
think that these organic methodologies

338
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:23,519
as fascinating as they are to me because

339
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,990
they are art you have to admit that like

340
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,449
I said I don't have the ability to

341
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,820
ferment everything in my woods and close

342
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:33,690
my loops and do this operation in that

343
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,820
way and make money you know so I use our

344
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:38,310
organic bottom and then I and I charge

345
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,589
it so that I have a bacterial base that

346
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:43,229
solid so my base level of fertility is

347
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:45,660
consistent and I can get analysis done

348
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,610
so I know I'm within range and then I

349
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:50,669
said then I utilize that final escape

350
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:53,339
technology to get around the

351
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:55,949
environmental stress but I just admitted

352
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:57,900
to myself that went on 70 maybe then I

353
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,759
can be a fully closed loop farmer

354
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:01,769
because I can start to grow all the

355
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,019
products that I needed when I was in

356
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:06,029
Colombia they were growing all these

357
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:08,939
products that they were using for their

358
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:10,889
Ag in general and once they got into

359
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,510
cannabis they just had to increase the

360
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:15,600
acreage of the things that they were

361
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:18,080
already producing to use as ferments

362
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,649
because that's how they operated

363
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:24,089
naturally so for them KNF situation made

364
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:25,860
total sense because they were already

365
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:28,350
really following it but it was more like

366
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:30,690
Colombian natural farming they weren't

367
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,980
copying you know master Joe they would

368
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,180
copy and how they've been doing it since

369
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,240
the dawn of time

370
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:38,250
and I think you just have to be really

371
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,779
honest about your situation and just say

372
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:41,490
look there's a lot of ways to get to the

373
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:44,039
destination choose the one that's going

374
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:46,379
to work for you and it's okay you're not

375
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:51,569
in competition with each other for who's

376
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:54,779
coolest with bro technology honesty

377
00:15:51,570 --> 00:16:00,230
isn't the first policy in cannabis it

378
00:15:54,779 --> 00:16:03,480
seems ego is the best policy

379
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:07,110
you don't want to either you don't want

380
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,580
to spend shit or you want to spend

381
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,110
everything and show everybody you can

382
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:14,520
grow great weed there's not a lot of

383
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:16,800
in-between and the one consistent thing

384
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:20,819
I would say what the biggest problem

385
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:23,669
with KNF becoming extremely successful

386
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,410
is that once something becomes popular

387
00:16:23,669 --> 00:16:26,909
people don't want to fall out of that

388
00:16:25,409 --> 00:16:29,639
cool clique and then they don't want to

389
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:31,110
admit that it goes well and so everybody

390
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:32,789
just keeps smiling and saying

391
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:35,129
everything's fine like that mean when

392
00:16:32,789 --> 00:16:37,500
the things on fire and because nobody

393
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:40,230
wants to be nobody wants to be the guy

394
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:43,110
that didn't do it well and that's that's

395
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:46,560
systemic across the board which I keep

396
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:49,080
saying is the number one throttle on

397
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,599
evolution of the industry wide as soon

398
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,910
as people can be authentic and honest

399
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,040
about how bad things aren't going we can

400
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:59,699
start talking about how good they can go

401
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:02,789
and you know people aren't quite right

402
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,799
not being guide like we're just not just

403
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:07,589
it's not enough you know when when shits

404
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:09,480
going wrong and strawberries everybody's

405
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:11,849
talking about it when shit's going wrong

406
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,549
in sugar beets or grapes or anything I

407
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:16,379
remember when I was a kid they had this

408
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:18,539
weird phenomenon going through sugar

409
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,170
beets that was wiping everybody out and

410
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:23,849
all the farmers all the you know

411
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:25,590
companies everybody rallies around they

412
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:27,839
shit to fix it and figure out what the

413
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:30,659
problem is and kind of do a reset it's

414
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:32,849
just we're not in that category as much

415
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,640
as that's the part of big AG we should

416
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:37,740
be in everybody really gets together and

417
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,009
really does these things and some of

418
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,500
these people share these trials that are

419
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:45,049
being done I know a guy that's really I

420
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,420
mean he's a big

421
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:50,419
in cannabis and he loves cannabis so

422
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,370
it's a great way of looking at it wasn't

423
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,820
a big guy trying to get in it for the

424
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:54,739
money

425
00:17:52,819 --> 00:17:56,409
he was already in big I wanted to be

426
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,839
into cannabis and bring what he knew and

427
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:01,759
learn what he can and so basically you

428
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:03,259
know I actually was talking to Peter

429
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,150
about this guy and saying we should get

430
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:07,190
him on the podcast I talked to him about

431
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,440
it the other day and he was like I can't

432
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,289
go on there the company I work for won't

433
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,090
let me talk to anybody about shit you

434
00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:16,990
know and I was just like well that's you

435
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:20,269
know hey fuck you know he would be great

436
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,279
you know I've learned a lot and things

437
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:24,950
like that but if it's not the company

438
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:27,259
itself well if it's the company itself

439
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,840
holding back even good people within

440
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:32,140
that company to share that information

441
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:37,609
so I mean it's kind of crazy how how

442
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:42,710
bottled up it is or the what so just

443
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:45,969
quickly sticking on our KF topic Chris

444
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:49,400
Trump's actually confirm for next week

445
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:55,390
so Scott just quickly can you touch on

446
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:59,690
the use of rice to kind of to collect

447
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:01,430
and grow things you've mentioned

448
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:03,980
something about rice and kind of

449
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:06,310
concerns there and then also kind of how

450
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:10,579
mastered show from your perspective has

451
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:12,589
evolved his way of thinking and and what

452
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:14,240
how he thinks about things differently

453
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:22,720
and now we're going to get onto a laning

454
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:26,500
and the soil food yeah I think you know

455
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:30,589
one of the things that I think is really

456
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:34,490
missing from the KNF community is a

457
00:19:30,589 --> 00:19:37,519
little bit more solid foundation of the

458
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:39,259
entirety of the soil food web and how

459
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,539
these things interplay in the root

460
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:45,589
system of plants and lead to good

461
00:19:41,539 --> 00:19:48,379
results or bad results you know one of

462
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:51,740
the objections that dr. Lane Ingham and

463
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:55,610
has had is the concept that we're taking

464
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:57,589
a strategy from Korea using rice which

465
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:58,389
is something that naturally exists in

466
00:19:57,589 --> 00:20:01,299
that Reed

467
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:05,380
they're using it to catch organisms and

468
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:07,750
using that to be their inoculum which I

469
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,480
think Kevin nailed it like they're doing

470
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:13,359
Columbia natural farming like okay so

471
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,279
those Colombians have adapted these same

472
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,490
principles of using the available

473
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:20,170
materials in their environment to

474
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,549
compost them or ferment them down that

475
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,620
they can then use for healthy plant

476
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:27,490
growth and I think that's something

477
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:29,889
that's being missed in the United States

478
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,329
and so when we take rice which is

479
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:34,990
something that doesn't naturally occur

480
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:37,929
in the forests of the redwoods and we

481
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:40,059
put it into the root system or soil or

482
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:42,759
mulch layer whatever it is they're doing

483
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:44,740
with it they're harvesting organisms

484
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:46,869
from that environment that are suitable

485
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:49,180
to decomposing that material not

486
00:20:46,869 --> 00:20:50,769
necessarily organisms that lead to

487
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:56,049
healthy plant growth within that

488
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:58,329
environment and you know the KNF

489
00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:00,250
community just objects to my objection

490
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:01,659
and nobody really you know opens a

491
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:06,130
textbook to even see what they're doing

492
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:08,110
or you know takes dr. lanes microscope

493
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,750
course which again is contradictory to

494
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:12,609
the can of principles of being low-cost

495
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:16,660
so we just have this kind of obstacle

496
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:19,659
where you know the entire KNF community

497
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:21,940
from my standpoint is neglecting a major

498
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:24,279
portion of soil biology that's easily

499
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:26,680
and readily found in textbooks that you

500
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:29,049
can read up on and understand how these

501
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,690
systems work what these organisms do and

502
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:34,659
how they do or do not have positively

503
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:36,580
affect plant growth they're kind of in

504
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:39,250
the wizardry side which I'm down for

505
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:43,019
wizardry but you can't live on wizardry

506
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:46,119
and deny the law of gravity you know

507
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:48,039
well the Brewers have a little wizardry

508
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:50,289
to little sprinkle of this and a

509
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:52,899
sprinkler that everybody gets their

510
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:54,970
wizard hat on sometimes but I'm

511
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,560
definitely gonna break the internet on

512
00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:00,490
this one sky you might have to unblock

513
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,079
some people or so I don't even I don't

514
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,960
belong to the internet anymore it

515
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:07,819
doesn't

516
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,860
I don't belong to the Internet I come

517
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:11,599
from I come from Southern California and

518
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:13,069
I was raised by skaters surfers and

519
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,889
gangsters where it wasn't real that

520
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:18,139
wasn't okay to be fake like you got

521
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:21,470
called fake every day if like you didn't

522
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:23,179
drop in on the ramp properly like so I'm

523
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,130
not gonna participate in Instagram it's

524
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:26,630
just like it's like the bar scene of

525
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:29,990
fake ass is like I'm not trying to

526
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:32,059
participate in that shit like like I

527
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:34,339
don't even I don't got post Colvin I got

528
00:22:32,058 --> 00:22:39,678
no time for this shit I got no time for

529
00:22:34,339 --> 00:22:42,319
that none so just quickly give me your

530
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,500
perspective like on on ferments and

531
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:49,970
alcohol and and mastered shows evolve

532
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:52,460
thinking and water can you and go well I

533
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:55,759
guess so I what so what Peter I guess to

534
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:58,298
catch up the live listener I'm I don't I

535
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:01,460
don't it all want to speak for the chose

536
00:22:58,298 --> 00:23:04,250
necessarily but to my understanding like

537
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:06,169
the evolution of KNF has even been to

538
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:08,538
like the jus d'amour jadam which is his

539
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:10,669
son which to my understanding that's

540
00:23:08,538 --> 00:23:12,648
been communicated to me by KNF people

541
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:15,470
it's more of a water based ferment and

542
00:23:12,648 --> 00:23:17,449
so I was kind of shocked to hear that

543
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,220
the people here in the United States

544
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,110
trying to grow cannabis are doing like

545
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,569
sugar based ferments which leads to a

546
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:25,699
lot of alcohols and it seems that the

547
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:28,639
Cho family themselves are evolving to a

548
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:32,149
water-based ferment and you know I don't

549
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,159
know the intricacies of that but what I

550
00:23:32,148 --> 00:23:37,038
do see is an evolution from the Cho

551
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,830
family on their own process and so we

552
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,919
need to say that same evolution within

553
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:45,678
the cannabis space of their process

554
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:48,380
because you know my wife and I job is as

555
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:51,440
a lab and we were trained by a scientist

556
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:54,320
to identify organisms whether you're a

557
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,120
KNF garden or a living soil garden when

558
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,819
we do this analysis and put these

559
00:23:56,119 --> 00:24:02,418
organisms into different categories it's

560
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:04,548
very clear indicator of success or bad

561
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:10,899
outcome regardless of the type of form

562
00:24:04,548 --> 00:24:13,250
you're out and you know there's these

563
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:14,778
phenomena in the root zone that are very

564
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,669
important I was trying to dig through it

565
00:24:14,778 --> 00:24:20,118
last night but we got so many damn texts

566
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:20,778
this house I couldn't find it but there

567
00:24:20,118 --> 00:24:22,908
is this woman

568
00:24:20,778 --> 00:24:24,470
we were both flipping through books like

569
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:26,059
where's this clothes you're gonna quote

570
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,499
science you got to be accurate or else

571
00:24:26,058 --> 00:24:31,158
they rip you to shreds on the Internet

572
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:32,989
but nonetheless this whole paragraph was

573
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:35,720
speaking about all the functions of

574
00:24:32,989 --> 00:24:38,058
plants that stopped under an anaerobic

575
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,308
condition in the read zone and this is

576
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:42,528
important because major metabolic

577
00:24:40,308 --> 00:24:46,460
functions stopped working under

578
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:47,808
decreased oxygen conditions and a whole

579
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,600
bunch of other compounds are produced

580
00:24:47,808 --> 00:24:52,368
and you know so we run this lab where

581
00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:54,079
people send us oil samples from the

582
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:56,178
smallest garden to the biggest garden

583
00:24:54,079 --> 00:25:00,798
living soil nonliving soil

584
00:24:56,179 --> 00:25:04,038
hybrid KNF we get a lot of it and by far

585
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:06,648
the weirdest plants symptoms come from

586
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:08,480
the canif sector like nobody that's

587
00:25:06,648 --> 00:25:10,758
doing a living slow farm calls me

588
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,829
because they're stem turned to gush and

589
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:15,980
the plant fell over like nobody in

590
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:17,989
hydroponics has ever called me like that

591
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,849
you know there's some really really

592
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:22,159
weird plant phenomenons that are

593
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:23,898
happening and I believe it has something

594
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,549
to do with the horrendous amount of

595
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:34,189
alcohol that are being poured on the

596
00:25:25,548 --> 00:25:36,378
plants yeah yeah it's just it's cuz I'd

597
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:39,739
like I think what happens is the

598
00:25:36,378 --> 00:25:41,778
internet starts to rebut me saying that

599
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:43,278
I'm saying everybody needs to be on my

600
00:25:41,778 --> 00:25:45,200
camp and that's not what I'm saying at

601
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:48,288
all what I'm saying is if you're gonna

602
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,720
engage in organic activities and talk

603
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:52,489
about biological concepts you should

604
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,858
familiarize yourself with these

605
00:25:52,489 --> 00:25:58,069
functions and foundations from readily

606
00:25:54,858 --> 00:25:59,778
accessible textbooks in the library like

607
00:25:58,069 --> 00:26:01,608
it's not just my information like

608
00:25:59,778 --> 00:26:03,739
there's major complications with the

609
00:26:01,608 --> 00:26:06,199
strategy and I'm not saying it can't be

610
00:26:03,739 --> 00:26:08,169
done because we've assisted some farmers

611
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,999
that have had some pretty good success

612
00:26:08,169 --> 00:26:12,590
with a hybrid approach and there's

613
00:26:10,999 --> 00:26:14,509
definitely an increase in terpenes

614
00:26:12,589 --> 00:26:16,368
there's definitely an increase that

615
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:21,249
comes with using some of these KNF

616
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:24,230
functions but you cannot ignore

617
00:26:21,249 --> 00:26:26,089
foundations of biological concepts that

618
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,690
are just as absolute as the law of

619
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:28,689
gravity

620
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:35,740
yeah so that's my two cents we would

621
00:26:33,308 --> 00:26:39,190
just say you know what to echo kind of

622
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:40,779
would Lydian what Kevin was saying just

623
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:44,230
whatever you're going to do whatever

624
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:46,928
system you resonate with just make sure

625
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,730
you take the time to quantify what it is

626
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:50,620
you're doing so you know why you're

627
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:52,058
doing it and you don't waste that effort

628
00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:54,489
only to find at the end of the harvest

629
00:26:52,058 --> 00:26:56,079
that you failed for whatever pesticide

630
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:57,759
that you didn't see coming down the pipe

631
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,649
because you overlooked something and

632
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,269
that happens to all of us that happen

633
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,920
that's a major learning lesson for

634
00:27:01,269 --> 00:27:04,960
everyone we're all in a great big

635
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:08,170
learning lesson right now on that but

636
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,569
just quantify what you're doing it it

637
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:12,550
take the time spend the money to do it

638
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:15,369
otherwise you know at the end of it you

639
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:18,369
could you know definitely miss something

640
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:26,079
and film testing and you don't get that

641
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:28,389
money yeah you just you crop right the

642
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:29,049
product isn't right it doesn't have a

643
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:35,880
home anymore

644
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:38,919
that's right yeah below shell I know

645
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,470
that gives me the right production at

646
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:43,600
that location and so I think that

647
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,009
direction always has to be specific

648
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:47,079
where you know it's in terms of

649
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:49,390
scalability I never intend to scale that

650
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:50,949
operation that is always meant to be the

651
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:53,770
size it is and I'm cool with that

652
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:56,470
for its duration so I can use that as a

653
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:58,150
specific but anytime you go to any

654
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:01,329
operation you know you have to identify

655
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:03,759
the people have the ability first to

656
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:06,220
even run and do what they intend to run

657
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:07,929
and do and I just think that there's

658
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,750
people who are brilliant and they know

659
00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:12,550
how to make these systems work and then

660
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:14,740
there's shortcuts that occur because

661
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:17,379
people don't understand that that isn't

662
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:21,160
a shortcut and if you do this you will

663
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:22,840
get this problem as a result and there

664
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,730
hasn't been enough experience in the

665
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:26,139
u.s. for operators I would be

666
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:28,120
interesting to go to Korea and see

667
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:31,300
people farm and ask them you know do you

668
00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:33,159
use KNF and what like how do they

669
00:28:31,299 --> 00:28:35,740
approach farming in their culture

670
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,210
because that's what I get kind of caught

671
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,589
up in is how does the out of the people

672
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:40,660
and he's it needs other countries don't

673
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:42,849
have commercial AG for the same degree

674
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:43,240
we do in the way we approach it how do

675
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:45,339
they

676
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,808
generate the products that was what was

677
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:49,299
so interesting about the Colombian

678
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:50,678
situation was they was scaling out the

679
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:53,649
crops that they were gonna grow to

680
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:55,480
create the products they needed so they

681
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,850
had full control of what they did is an

682
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,620
input and they knew exactly why I asked

683
00:28:57,849 --> 00:29:01,299
them white why do you grow this and he

684
00:28:59,619 --> 00:29:03,819
said this is what we get from this it's

685
00:29:01,299 --> 00:29:05,319
what we get from back so they had a full

686
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:08,980
strategy and have been based off a

687
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:10,839
success it's just that like for me my

688
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,610
farm is in is in developed to that

689
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:14,439
degree yet but the people that I know

690
00:29:12,609 --> 00:29:16,329
that are having success when you go to

691
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,519
their properties it's almost like a plan

692
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:20,109
Oasis to where they have so many

693
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:21,700
different things growing in such a

694
00:29:20,109 --> 00:29:24,129
balance that they can create these

695
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:27,460
balanced systems and you know and I

696
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:30,070
strive for that as my long-term goal but

697
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:33,700
I know that I can't jump right into it

698
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:36,549
and succeed it's too much of a risk it

699
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,319
has to be a progression you know like we

700
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:40,839
talked about last time you start off

701
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,909
with something you prove the concept you

702
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:45,419
increase it exponentially until you've

703
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:48,100
reached you know the full max potential

704
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:49,720
but if you're just if you're just moving

705
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:51,399
through time and space running as fast

706
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:55,000
as you can you can run right into a

707
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:58,330
fucker wall yeah exactly

708
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,009
and and our core messages we're trying

709
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:02,649
to keep these regenerative funds in

710
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:04,869
business that's the thing like you know

711
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:06,580
that's taken the strategy he is because

712
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:08,709
he knows it ensures its survival in the

713
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:10,569
market like we're trying to keep all

714
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:12,850
these people in business so that we can

715
00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:14,710
make a broader impact you know if we

716
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:16,539
have all of our organic farms go out of

717
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:18,850
business because they plant it in the

718
00:30:16,539 --> 00:30:20,970
first year who a culture like that ain't

719
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:24,579
that's not sustainable like we need to

720
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:26,558
we need to develop systems that are

721
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:28,509
actually repeatable that actually lead

722
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:30,490
to sustainability of your business and

723
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:32,410
that's that's why I like Kevin so much

724
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,779
he's got a you know business mindset I

725
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:36,610
came from a business family as well so

726
00:30:34,779 --> 00:30:39,009
yeah I'm on the regenerative camp but

727
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:42,129
I'm always looking at from a small

728
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:45,299
business survivability standpoint we we

729
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:47,020
have to start with being successful and

730
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:49,808
repeating that that's where

731
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:52,660
sustainability starts for me you know

732
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:54,250
and I a lot of times I see farms make it

733
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,558
to the commercial scale and a lot of

734
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,279
them have hired us to help them and they

735
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:59,500
go so

736
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,480
far to the regenerative that it's not

737
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,400
practical for their survivability in the

738
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,829
market and we have to start with

739
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,380
survivability in the market and inch our

740
00:31:05,829 --> 00:31:10,689
way towards full sustainability of our

741
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:14,100
property or it's just gonna be a

742
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:16,870
boneyard of stories of what almost was

743
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:18,490
you know because I can tell you the

744
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:21,669
hydro facilities they're not slowing

745
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:23,710
down they're ramping up and you know

746
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:28,480
unless some of these regenerative farms

747
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:30,450
figure out how to be profitable to make

748
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,410
an impact on the market or how we

749
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:34,740
community-wide figure out how to

750
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:36,490
communicate strategies that lead to

751
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,359
regenerative opportunities and

752
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,730
sustainability

753
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:41,109
you know what impact are we actually

754
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:43,500
going to have and how do we actually

755
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,500
give
