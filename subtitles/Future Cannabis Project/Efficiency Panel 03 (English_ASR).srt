1
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,969
and so whoa this one's a little louder

2
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:32,320
so in terms of retrofitting a greenhouse

3
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:34,570
you know there's a lot of greenhouses in

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,509
the Central Coast right now that are

5
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:40,719
being retrofitted that were used for say

6
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:44,229
fresh-cut flowers roses and orchids and

7
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,268
and other sorts of flowers and you know

8
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:48,219
maybe most people don't know this but

9
00:00:46,268 --> 00:00:51,399
you know since most flowers are not

10
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:54,670
being eaten and are not edible they just

11
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:57,338
have to look really pretty and so they

12
00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:00,189
dumped a shitload excuse me kids of

13
00:00:57,338 --> 00:01:04,209
pesticides on these flowers they will

14
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:06,938
fumigate the ground and the air and that

15
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:11,349
space is probably pretty polluted

16
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:13,868
speaking of remediation you know they're

17
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:17,319
rickety greenhouses they're wood framed

18
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:19,239
they're torn plastic and you know like

19
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:20,438
you think you're getting a good vibe I

20
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:23,108
get it you know by buying that

21
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:26,288
greenhouse but you have to completely

22
00:01:23,108 --> 00:01:28,328
replace all the wood with steel or

23
00:01:26,289 --> 00:01:32,649
aluminum you have to replace the cover

24
00:01:28,328 --> 00:01:34,328
with something else I hope maybe now

25
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:36,368
you're gonna add pad and fan cooling

26
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:39,038
because you can't just you know open up

27
00:01:36,368 --> 00:01:41,259
the windows to let you know the cool

28
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:43,239
coastal air come in when you have it for

29
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:45,638
these flowers that you don't really care

30
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:47,739
if pests come in or what the environment

31
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:50,920
is because well you're gonna fumigate it

32
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:53,679
so it doesn't really matter so much and

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,990
so you know having to deal with a an

34
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:59,859
existing greenhouse structure in some

35
00:01:55,989 --> 00:02:01,839
ways can be more painful than an indoor

36
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:04,478
structure where at least you have bones

37
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,340
that are gonna stay put that may be you

38
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:09,580
know it like you'll fix up I mean in

39
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:12,729
terms of indoor facilities you know the

40
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,740
roof the structure itself is horrible to

41
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:16,810
deal with because a lot of it can't hold

42
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:20,140
the load of the equipment that you want

43
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,120
to install you have neighbors both for

44
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:24,159
greenhouses and for indoor that are

45
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:28,060
gonna complain about odor that are

46
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:30,490
forcing less efficient greenhouse

47
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,920
designs because we're trying to

48
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,450
keep all that odor from leaving the

49
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,889
facility and then if you let it leave

50
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:38,169
the facility now what are you spraying

51
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:41,139
into the air using to mitigate those

52
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:43,599
odors right also not a good solution so

53
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:45,459
being able to find a green a property

54
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,719
where the greenhouse is maybe more rural

55
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,030
and you're not gonna get all those

56
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,900
complaints and you can do some install

57
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,069
more efficient equipment would be ideal

58
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,920
we don't always have that option though

59
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:59,349
right the ideal isn't always there is

60
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:01,509
still sticking on the design topic what

61
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:05,109
are a couple things that are commonly

62
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:07,329
overlooked on just general designs of

63
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,400
greenhouse of space in general what are

64
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,620
a few things that are overlooked is is a

65
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,039
post-production pre-production the

66
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:16,180
happiness and health of the employees

67
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,370
what are some things that you've kind of

68
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,770
noticed that people kind of go in

69
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:24,460
forgetting about so I guess you know

70
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:26,800
kind of coming from the last question in

71
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,710
terms of retrofit versus fresh build you

72
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,070
know every time if you can do it once

73
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:36,879
and right that's the way to do it on the

74
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:38,439
retrofit side of things I I think it's a

75
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,229
lot of it comes down to what I would

76
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:43,539
consider to be workflow you know and

77
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:45,759
that includes materials flow you know

78
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:47,859
harvesting flow all of that you know

79
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,590
I've worked in far too many facilities

80
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,510
I'll give one of my favorite examples a

81
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:55,719
couple hundred light indoor facility in

82
00:03:52,509 --> 00:03:59,199
Denver it was back in the day Cummins

83
00:03:55,719 --> 00:04:01,000
engine test plant and so you know they

84
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,699
had it was clean there was no major

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,990
issue they had huge bay roll-up doors

86
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:07,119
you know obviously they were bringing in

87
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:11,320
heavy you know diesel engines and stuff

88
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,930
to test at a mile high and so it got

89
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:17,019
converted into a cultivation facility

90
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,030
and in their enthusiasm they walled off

91
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,548
all the roll-up doors for security

92
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:24,609
measures and so the biggest entrance

93
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:26,519
into the building was a man door and if

94
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:29,080
they wanted to bring in things like

95
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,939
tanks they know it's gets totally

96
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:32,680
laughable if they wanted to bring in

97
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:34,180
things like big tanks which you might

98
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,699
want in a you know a couple hundred

99
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,470
light indoor possibly you'd have to cut

100
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:41,800
a hole through the roof and crane it in

101
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:43,669
which you know given the crazy HVAC and

102
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,639
lighting and everything was in

103
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:49,938
entirely functional forum so you know

104
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,610
it's good to plan for for the purpose

105
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:54,349
and you know certainly workflow I think

106
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:56,710
is like the biggest thing you know soil

107
00:04:54,348 --> 00:04:59,870
in soil out material and material out

108
00:04:56,709 --> 00:05:02,538
Jurgen omics all of that is pretty darn

109
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,759
key yeah I think workflow is one of the

110
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:06,378
things that people constantly leave out

111
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,900
in the efficiency model that is probably

112
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:10,759
one of the most efficient models that

113
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:12,138
they need to be thinking of is how do

114
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,840
your employees get from point A to point

115
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:18,680
B as well as the product so I'm just

116
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:22,728
gonna say real quickly is move the

117
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:27,319
plants to the people as opposed to the

118
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:31,610
people to the plants the amount of labor

119
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:35,750
efficiency and just risk of cross

120
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:40,129
contamination by doing it that way huge

121
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:41,598
savings huge opportunities there and you

122
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:44,210
know when we're just talking

123
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:46,188
horticulture in general you know like

124
00:05:44,209 --> 00:05:49,068
some of you may have seen you know these

125
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:52,610
lettuce greenhouses where you know they

126
00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:55,550
they transplant the seeds at one end of

127
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:59,389
a deep bed water culture and then and

128
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:02,300
then they incrementally move those

129
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:05,210
plants down the row and then 30 days

130
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,860
later they're harvesting from the other

131
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:09,680
end

132
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:12,528
people never moved those plants never

133
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,560
had to harvest them by hand they

134
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:17,418
literally just have a machine that just

135
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,569
scoops it up takes it over to the

136
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:22,218
packaging room and then people handle it

137
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:24,020
I mean then um you know we're so

138
00:06:22,218 --> 00:06:26,240
concerned about energy efficiency in the

139
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:30,620
cost of energy but what is always the

140
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,629
number one cost of any business labor so

141
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,750
anything you can do to reduce labor

142
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:40,330
increase labor efficiency which is move

143
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:43,189
plants to the people as much as possible

144
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:46,848
so I I was only going to say one thing

145
00:06:43,189 --> 00:06:48,409
I'm now gonna say - so you are asking

146
00:06:46,848 --> 00:06:50,449
sort of what are some of the primary

147
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:52,639
things that people fail to consider and

148
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:53,718
I agree with both of the things and then

149
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,478
the other thing that I'm gonna say

150
00:06:53,718 --> 00:06:56,930
people fail to consider on the regular

151
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,560
which is

152
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:02,180
kind of shocking is where their most

153
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,500
fundamental components are gonna come

154
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:05,600
from where is your electricity coming

155
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,689
from where's your water coming from what

156
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,110
people genuinely don't ask those

157
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:13,000
questions when looking at properties all

158
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:16,310
the time

159
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,800
you don't just flip a switch and it's

160
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,389
all done that's that's not actually

161
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,449
where electricity comes from it's not

162
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:26,478
magic it has to get to you from

163
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:27,050
somewhere and understanding where it's

164
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,259
coming from

165
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:32,930
and how it's going to get there kind of

166
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:35,719
important when it is one of the highest

167
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:38,860
cost factors and one of the most

168
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:42,620
critical components of your facility

169
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,490
secondarily I will say that we very much

170
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,370
confuse

171
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,900
energy efficiency with efficiency and

172
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:51,259
sustainability those are two totally

173
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:53,929
different things and super important

174
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:57,168
when we are speaking on an efficiency

175
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:59,449
panel to recognize that the we are not

176
00:07:57,168 --> 00:08:02,089
only considering how to be energy

177
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:04,430
efficient we are considering how to be

178
00:08:02,089 --> 00:08:07,759
efficient in the entire scope and

179
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:10,160
function of our business and that's not

180
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,029
only going to capitalize on your

181
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,220
electricity so the people become really

182
00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:19,279
important the workflow becomes really

183
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:21,409
important all of those things are part

184
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,448
of efficiency all of those things are

185
00:08:21,408 --> 00:08:26,329
critical parts of sustainability and

186
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:29,419
will ultimately have massive impacts on

187
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:30,978
the cost of doing business I want to

188
00:08:29,418 --> 00:08:33,319
kind of jump in there and follow up and

189
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:35,538
you know coming from from you know

190
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,629
Nevada County and being you know having

191
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:40,939
my roots in organic cultivation and

192
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:42,500
things like that you know there's been

193
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,120
this ongoing debate that I'm sure

194
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,980
everyone's been somewhat preview to

195
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,259
write which is organic versus synthetic

196
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:50,389
what's better what's worse what's more

197
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:52,129
efficient what's not and and you know

198
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:55,240
the the opinion that I've come to is

199
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:59,028
essentially that you know you can do

200
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,009
organic cultivation very well you know

201
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:03,230
you can have an efficient business model

202
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:05,389
built from you know an organic

203
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:07,700
cultivation model you can also do

204
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:09,769
organic cultivation very poorly you can

205
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,670
do organic cultivation in a very

206
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:13,669
resource

207
00:09:10,669 --> 00:09:16,309
in efficient manner you know so to me

208
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:18,769
it's no longer you know is it organic is

209
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:20,539
it synthetic you know there's there's a

210
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:22,940
triple bottom line of course but in

211
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:25,299
terms of just resource efficiency you

212
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,800
know one doesn't inherently mean

213
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:30,919
resource efficient or low carbon

214
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:32,569
footprint at this point you know so that

215
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:34,490
that to me is you know I'm sort of

216
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,260
surprised that that's the situation in a

217
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,730
certain way but but that's the reality

218
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:40,278
of it you know you really need to be

219
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:41,509
aware of your supply chain where are you

220
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:43,759
if you're in the middle of nowhere it's

221
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:46,870
gonna cost you more you may be less

222
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:50,809
resource efficient bringing in bulk

223
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:52,610
organic media you know and and the only

224
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:54,259
thing I thought of too was you know I've

225
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:56,149
been working on this project in Ohio you

226
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:57,169
know and it's it's a big project they're

227
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:59,839
you know they're a very limited number

228
00:09:57,169 --> 00:10:02,028
of licenses and I talked to the lead

229
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,190
cultivator a few weeks ago and we're

230
00:10:02,028 --> 00:10:06,230
starting to talk down you know way

231
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,720
further planning stages beyond build-out

232
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:12,110
and I said to him so will you send me

233
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,089
the water data and he was like yeah yeah

234
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,399
I'm pretty sure we have it somewhere and

235
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:19,070
I'm like yeah can you like find that and

236
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,570
you know I can't believe you're millions

237
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:23,149
into a project and you don't know you

238
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:25,970
have excellent supply you know water

239
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:27,769
quality and you again you might want to

240
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:29,600
take that into consideration in the

241
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:31,009
pre-planning stages so you know what

242
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,350
your capital requirements are gonna be

243
00:10:31,009 --> 00:10:37,159
for the equipment to remediate your site

244
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:39,769
and get it to you know the spec that you

245
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:43,159
desire I mean thank you for saying water

246
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:46,490
quality and water source that is should

247
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:49,519
be number one when selecting a property

248
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:53,149
because that is the life of your plant

249
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,519
and yeah and it's going to affect your

250
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:57,500
filtration needs or do you need reverse

251
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,179
osmosis it kills me to see all these

252
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:03,230
facilities installing reverse osmosis

253
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:05,870
that has perfect water quality right or

254
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:08,360
that has really crappy water quality and

255
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,250
isn't filtering it or doing any sort of

256
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,579
remediation I mean I don't not even sure

257
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:15,769
which one is worse you know we recently

258
00:11:13,578 --> 00:11:18,019
worked on a project in Oklahoma we're

259
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:20,328
designing a high-pressure fog system and

260
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:21,649
you know one of the first questions is

261
00:11:20,328 --> 00:11:23,779
what's the water quality because how

262
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:25,820
much filtration do we need to put on

263
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:28,459
on the water that's gonna go through

264
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,580
these teeny tiny teeny tiny nozzles and

265
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:34,820
the growers like oh we have that a few

266
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:37,400
days later well we can't find it so

267
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,650
we're getting it tested again and it's

268
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,360
just like you wanted an answer for this

269
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:42,620
you know fog system two weeks ago and

270
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,289
now we're waiting two weeks for your

271
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,009
water quality sample so water water

272
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:50,509
water

273
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:54,009
it all starts there it's pretty

274
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:56,870
important thing again you know yeah yeah

275
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:58,309
right exactly yeah and that's the that's

276
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:02,299
the truth I like how you touched on the

277
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:03,649
the topic of organic and it you know it

278
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:05,449
could be a good thing or it can be a

279
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:07,569
non-sustainable thing just depending on

280
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,370
the the inputs

281
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:12,200
another thing that's you know comes to

282
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,169
mind too when the efficiency of the

283
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,790
design is the operating procedures

284
00:12:14,169 --> 00:12:19,519
literally every single function in the

285
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:21,649
farm even going to get the mail should

286
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,269
have an operating procedure you know and

287
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:25,009
they're adaptable they're you know

288
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:26,419
that's an evolution depending on how the

289
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:28,309
business grows and evolves but

290
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:30,169
everything should come with a procedure

291
00:12:28,309 --> 00:12:32,329
you know and that procedure should

292
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:33,860
always be scrutinized and and how can it

293
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:36,200
be more efficient and how could it

294
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,700
benefit the program more and that's

295
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,710
something that a lot of people overlook

296
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,960
is that yeah I got my procedure it's in

297
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,490
here I pour a little visit for a little

298
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,320
of that and we're all good you know oh

299
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,000
no I had that eight percent you know

300
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,360
couldn't you know strain you know what

301
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,250
do I do

302
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,750
and so yeah having an operating

303
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,159
procedure and a standard procedure for

304
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:55,850
everything that you do is very very

305
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:58,639
important so I want to just have a

306
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:01,279
moment to touch on that because actually

307
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:05,720
somebody on the legal panel was talking

308
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,549
about how sort of freaked out frustrated

309
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,960
bent out of shape everybody gets with

310
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:11,209
the regulation the regulation the

311
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,240
regulation and it sucks and we're coming

312
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:15,889
from no regulation and really any

313
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,470
regulation feels excessive and

314
00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:22,009
frustrating and expensive but at the end

315
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:25,370
of the day it's those regulations those

316
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:28,850
procedures that ultimately create the

317
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:33,139
sustainable functioning economy of an

318
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:35,089
industry of scale they are I'm not even

319
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:37,250
going to call them necessary evils they

320
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:40,040
are just flat-out necessary

321
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:43,700
it's how we figure out how to do this

322
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:46,459
well it's how we figure out how to do it

323
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:49,340
in a way that supports everybody

324
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:51,620
actually being able to stay open and

325
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:55,030
actually being able to make money off of

326
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,029
the work that they do

327
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,609
you
