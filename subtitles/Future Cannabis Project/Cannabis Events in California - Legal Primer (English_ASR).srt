[Music]

2
00:00:11,419 --> 00:00:18,960
with the passage of AV 2020 raise your

3
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,320
hand if you've read a B 2020 from front

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,880
to back

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,670
oh my god we have Pam Epstein in the

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:27,239
house who's gonna be doing a legal deep

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:31,140
dive into temporary licenses cannabis

8
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:36,299
events something that captain happened

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:38,128
fairly often in 2017-2018 a lot of the

10
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:41,399
consumption events you all know and love

11
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:43,259
came to a screeching halt pans here to

12
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,320
explain why but to explain why things

13
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:48,780
are about to change and on our panel we

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,558
have a whole bunch of cannabis event

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,870
operators in the state of California so

16
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,459
I'm gonna turn it over to Pam she's

17
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:58,820
gonna do a little legal deep pot dive

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:02,520
with everyone and then I'm gonna do the

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:06,269
business side of running events with the

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,430
panel so Pam welcome everyone I think

21
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:11,219
it's interesting to set up the

22
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,280
conversations you're gonna hear from the

23
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:16,590
operators up here who have lived through

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,680
the challenges who have learned

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:24,478
throughout the implementation period of

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,880
what is now the Mau CRS a and have

27
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,739
persevered through that and are going to

28
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:32,219
kind of take us through that journey

29
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:35,640
through what living this ever-changing

30
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:38,310
legal landscape was with a lens on what

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,879
we have to look forward to in 2019 and

32
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:45,390
why it may seem like a small victory it

33
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:48,030
is going to be a watershed moment to get

34
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,259
us back to the events culture that

35
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:56,368
California was known for under prop 215

36
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:59,250
I'm so to set us up for that California

37
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:02,310
was one of the was the first date to

38
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,500
take decriminalize action in 1996 with

39
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,500
The Compassionate Use Act that then

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,830
became the medical marijuana program

41
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,990
with SB 420

42
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,719
that gave you the cooperative collective

43
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,730
model in the 2008 attorney general

44
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:20,939
guidelines and we lived under that

45
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:22,619
system for quite a long period of time

46
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:25,379
until late 2015

47
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,689
when there was a trio of bills

48
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:30,719
interesting to note there were over I

49
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:32,460
think 80 legislative bills this past

50
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,139
session so we've come a long way and

51
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,900
that gave us mersa

52
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:40,589
which then gave birth to what statutory

53
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:43,770
structure we currently have and under

54
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,900
that structure predating that structure

55
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,480
under the 215 model you would simply

56
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,670
have an event and you would check

57
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,979
recommendations patient recommendations

58
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:54,659
and you would have brands that showed up

59
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:56,310
because they were properly forms

60
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:57,810
collectives and people would join the

61
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,050
collectives and they were able to have

62
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,240
this robust interaction with cannabis

63
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,570
and the operators and the manufacturers

64
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,760
that were truly engaged in this process

65
00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:11,759
what happened when we had infrastructure

66
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:14,819
come into play is you had the creation

67
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,609
by one of the three regulatory agencies

68
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:21,959
the Bureau of cannabis control developed

69
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:25,290
an event organiser licensee and special

70
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:29,340
event licenses and when the ma us and

71
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:33,239
when the ma UC RSA came into effect it

72
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,340
said a very specific precedent about

73
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,039
where these events were allowed to be

74
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:41,310
located they were allowed to be located

75
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:43,650
on agriculture agricultural associations

76
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,469
in County Fairgrounds district

77
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,349
agricultural associations there are 58

78
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:53,489
throughout the state and they are state

79
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:55,590
agencies however the state agency these

80
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,019
are like little state agencies are

81
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:02,550
housed within other jurisdictions and

82
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:04,969
because when we had Mandy ma you see RSA

83
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,830
come into effect you had to have local

84
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:10,080
authorization local authorization was

85
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:13,560
given to you by a local jurisdiction

86
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,889
that was defined as a city county or

87
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,620
city and county and that did not include

88
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:23,279
a district agricultural Association so

89
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,480
as these event organizers went to go get

90
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:27,479
their license and

91
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,550
and engage in a compliant activity they

92
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,590
went to where you naturally think that

93
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,530
you would go as you are a state agency

94
00:04:31,589 --> 00:04:36,449
and we'll hear I'm sure about the trials

95
00:04:34,529 --> 00:04:38,549
and tribulations with chalice I in fact

96
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:43,399
worked with the 28 CAA

97
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:45,509
because they believed that they had the

98
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:48,359
jurisdictional control over their

99
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:51,539
borders to regulate what events took

100
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,370
place there that's an important

101
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,000
distinction right you would think that

102
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:59,340
they don't pay city tax they get all of

103
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,649
their permits from the state that now

104
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:04,079
all of the sudden where you are located

105
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:06,389
where this district agricultural

106
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:08,370
Association is located and it's in the

107
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:09,959
name they serve a larger district they

108
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:13,199
serve everybody in the state of

109
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:15,719
California to the means of granting them

110
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,599
access to agricultural activity we are

111
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,090
in fact in cannabis and agricultural

112
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,770
product right so this is in the

113
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:24,659
wheelhouse of what these district

114
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:26,430
agricultural associations are used to

115
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,290
doing they put on events they have

116
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,900
liquor licenses they don't go to the

117
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:33,900
jurisdiction at any other point to ask

118
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:37,019
for permission and why is this so

119
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:40,399
critical because you may have a

120
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:43,649
favorable DAA who has had positive

121
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:48,060
experiences with cannabis operators that

122
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:51,349
then have to go and ask a city for

123
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:54,209
permission and that city may be

124
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:58,129
unfavorable to cannabis and that then

125
00:05:54,209 --> 00:06:02,879
creates a conflict that was unresolvable

126
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:04,860
until we got to a be a year 2020 so an

127
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,810
event organizer goes they go through the

128
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,670
disclosure process they get their

129
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,550
license and then they have to go and get

130
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:13,980
that event license that temporary event

131
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:16,560
allowance that's when we run in to the

132
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:19,500
problems at the fairgrounds and moving

133
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,540
forward as we talked about 2020 gives

134
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:26,000
you the right gives these operators the

135
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:29,160
right to be able to hold events not on

136
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,410
das or County Fairgrounds but anywhere

137
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,920
where they can get local authority in

138
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:36,570
local authorization at first that seems

139
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,160
like you're going to be able to have an

140
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:42,209
event anywhere

141
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:45,180
what this does is it allows for events

142
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:48,269
to take place not at those two specific

143
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:51,329
locations by you have to gain permission

144
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:54,810
to do so and once you give the right to

145
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:57,300
regulate you will see cities and

146
00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:00,810
counties stepping up and wanting to

147
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,329
regulate so what does that mean are you

148
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:06,269
going to have to get some sort of permit

149
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:08,039
we hope so what I always advise and what

150
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:10,680
I know that these operators will likely

151
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,290
do is to go to those cities with a

152
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,600
request know what kind of event you want

153
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:18,090
to have know where you want to have that

154
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,280
event know whether or not there is

155
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:22,409
alcohol that's going to be served at

156
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,389
that event because that is a critical

157
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,270
component of the events culture that is

158
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:30,870
going to continue to experience pain

159
00:07:27,269 --> 00:07:33,509
points is how do you have an event where

160
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:38,040
you have two substances that are heavily

161
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:39,899
controlled and we've seen the state and

162
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,689
the governor take a very specific

163
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:45,810
position a that you cannot infuse

164
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:47,759
cannabis to the with any alcohol more to

165
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,069
the point than that the regulations

166
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,159
flushed out that you cannot even have

167
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:57,269
the alkalized beer or wine or anything

168
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:59,880
that we confuse the consumer so you can

169
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:02,909
see that we're gonna have strategic pain

170
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:05,370
points to learn how to navigate between

171
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,800
having a premise and what that premise

172
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:10,590
means and whether or not you're at a

173
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,020
facility that serves alcohol and whether

174
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:16,918
or not that facility could potentially

175
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:19,109
be jeopardizing their liquor license or

176
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:20,639
their insurance policies or any other

177
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,550
business license that they currently

178
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,918
have so what is the difference you may

179
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:29,610
be thinking between a consumption event

180
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:31,349
and a event that you can consume out

181
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,149
where you can also purchase cannabis

182
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:37,168
does that sort of also what we're

183
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:40,918
talking about where we've seen in the

184
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:43,079
last year to two years these pop up

185
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:44,909
events that occur where you see vendors

186
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,180
that are there that are exchanging

187
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:50,939
products if that product has not gone

188
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:54,559
through a retailer if that event

189
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:57,870
is taking place in a non private

190
00:08:54,559 --> 00:09:00,449
residence even then with track and trace

191
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:03,289
coming online you're not going to be

192
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:07,620
able to hold those events those are

193
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:09,480
non-compliant events California says

194
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,110
there is no or the city of Los Angeles

195
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:16,350
says there is no consumption right they

196
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,210
do not have time yet to regulate this so

197
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,300
there are no consumption lounges that

198
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:24,360
are regulated there are no consumption

199
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:26,039
on site with a dispensary these are

200
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,289
things that need to be flushed out in

201
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:30,269
Southern California the only people that

202
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:32,429
are the only city jurisdiction is moving

203
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:35,399
in that direction is the City of West

204
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:39,870
Hollywood and they are issuing specific

205
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,879
consumption licenses and dispensaries

206
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:45,990
that are allowed to consume on-site and

207
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:48,750
sell so you can see the more they they

208
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,850
have the bandwidth to regulate these

209
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,710
jurisdictions will start to do so and

210
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,769
they will regulate events in the same

211
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:58,290
manner and practice these West Hollywood

212
00:09:55,769 --> 00:10:00,240
is looking at the events issue now that

213
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:03,360
they want to get ahead of it because

214
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,710
they are a progressive city other cities

215
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,440
you're gonna see in Southern California

216
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:10,350
move much faster unfortunately than the

217
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,410
city of Los Angeles will be out in the

218
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:17,460
desert where you're gonna see Coachella

219
00:10:13,409 --> 00:10:20,699
Palm Springs Desert Hot Springs they're

220
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:24,350
all gonna issue events up north you're

221
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:27,390
gonna see this play out much quicker as

222
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:29,310
Oakland and Sacramento already have said

223
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:31,889
we're just gonna process events in the

224
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:33,869
same in similar fashion I know Davis the

225
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:35,759
city of Davis is also very much looking

226
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:38,070
into that so if you want to support

227
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,169
these event organizers I say please be

228
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:43,200
responsible when you're at the events

229
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:46,199
these is you know we're learning to walk

230
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,150
crawl run it out here in California and

231
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,820
as we want to develop the ability to

232
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:52,889
curate events where you're gonna be able

233
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,900
to see demonstrations of cannabis

234
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:56,490
products being made and then ingest them

235
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:57,809
without having to have final form

236
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,600
product through the Quality Assurance

237
00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:03,119
and quality control mechanisms that we

238
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,120
have the best way to do that is to

239
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,769
be a compliant attendee at these events

240
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,929
so it would ask you to do that and

241
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:12,480
really listen and support these

242
00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:14,909
operators as they tell you how they

243
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,500
Traverse these very Tremmel tourist

244
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:18,500
waters over the last two years

245
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:29,960
