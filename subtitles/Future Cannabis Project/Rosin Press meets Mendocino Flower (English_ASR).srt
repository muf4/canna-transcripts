cannabis tissue culture so this started

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,200
off in the petri dish and I grew it and

10
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,690
I vege to it and i gave it love and love

11

California so I'm I'm spontaneous about

26
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,770
where I'm at I go to Sacramento I go to

27
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:40,229
San Bernardino I go to Oakland I go

28
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:44,939
everywhere and actually I'm on my way to

29
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:48,150
catering weddings that's my goal to have

30
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:53,849
a dab bar and pre-roll for my for

31
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:56,130
weddings in wine country stupid good for

32
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:58,349
animals around here nobody has that

33
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:01,259
right now Trish nobody has happy

34
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:03,839
it's from the real Coronado in Colorado

35
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,670
he's the guy that made it I'm the one

36
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,550
that grew it though and then I hear

37
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,159
we've got some prepared and my own

38
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:13,709
proprietary preparation method a lot of

39
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,870
companies will do BTS or bottle textile

40
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,469
this is a variation on that it's a

41
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:22,819
little more efficient it's a top bottle

42
00:02:18,469 --> 00:02:27,090
and this is a let's see 90 micron bag

43
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:29,189
courtesy of the Press Club so far they

44
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:32,310
are my favorite company in terms of bags

45
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:34,500
you can press bagless but only really

46
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,229
small amounts and it tends to not be as

47
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,050
clean you slap particulate in there so I

48
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:42,629
like going with bags and we'll see how

49
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:47,160
it comes out right now I'm also pressing

50
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:50,699
this at a lower temp at 185 yes correct

51
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:53,099
this is a DIY Robert uh-huh correct and

52
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:54,929
using dab press plates on here shout out

53
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:58,650
to them too there are another really

54
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:01,200
great company you can go with a build

55
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:04,590
that's much more do-it-yourself than

56
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,780
this but I still had to come up with

57
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,239
something that was that fit my own style

58
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,849
and budget compared to other companies

59
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,789
that are out there there are some great

60
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:18,030
players in the rosin press market our

61
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:21,120
industry but a lot of the presses out

62
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:23,759
there are pretty pricey for the average

63
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,530
you know Joe Schmo who's just starting

64
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,090
wanting to press a little bit see how it

65
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,709
goes

66
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,590
not everyone's got a thousand bucks to

67
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:35,239
spend on experimenting you know

68
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:37,729
for bud right but these these machines I

69
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,759
have two of them they costs way less

70
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:44,929
than that to build so I'm all about the

71
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:49,120
DIY and trying to empower empower the

72
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:52,180
average you know the average guy or gal

73
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,250
gonna push it in a little bit further

74
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:59,629
preparation is key I am kind of fiddling

75
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:01,909
with it yeah this one's hand but you

76
00:03:59,628 --> 00:04:06,280
could go with electric with a palm plus

77
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:09,348
I talked about like the art of pressing

78
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:14,870
a lot of it you using your senses your

79
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:17,509
going by what you see what you hear some

80
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:20,720
people it's been allowed here but some

81
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:23,810
people listen for a sizzle I like using

82
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,940
my eyes once you see the oil starts

83
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:30,379
trick draining out that's usually when I

84
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:32,418
start my time as well if you look online

85
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:34,399
or if you ask somebody who presses they

86
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:36,349
will give you they'll have a long

87
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:40,489
explanation about the best temperature

88
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:42,320
the best time to leave it in for me it's

89
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:48,710
preferential it depends on what I'm

90
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:50,538
pressing right now I'm at 185 which is

91
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:53,659
not the lowest some people press that

92
00:04:50,538 --> 00:04:55,848
like 170 but I think the 80s are pretty

93
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:57,950
good for for getting a nice butter and

94
00:04:55,848 --> 00:05:00,740
preserving a lot of Terps but also

95
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:03,079
getting a good yield well I mean a lot

96
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:07,069
of people press button like the low 200s

97
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:10,449
yeah yeah the usually arranged is 170 F

98
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:12,620
to about 220 but if you go into the 200s

99
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:15,560
even though you end up getting a nice

100
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:17,780
yield you you've sort of burnt off or

101
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,759
destroyed some of the Turks so it tends

102
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:22,038
to come out a lot darker and since

103
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:26,120
there's less Terps it's not really wet

104
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:29,240
or saucy it's more like shattered

105
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,750
I tend to prefer the batter's it's got

106
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,750
more flavor

107
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:38,749
so when I start seeing a lot seeping out

108
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:40,428
that's usually when I start my time but

109
00:05:38,749 --> 00:05:42,499
again I kind of play it by eye and by

110
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:44,388
ear if I'm going to and-a-half minutes

111
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:45,799
if my time runs out and it's still

112
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:49,309
flowing out a lot

113
00:05:45,798 --> 00:05:50,748
I'll put an extra minute maybe if I hear

114
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:52,969
it's still sizzling meaning there's

115
00:05:50,749 --> 00:05:54,528
still oil sort of boiling out of the

116
00:05:52,968 --> 00:05:55,848
plant matter then I know there's a

117
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:58,308
little more and I'll leave it a bit

118
00:05:55,848 --> 00:06:01,158
longer so in terms of different

119
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:03,459
cultivars and how they yield once we

120
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:08,808
finish this you kind of tell me how this

121
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:09,139
how this Street does yeah yeah fair

122
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:11,479
enough

123
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:12,949
well this has a little bit longer to go

124
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:16,248
so in the meantime let me just show you

125
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:17,899
something you can see there speaking of

126
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:21,019
other cultivars these are some other

127
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:24,798
presses I've done recently this here is

128
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:25,788
purple tangi which it was from stay high

129
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:28,748
LAX

130
00:06:25,788 --> 00:06:31,338
I don't believe they cultivated it but

131
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:33,859
it was just some really nice but it's

132
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:35,868
just a team of dominant hybrid this one

133
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:37,668
buttered up on the paper so it's

134
00:06:35,869 --> 00:06:40,249
completely stable you can touch it it's

135
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:42,139
not sticky at all it just smells like a

136
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:45,289
fruit basket just punches you in the

137
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:49,788
nose this is from Josh wax

138
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:51,588
this is his Seabiscuit a3 which I think

139
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:55,399
has won some competitions of its own

140
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:57,649
actually this was just pressed let's see

141
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:58,249
two days ago and left to cure for a

142
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:01,579
little bit

143
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:06,519
completely buttered up just extremely

144
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:06,519
fragrant pressed at a low temp and

145
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,509
and then on the other end of the

146
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,509
spectrum

147
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:19,139
I for personal use I press a lot ahem

148
00:07:16,348 --> 00:07:23,519
so these are hemp Rosen's high CBD roses

149
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:26,490
so these give you a lot of anti-anxiety

150
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:28,318
and cyah lytic relief anti-inflammatory

151
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,300
relief so it's going to help a lot of

152
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,780
pain you might have from old injuries or

153
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,069
arthritis or whatever you have some

154
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:38,638
people find it helps them sleep better

155
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:40,759
or recover from workouts faster for me

156
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,530
honestly it just helps with anxiety and

157
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:49,560
and muscle pain I have back pain so

158
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:51,959
scoliosis so this one's almost ready and

159
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:57,538
I could just tell by how it looks it's

160
00:07:51,959 --> 00:08:00,689
starting to butter up already see that

161
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:02,189
frothiness once I take it out and get it

162
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:07,168
on the cold plate its gonna butter up

163
00:08:02,189 --> 00:08:10,908
and that's our time trying to dry this

164
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:13,560
off make sure there's no condensation

165
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:16,889
this is a budget cold plate this is a

166
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:21,478
this is a baking tin and you know just a

167
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:23,400
quick yeah it's like 10 bucks compared

168
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:27,378
to a professional cold plate which is

169
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:27,378
like 8200

170
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:42,168
so yeah we don't have smell-o-vision but

171
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:45,019
not yeah right

172
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:46,429
you know when smellivision finally comes

173
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:50,740
around it's going to be stoners who

174
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:50,739
really make the most use out of it I

175
00:08:51,818 --> 00:09:01,248
wanted AB do it these guys are hot we

176
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:03,139
also got some courts if as long as

177
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:06,139
someone's got a torch I don't have a

178
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:07,549
mount of beauty there on the court

179
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:09,318
should be the best guys are hot already

180
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:10,849
though or if someone's got a puff CO or

181
00:09:09,318 --> 00:09:15,318
something yeah

182
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,689
here let's I was gonna do I was gonna do

183
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:19,278
a second press and so I could really

184
00:09:17,688 --> 00:09:20,028
track the weight do you mind I'll be

185
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:21,499
quick that's cool

186
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:24,049
area I want you guys to smoke on this

187
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:28,639
later - okay okay this is my head size

188
00:09:24,049 --> 00:09:34,269
so definitely get in there oh yeah it's

189
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:34,269
all you guys follow my Instagram

190
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:42,170
as far as I'm concerned though this

191
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:45,319
press very nicely my Grand Canyon

192
00:09:42,169 --> 00:09:48,189
cannabis well I could have got some

193
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,830
cheaper stuff but this is my favorite

194
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:54,110
also oh that's all that looks nice

195
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:56,690
that's a big yield for flower yeah and

196
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:01,930
this is just the first press Wow you

197
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,930
said it was six fiction - six point four

198
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:16,049
that gives me a canon boner if I find my

199
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:18,778
gelato 45 hash it's over it's over yeah

200
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:20,759
my my bubble hashas dabble bowl so if

201
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:22,730
you hit it on a high heat you get dad's

202
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:27,360
all day yeah

203
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:29,579
put love into it man hey they've no they

204
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,000
pressed my or grranimals my month my

205
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:32,000
head stash

206
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:41,759
hi he said six point four and I'm

207
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:45,838
thinking total will be about one and a

208
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:49,429
half usually four grams of pretty good

209
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:52,470
bud or 25% brings back a gram of rosin

210
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:55,528
because the weight is about a quarter

211
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:57,269
gram per per gram of flour and that's

212
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:59,909
assuming we can extract a hundred

213
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:02,549
percent of it and realistically I'm

214
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:06,208
getting in the 90s when you're done

215
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:09,629
pressing you typically end up with these

216
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:11,909
called rosin chips some people will

217
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:13,289
break the weed out and try to smoke it

218
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:15,480
but I wouldn't recommend that because

219
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:17,849
it's very harsh and it doesn't have that

220
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,500
much in it so it's you know it's you're

221
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,230
gonna be smoking a lot for the effect

222
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:25,169
you'll get what I picture exactly you

223
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:27,509
could soak it in alcohol a high high

224
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:31,078
proof like Everclear of vodka or I

225
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:32,879
actually make it in coconut oil I cook

226
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:36,328
it or you can do butter and there you

227
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:38,070
have animals in oil but my point is

228
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:40,370
there's no waste at least with the way I

229
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,370
do it

230
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:47,548
so this is the second one it's I don't

231
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,259
usually leave them for as long because

232
00:11:47,548 --> 00:11:52,980
it's already hot it has a heat from the

233
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:55,079
first round I just want to quickly push

234
00:11:52,980 --> 00:12:01,188
out whatever didn't come out the first

235
00:11:55,078 --> 00:12:01,188
time and then again here's the strain oh

236
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,480
look

237
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,879
look at that

238
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,250
[Music]

239
00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:15,619
[Applause]

240
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:18,820
it's like diamonds

241
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,820
[Applause]

242
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:27,509
okay I'll let this out

243
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:38,240
and again you can make presses or there

244
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:42,560
are presses that are much more compact

245
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:48,730
than this for six tons of pressure but a

246
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:55,009
lot of them are very very costly or just

247
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:56,120
just not as DIY I guess is this one yeah

248
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:58,399
that's the most pretty good

249
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,519
so the second presses are usually darker

250
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,409
a little oilier in some cases you start

251
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,539
burning the oil and that's why it's

252
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:07,819
darker but I'm going at a pretty low

253
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:09,889
temp so I think this is just getting to

254
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,350
the limits of the oil in this amount of

255
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:15,139
weed eventually if you keep cranking

256
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:18,769
you'll get a really dark oil and that's

257
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:21,708
actually not even cannabinoids anymore

258
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:23,240
that's like chlorophyll and you're

259
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:25,879
getting plant oils that you don't really

260
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,950
want yeah the good stuff tends to come

261
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:30,588
out in the first two presses and that's

262
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:31,970
what we've got here beyond that you're

263
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:33,320
you're getting out stuff you don't

264
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:35,740
really want to be smoking it's gonna

265
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,740
make it hard

266
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,850
yeah these are some presses I did right

267
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,139
before you got here I showed you this

268
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:45,129
one but you could kind of see it this is

269
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:47,980
from some ahem

270
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:51,490
so it's got a much more glassy shatter

271
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:54,039
kind of look to it usually hemp by press

272
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:58,899
at a higher temp so I can get a better

273
00:13:54,039 --> 00:14:00,099
yield out of it I'm I got a lot the

274
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:01,720
first time yeah I'm in a way it right

275
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,019
now I know this is another hemp strain

276
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:09,430
on other one was super haze and this is

277
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:11,529
a lifter Oh Jeep so those are the

278
00:14:09,429 --> 00:14:15,759
presses I've done tonight like I said

279
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:18,419
for myself I do a lot of CBD pressing

280
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:18,419
CBD rasa

281
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:38,250
if you don't have a cold surface the

282
00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:41,129
scrape is really tedious and really

283
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:44,100
annoying you really want to use a cold

284
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:46,259
surface if you're at home obviously

285
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,600
something like the freezer or you know

286
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:51,299
maybe put a plate in the freezer for a

287
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,149
second to get cold I like using the

288
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:55,559
little entryway to the freezer there's

289
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:57,329
usually going to be a nice little flat

290
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:00,629
platform depending on how your doors

291
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:05,040
open if they open out sideways or they

292
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:06,629
have the vertical stack ones but point

293
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:10,259
is you need a cold surface granite

294
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:12,240
countertop can work pretty well too and

295
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:13,679
I'm leaving behind these little plant

296
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,460
bits because obviously we don't want

297
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,459
those on the nail

298
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,279
this one yeah look at that

299
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:30,169
and when it's really high quality bud a

300
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:32,480
lot of times you can mix the person the

301
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:35,479
second press for some people it is

302
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,279
preferential but what I found is if

303
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,980
they're done close together same

304
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,319
temperature it'll all mix together

305
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:47,570
pretty well and it will all butter up

306
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:50,150
together but I know some companies out

307
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:53,330
there they definitely don't mix their

308
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:55,909
first and second runs for flour rosin I

309
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:58,759
think it's okay maybe for hash rosin you

310
00:15:55,909 --> 00:16:03,370
wanna you want to keep that first and

311
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:03,370
second press or run separately

312
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:16,019
when it's this buttery I also try to not

313
00:16:09,379 --> 00:16:18,659
disturb that too much I'm not not I want

314
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:21,438
the butteriness to be I want you to be

315
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:21,438
able to dab that up

316
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:29,320
there you go look how easy that comes up

317
00:16:31,669 --> 00:16:33,699
Oh

318
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,379
this is it as a letter peace latter

319
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:44,379
peace

320
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:56,550
yeah

321
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,550
look at the color though

322
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:05,039
you cut me a little square one of these

323
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:05,039
from now and maybe thank you

324
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:12,030
I had another square a second ago

325
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,029
thank you

326
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:20,180
all right so all this in 6.2 6.4

327
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:38,750
this feels like a little over a gram and

328
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:41,720
a half based on 6.2 or 6.4 if it's 25%

329
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:46,609
we should get about one and a half or so

330
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,089
so let's see okay a little under one and

331
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:51,589
a half

332
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:54,308
but that's let's see I'm pleased about

333
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:54,308
the quality

334
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:00,639
[Applause]

so you said 6.4 okay my bad

336
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,049
21%

337
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,839
that's not bad as long as you're in the

338
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:21,730
20s I think you're good but I can do

339

340
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:27,390
