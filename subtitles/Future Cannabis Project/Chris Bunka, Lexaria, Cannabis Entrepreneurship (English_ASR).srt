1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,359
and so we've uh developed a technology

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,160
that we originally bought about a year

3
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:18,358
ago and we've enhanced it a lot and we

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,320
now have a way of delivering cannaboids

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,160
uh through ingestion through eating and

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,679
drinking that um have the highest

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,960
bioavailability rates ever measured and

8
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:30,719
we've done inv vitro testing to to make

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,039
sure that that works and so far it does

10
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:37,079
work and it works very well and anytime

11
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:40,200
anybody can absorb a a molecule that's

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,878
having some some major effect on them um

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,600
and they can absorb it more efficiently

14
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:45,558
than they could before that's a good

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,320
thing because at the end of the day it

16
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:51,878
means they can use smaller amounts to

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,600
get the effect that they need and

18
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:57,238
anytime you're ingesting smaller amounts

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,359
of powerful molecules that's just better

20
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:01,439
for your body there are a lot of EDI out

21
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,799
there and there's a lot of different

22
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:07,438
ways to ingest different molecules like

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,040
cannaboids and there's some numbers that

24
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,319
people need to know so generally if

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,840
somebody smokes a joint they absorb

26
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:17,679
around 30% of the cannaboids um if they

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,640
Vape uh that number drops usually to

28
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,479
somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,560
22% if they go sublingual and put drops

30
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,759
under the tongue the absorption rates

31
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,079
into the blood are usually around

32
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,599
12% and unfortunately if you eat a a

33
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,519
marijuana brownie or a cookie or what

34
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:37,078
have you typical absorption rates are

35
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:41,039
only about 5% so you can see that

36
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:42,839
graduated kind of uh range of absorption

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,118
and this is all very well known to

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,240
science it's because of the way the body

39
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:52,078
absorbs powerful molecules so although

40
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:54,839
um Edibles are a preferred method of

41
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,599
ingesting uh with regards to societal

42
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,159
objections they're not a very good

43
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:02,158
method for absorbing molecules so our

44
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,520
science has done something that's really

45
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,719
cool and we actually work on a molecular

46
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:10,439
level these are this is patent pending

47
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:13,919
technology both in the United States and

48
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:17,560
worldwide where we combine the uh

49
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:20,159
cannaboids with longchain fatty acids

50
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,840
and basically what we do is we kind of

51
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,000
manipulate these molecules I'm not

52
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,319
allowed to say exactly how we do that

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,598
because that's our secret um but we

54
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:32,359
manipulate these molecules and when

55
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:35,399
we're finished the body recognizes the

56
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,720
fatty acid as opposed to the cannaboid

57
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,840
and what happens in our testing we did

58
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:42,719
some invital lab testing this summer The

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,959
Summer of 2015 and those test results

60
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,919
came back and they were marvelous they

61
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:53,560
were remarkable and in one of the tests

62
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:57,119
as an example we had 4 99% Improvement

63
00:02:53,560 --> 00:03:00,039
in absorption of cannabidiol compared to

64
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,680
Baseline without our technology so

65
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:07,239
fivefold increase in absorption which is

66
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:13,120
an amazing C change and what it means is

67
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:15,680
you could effectively use one as much of

68
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,759
a of a baked good or an edible product

69
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,560
with our technology as opposed to

70
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,878
without it and get relatively the same

71
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,878
effect that makes everything different

72
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:28,199
you can use less it's uh easier on your

73
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:29,959
body or you can use the same amount and

74
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,560
have a more profound effect that that's

75
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:36,878
up to the customer to decide we're all

76
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:41,239
profoundly affected by the major kind of

77
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:45,399
impact we think we can have not just on

78
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:49,480
our Market or the canabidol or THC

79
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:52,319
Market but on other markets so we've

80
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:57,399
extended our patents and we filed

81
00:03:52,318 --> 00:04:01,399
patents pending on U canabidol on uh THC

82
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,560
but also on fat soluble vitamins also on

83
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,280
non-steroidal anti-inflammatories so

84
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,360
these are things like ASA acetaminophen

85
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,719
and ibuprofen we all have that in our

86
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,439
homes and the the really big one from a

87
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,199
market perspective is nicotine we file

88
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,639
patent pendings on the delivery of

89
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:21,798
nicotine and all those other molecules

90
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,000
because we have reasons to believe that

91
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:27,959
our technology actually delivers all of

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,199
those molecules at a more effective rate

93
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,638
than they can be delivered today a lot

94
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:34,919
of people think that you absorb Foods in

95
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,038
your stomach and and you don't uh only

96
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,639
about 5% of what you eat is actually

97
00:04:37,038 --> 00:04:42,000
absorbed in your stomach 95% is absorbed

98
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:45,519
in your small intestine and the small

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,399
intestine likes certain molecules or is

100
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,680
more efficient at absorbing certain

101
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,198
molecules than it is compared to others

102
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,959
one of the things that it's very

103
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,879
welldeveloped to absorb is our fats um

104
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,359
and and that's not hard to believe

105
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,560
because there's an obesity problem all

106
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,720
over the world so the body's very good

107
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,280
at absorbing fats and so our kind of

108
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,240
Brain Trust if you will was well is

109
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:12,519
there a way that we can combine healthy

110
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,560
fats so longchain fatty acids are things

111
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:17,918
like sunflower oil which is a relatively

112
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,720
healthy fat very minute qu quantities of

113
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:24,478
it really minute quantities of that with

114
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,319
a payload such as canabidol manipulated

115
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:28,719
in a very particular way that nobody's

116
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,280
ever thought to do before and what we've

117
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:36,560
done is we've kind of the body into

118
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:39,918
saying oh I I smell I taste and I absorb

119
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,399
a fat and it also gets away from some of

120
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,399
the problems with some of the edible

121
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,599
markets that have some kind of pretty

122
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:48,038
strong flavors and pretty strong um

123
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,720
odors we generally don't have that in

124
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:53,399
our products or much much less because

125
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,000
again we wrap those molecules in a kind

126
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:58,038
of bubble of fat if you will and what

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,038
the body smells and tastes are those

128
00:05:58,038 --> 00:06:03,879
very Savory and and and good tasting

129
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:06,360
fats so we've kind of gotten around the

130
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:07,759
problems of of absorption by tricking

131
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,439
the body into thinking that it's

132
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,598
absorbing something else so for example

133
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:15,759
we have a product on the market right

134
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:18,719
now called vipo tea and it's tea it's

135
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:22,000
not hemp tea it's not marijuana tea it's

136
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,639
black tea it's Chinese black tea but

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,639
we've processed it with our with our

138
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:31,079
proprietary technology and we've placed

139
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,319
hemp oil and canabidol and tpin within

140
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,560
that black tea so when you drink that

141
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,800
tea you know what you taste you taste

142
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,598
black tea it has a slightly earthy

143
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,160
smooth kind of texture to it that black

144
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:46,839
tea doesn't really have black tea is a

145
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,479
little bit sharper but other than that

146
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:52,239
there is no hemp or marijuana flavor or

147
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:54,598
smell to it and we had such success with

148
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,000
that over the last six or eight months

149
00:06:54,598 --> 00:06:59,959
that we've actually unla launched a line

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,120
of seven other te's so we now have

151
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:05,120
English breakfast tea we have green tea

152
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:08,720
we have herbal teas um a whole variety

153
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:12,160
of teas and they all benefit from

154
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,680
avoiding the strong tastes which are

155
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,919
objectionable to a lot of people in fact

156
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,680
we are launching um a protein energy bar

157
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:25,198
in October of

158
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:28,038
2015 and it uses our technology no trans

159
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:32,080
fats no artificial sweeteners no

160
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:34,918
artificial flavors or colors no corn

161
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,478
syrup nothing like that super super

162
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,758
healthy bars with the benefits of full

163
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:41,918
spectrum hemp oil and they taste

164
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,720
delicious I have eaten them we've gone

165
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,158
through about 12 different recipe

166
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,199
formulations over the last year I've

167
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:49,800
eaten them a lot they are delicious and

168
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,000
they taste like a really really high

169
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,079
quality protein bar which is exactly

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,319
what a food should taste like the food

171
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,639
not something else we have a a

172
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,598
two-pronged business strategy as well I

173
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,478
mean we're very proud of the technology

174
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:04,360
we're very proud of our products but

175
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,959
we're running a business and so there

176
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,560
are two parallel themes to our business

177
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:14,758
the first one is the cannabidiol space

178
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,038
CBD so under the CBD molecule we are

179
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:20,520
launching we've already started with our

180
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,360
vova tea um we're launching coffee hot

181
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:25,878
chocolate and the protein energy bar in

182
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:29,960
the next 45 days all of those products

183
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:32,278
benefit from our technology and we use

184
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:35,519
uh canabidol that's sourced from the

185
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:39,240
hemp plant and under US federal law we

186
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:42,000
are allowed to use extracts from uh

187
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,360
imported hemp uh within our food

188
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,759
products and we can sell those products

189
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,200
Nationwide throughout America and in

190
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,439
fact we can sell them in certain other

191
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,200
countries as well that from a business

192
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,800
point of view allows us to produce our

193
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,959
product in one location and sell it

194
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,399
nationwide which is something that a lot

195
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,199
of the other fragmented businesses in

196
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:06,879
this sector are not able to do when they

197
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:09,640
operate in only one state um and it also

198
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,679
gives us benefits of scale um so we can

199
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:14,319
establish a national brand which we're

200
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,719
we're well in the midst of doing and and

201
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,399
we're conducting all of that so we are a

202
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,399
CBD company when it comes to products so

203
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,839
when we're selling Nationwide we also

204
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,600
are able to sell outside of the medical

205
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,880
marijuana uh channels so for example if

206
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,440
we were able to get into a National Drug

207
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:38,320
Store chain a National Grocery Store

208
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,720
chain uh herbal Health Centers uh gyms

209
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,720
uh any number of locations uh it's

210
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,920
really up to us as a Food Products

211
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,639
Company to be able to do that so that

212
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:49,240
gives us a lot of traction that a lot of

213
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,319
other companies in the medical marijuana

214
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,600
space just can't have and then the

215
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,920
second line of our business is sort of

216
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,079
uh the the IP or the intellectual

217
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:00,759
property side of the company and from

218
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:03,359
that point of view we really see

219
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:06,360
ourselves as the Intel inside for the

220
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:11,079
pot business and what that means is we

221
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:14,360
know that our technology works on cannab

222
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:16,958
cannaboid uh absorption we know that

223
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,919
it'll work very well for the molecule

224
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:22,319
THC we as a company don't focus on high

225
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,919
THC products but we have nothing against

226
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,079
them whatsoever and we are happy to

227
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:31,319
license our technology to all of those

228
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:34,078
companies in the space that do sell THC

229
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,920
products and again with our technology

230
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:39,599
the benefit to the consumer is that they

231
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:41,639
can consume far less in order to get the

232
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,800
effect that they're looking for which is

233
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,879
a a public good and it saves them money

234
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:48,958
as well so there's an intellectual Pro

235
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,480
uh property licensing component to our

236
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:54,479
company and as time goes by if we're

237
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,639
fortunate and if the lab tests in the

238
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,320
future um bear fruit which we think and

239
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,278
we hope it will um if those things

240
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,000
happen then we can also look

241
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:06,399
additionally down the road at the

242
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,480
potential for licensing Revenue in some

243
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,120
of those other molecules the things I

244
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,440
mentioned earlier like nicotine or

245
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:16,039
non-steroidal anti-inflammatories now

246
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:19,200
those markets in some cases are 300

247
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:21,319
times larger than the legal marijuana

248
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,000
market so we're talking about uh

249
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,000
completely different business models and

250
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,879
different competitors there's a lot of

251
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,519
things that would come into play there

252
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,159
but they're they're very significant

253
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:33,720
markets and we like to have a role to

254
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:37,559
play in them we do think that the

255
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:40,440
technology that we have invented is new

256
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:43,559
it's novel and it hasn't been discovered

257
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,519
by neither the pharmaceutical companies

258
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,039
nor the tobacco companies nor anyone

259
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,519
else in the past which could mean that

260
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:51,559
we do have something here that really is

261
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,480
a breakthrough one of the things we hope

262
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:55,078
is that people become more educated

263
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,959
about the way their body works and the

264
00:11:55,078 --> 00:12:01,239
way these these products are absorbed in

265
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:05,359
your body and and you realize in fact

266
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,519
that not only um not only it might not

267
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,278
be a good idea to buy a product that has

268
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,600
100 milligrams let's say of THC in it

269
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:14,720
that's a lot puts a lot of Demand on

270
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,639
your liver it puts a lot of Demand on

271
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,120
the rest of your body and with our

272
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:22,959
technology you may get just as much sort

273
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,039
of bang for the buck out of a 20

274
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,439
milligram product as somebody else who's

275
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,958
advertising 100 milligram now think of

276
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,720
the differences that that brings to the

277
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:34,198
consumer it means they can pay less

278
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,560
money because they need to purchase less

279
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:37,399
it means they're putting their body

280
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:40,599
through less stress as it tries to

281
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:42,320
absorb some of those higher amounts and

282
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,159
it's just a good thing for the industry

283
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,278
overall so we really embrace the idea of

284
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:50,159
using smaller amounts but using it very

285
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:52,399
effectively that's really what we're all

286
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,519
about so another thing that people

287
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,278
should be thinking about is what else is

288
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:00,440
in that edible that they're consuming so

289
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:03,078
for example is the product made with

290
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,399
butter or is it made with sunflower oil

291
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:08,159
or is it made with corn syrup or what

292
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,958
and the reason that I that I mention

293
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:13,159
this is that people really need to know

294
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:16,198
that the different ingredients that they

295
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:20,439
ingest as they're ingesting the THC or

296
00:13:16,198 --> 00:13:23,278
the CBD will affect not only how much of

297
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,639
the THC is going to be absorbed but if

298
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,919
it's a high cholesterol fat it's just

299
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:30,159
not good for you so it's really really

300
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,799
important to read the label just as

301
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,919
important as it is in the grocery store

302
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:35,599
when you do your weekly shopping it's

303
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:38,639
important to read the label and know

304
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,399
what's in there so lexaria energy with

305
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,399
all the food products we produce or ever

306
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:47,799
will produce we are talking about truly

307
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:51,480
healthy foods no artificial sweeteners

308
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:54,198
no high cholesterol fats no trans fats

309
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:57,440
that really matters to how well you

310
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:59,838
absorb the molecules and to your overall

311
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,839
health

312
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,839
