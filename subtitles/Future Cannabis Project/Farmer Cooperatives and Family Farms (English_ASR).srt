2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:20,448
the reality of of having this this

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:27,800
market that's already established and

4
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:30,810
trying to be regulated and finding

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:35,460
myself up against a wall this is I guess

6
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:41,359
what I'm what I'm getting is that on on

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:46,799
the one side I don't have you know the

8
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:54,229
the finances or the the business sense

9
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:56,849
that these large companies do and still

10
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:58,979
realizing I needed to go through with

11
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,129
this process and I needed to become

12
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:05,489
compliant and I needed to start going

13
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:11,789
down this this pathway several years ago

14
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:14,490
and seeing my friends and family and

15
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:19,500
community members that couldn't or

16
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:23,879
didn't want to do it kind of look at me

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:27,239
like I was crazy and and be so shocked

18
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:30,089
like that that I would do this process

19
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:34,408
and yet at the same time not fitting in

20
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:37,560
with the real players then the new

21
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,229
industry that comes in and says hey

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,899
we're gonna do a million square feet or

23
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:46,500
whatever and we have all the capital we

24
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,390
can lose money it's it's in our business

25
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:53,430
plan to lose money for three or five

26
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:59,670
years or whatever it takes and seeing

27
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:02,490
the like how how they don't understand

28
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,099
how a small operator would work or how

29
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:07,549
that could function and yet the small

30
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:10,500
operators in my life

31
00:02:07,549 --> 00:02:13,680
acting somehow like I'm the man or

32
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,680
something for

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,968
for trying to keep my family my two

34
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:24,109
young children safe and and getting

35
00:02:20,968 --> 00:02:27,239
caught kinda in this this paradigm where

36
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:30,450
need access to market but don't somebody

37
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:33,420
asked yesterday hear about my sales rap

38
00:02:30,449 --> 00:02:35,209
like you know what sales rep or sales

39
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:37,979
reps how do they work for your company

40
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:40,098
it's like I don't have a sales rep I

41
00:02:37,979 --> 00:02:43,590
don't just try and meet with

42
00:02:40,098 --> 00:02:46,798
dispensaries or distributors when I can

43
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:52,259
yeah to try and get something going but

44
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:54,359
I am the lead farmer I am tied to my

45
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:57,780
farm that's what we do all day every day

46
00:02:54,359 --> 00:03:00,180
and and the discussions we had yesterday

47
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,780
and yeah tied to your farming but it is

48
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,250
a family farm and I think that is what's

49
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,318
getting lost and we had the discussion a

50
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,870
little bit yesterday and really on but

51
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:13,530
have family farms like in all other

52
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,030
aspects of North America if you look

53
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,280
they've gone to commercial farms and

54
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,039
like this is an industry where there

55
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,519
still are a lot of true family farms and

56
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:26,789
it's how do we collectively get that

57
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:30,329
group together into market and I think

58
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:35,030
we're better together than individually

59
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:37,590
I think we talked a lot about different

60
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,598
sectors of the market and I think

61
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:45,120
there's a lot of operates there's a lot

62
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:48,899
of opportunity for all areas but the

63
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:52,590
area that you are in is this small batch

64
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,289
this craft properly dried properly cured

65
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:59,310
like product that right now isn't

66
00:03:55,289 --> 00:04:03,888
necessarily being rewarded from a price

67
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:06,889
point but I think we'll be and we at GCI

68
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:08,939
and partnering like we're throats were

69
00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:12,540
involved in both Canada and Switzerland

70
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:14,698
and are moving into California which we

71
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:16,798
think the Pacific Northwest from BC down

72
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:18,658
to California is the epicenter of

73
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,238
cannabis in the world and think the

74
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:23,879
triangle and thing this is the old world

75
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:25,259
to cannabis and that is a market that is

76
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:28,250
going to

77
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:31,829
as we move forward both globally and

78
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:33,810
rules and regulations coming down that

79
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:35,729
the world wants and is a treasure that

80
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:37,920
needs to be protected and the small

81
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,140
family farm such as yours and thrilled

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,140
to be partnered with Hezekiah and the

83
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:45,569
coop and bringing sort of marriage of

84
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:48,870
farmers capital and so that we can

85
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:52,139
compete and we can get these products

86
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:54,269
out to the world and allow more people

87
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:56,490
like yourself to come from the free

88
00:04:54,269 --> 00:05:00,089
market over to the regulated market and

89
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:02,939
have a pathway and have collectively

90
00:05:00,089 --> 00:05:06,060
have sales teams have market names so

91
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:09,389
things so we've got a team work so the

92
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,610
nature of this business by the laws and

93
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:14,389
the prohibition of input of force people

94
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:18,240
to be secretive and to be isolated and

95
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:20,899
working solo or with very few trusted

96
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,540
people one of the opportunities with

97
00:05:20,899 --> 00:05:26,339
sort of the regulation and coming out of

98
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,790
the closet so to speak is that we can

99
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:32,729
work together sure like the probability

100
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:34,710
of us meeting 15 years ago probably

101
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,480
pretty pretty low you know and it's

102
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,819
fastly that we're both sitting here and

103
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,350
there's opportunities to move forward

104
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:42,949
and work together and it's sort of

105
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:45,600
bringing the marriage of capital and

106
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:47,159
good values and to build a product and

107
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,040
what we want and I think what you guys

108
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,240
won is in 10 years to have an industry

109
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,730
that we're proud of or at least a good

110
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,840
portion of the industry that we're proud

111
00:05:53,730 --> 00:06:00,720
of and that carries on the values and

112
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,599
being able to provide for family provide

113
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,550
a good product be proud of what you're

114
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,080
putting into a jar what people are

115
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:12,210
smoking yeah and I think together we can

116
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:15,000
do that and it's not without difficulty

117
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:16,919
and I don't know I've found this whole

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,759
experience and Madeleine's has been

119
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:24,600
fantastic meeting great people and yeah

120
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:28,519
and the was the I think what we're

121
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:31,290
really looking for is people

122
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:36,539
distributors you know collective

123
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:38,790
bargaining groups that we trust to a

124
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,040
level that we can contain

125
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:45,210
you two just spend the majority of our

126
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,920
time farming yeah because it's the I can

127
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:48,959
kind of the elephant in the room or

128
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:53,640
whatever you want to say is that the

129
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:56,459
traditional market provided plenty of

130
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,610
shady shit goes on but if the if you had

131
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:02,180
the right people is that they did that

132
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:06,000
they allowed for these half-hour

133
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,970
transactions that took care of part of

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,149
the year yeah um and that allowed for

135
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:17,700
farming and what we're seeing is a

136
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:20,939
problem one problem with this new market

137
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:24,719
is five hour meeting about a five hour

138
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:28,110
meeting to talk about a net 30 that

139
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,930
turns into a net 60 that turns into a we

140
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:33,300
don't know it sat on the shelf and what

141
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,490
are you gonna do about it and I don't

142
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,230
know how intentional this is I'm not

143
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,319
gonna try and put it out there that it's

144
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:43,500
you know that they're trying to scam me

145
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:45,719
but I see with these these distributors

146
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,170
that some of them are just trying to

147
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:52,200
survive but the more established ones

148
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:54,300
know that I'm busy farming and sure I

149
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:59,219
have a business lawyer and I have a

150
00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:03,449
defense attorney but do I really have

151
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,460
the time or effort there are finances to

152
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:08,009
work with them at the level that I would

153
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:12,229
need to to to draft that leather

154
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:16,310
letterhead to you know to go to court I

155
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:21,480
don't so instead I let it slide I mean

156
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:23,870
yeah and I think what we want and I want

157
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,670
to work with people and look there's

158
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:28,590
good people on all sides of the aspects

159
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,569
and there's bankers and people that are

160
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:32,879
assholes and screw people over and I'm

161
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:34,168
just sort of there's farmers that do as

162
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:37,019
well hell you know what I don't like it

163
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:38,639
so it's not but it's finding that group

164
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,918
of people that have a shared and common

165
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,830
vision and common goal that you trust

166
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:45,480
and you shouldn't need contracts shaking

167
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,120
your hand and looking in the eyes is how

168
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,190
this business has taken place for 30 or

169
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,299
40 years it should be how it should be

170
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:52,380
able to continue you should be able to

171
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:56,039
trust your partners

172
00:08:52,379 --> 00:09:00,450
and that if something extraneous happens

173
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:03,230
on my end or your end when I come to you

174
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:07,470
realize that it wasn't intentional and

175
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:10,289
you believe believe that because there's

176
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,029
not this fear of their trying to take

177
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:15,779
advantage yeah we're all trying to do it

178
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:21,029
like yeah something like oh did was

179
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:22,110
there a mold issue for some reason that

180
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:24,480
no one could have thought of like a

181
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,629
crazy humidity event comes through

182
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:32,310
surely Menor you just trying to hide

183
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:34,230
product and that's not it's about trust

184
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:36,989
and its built-in and what with heads and

185
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,670
the coop is because it's the coops or

186
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,889
farmer owned and you're still like it's

187
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:42,479
not big business coming in and trying to

188
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:44,159
buy your farm and tell you how to do it

189
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,289
you still own your farm you have these B

190
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,449
but helping that path to market and

191
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:50,819
become that source that so you can farm

192
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,950
and create the best product and we do

193
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,050
the best job at getting that product

194
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:57,480
into jars and out to the market and

195
00:09:55,049 --> 00:10:00,269
capital back to you so you can continue

196
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:04,830
to do your and that I think what I've

197
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:06,720
seen is people have different portions

198
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:08,879
of that business and everyone thinks

199
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,139
their portion is more important and

200
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,500
should take more money and are trying to

201
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:16,470
squeeze the other and everyone needs to

202
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,389
have a fair and living portion of that

203
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,759
pie and that's how we can grow it all

204
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:24,059
and let's grow the pie instead of trying

205
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:29,789
to take pieces of a smaller pie from

206
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:32,759
each other sure that's you know that I'm

207
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:38,189
kind of the belief that I I don't think

208
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:42,059
that mine is is my piece is the most

209
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:47,130
important it's you know that it's better

210
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:50,089
than someone else but the reality is

211
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:54,179
that I I do have this certain capital

212
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:56,940
investment because I'm also on the front

213
00:10:54,179 --> 00:11:00,799
end or whatever on the first verse to in

214
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:03,630
in line for the creation of the product

215
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,990
that it is a hard pill to swallow when I

216
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:09,019
do basic math and I'm getting just great

217
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:11,389
down on numbers that I have to like kind

218
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:14,049
of calculate quickly in my head they're

219
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:18,039
like the the jar price the eighth price

220
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:21,279
and in these meetings and unlikeliness

221
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:26,629
try to get out a calculator and stuff

222
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:29,120
and it's like okay that's not a hundred

223
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:31,730
percent my world the the business

224
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,100
certainly isn't the business aspects of

225
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:38,420
this but I can I can do some basic math

226
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:40,879
and I can say don't don't

227
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:45,699
basically call me stupid when you sit

228
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:50,059
here and I'm I'm kind of asking for

229
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:53,960
whatever like a fifteen twenty percent

230
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:55,309
I'm hoping to get and meanwhile they're

231
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,650
saying they're only putting a hundred

232
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:59,689
percent markup on it and the math just

233
00:11:57,649 --> 00:12:03,470
doesn't line up when I can see the

234
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:06,710
product on the shelf and say I know how

235
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:08,360
much all these taxes are yep so I I know

236
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,610
that that's not the only thing that's

237
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,639
causing this product to be so exorbitant

238
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:17,450
ly expensive that the majority of

239
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:20,049
consumers just don't feel that they can

240
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:23,900
afford it or they truly can't yeah

241
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:28,219
absolutely and I think what is lacking

242
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:30,470
in a lot of the industry and through the

243
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:34,070
coop and the model and doing this is

244
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:38,120
transparency and that's what we won and

245
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:40,850
I think it's a lot easier to understand

246
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:44,000
when everyone can see every aspect and

247
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:47,540
there's transparency to it of what the

248
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,679
markups are and there's a lot of people

249
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:51,949
with industry they're trying to hide

250
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:54,889
those pieces so they can take a bigger

251
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:58,790
group and it's it's about building trust

252
00:12:54,889 --> 00:13:00,710
and building and hopefully this event in

253
00:12:58,789 --> 00:13:02,419
meeting you yesterday and continue the

254
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,160
conversation over by the coffee earlier

255
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:06,169
on and that's led to us sitting here

256
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:14,559
with a microphone which is more awkward

257
00:13:06,169 --> 00:13:17,209
but it is a continued development and

258
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:20,000
hope we have more discussions with

259
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:24,800
hezekiah and get you involved in

260
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:28,700
because I think we can succeed as a

261
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:32,029
group and market this region this plant

262
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:35,450
in a way that the there is consumers

263
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:38,269
that want this and it's just a matter of

264
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:40,340
being able to have a unified voice to

265
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:42,889
get there and a quality product and it

266
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:45,259
takes great people and visionaries and

267
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:46,970
you've taken the path from the free

268
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:49,759
market to the regulated market which is

269
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:52,009
a difficult one and we want to be there

270
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,990
to help make sure that that was the

271
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:56,689
right decision

272
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:58,820
yeah yes no and that that's not that's

273
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:00,920
the beauty of the code the coop model

274
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:04,250
and that's why you know I look forward

275
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:07,069
to I see it as a as a necessity for me

276
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:12,740
because it bridges this gap between

277
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:14,660
being the lone voice trying to make

278
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:19,129
enough of a wave or whatever you want to

279
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:23,449
say that that like that my product does

280
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:26,240
sell in sells in in a timely manner and

281
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:29,120
it actually works but at the same time

282
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,549
not having to go it alone yeah that they

283
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,110
and and and scale up because the other

284
00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:35,689
option is to scale up to such a

285
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:39,470
magnitude that I don't don't need a

286
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,790
co-op that I just I have these um what

287
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,399
are the marketing agents or whatever

288
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:47,779
terms some of these distress throw

289
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:50,419
around and that the coops seems to be

290
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:54,588
that that beautiful middle ground of

291
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:56,389
having the voice but all but having the

292
00:14:54,589 --> 00:15:00,380
voice without having to buy the voice

293
00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:02,720
absolutely and everyone having multiple

294
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:05,200
skill sets and pieces if you do it I'll

295
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,570
grow it up and you're all yourself and

296
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,250
fully believe you could do that but

297
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,140
you're not the strongest at all the

298
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,549
aspects and what happens when you have

299
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:16,179
to do everything and you have these

300
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:18,469
different things you don't do anything

301
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:20,179
you do everything average instead of

302
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:22,460
doing what you're really good at well

303
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:24,409
and the great piece is if you get a

304
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,810
whole bunch of group of people that are

305
00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:30,708
all good at pieces we can excel at all

306
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:32,958
of them and propel the entire group and

307
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,709
then that's that's the beautiful thing

308
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:38,569
right there

309
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:42,470
is is that if we could come come to

310
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:47,360
market strong in in that that collective

311
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:50,980
voice of of saying this this is this

312
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,720
beautiful marriage of a quality product

313
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:56,860
created in a sustainable fashion yeah

314
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:01,399
because I think ultimately when there is

315
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:03,649
some more some higher level of consumer

316
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,569
education that that is ultimately what

317
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:08,199
they want is a marriage of those two

318
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:11,240
things absolutely and I think

319
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,460
collectively if you have started with

320
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,970
ten farmers and a hundred farmers and

321
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:19,460
three hundred farmers and now it's

322
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:21,500
100,000 square feet of collective grow

323
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:25,370
to a million to 3 million all of a

324
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:28,399
sudden and all unified telling that

325
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:31,159
story and that education it's more

326
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,159
powerful and it's easier to get that

327
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:37,459
message out about what the product it is

328
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:40,579
than 300 people individually doing their

329
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:44,660
things and not unified doing it and it's

330
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:46,700
just look median like it's it's crazy

331
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:49,339
it's easy to get messages out but it's

332
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:52,340
also difficult like everyone's got an

333
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:55,280
Instagram but who follows what and it's

334
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:59,960
all over like media is so fragmented so

335
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:01,669
getting a voice and trying to educate is

336
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,279
much easier if we've got a whole group

337
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:07,519
doing it and it is I believe

338
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:09,500
fundamentally it's what people want they

339
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,569
just don't necessarily know how to get

340
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,519
that there's not a path in the regulated

341
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:16,700
market to get that reliably and

342
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:20,029
consistently and I think this marriage

343
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:21,410
and partnership between farmers keeping

344
00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:23,750
community and I think one of the things

345
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:26,779
that was most important yesterday was

346
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:30,079
the collective model is a way to keep

347
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:33,049
families on their farm and family it's

348
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:35,750
not as you mentioned it's not just a

349
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:37,869
farm and it's not just family that

350
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:41,119
they're together and it's a combined

351
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:43,299
entity and this is the backbone of what

352
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,739
North America has been built on and

353
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:47,740
doing this and it's critical to keep

354
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,410
that part of

355
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:52,809
this alive because that's why people are

356
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:55,210
doing this like I know you absolutely

357
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:56,769
love the plant but you're doing this to

358
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,650
provide for your family and to make

359
00:17:56,769 --> 00:18:03,579
their life better and to be able to do

360
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:04,509
that together with the thing you love is

361
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:06,369
fantastic

362
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:10,900
yeah well for me they're inextricably

363
00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:12,489
linked so I I can't I can't just say one

364
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:17,290
or the other and this is kind of the the

365
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:19,450
quandary that I'm in where historically

366
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:23,109
we don't want to rock the boat yeah yeah

367
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:25,660
I know Hezekiah Izzie we had a talk last

368
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:28,929
night after that about this very thing

369
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,310
where it's the one part for me it's more

370
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:32,110
than that but he was kind of saying it's

371
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:37,029
the biggest one for him we're all a

372
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:40,000
sudden it's a big it's just a time to

373
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:43,359
shut up but we're like okay think of the

374
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:47,380
children we don't we don't want to push

375
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:49,089
that boundary yeah and I've been in that

376
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,220
same place whereas I all right we

377
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:56,500
already have enough things that we're

378
00:18:51,220 --> 00:19:00,400
trying to try to push through it's it's

379
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:02,789
the one it's so taboo that if they they

380
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,110
want these certain regulations in place

381
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:07,180
you can't have kids anywhere near it

382
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:09,579
well we'll just do that yeah

383
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:13,870
but then at a certain point after enough

384
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:19,119
time energy and as a small farm of money

385
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:21,099
I've spent so much money to them why

386
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:25,029
can't I have some kind of a voice saying

387
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:27,309
it's just a plant no my children are not

388
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:30,129
going to be consuming the plant but

389
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:33,369
being near it is not going to hurt them

390
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:36,520
so why can't we have a little bit of

391
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:41,049
dialogue and education about the fact

392
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:44,440
that they don't need to be you know a

393
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:47,409
way from it to the point where I lower

394
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,600
my quality of life in terms of being a

395
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:52,779
family man yeah we're being you know a

396
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,909
person that that's with my family and

397
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:59,129
that my wife could have a little bit

398
00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:01,550
more free time or time to work on her

399
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:05,240
parts of the project that

400
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:09,680
that the kids could be a little bit

401
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:14,690
closer to that that's absolutely and it

402
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:17,500
I think it's something once again as a

403
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:22,820
group and that's something at GCI

404
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:24,680
and working with emerald grown that we'd

405
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:28,879
like to take up and lead and we're

406
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:30,529
separated enough from not having a farm

407
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,860
that is being the voice and pushing it

408
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:36,649
it's not creating risk on our side right

409
00:20:33,859 --> 00:20:38,629
because by not physically having the fan

410
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:41,180
like so can sort of create an insulation

411
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:43,100
a little bit to push this to try to get

412
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,710
these through it with the support of the

413
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:46,939
farmers but get this through and I think

414
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:50,000
that was one of the things that came out

415
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:56,480
of the sort of roundtable last night

416
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:58,309
that is critical and it's the passing on

417
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,579
of the family farm generationally and

418
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:05,329
learning is part of the process and if

419
00:21:01,579 --> 00:21:07,069
this is a crop that doesn't allow that

420
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:12,049
then you end up with a disconnect at

421
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:13,339
some point because maybe not all your

422
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:15,409
children are gonna want to continue but

423
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:17,899
maybe one does and that's how the family

424
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,970
farm continues and it's through that

425
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,920
education process and if through

426
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:25,450
regulations which don't really make

427
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:28,700
sense because as we know the plants

428
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:30,170
their plants you can't magically get

429
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:35,360
high from being too close to the plant

430
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:37,310
you know the light it's so I I think

431
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,979
it's something that it's very and if

432
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:41,659
it's a one of the byproducts of pushing

433
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:45,470
this forward it'd be fantastic because

434
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:49,070
it's critical to the whole piece of

435
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:52,009
having this high quality product because

436
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:54,439
without family on a commercial scale you

437
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:57,920
just can't get the care and the end

438
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,600
product on a scale and I'm not gonna say

439
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:01,009
it's never gonna happen in a million

440
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,639
square feet and maybe they'll create

441
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:06,019
technology to do it I'm very skeptical

442
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,280
on that front and I think the consumer

443
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:10,389
is gonna want something different and

444
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:12,819
they want the old-world cannabis and

445
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:15,190
and talked about this Bordeaux burgundy

446
00:22:12,819 --> 00:22:19,200
champagne region of cannabis and the

447
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:23,470
Pacific Northwest is that and this is

448
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:26,380
you've been a steward of that for many

449
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:30,250
years and the whole at Northern

450
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,990
California have been and it's a duty to

451
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:34,660
carry that forward and to continue that

452
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:38,890
and we're excited to be part of this

453
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:42,540
journey with you guys I am excited for

454
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,540
the for the future of being able to

455
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:47,529
continue to form at this point we were

456
00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:51,750
kinda interested in survival mode yep

457
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:55,029
that I I care so much about producing

458
00:22:51,750 --> 00:23:00,549
the product and all that goes with it

459
00:22:55,029 --> 00:23:03,430
and for me the the family farm aspect of

460
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:05,529
it is so important because it's I got

461
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:08,590
neither or that happens real quick when

462
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:11,680
you take away the family either my

463
00:23:08,589 --> 00:23:13,449
family life suffers because they are

464
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:18,549
farther away and I don't see them as

465
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:20,200
often or my my work suffers because I am

466
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:23,049
with them and I'm trying to commute in

467
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,910
to take care of it when I can eventually

468
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:25,539
and when we're able to bring that

469
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:30,340
together

470
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:33,789
I see how both my family life and my

471
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:35,259
work life go up enter at this this yes

472
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:38,379
higher place and I think the most

473
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:41,230
important thing is keeping that together

474
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:44,830
but second is this sort of marriage

475
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:48,160
between the coop finance farmers and all

476
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:49,899
of these pieces is the immediate goal is

477
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,550
obviously we won't have a great product

478
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:55,210
and we get it to market in a regulated

479
00:23:51,549 --> 00:24:00,250
fashion but we need to move it quickly

480
00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:04,180
that you're beyond just surviving like

481
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:07,779
it needs to hit a point where it's a

482
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:10,049
fair and equitable occupation doing it

483
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:13,119
and getting that piece and getting it so

484
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:15,240
that more people want to come from the

485
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:18,729
free market to the regulated market

486
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:21,730
because there is a path to better

487
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:23,360
quality of life better family less risk

488
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:26,089
all of those elements and

489
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:28,159
there's a path to the passion they've

490
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:30,919
had for their plants and things to get

491
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,140
to the market and it was shared and that

492
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:36,679
I see one of the biggest takeaways from

493
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:43,880
me this weekend is we need to help get

494
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:46,009
from survival to comfort happiness and

495
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:49,730
comfort and and obviously we want to

496
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:51,798
grow to like great success but we need

497
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:55,039
that first step over like it's got to be

498
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:57,679
and taking away that that option of an

499
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:00,109
either/or because there's a lot of

500
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,640
people that are sitting on that razor's

501
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:04,548
edge right now going back to the free

502
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:06,490
market because they can't do it right

503
00:25:04,548 --> 00:25:08,450
and that's what we've got a chain like

504
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:10,039
these pioneers and these people that

505
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:13,220
have taken that first step we need to

506
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:15,710
support them and help so they can

507
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:19,000
continue this path yeah and so that it's

508
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:22,400
an easy decision not a either/or

509
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,650
decision and I think an extension of the

510
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,110
the whole family discussions you know

511
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:29,360
family something you know talking about

512
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:32,329
how close the children can be to the

513
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:34,939
grow or things like that but I think

514
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:39,470
there's a bigger issue here also when we

515
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:43,970
talk about family farm is that in the

516
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:48,079
corporate model they they can follow

517
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:51,200
these certain rules if though all the

518
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:53,779
water for the facility needs to come

519
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,269
from this certain area of well

520
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:58,730
specifically that's not hydrologically

521
00:25:56,269 --> 00:26:01,400
connected to something else fine they

522
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:05,900
can do that and then they they go home

523
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:08,120
to their house wherever that is and they

524
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:11,298
live their normal life well on a family

525
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:14,119
farm it's not really like that and so as

526
00:26:11,298 --> 00:26:17,269
an example I got a million gallon pond

527
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:19,039
in two Springs that provide all the

528
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:22,548
water that I could ever need

529
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:26,240
yep well we had to punch 160 foot well

530
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:27,980
well I we had water at 35 40 feet pay by

531
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,549
the foot you can do the math it's not

532
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:33,019
necessary but it's not hydrologically

533
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:36,230
connected

534
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:39,650
so I move out of this area of being as

535
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:41,960
heavily regulated okay and so that works

536
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:43,490
that's what they want for for cannabis

537
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,250
cultivation fine

538
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:48,289
they do they still want it metered and

539
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,660
I'll roll with that

540
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:52,759
well that wasn't good enough then they

541
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:54,890
started saying well what about for your

542
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:57,859
domestic use why can't you just use this

543
00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:00,890
water for your domestic use and I I

544
00:26:57,859 --> 00:27:04,429
think it's a poignant example of where

545
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:08,930
this regulations starting to really

546
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:12,730
creep in to the to our our everyday

547
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:15,950
living to earn oh my family already has

548
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:18,170
clean safe delicious drinking water yeah

549
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:21,289
and we're not using a lot of it we have

550
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:25,340
deeded access in a normal world that

551
00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:27,920
would just be accepted but because of

552
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:32,199
the nature of this plant and it's

553
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:38,230
extreme regulation this point it allows

554
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:41,840
for this just this hyper regulation

555
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:43,460
where they start controlling aspects

556
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:48,220
that to me seem like they have nothing

557
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:52,370
to do with the actual plant itself and

558
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:54,170
yeah and I think and I think a lot of

559
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:56,659
the regulation takes place in vacuums

560
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:58,610
and don't understand the family farm

561
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,200
which is also part of the whole

562
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:04,639
education and getting the story out

563
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:06,200
right and showing the positive stories

564
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,040
around this not just the negative

565
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,289
stories because people see the news and

566
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:14,659
the free market black market whatever

567
00:28:12,289 --> 00:28:17,180
want to call and people that are doing

568
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:20,120
the bus or what they're doing and a lot

569
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:22,190
of times some of that is involved with

570
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:25,039
other drugs like there's there's a

571
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:28,160
perception that is portrayed and what we

572
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:30,829
need to do is start changing that story

573
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:36,620
and tell the good stories and the pieces

574
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:39,439
so that it's seen as a for what it is as

575
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:41,899
a crop yeah I mean that's that's a big

576
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:44,120
that's a big distinction that I make and

577
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:46,470
you know these broad sweeping statements

578
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:52,408
but here's one is the

579
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:55,589
like a simple it's a to two parts split

580
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:58,860
in terms of free market traditional

581
00:28:55,589 --> 00:29:01,408
market cultivators and then distributors

582
00:28:58,859 --> 00:29:05,569
wouldn't you know people in in the

583
00:29:01,409 --> 00:29:08,759
business is people where it's

584
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:10,408
potentially the only Cromley real cry

585
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:12,179
maybe jaywalking and speeding or

586
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:15,659
something but it's the only crime they

587
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:18,019
commit and otherwise are normal whatever

588
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:20,820
whatever that means yes like yeah that

589
00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:23,548
everything else about them when you meet

590
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:26,638
them you buddy oh my god you could be

591
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:28,558
you know you're a normal person and then

592
00:29:26,638 --> 00:29:31,439
the other side which is straight-up

593
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:35,369
criminal element yeah where they have

594
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:38,070
used money from human trafficking and

595
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:40,619
hard drug sales to finance these

596
00:29:38,069 --> 00:29:46,019
large-scale illicit cannabis production

597
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:48,449
and distribution operations and that we

598
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:48,960
can make a distinction to the general

599
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:51,750
public

600
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:54,870
yeah and and say hey I know that these

601
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:58,079
people they haven't done everything

602
00:29:54,869 --> 00:30:00,119
perfectly they've had to do what they

603
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:04,158
felt was necessary or what made their

604
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:07,168
business work but they're not bad people

605
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,960
absolutely and that's there is a real

606
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:12,570
distinction there and I think in

607
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:16,850
fairness like Canadian regulators

608
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:16,849
American regulators and the law makers

609
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:22,500
the unintended consequences of trying to

610
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:26,519
they want to remove the criminal element

611
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:29,308
from it but it's captured the pioneers

612
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:31,470
as well and the people that we're doing

613
00:30:29,308 --> 00:30:34,470
it and pushing plant based medicine and

614
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:36,389
that have gotten us here yeah to that

615
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:38,399
like that have carried the mantle and

616
00:30:36,388 --> 00:30:43,250
risk their Liberty their freedom in

617
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:46,138
order to do this and though that group

618
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:47,460
yourselves and these farmers people sort

619
00:30:46,138 --> 00:30:50,369
of the ones that should be celebrated

620
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,899
and they shouldn't be caught up with the

621
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:54,538
regulations they're trying to elimate

622
00:30:51,898 --> 00:30:55,949
eliminate the criminal element and I am

623
00:30:54,538 --> 00:30:58,079
all for the criminal element

624
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:59,690
unfortunately not an end intended

625
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:01,399
consequences

626
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:04,000
the criminal element being removed I'm

627
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:07,910
very in favor of that but the unintended

628
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:11,230
consequences is unfortunately generally

629
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:15,290
it's organized crime they have lawyers

630
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:16,819
moving money doing things these simple

631
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:19,970
rules that they put in place and become

632
00:31:16,819 --> 00:31:21,859
onerous for the guy that this is the

633
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:24,350
only thing that they've done wrong and

634
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:25,669
having jaywalk they don't have the

635
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,959
ability to get around it so it doesn't

636
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:28,850
these rules don't actually catch the

637
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,720
criminal element unfortunately and

638
00:31:28,849 --> 00:31:32,809
that's sort of the unintended

639
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:34,279
consequence and they exceedingly punish

640
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:36,079
the people that are just trying to get

641
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:38,059
their to go the right way and that's

642
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:40,099
where I think telling the stories and

643
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:41,929
having the public realize that there is

644
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:44,500
a difference and these are family farms

645
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:48,880
like these are farmers this is not a

646
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:54,049
criminal enterprise yeah yeah and the

647
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:59,960
guy got three broad categories that I

648
00:31:54,049 --> 00:32:04,659
put this into and Aldus you know the one

649
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:08,630
is is the business aspect of it and new

650
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:14,120
or newer people coming into this kind of

651
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:17,660
a lot of what we see here yeah is there

652
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:19,369
better at it oh shit yeah I've made my

653
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:21,380
business work but I have no business

654
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:28,099
background I you know I don't have an MD

655
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:31,690
MBA MBA or really care but that that's

656
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:35,809
great for them okay and they have this

657
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:38,240
this skill set and I I think there's

658
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:41,720
there's pieces of that for me to learn

659
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,480
on how to run a business that that works

660
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:46,730
to where I have good forecasting

661
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,880
abilities and good bookkeeping skills

662
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:53,539
and all that and so of course they they

663
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,730
have that in a way that we as farmers

664
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:59,180
for the most part don't and this set the

665
00:32:55,730 --> 00:33:01,730
second one being the the science of it

666
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:03,740
and I feel like the big business they

667
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,140
can get that they may not personally

668
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:09,230
know how to grow the best product but

669
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:11,330
they can get enough people on the team

670
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:13,610
that know it that they can make that

671
00:33:11,329 --> 00:33:16,309
work but it's

672
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:18,469
the history and the culture of it that

673
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:20,539
they seen it's kind of alludes them and

674
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:23,089
they don't see the importance of it and

675
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:25,069
that's that's the big one that we really

676
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:27,589
hope that we can kind of and that's the

677
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:31,909
most important part to me

678
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:38,049
and that's what can't get lost and if it

679
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:40,900
does get lost I don't see a future where

680
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:44,480
Northern Californian or British Columbia

681
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:47,240
Oregon the stewards of this plant for

682
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,910
the last 50 years can survive without

683
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:53,299
that culture because that is it's a

684
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:56,360
culture of the history the legacy and

685
00:33:53,299 --> 00:34:00,529
it's the being able to grow this product

686
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:02,959
in a craft and a way that's critical to

687
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:06,049
the survival of this area and it's gonna

688
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,819
be a segment of the marketplace that

689
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:10,579
does it it's not the entire marketplace

690
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:12,380
and I think we talked earlier there's

691
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:13,909
lots of elements of this marketplace

692
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:16,460
there's new consumers that are gonna

693
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:18,079
come on women men that want a

694
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,730
replacement for alcohol and they want it

695
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,049
through a beverage or an edible and that

696
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,599
and that's where the science is going to

697
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:26,390
come in and onset times and offset times

698
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:30,619
but make a full spectrum like the plant

699
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:32,690
the time back to old-school old-growth

700
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:35,239
wines and the Cabernets and the

701
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:37,460
uniquenesses that come from the

702
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:40,669
different microclimates and that to

703
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:43,159
farms by the crow flies of quarter mile

704
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:44,960
can have totally different environments

705
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,549
and different products and there's going

706
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,039
to be there is a consumer that wants

707
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:51,680
that now and there always will be and we

708
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:54,380
need to make sure that we provide an

709
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,049
economic framework that it's sustainable

710
00:34:54,380 --> 00:35:00,680
for the farmers to be able to grow that

711
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:02,330
and that we don't lose that and that

712
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:04,819
comes back to the family farm and

713
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:06,469
working together and I'm really excited

714
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,240
about this journey and it's been

715
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:09,859
fantastic meeting here this weekend and

716
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:13,089
look forward to many more conversations

717
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,090
for sure
