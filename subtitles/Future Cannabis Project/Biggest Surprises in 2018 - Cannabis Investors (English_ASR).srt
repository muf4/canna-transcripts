1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,440
it's great to be here in the future

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,450
cannabis project talking about 2018

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,349
reactions and assessments I have to tell

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:12,809
you in 2018 I need to I need to answer

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,210
this with with two things that caught me

6
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:16,589
by surprise the the rapid pace have

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,830
changed in terms of perception of

8
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:21,839
cannabis in this country medical you

9
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:24,750
know full wreck you name it

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:26,879
little old ladies bi and CBD online from

11
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,589
Amazon it's extraordinary the pace of

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,149
change to me even though I thought it

13
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:32,219
was going to be extraordinary has been

14
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:33,390
beyond extraordinary from the investment

15
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,920
community's perspective I'm not

16
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,630
surprised at the sophistication of the

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,980
players and and the folks at this table

18
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:41,010
that have you know done this and other

19
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:43,738
in other venues and are doing it here

20
00:00:41,009 --> 00:00:45,808
and big institutional investors I'm

21
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:47,878
surprised at how quickly the the

22
00:00:45,808 --> 00:00:49,378
investment community is sorting through

23
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:51,599
different types of businesses and

24
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:54,329
different verticals within the cannabis

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,198
investment sub sectors and making quick

26
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:57,030
decisions right now

27
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,769
on who's gonna win and who's gonna lose

28
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,689
and frankly it's pretty interesting to

29
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,350
see how quickly we've gone from people

30
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:05,789
who were it seems to me and maybe I'm

31
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,118
speaking my own book but you know

32
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:12,030
assessing where the first mover

33
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,310
advantage was something that seemed to

34
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,950
be universally rewarded and I think

35
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,750
people are now fortunately looking at

36
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,460
companies that are really executing in a

37
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,109
clever way not just because they were

38
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:23,789
there first from from an international

39
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:26,938
standpoint it's hard to be surprised

40
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,189
than much you know the Jeff session one

41
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:30,779
really got me when you know he came out

42
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:32,758
there's a stark difference between adult

43
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,368
use like medical cannabis I probably

44
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,109
lost at that point maybe 40 50 million

45
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:39,629
dollars of investor confidence in a day

46
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:41,159
and I'm like are you actually that

47
00:01:39,629 --> 00:01:42,449
concerned about these things like we

48
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,490
know medically we have these protections

49
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,990
like with omnibus and so forth we know

50
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:47,548
adult use is totally illegal

51
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:49,798
we know the ancillary sides completely

52
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,479
fine it's real estate its packaging but

53
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,180
I was surprised that so many serious

54
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,649
investors are so distracted by some of

55
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,570
these little political things that have

56
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:58,920
been known forever and that that was

57
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:00,359
really surprising I thought the seasoned

58
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,250
rural investors would know the rules

59
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,810
understand what's happening that's where

60
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,129
I learned a lot of investors don't so

61
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,530
when they ask those questions now I'm

62
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:09,348
like you're not even serious like we'll

63
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,969
talk to you bout our next funded like

64
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:13,530
we'll talk to you later on the

65
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:15,689
international side seeing

66
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,430
what we did in denmark in portugal what

67
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:19,620
happened in macedonia the preliminaries

68
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,569
to greece we're probably the largest

69
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,730
like licensing group internationally i

70
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,149
would say on a private side but i saw

71
00:02:23,729 --> 00:02:28,769
maybe 25 countries pop up that we're

72
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:30,090
totally anti cannabis but when they see

73
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,340
the revenue when they see the other

74
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:34,620
pieces the kids with epilepsy the cancer

75
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,530
all the additional pieces where it

76
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,330
finally clicked for them and my company

77
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,650
our consulting company just went off the

78
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:42,510
hook on international to where

79
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,920
international needs to be 30 percent of

80
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:46,199
our book now it's maybe 80 percent of

81
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,000
our book and then seeing where the u.s.

82
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:49,289
is the largest consumer market but

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,819
there's this whole thing called the rest

84
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:54,209
of the world and like that all needs

85
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:56,099
medicine ham protein sources so seeing

86
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,539
so many countries come online so fast it

87
00:02:56,099 --> 00:02:59,340
was just realizing this is gonna come

88
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:01,139
faster than we thought it's always fast

89
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,569
but it's getting exponentially faster by

90
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:05,639
the day and really the most important

91
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:07,679
skill set being male to sift through

92
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,869
what's real what's not true due

93
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,730
diligence like in a country that has

94
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,200
four licenses that we have one and here

95
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:15,299
twelve groups say they have a license

96
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,919
there there's a lot of talk about what

97
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,959
people intend to do versus what they're

98
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,869
actually doing and how they're doing

99
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,189
that or what they did correctly there so

100
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,870
it's gonna get faster if that was what i

101
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:27,629
realized quickly and I needed more

102
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,009
translators and more Deloitte access

103
00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:36,090
than I would ever think i profits they

104
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:39,659
previously needed I think the bigger III

105
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:42,359
I agree with Nick the surprise has been

106
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:44,729
how fast how many states how many

107
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:47,010
countries how many people are looking at

108
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:50,669
this surprised that the Trump

109
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:52,919
administration let it go and let it

110
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:58,699
continue I think the biggest surprise I

111
00:03:52,919 --> 00:04:02,518
had this year was the CBD him becoming a

112
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:05,699
separate industry crossing into all 50

113
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,980
states being to export health and

114
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:10,828
wellness products made in the USA to

115
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:13,500
people in Indonesia and the Far East and

116
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:15,480
in Dubai it's created new markets new

117
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,399
revenue and I think it will help

118
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:21,980
legitimize the benefits of cannabis

119
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,459
by the CBD getting out there and helping

120
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,460
so many people

121
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,509
