1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,379
many of these guys have already heard my

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:06,000
rant about the use of an Oxford comma in

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:07,859
the regulations which is in the

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,718
regulations it says cannabis

5
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,830
concentrates you know suppositories

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:16,160
capsules whatever vape cartridges comma

7
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:18,899
inhalable products a parenthetical

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,039
shattered a blacks and when they put it

9
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:22,140
in that second part in the regs they

10
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,850
didn't put three cartridges comma

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,890
inhalable products shattered a blacks

12
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,250
they just put inhalable products

13
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:31,589
shattered a blacks and so the argument

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,630
happening now is that might be what you

15
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,789
mean but Department of Public Health

16
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,550
that is not what you said and we're

17
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:40,140
trying so hard to read and understand in

18
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:43,530
the English language in the use of

19
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,259
commas and all of these things I guess

20
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,539
so Julie's get the comma woman and I

21
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:51,979
love it because I use that argument in

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,808
our letter and then my argument is that

23
00:00:51,979 --> 00:01:00,030
there is a difference between a product

24
00:00:54,808 --> 00:01:02,849
and a container of that product I cannot

25
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,150
use the oil that is in the pen without

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:10,469
the vape cart I cannot and the BCC tells

27
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:13,439
me I cannot bulk oil test the oil before

28
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:17,938
it goes in to the vape cart I must test

29
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:21,419
what the final form of the product so

30
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:23,938
unless the product is bulk oil and then

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,189
the container is the vape pen cart which

32
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:29,250
is not at all the way that it is set up

33
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:32,188
in the regulations then there is no way

34
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:35,640
that that vape pen cart is deemed to be

35
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:37,559
a container and if I'm gonna get out my

36
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,960
crystal ball I'm just gonna tell you

37
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,490
guys yeah that's where it's going yes

38
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:43,469
we're gonna have to put universal

39
00:01:41,489 --> 00:01:44,938
symbols on cartridges I have no doubt

40
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:47,099
they're gonna bring back the little

41
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,929
stamp maker is gonna lobby to put the

42
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:51,118
stamps back on the edibles so you know

43
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,920
the difference between a cannabis

44
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,629
chocolate and another chocolate we're

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,030
gonna go all the way down the rabbit

46
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:59,009
hole because especially since if people

47
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,960
in Laguna Beach are getting Cu pees to

48
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,118
open a CBD store and they're gonna sell

49
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:04,709
vapes guess what your law enforcement is

50
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:08,340
gonna want to know on visual perception

51
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:10,729
is that a CBD vapor is that a THC vape

52
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,710
because now we're starting to fork into

53
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:16,629
CBD good ta

54
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,629
she bad this is what's happening
