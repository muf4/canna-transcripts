1
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:22,118
they're also doing that with SPECT

2
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:24,460
stands another fancy scan so they're

3
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:29,198
just so you get this they're watching

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:31,269
cannabinoids change the brain physically

5
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,399
change the brain not and then they're

6
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:35,649
measuring that - enough seeing the

7
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,119
effect when they there's been studies

8
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:39,850
done out of the United States that have

9
00:00:37,119 --> 00:00:41,349
shown that special disorder kids do

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:43,300
really detest Ananda mite or

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,948
endocannabinoids deficiencies it's

12
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:47,099
really difficult so a lot of them are

13
00:00:44,948 --> 00:00:50,049
doing you know the cerebral spinal fluid

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,520
spinal taps on kids for studies it's not

15
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:54,339
something we allow in the United States

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,910
rightfully so but what they did do is

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:00,670
they did a test a blood tests on

18
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:03,339
spectrum kids with high levels of autism

19
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,960
spectrum this autism spectrum right and

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:09,100
they found that their white blood cells

21
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:11,169
had two to three times the amount of cb2

22
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:13,569
receptors saying people not on the

23
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,679
spectrum and here I said well that's

24
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:16,148
what the body does it's always

25
00:01:14,679 --> 00:01:18,840
fluctuating because it's trying to find

26
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:21,159
homeostasis so because what there's

27
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,810
theorizing is they're deficient in these

28
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,939
cannabinoids so the body is producing

29
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:27,310
more receptors to try to absorb what is

30
00:01:24,939 --> 00:01:30,039
in the biotics there's already clinical

31
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,959
research showing that you know endo

32
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:34,450
family deficiency disorders which is the

33
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:35,649
what a lot of these mystery conditions

34
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,719
that we've lived with their whole life

35
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:40,000
we're likely going to fall under in my

36
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:42,340
opinion we've had this our whole life is

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,019
clinically diagnosed conditions where

38
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:47,009
you have there's no test for them right

39
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:49,689
you have to prove it like migraine right

40
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,950
fibromyalgia all these sort of things or

41
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:52,450
you know you have to prove sit and

42
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,649
suffer and prove to your doctor that you

43
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,539
have it because they don't really know

44
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:57,039
what to look for to prove that you have

45
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:58,840
it well in the disturber the

46
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,459
endocannabinoids system we're likely

47
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,829
again those days are going to be over

48
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:05,020
relatively soon as soon as we develop

49
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:07,030
the ability to test more efficiently for

50
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:08,799
endogenous cannabinoids right now you

51
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,620
can't really do it at a at your local

52
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,469
blood draw place because of how quickly

53
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:17,560
they dissipate right but those days are

54
00:02:14,469 --> 00:02:19,449
coming and the ability to test for that

55
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,098
it's really going to start to show why

56
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:22,799
also coincidentally

57
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:26,500
those conditions or ones people always

58
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,409
gravitated towards cannabis for a mass

59
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,938
however my

60
00:02:27,408 --> 00:02:34,310
had a PFC DTSC except that so I know

61
00:02:31,938 --> 00:02:36,229
we're getting short on time and I did

62
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,908
leave us with a cliffhanger I just

63
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:39,798
wanted to get into real quick because if

64
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:43,068
I save it right now

65
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:45,500
it's worse than it wasn't in you know

66
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:46,968
it's as bad as it's been since 1994 I

67
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,598
just want to hope give everyone

68
00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:52,250
understanding as to why that is and I've

69
00:02:50,598 --> 00:02:55,280
gotta get technical for a second but

70
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,989
just bear with me I'll take you to more

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,370
but we'll get back to the shire here

72
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:02,030
pretty soon

73
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:03,650
so in order to understand why we don't

74
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,919
have access you have to understand what

75
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:08,480
is needed to treat serious medical

76
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,250
conditions and this is why I want to

77
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,709
take us back to the epidemics trial so

78
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,840
in those studies they had kids with

79
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:16,878
dravet syndrome primarily limits yes so

80
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,949
central to very difficult to treat

81
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,448
intractable forms of potentially

82
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:24,370
terminal epilepsy know they know

83
00:03:20,449 --> 00:03:28,280
whatever the dialect is right yeah was

84
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:31,188
sure got approved in the US as a drug

85
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,739
for pediatric seizure disorders which

86
00:03:31,188 --> 00:03:36,709
are as forces that very difficult to

87
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:38,329
treat but it's only one strength yeah

88
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:40,459
yeah so it's it's basically the first

89
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:42,079
fda-approved CBD medication it's

90
00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:43,609
purified CBD they do add a couple

91
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:50,329
terpenes in there but for most part it's

92
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:52,430
just CBD right so so it's been approved

93
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:54,530
by the FDA you're gonna see it probably

94
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,150
this year later this year you'll start

95
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,729
seeing it being actually it's already

96
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,829
being prescribed to epilepsy patients

97
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:02,269
it'll be more common as you know that's

98
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:03,769
usually how it works it starts off where

99
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:06,049
they said even in May they branch out

100
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:07,699
cuz they're doing studies with it it's

101
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:09,829
extremely expensive yeah cost about the

102
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:12,409
families after insurance which women

103
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:17,000
don't really cover it over $36,000 a

104
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:18,829
year so and that's cheap okay but that's

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,718
cheaper than going to the dispensary in

106
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:24,019
Nevada City and I'm about to show you

107
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:27,019
who I right so in in those studies they

108
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:28,668
showed that efficacy happened at around

109
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:30,829
starting at about seven and a half

110
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:32,718
milligrams per pound body weight so

111
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:34,788
lesson number one if you're treating

112
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:36,649
yourself with cannabinoids you need to

113
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:37,439
know the concentration not the volume

114
00:04:36,649 --> 00:04:39,359
right

115
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,430
how many milligrams my taking of a

116
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,840
cannabinoid how does it relate to how

117
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,790
much I weigh this is what doctors

118
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,529
usually do for us that we have to do for

119
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:50,189
ourselves with cannabis medicine because

120
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:52,289
we don't have a doctor's present company

121
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:55,829
excluded they were typically doing that

122
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,810
for us they're showing seven and a half

123
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,639
milligrams per pound bodyweight is where

124
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:01,769
it starts so what does that mean so we

125
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,300
take your typical eleven-year-old the

126
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:05,370
way is let's just make it easy a hundred

127
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,930
pounds right they go into their

128
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,319
neurologist and they're putting them on

129
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:14,689
a starting dose of 750 milligrams a day

130
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:17,909
okay 7.5 times 100 750 milligrams a day

131
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:20,910
a child to treat potentially terminal

132
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,800
epilepsy so we go into our dispensaries

133
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,320
how many of you been in the dispensary

134
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,379
here right next time you're in there I

135
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,089
want you to look if you had to take 750

136
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:32,219
milligrams a day how would you do it

137
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:34,439
right so what you have in the century is

138
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,300
typically a CD teachers are everywhere

139
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:38,100
right but no one looks at the

140
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,620
concentration most of them with 300

141
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:44,520
milligrams a bottle maybe 500 milligrams

142
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:46,379
so ball so in order for this child to be

143
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,799
treated they'd have to drink two or

144
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:52,009
three and a half of those bottles a day

145
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,509
and unfortunately the way cannabis is

146
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:56,459
marketed right now the stronger it gets

147
00:05:54,509 --> 00:05:58,769
the more purified it gets which means

148
00:05:56,459 --> 00:06:01,829
the less effective fitness so there are

149
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:03,899
some CBD isolate powders or 1500

150
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:05,639
milligrams the most of those are less

151
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:09,209
effective because they're so purified

152
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:11,219
right it even knows the most I've seen

153
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:12,739
is 1500 milligrams in a Baros they'd

154
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,610
have to drink half a bottle

155
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:18,290
to get the starting dose now that's a

156
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,530
starting dose a lot of the kids we have

157
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:24,189
get up to 15 to 20 milligrams per panel

158
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:27,619
so there are 2,000 milligrams a day

159
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:29,569
doses so in order for that to work when

160
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,649
the cleanser sent work shut down we

161
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:35,120
talked to the people at elevation and

162
00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:36,709
Nevada City and they are amazing

163
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,750
Daniel Bosch for the owner immediately

164
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:41,930
said glad your families didn't have

165
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:45,230
everything at cost right great let's see

166
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:47,209
if that helps so we go in and at cost

167
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,330
the strongest thing they have in there

168
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:52,279
is a 1 gram of concentrate so it's not

169
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:54,560
even as a suspension or making sure that

170
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:57,169
a child could use and it's 500

171
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,430
milligrams and after the discount and

172
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:05,750
then taxes it's about still about 50 $45

173
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:08,959
for 1 gram and it's 500 milligrams so we

174
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:11,629
had to buy 18 of those which is all they

175
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,729
had in stock we had to break the law to

176
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:16,009
do so because in California you can only

177
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,950
buy 8 grams a day even though there's no

178
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:21,860
THC so they drove for three hours they

179
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:25,969
could only buy eight of them at 500

180
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:29,480
milligrams that's about six seven days

181
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:31,670
worth of medicine and we ended up having

182
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,430
to buy an 18 because we just took turns

183
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:36,379
buying it for the family with a full

184
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,810
discount rameen elevation made zero

185
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:42,199
money it cost us eight hundred and sixty

186
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:44,030
dollars and it was for 21 days worth of

187
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,310
Medicine that I had to take them to my

188
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:48,379
house and teach them how to turn into a

189
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:51,050
suspension because it was concentrated

190
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:54,649
right this is the current state of

191
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:57,170
cannabis so even with the century making

192
00:07:54,649 --> 00:08:01,159
no profit that family could not afford

193
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:03,590
to get back in and give that meant they

194
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,810
spent the $800 they had at bottom about

195
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:09,289
20 days and then they have nothing and

196
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:12,439
this is for a young child who has dravet

197
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:13,270
syndrome and last I heard they had run

198
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:17,709
out of Medicine

199
00:08:13,269 --> 00:08:19,689
and he was in the hospital and we we've

200
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:23,168
lost hits since the gloves not in place

201
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:25,449
and this is the current state and you

202
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:26,709
know I don't want to be a big bummer but

203
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:29,830
what I want is for people who are

204
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:32,949
passionate about this to be in no doubt

205
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:35,049
and not spread the myth that cannabis is

206
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,719
here and everything's fine and access is

207
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:40,359
available if you're a business owner I

208
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,370
think it's important to understand what

209
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,839
patients need so that we can start

210
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,830
producing products that will actually

211
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,209
benefit critically ill patients a lot of

212
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,278
what we hear is that the market is

213
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:53,559
saturated right everything is everyone's

214
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,480
got the same things but they don't

215
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:56,859
realize that I've got 150 families who

216
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,050
can't find the medicine they need in a

217
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,430
single dispensary in California so it's

218
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:02,069
a market that needs to be filled and

219
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:04,750
it's about education and understanding

220
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,940
so I want to make sure before we ran out

221
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,339
of time that we had some understanding

222
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,430
as to why when I say it's worse now than

223
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:14,170
it was in 1994 or why that is

224
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:15,129
collectives are gone charities can no

225
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:17,740
longer exist

226
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:20,889
the cost is unaffordable the products

227
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:22,870
are unavailable and because now we're

228
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:24,639
violating state law there's no there's

229
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:27,100
not the 215 still around but the

230
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,528
protections are not the same we have the

231
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:31,930
National Guard from gavin newsom going

232
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:34,360
into busting cannabis farmers and the

233
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:37,059
consequences are way higher way higher

234
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:46,480
now than they were prior to proposition

235
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:48,789
64 ask somebody what part what part of

236
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,300
this the question was this Colorado have

237
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:51,299
a framework

238
00:09:56,169 --> 00:10:01,639
not a very good one I mean I think what

239
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:02,929
what California had that Colorado a lot

240
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:06,019
of other states didn't happens it had

241
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:08,719
twenty years to refine medical cannabis

242
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:09,829
charities and collectives you know a lot

243
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,110
of these states just jumped into

244
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:13,639
legalization rights a lot of them what I

245
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,509
find they don't know what they don't

246
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:16,460
know they're missing

247
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:18,590
so I mean you might not hear as much as

248
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,700
an outcry out of families and parents in

249
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,889
other states but it's really because

250
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,720
they just don't understand what they

251
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:25,730
could be kidding you know some families

252
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,430
get a little bit of benefit from

253
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,409
whatever CBD products are around but

254
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:33,319
there's a big difference in the ten or

255
00:10:30,409 --> 00:10:35,809
twenty percent efficacy from products

256
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,760
that are too weak in getting 80 or 90

257
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:40,009
percent efficacy from being able to dial

258
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,590
in specific products for kids that are

259
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:45,769
there there's no compassion or charity

260
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:47,720
model that I know of in Colorado and

261
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:49,819
when the cloud recent work was around we

262
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,379
help families from all over the world we

263
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,390
weren't able to get medicine to all of

264
00:10:51,379 --> 00:10:55,610
them but we did educational services for

265
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:57,649
anyone who called and we got the most

266
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:00,190
calls from families in Washington in

267
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:00,189
Colorado

268
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:10,159
what was that so a pelican pocket hug

269
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:15,820
him going care apologist but so last

270
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:19,159
year we've worked on sv it was a 12 that

271
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,930
829 yeah that's so many numbers now it

272
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:22,549
has to be 34 this year that's how

273
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:24,109
quickly in and out of my memory as soon

274
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:26,389
as Governor Brown vetoed it which is

275
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,730
what he did so we worked really hard to

276
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:30,740
start to develop California compassion

277
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:32,870
model so that we can be recognized as an

278
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,100
entity because right now the glad news

279
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,409
networks someone who just helped

280
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,149
trembling Oh kids it's the black market

281
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:39,889
so everyone who's getting legal this

282
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:41,659
goes into again why it's worse now than

283
00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:43,039
it was all the people who are helping

284
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:44,809
the calandria sent work as they get

285
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:45,169
legal they can no longer interact with

286
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:47,000
this

287
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:48,649
it's divergent where the black market

288
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,070
now there's we have no way to identify

289
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:54,019
it who we are so that would have allowed

290
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,370
us to be identified is a compassionate

291
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:57,110
program so at least we can interact

292
00:11:55,370 --> 00:12:00,470
right I can give you stuff you can give

293
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:02,659
me stuff for someone on paper and we got

294
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,600
Republican and Democratic support that

295
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:07,459
in this political climate today if that

296
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,500
doesn't tell you that it was good you

297
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,970
know you don't get bipartisan support I

298
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,559
maybe think you can ask Marco at the sky

299
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:17,060
is a folk 51 purple and 49 feet you know

300
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,439
they they have bipartisan support they

301
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:21,199
got all the way to Governor Brown's test

302
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,270
and then he vetoed it with really no

303
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,490
explanation he just said he didn't want

304
00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:29,829
he saw it as a tax set and people would

305
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,830
just be diverting taxes

306
00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:37,239
you
