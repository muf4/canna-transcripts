1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:14,039
[Music]

2
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:16,259
yeah I I got introduced HR not not too

3
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:18,719
long ago or we it's been brought to

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,109
everyone's attention on on the benefits

5
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:25,259
of it and clay I I'm fortunate enough to

6
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,868
try his live soil as well as he makes

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,420
biochar and he approached me wanting me

8
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:32,549
to give his biochar run so of course we

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,880
jumped on it we do a lot of R&amp;D we were

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,909
happy to and we're really excited with

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,800
the results and what we're seeing and

12
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:42,539
I'm not the expert in biochar but clay

13
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,640
tell me a little bit about my

14
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,579
understanding is you can you can use the

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,509
source different kind of wood to make

16
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:51,000
biochar and there there's different

17
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:52,558
grades and and well the outcome will be

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,988
different on what kind of woods you're

19
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,820
choosing tell me a little bit about you

20
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:59,640
know what you're doing and why you do

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:04,799
that you know what would you select we

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:08,280
start with hardened soft woods one step

23
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:12,960
up that we offer in our biochar product

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,359
is we also use coastal driftwoods the

25
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:19,639
sea is amazing for plants so anything

26
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:23,280
that those those those logs that could

27
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:27,329
saturate in the biochars

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,590
burnt to a specific degree every creator

29
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:33,239
of biochar has their own degrees the

30
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,520
Amazonian started at first so obviously

31
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:38,069
they didn't have thermometers they burn

32
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:41,340
it to the point where my grandpa taught

33
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:44,849
me it's time to snuff it out so we kind

34
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,530
of did that year after year after year I

35
00:01:44,849 --> 00:01:48,629
mean before I bring it to any of you

36
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,728
guys I definitely had to run it in our

37
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:58,048
medical grows and so we use hardwood

38
00:01:53,728 --> 00:02:00,328
softwood and the the driftwood that kind

39
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,009
of makes it a little bit different

40
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:05,849
there's a lot of different biochars you

41
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:08,818
can make biochar from straw that's right

42
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:10,868
and it's just it's not the same I'm a

43
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,909
molecular level

44
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:15,098
the straw isn't the same as the

45
00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:18,568
hardwoods like madronas and stuff like

46
00:02:15,098 --> 00:02:22,628
that it's its mother nature's perfect

47
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:25,030
store perfect hotel for the microbes for

48
00:02:22,628 --> 00:02:28,479
your soil and you know my understanding

49
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:30,759
is you you you've moved on using some of

50
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,128
mammoth products and tell me some of the

51
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:35,048
goodies that you're putting in to your

52
00:02:33,128 --> 00:02:37,659
biochar in your process you know your

53
00:02:35,049 --> 00:02:38,319
teas and your mix and and how why that's

54
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:41,500
so much better

55
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:47,459
why your product has become so good well

56
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:50,969
a lot of R&amp;D thousands of plants it

57
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:54,909
biochars whole process is to collect

58
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:57,098
nitrogen and phosphorous from the soils

59
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:59,259
after a fire because there's no more

60
00:02:57,098 --> 00:03:01,839
foliage there's no more roots to be able

61
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:03,759
to hold that stuff in the soil so Mother

62
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,200
Nature doesn't want the year of rain to

63
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,659
come along and wash all those minerals

64
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:11,199
away so they create she created biochar

65
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:14,370
it actually collects it so what we do is

66
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:18,599
we brew 26 organic ingredients

67
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:23,049
amendments everything from green sand

68
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:25,090
crustacean meal alfalfa we have a few

69
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:26,920
secret ingredients that once you isn't

70
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,629
it you get you get told what those are

71
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:33,518
but I can't give all all the goodies

72
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:35,829
away now that goes and we actually brew

73
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,590
three it's a timing thing you brew three

74
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:41,169
different teas and then towards the end

75
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:44,200
we actually add mammoths at the end for

76
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:46,169
the microbes can't put him into earlier

77
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:50,738
they'll eat everything before your plans

78
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:54,150
yes and I was fortunate enough to you

79
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:57,700
brought me you're making live soil now

80
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:00,099
and you he reached out to me and wanted

81
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:02,530
me to try a run of his live soil so we

82
00:04:00,098 --> 00:04:04,149
have it's very new to us but you want to

83
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,939
tell us a little bit about that project

84
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:10,629
and and what you're doing with your live

85
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:13,539
soil line and how how its special well

86
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:14,199
it's it's special my one of my best

87
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:19,899
friends

88
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:22,719
besides Casey is he's he's a Marley worm

89
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:25,419
growers he is has

90
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,570
sends one castings all over well a lot

91
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,340
of doing organic amendments that you can

92
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:33,099
buy out here have one type of worm

93
00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:38,250
castings we actually have five different

94
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:42,370
types of worm castings in ours and the

95
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,860
he also makes soil so then Casey and a

96
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,449
few other growers that use our biochar

97
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,710
we're like well why don't you work on a

98
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:52,240
soil so actually the last year we ran

99
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:54,339
different tests the SEM the other you

100
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:00,939
know I've been building soils for twenty

101
00:04:54,339 --> 00:05:03,699
years so it wasn't new to me but to put

102
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:06,670
a super soil out there for this

103
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:08,680
gentleman to risk fifty thousand dollars

104
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:11,620
worth of his product on that's something

105
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,879
big to ask and and I think it's pretty

106
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:16,600
dialed in

107
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:19,379
it's stoked to harvest soil know

108
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,050
nutrients added needed to be added

109
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:25,060
unless you're gonna run a long outdoor

110
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:28,210
it's about you know four four months is

111
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:33,040
a good run if you're gonna run along

112
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:34,569
outdoor you want to top this yeah clay

113
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,790
could you tell us a little bit about the

114
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:39,490
your soil making process you're making a

115
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,050
live soil with biochar you know part of

116
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,050
your expertise and background with the

117
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:46,540
biochar tell us that process and how

118
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,079
you're selecting ingredients for your

119
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:53,490
live soil how that how that comes to be

120
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:58,990
well as a grower you try everything

121
00:05:53,490 --> 00:06:02,009
Coco's amazing peat moss peat moss is

122
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:07,629
amazing our living soil actually

123
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:09,939
probably has more peat moss in it per

124
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:16,959
bag than any other super soil out there

125
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:19,990
I prefer peat moss it is it is organic

126
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:24,609
and created to also help the microbe

127
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:28,540
growth Coco is a really good product

128
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:30,370
also but I just prefer the peat as a

129
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:35,449
grower and everybody's got their own

130
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:38,259
their own their own choices we use only

131
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:43,009
percent organic and naturally collected

132
00:06:38,259 --> 00:06:45,199
amendments we start with micro and macro

133
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:48,199
nutrients EO do three different teas

134
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,718
that we brew and there's a certain order

135
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:53,300
that we add stuff to it and that's been

136
00:06:50,718 --> 00:06:55,129
a test because then we test the soils

137
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:58,218
and see what the runoff is see what's

138
00:06:55,129 --> 00:07:02,028
not staying what is staying for

139
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:03,558
different stages of your plant one our

140
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:07,009
first brew we start with the fish

141
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:09,800
emulsion that fish emulsion is what

142
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:12,310
speeds up that year-long process that

143
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:16,370
the mother nature needs to go through

144
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:18,348
after after a fire because I needed to

145
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,838
speed that process up obviously we

146
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:24,588
harvest every week you got to have a new

147
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:26,240
soya ready to go and that the the

148
00:07:24,588 --> 00:07:29,689
microbes and the beneficial bacteria

149
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,569
that grow in the fish emulsion is the

150
00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:35,599
first T that we start and we slowly add

151
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:39,259
the macronutrients after that all the

152
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:44,110
way from crustacean mel alfalfa meal

153
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:47,930
glacier still green sand we also use

154
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:52,538
brown and black compost from olie

155
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,538
mountain very very reputable company

156
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:06,780
it's time it's it's if you think about

157
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:09,240
it you watch your compost go from color

158
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:11,039
to brown to black finally when it's

159
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,590
ready to go and that that's that's all

160
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,900
that is you can because we want you to

161
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:18,060
be able to only water your whole cycle

162
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:19,879
so you get out food in the beginning and

163
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,829
you get out food available at the end

164
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:24,779
what I'm hearing you say is brown and

165
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:27,870
black compost what one's a little more

166
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:30,389
hotter than the other great one will

167
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:32,580
affect your plan a little more the most

168
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:34,889
of the black compost is now broken down

169
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:39,360
and ready for your plant ready for the

170
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:42,449
microbes to eat as your microbes are

171
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,210
feeding on that compost in our soil your

172
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,790
brown compost is breaking down by the

173
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:50,090
time you're switching into flour it's

174
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:53,129
breaking down that high phosphorous

175
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:57,690
bagua know which is what the cannabis

176
00:08:53,129 --> 00:09:00,090
plant needs and for extra extra

177
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,490
flowering extra flower power I like to

178
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:05,550
say the timing was important timing is

179
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:07,730
important and and it takes time to learn

180
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:10,199
when to do your compost and stuff but

181
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:14,850
you kind of took that out of the thought

182
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,230
process by using both compost I said

183
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,870
we're really excited to run it thank you

184
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,539
for that by the way what you running

185
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:24,389
it's been adjust not even two weeks now

186
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:26,759
since we transplanted them so we're

187
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:28,799
following taking data and we'll get you

188
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:31,620
the results and we're excited to see

189
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:34,500
what what we can do I'm glad you guys

190
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:38,429
I'm glad you trusted me and absolutely

191
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:42,799
keep I'll be at your door every day yeah

192
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:42,799
make sure we make sure we get it

193
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:52,789
those are crossed all the t's those are

194
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,440
definitely crossed all the t's the

195
00:09:52,789 --> 00:09:58,649
microbes we add towards the end because

196
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,720
they'll eat everything I also we're

197
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:03,329
coming up when you have living soil you

198
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,100
don't want to flush it's a big you hear

199
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:08,370
people talk about flushing because there

200
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:10,379
is no flushing you want to ground your

201
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:12,000
microbes I mean I'm just saying you

202
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:13,710
don't want to wash those microbe job

203
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,990
because they're doing the last of their

204
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,570
life trying to get that phosphorous out

205
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,549
trying to get the nitrogen out because

206
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:24,140
you don't want your cannabis to Sparkle

207
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:26,729
and crackle when you light it and then

208
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:30,509
so you want those microbes to eat up

209
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:32,460
everything that's left in that soil so

210
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:36,569
we're gonna actually make we've we use

211
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:39,509
in our own farm sugar finishes is what I

212
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,310
call and they're their organic extracts

213
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:44,370
I make three different extracts

214
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:47,549
depending on the strains and we crushed

215
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:50,789
the biochar into a powder add this with

216
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:53,909
three different natural sugars so as you

217
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:56,849
water your last two weeks of the of the

218
00:10:53,909 --> 00:10:59,309
flowering cycle that powder does what

219
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:01,019
Mother Nature wanted it to works its way

220
00:10:59,309 --> 00:11:03,929
through your soil and takes out all that

221
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:06,000
nitrogen grabs out all ups not available

222
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,629
to your your microbes or your plan

223
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,539
anymore

224
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:11,580
so what's left the sugar and the natural

225
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:14,610
extracts that we use the organic

226
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:17,430
extracts blueberry huckleberry I mean it

227
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,320
just depends on the strain but then all

228
00:11:17,429 --> 00:11:23,069
those microbes have to feed on is that

229
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,960
sugar honey and there's a few other few

230
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:28,230
other items that we use that I don't

231
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:32,670
want to say but you know if they are

232
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:35,340
listed on the product of course but that

233
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:38,729
just leaves nothing else in the soil but

234
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:41,340
natural sugars there's no natural sugars

235
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,470
you know how sticky honey is will feed

236
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:47,310
your plant honey tell me how sticky your

237
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:48,779
buds are just saying so clay what else

238
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:51,089
outside of what you've mentioned already

239
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:52,069
are you putting in your super soil your

240
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:55,980
live soil

241
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:58,580
well obviously mammoth microbes is the

242
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:03,100
last we also use

243
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:05,540
we're doing soils for other other other

244
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,339
cannabis growers and hemp growers they

245
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:09,409
want to use there's all kinds of

246
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:12,200
microbes out there to use and there's

247
00:12:09,409 --> 00:12:16,039
different cultivators of those microbes

248
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:18,200
so you're actually adjusting per farm if

249
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:21,740
they ask so it does kind of change a

250
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:25,430
little bit but as far as you know the

251
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:27,889
compost the there is a little bit of

252
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:30,528
that brown and black compost and the

253
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:32,720
teas but very little of it we actually

254
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:37,519
add most of that to the super soil at

255
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,050
the end 1/2 the earthworm castings

256
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,480
there's five different North's worm

257
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:44,539
castings that we use two of them go in

258
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,990
the t's three of them are added to the

259
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:53,990
super soil by themselves everything from

260
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:57,589
high phosphorus bat guano low fuss cow

261
00:12:53,990 --> 00:13:01,070
calcium kalmec we use ground up moisture

262
00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:03,589
shells in it obviously helps the pH a

263
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:06,290
little bit but Mother Nature the biochar

264
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:08,390
actually pH is for every plant

265
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:10,250
I mean think how many plants start up

266
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:13,069
after a forest fire at a just a pine

267
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:17,539
tree you know it isn't just a weed it

268
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:20,720
has to be all the way across so even we

269
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:23,000
have some non organic growers that are

270
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:27,170
using a chemical based nutrients that

271
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,659
use our biochar because it does work but

272
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:32,328
they add these teas in between them to

273
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:34,309
help replace the microbes so just stay

274
00:13:32,328 --> 00:13:38,088
organic yeah then you don't have to do

275
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:39,889
that so for some of your customers that

276
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:41,480
you're providing a biochar your soil to

277
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:43,610
if they're in different areas regions or

278
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:47,360
go growing differently say outdoors or

279
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:48,649
if it's in a greenhouse or indoors what

280
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,300
are some of the changes that you're

281
00:13:48,649 --> 00:13:52,278
having to make or that your that they're

282
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:54,139
wanting maybe even for certain strains

283
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:55,909
that they're running and what are those

284
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:59,480
changes that you would do for your live

285
00:13:55,909 --> 00:14:02,778
soil for the life so the first change

286
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,850
that I try and do I don't play with the

287
00:14:02,778 --> 00:14:09,289
ingredients so much a play with the

288
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:11,750
amount of biochar the amount of perlite

289
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:14,539
the amount of peat moss well we'll play

290
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:18,559
with that a little bit but as far as the

291
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:22,819
grow if they're on a drip system most of

292
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:25,099
my grows are watering once a week in a

293
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:28,459
professional go that's a lot of labour

294
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:31,699
not being you know being used on better

295
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:34,338
things and holding the watering wand we

296
00:14:31,698 --> 00:14:36,740
will change it basically when it comes

297
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:39,440
down to them to the gardeners already

298
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:42,350
using it it will change on just the

299
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,040
amount of biochar that's added some

300
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:50,720
soils heavy clay soils 20-30 percent

301
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:54,528
biochar I have a whole group of farmers

302
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:56,600
that grow indoor fruit trees they're

303
00:14:54,528 --> 00:14:58,610
running their mixes they're using it

304
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,850
about 30 percent which is even more than

305
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,639
most cannabis growers so we kind of

306
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:06,860
adjust it per what their soil medium

307
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,100
whether they're gonna use a soilless or

308
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:12,709
they're using our live soil that's

309
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:16,278
pretty much I don't adjust the recipe

310
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:19,639
only because I think as being a chef for

311
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:21,828
15 years for the Hilton I've got the mix

312
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:24,620
down I've got the alfredo sauce pretty

313
00:15:21,828 --> 00:15:27,799
knocked out and I'm not gonna have my

314
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:30,078
buddy over for dinner to try my alfredo

315
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:33,889
sauce if I haven't already fed it to my

316
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:37,069
own family and we use our biochar and

317
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:40,000
our vegetables my mother's house plans

318
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:42,800
amend everything have you made a change

319
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,350
purse drain or maybe if a customer has

320
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,528
asked you or do you know of say a strain

321
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:50,329
yeah if it's you know blue dream or

322
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:52,189
blueberry that by tweaking your formula

323
00:15:50,328 --> 00:15:54,679
a little bit now this is for the strain

324
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,720
you know strain specific that you get a

325
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:59,179
different result or get that strain to

326
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,519
reach its full potential or and what

327
00:15:59,179 --> 00:16:04,429
would those changes be a pretty wet

328
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:07,009
strain that everybody knows same way

329
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:09,259
with like say blue dream had a blue

330
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:11,899
dream cut for about seven years it's

331
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:15,919
amazing everybody loves their blue dream

332
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:17,750
but we have a grower Gorilla Glue Number

333
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:21,689
Four actually use it as one of my

334
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:24,720
father's or not gorilla glue number four

335
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,960
and we change it we have changed it a

336
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,060
bit

337
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,940
because there are certain strains

338
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:33,659
there's landrace strains that have not

339
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:36,000
been adult altered that come from other

340
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:38,610
countries there's different minerals on

341
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,669
every part of this rock so we have had

342
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,950
to adjust depending on a cup we got a

343
00:16:41,669 --> 00:16:48,929
couple growers that grow gorilla glue

344
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:52,740
number four strictly for edibles and we

345
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:56,699
have backed off we backed off about half

346
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:59,299
of our biochar and ingredients in our

347
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:03,120
last tea for that particular strain

348
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:04,649
because anybody can grow it you can put

349
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,588
it in a mud puddle and it would probably

350
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:09,900
grow so yeah we do adjust them because

351
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:11,909
why am I gonna have you pay for a full

352
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,339
product when I'm not putting all that in

353
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:17,279
there I mean I'm just not you don't need

354
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:18,059
it for certain strains another one God's

355
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:22,170
gift

356
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:25,500
very very very easily grown very low

357
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:28,130
nutrients blue dream now then on the

358
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,859
other side we got some land races

359
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:34,830
Afghani number one that you know that

360
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:37,319
that that can be a 13-week strain well

361
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:39,509
it's gonna need phosphorus a little bit

362
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:41,700
longer than everybody else especially if

363
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:43,529
you don't want a smoke leaf if you

364
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,480
actually want some density to your

365
00:17:43,529 --> 00:17:48,450
flower you got a kick up that low Foss

366
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,250
in the beginning of flowering to make

367
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:52,490
sure you actually get a but instead of

368
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,490
just

369
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,559
Thank You clay welcome so after

370
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:05,910
presentation today what what are some of

371
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:09,059
the the key aspects you'd like to cover

372
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:11,880
again what struck your fancy you know

373
00:18:09,059 --> 00:18:16,289
the the main takeaways from from where I

374
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,060
spoke yeah and very important it varies

375
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:21,029
per state every state is different but

376
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:22,859
the main takeaway is you have to plan

377
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:24,839
for change there's going to be change

378
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:29,099
change change and you have to plan plan

379
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:32,549
plan and phasing your built out or your

380
00:18:29,099 --> 00:18:35,730
planning is important because the future

381
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:38,190
is unknown and uncertain and so most

382
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:41,519
people that are building out to a to a

383
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:45,990
large capacity want to phase that build

384
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:47,879
and there's unforeseen and and you want

385
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:51,059
to plan for that and if that's using

386
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,860
mobile structures maybe you know - or

387
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:55,109
not knowing if you're gonna if your

388
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:57,209
county or zoning or a lie to do

389
00:18:55,109 --> 00:19:00,179
extraction and arable put a moratorium

390
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,490
on that area or limit your extraction to

391
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,289
the market itself changing and suddenly

392
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,759
you know flour might be extremely

393
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:06,809
competitive and I want to you want to

394
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:08,609
build a kitchen you know you want to

395
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:12,269
launch the edible line or a topical line

396
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:15,329
so so much is unforeseen so the main

397
00:19:12,269 --> 00:19:17,490
takeaway is is plan for change there'll

398
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:20,159
be a lot of change and and you have to

399
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,089
kind of forecast for that and always

400
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,670
keep that in mind

401
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:26,339
I think another big one from the the

402
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:29,759
mice my conference behind presentation

403
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:33,059
is all the different government agencies

404
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,859
and their their regulations and how you

405
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:36,240
have to abide by them all and they're

406
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:38,419
all different they all have their own

407
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,759
requirements and it makes it challenging

408
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:44,310
and those can change as well and trying

409
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,990
to when you're looking for a site - - or

410
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:48,389
starting your business you know you have

411
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,519
to take into consideration your local

412
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,380
authority and the state the city the

413
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:54,240
county you know clean air Health

414
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,060
Department Department of Ecology the

415
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,190
Planning Department fire marshal the

416
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:01,259
troopers yep your neighbors yeah and

417
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:02,850
those are all gonna vary depending on

418
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:04,789
where you are you know different County

419
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:07,799
will have different requirements and

420
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:08,519
even one of the things I wanted to talk

421
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:10,950
more on and we

422
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:12,778
didn't was the hoop houses and how in my

423
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,999
County that's considered a temporary

424
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:17,038
structure but they didn't have a

425
00:20:14,999 --> 00:20:18,749
definition for what a hoop house was a

426
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,479
year ago or and in some other counties

427
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:24,389
they don't consider a hoop house

428
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:25,469
structure and now the clean air agency

429
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:29,998
has come in and they're trying to

430
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:32,219
regulate us being able to grow in a hoop

431
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:33,899
house this temporary structure and

432
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:35,129
they're wanting to police you know if

433
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:37,348
you don't have a hoop house or you're

434
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:39,808
not growing you know this was this month

435
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:43,168
March last month of this year you're not

436
00:20:39,808 --> 00:20:45,358
able to now grow in one this is a the

437
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:48,809
clean air agency which is in Spokane

438
00:20:45,358 --> 00:20:51,509
County you know it's kind of their kind

439
00:20:48,808 --> 00:20:52,798
of their own Authority and they're not a

440
00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:54,058
planning department it's something that

441
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:55,319
you think the county would be policing

442
00:20:54,058 --> 00:20:56,388
and telling you what you can do in a

443
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:59,578
structure and you have this other

444
00:20:56,388 --> 00:21:02,158
government agency coming in and we had

445
00:20:59,578 --> 00:21:03,749
to file an exemption to be able to grow

446
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,489
in these temporary structures and we're

447
00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:08,729
not exempt of anything and that's a

448
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:10,499
yearly now fee I have to pay and they

449
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:12,179
want us to give them our my harvest

450
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:14,459
schedules you know which is putting my

451
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:18,209
team at risk and there's proprietary

452
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:19,288
information there and in another County

453
00:21:18,209 --> 00:21:20,788
it's completely different you know they

454
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:23,278
might not even have a clean air agency

455
00:21:20,788 --> 00:21:24,479
in that County hoop houses aren't even

456
00:21:23,278 --> 00:21:27,778
considered a temporary structure or a

457
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:30,509
structure at all so all of that is gonna

458
00:21:27,778 --> 00:21:33,479
play a huge role in where you're gonna

459
00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:36,479
build and what your plan is and you know

460
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:40,259
get yourself up the to success you know

461
00:21:36,479 --> 00:21:45,328
basically so doing all your homework is

462
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:47,969
basically a large one adaptation another

463
00:21:45,328 --> 00:21:49,858
to be open another main takeaway is you

464
00:21:47,969 --> 00:21:52,038
know yeah and I feel that this

465
00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:55,108
drastically is your budget you know

466
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:57,538
whatever my budget was I I feel that

467
00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:59,278
that and you know Matt now for me it's

468
00:21:57,538 --> 00:22:02,700
just double it you know there's gonna be

469
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:05,509
so many unforeseen costs that you cannot

470
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:09,088
plan on or you wouldn't imagine and so

471
00:22:05,509 --> 00:22:10,319
you have to it's just really hard to get

472
00:22:09,088 --> 00:22:12,838
your budget down for what you're working

473
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,249
with so you know that was a huge one for

474
00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:17,638
me is just whatever you think your

475
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:19,139
budget is double that budget there's

476
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:21,538
gonna be unforeseen things and things

477
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:22,479
are gonna be required to do and new

478
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:25,058
licenses and per

479
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,319
it's and government agencies coming in

480
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:31,269
trying to get a piece of the pie you

481
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:32,259
know like the clean air agency or and so

482
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:34,029
yeah those are the those are the

483
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:37,509
takeaways mostly you know plan plan plan

484
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:38,678
do your homework your budget whatever

485
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:41,558
you think you need you're gonna need

486
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,240
more and also contracts when you're

487
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:46,899
dealing with your contractors you know

488
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,640
roofers electricians a lot of these guys

489
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,870
this is new to us right the cannabis

490
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,880
industry commercial at this scale

491
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,889
especially to the government agencies so

492
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:57,580
we're all on this vertical learning

493
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:59,380
curve and they're not they're not gonna

494
00:22:57,579 --> 00:23:00,699
know how to decide a grove they're not

495
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,530
gonna know where you need power and why

496
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,789
and how much you know your architects

497
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:05,649
not going to know that your head grower

498
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:07,779
and the way he envisions that his system

499
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:11,519
his method he has to work with this

500
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:14,500
architect with the the electrician and

501
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:17,230
so there's just everybody's really on a

502
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:19,509
large vertical learning scale which is

503
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:22,058
exciting everybody's learning and that's

504
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:23,558
another reason for all the change as

505
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:25,779
they learn and figure out what's going

506
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:27,819
on there'll be changes that will be for

507
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:30,519
the positive and for the negative to to

508
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:35,139
a business owner or to a grower to to

509
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:39,599
the county to the city but I think those

510
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,600
were those are the main takeaways oh

511
00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:49,120
yeah it's been it's been a Zam indoor

512
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:53,048
and outdoor I hope with a lot of

513
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:55,149
different grows and the Clean Air Act

514
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:57,369
that they put together and it's gonna

515
00:23:55,150 --> 00:24:00,130
happen in every state there's gonna be

516
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:01,779
some states that don't care and there's

517
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:04,320
gonna be some they're three or four

518
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:08,048
different agencies pop up and they go

519
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:11,918
you know I mean really a hoop house I

520
00:24:08,048 --> 00:24:14,769
mean there's cattle farms that are

521
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,530
putting off more co2 on the air than we

522
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:19,960
could ever think of doing and are they

523
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:21,940
getting charged by the acre or are they

524
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,190
even getting charged for clean air I

525
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,860
mean you know it's just kind of it

526
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:29,650
really hit it really hit a lot of farms

527
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:31,750
we're struggling and so I can understand

528
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:34,040
them needing wanting to get their piece

529
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:37,069
of the pie but they could have

530
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:39,559
you know give give your state five years

531
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:41,659
give your give your investors five years

532
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:45,169
as people are putting out their entire

533
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:46,519
life savings into these places and

534
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:50,390
there's more and more things keep

535
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:53,720
popping up really you have to be like

536
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:55,730
Casey said have two times the amount in

537
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:58,039
your investment book than what you're

538
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:00,470
planning on action spending because it

539
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:02,420
changes it'll change next week it's

540
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,160
going to change again in the next month

541
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:07,460
yep month to month

542
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:10,850
it changes packaging rules labeling

543
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:14,450
rules security rules you can set your

544
00:25:10,849 --> 00:25:17,659
main game plan up but definitely leave

545
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:20,720
some quotations for adaptation on it

546
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,940
because it changes you're right you know

547
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:26,120
one of the panels that I enjoyed and it

548
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:29,120
was it was today and it was the breeding

549
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:31,369
panel you know a lot of what we do at

550
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,589
contender gardens is the the Rd in the

551
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:35,059
strain selection and and running these

552
00:25:33,589 --> 00:25:38,480
strains in different environments that

553
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:39,950
scene scene where we can get the best of

554
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,500
the best and what we're looking for

555
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:46,220
right the bag appeal the vigorous growth

556
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:49,190
the resistance to pathogens and insects

557
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:52,279
and we're really big on that research

558
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:54,140
and I enjoyed the panel today on the

559
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:56,539
breeding when it was really good to hear

560
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,210
them talk about Auto flowers feminized

561
00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:00,670
Auto flower seeds we do see that

562
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:04,579
becoming more and more of a big deal

563
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:08,779
because in the past it wasn't yeah yeah

564
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:10,579
in in the world but in the US and the

565
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:11,629
gentleman that spoke mr. loud did say

566
00:26:10,579 --> 00:26:13,549
how you know how he wouldn't even

567
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,500
consider a look at feminized Auto

568
00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:18,740
flowers you know not not too long ago

569
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,940
couple years ago but how he's looking at

570
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,819
and seeing things a little differently

571
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:25,190
now from from going to a greenhouse from

572
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:26,689
talking to another breeder and that's

573
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,940
that's been the truth for me as well

574
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:31,309
where you know Auto flowers weren't

575
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,529
really interesting and now we're seeing

576
00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:35,000
the breeding and the auto flower what we

577
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:37,670
have now to work with the stock has

578
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:40,609
changed and you know when you can get

579
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:42,500
two or three times your canopy in the

580
00:26:40,609 --> 00:26:43,909
season when before it wasn't really an

581
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,009
option or you wouldn't consider it I

582
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,779
mean that's that's huge you know that's

583
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:50,179
that's really doubling

584
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:53,119
doubling up your your yield and doubling

585
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:54,470
up your sales and we're gonna do them at

586
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,589
two locations this season the auto

587
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:59,089
flowers we very sprouted them and we

588
00:26:57,589 --> 00:27:01,939
have more going in so I'm really excited

589
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:05,269
to run them and and I have interest in

590
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,650
in perhaps providing some of the seed

591
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:08,900
stock these auto flowers to some of our

592
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:11,210
other fellow farmers and in a Washington

593
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,530
State because you see more and more of

594
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:16,308
them running them and wanting to get

595
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:17,928
that second third crop in the year a lot

596
00:27:16,308 --> 00:27:19,428
of potential there and I'm glad they

597
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:22,400
touched on the art feminized Auto flower

598
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:27,320
seeds because it is it is up and coming

599
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:29,620
I I was at first not so happy with them

600
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:35,178
either I don't have time my cologne

601
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:37,279
breeder myself but I had fortunate

602
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:42,470
enough the last couple years to be able

603
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:44,629
to run some some pretty decent strains

604
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,759
of Auto flowers and I'll tell you what

605
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:50,870
they'll be a part of my grill from now

606
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:53,710
on no never always go because I love the

607
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:57,048
propagation process of the plant but

608
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:59,298
definitely for that third run you got

609
00:27:57,048 --> 00:28:02,960
space and you need canopy space to fill

610
00:27:59,298 --> 00:28:05,929
out I definitely know 27 years ago and I

611
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,909
would say you know fill it in with your

612
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:08,690
Auto flowers you've gotten a lot better

613
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:10,850
too

614
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:13,220
you know first seeds I had and I wasn't

615
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:15,349
so impressed but now the breeders that

616
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:17,120
are that are working with those you're

617
00:28:15,349 --> 00:28:19,548
getting a lot more reputable a lot more

618
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,918
time under their belt and their luck I

619
00:28:19,548 --> 00:28:25,579
think there will be a game-changer and

620
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:28,970
you'll see a huge push and evolution

621
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:30,500
with feminized Auto flower seeds farmers

622
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,120
in my state are now using them to fill

623
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,779
their canopy or their rows or their

624
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,579
cells

625
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:37,069
they'll just plant them in between their

626
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:39,949
full season plants or where they they

627
00:28:37,069 --> 00:28:41,960
have their plants laid out and then

628
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:44,090
you'll just see those come in and just

629
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:47,029
sprout their entire field earlier to get

630
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:48,589
that extra crop and you'll see that the

631
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:50,779
higher potency Otto flowers the bigger

632
00:28:48,589 --> 00:28:53,779
yields and the denser the denser bud as

633
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:55,970
as the breeders and and we have moved

634
00:28:53,779 --> 00:29:00,079
forward on this on this project but the

635
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:01,610
demand form is is you as a parent I know

636
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:03,409
I would say that I think

637
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:05,389
we have all known just from from

638
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:09,050
breeders in the past and readers today

639
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:11,509
that you know readers are you know are

640
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:14,809
have bottlenecked a lot of strains um

641
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:17,690
and so all these varieties and types

642
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:20,389
have gone away because we have you know

643
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:22,820
found things we liked and use those to

644
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:24,890
breed and and kind of took the best of

645
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:27,019
the best to breed with and so we have

646
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:31,340
less of a selection today than we did

647
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:34,670
you know 10 20 years ago and so and in

648
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:35,779
you know and breeders will acknowledge

649
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:39,860
this and understand that that's true

650
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:41,509
this has happened and so there's some

651
00:29:39,859 --> 00:29:42,859
pros and cons to that you know obviously

652
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:44,809
we get some really good hybrids and the

653
00:29:42,859 --> 00:29:47,629
best of the best with today's today's uh

654
00:29:44,809 --> 00:29:49,970
breeding and stock that comes from it

655
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:53,060
but at the same time we've left behind a

656
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:56,089
lot of types that that we might not have

657
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:57,679
anymore don't have access to that are no

658
00:29:56,089 --> 00:30:00,369
you know we're forgotten about or not

659
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,370
used and

660
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:11,059
I'm popping a couple seeds out of my

661
00:30:08,359 --> 00:30:13,939
seed bank this year the can't wait to

662
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:18,859
get home and see them I got a I was

663
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:23,000
gifted a 1970s humble or 1970s Amsterdam

664
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:25,719
haze it was smuggled out of Amsterdam I

665
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:29,240
don't know how but I'm popping the beans

666
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:31,220
pretty excited to try something that

667
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,829
comes to mind for me and these aren't

668
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:37,308
really strange that are our land racer

669
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:41,569
or you know ancient or stuff you can't

670
00:30:37,308 --> 00:30:43,339
find but I remember a Mazar was

671
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:45,439
something that I was really into that we

672
00:30:43,339 --> 00:30:52,579
got our hands on early early on in the

673
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:55,850
2000s and there was a G blue that we

674
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:58,609
really liked that I haven't seen around

675
00:30:55,849 --> 00:31:01,278
and it's not an old ancient strain this

676
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:07,219
was in early 2000s as well now Trinity

677
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:09,619
was another one and but yeah that G blue

678
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,610
was something that we would love to get

679
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:15,979
our hands on again

680
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:19,519
g13 across G 13 is one of my first

681
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:21,349
trains back in the day orange peeking

682
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,278
out the window watching for your local

683
00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:24,859
mailman

684
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:27,409
has he got a bad yeah you know I think

685
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:30,288
our parents maybe would be the you know

686
00:31:27,409 --> 00:31:31,760
somebody to to ask on that you know

687
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:34,278
someone who substantially maybe older

688
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:37,220
than me that was into the end of the

689
00:31:34,278 --> 00:31:39,230
scene and and now you know doesn't here

690
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:43,640
has not found that strain again you know

691
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:45,259
just inexistent yeah because I think I'm

692
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,659
still on the on the younger generation

693
00:31:45,259 --> 00:31:49,819
you know as for when I started

694
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:52,270
cultivating and up till this point

695
00:31:49,819 --> 00:31:55,398
there's you know I didn't grow up

696
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:59,119
consuming in the 80s you know or you

697
00:31:55,398 --> 00:32:01,879
know I was a kid 70s you know wasn't

698
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:03,979
even alive so there's a lot of strains

699
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,310
that I wouldn't even have any idea that

700
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:16,759
don't exist anymore

701
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:16,759
