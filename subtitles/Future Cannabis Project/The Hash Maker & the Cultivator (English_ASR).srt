already got this one out in the store or

25
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:22,759
the camera has a nice work nice to earth

26
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:26,680
time smells caching yeah like a nice

27
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:26,679
gassy earthy undertone to it

28
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,430
that's not Cushman like reminds me of a

29
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:57,139
Cushman like just a reminder but there's

30
00:02:46,430 --> 00:03:00,799
something else going on what do you have

31
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:02,599
there's the Sunkist so this is something

32
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:05,750
we hunted this is ice cream cake number

33
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,109
one we have like four different fee

34
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:11,550
knows we

35
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:14,580
a 6 and 11 and the 14 that we just ran

36
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:21,000
probably to run this one one more time

37
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:25,800
and keep I keep this one actually good

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,960
blood structure has a good smell after

39
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:32,490
that a lot a lot of strains and you get

40
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:34,709
yeah you know it might look good and it

41
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,750
might have good crystal content but what

42
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,310
they lack is maybe smell off the bat off

43
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,979
the bat right off about you want a

44
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,080
cultivar that has about if you can yeah

45
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:45,959
and we have to work for and like burp

46
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,330
and baby it I really those are great but

47
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,090
you want it strong and it has the exact

48
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,670
would you agree my triangle of mints

49
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:57,300
that we used to run was like that it was

50
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:59,280
just in the room he was stinky but you

51
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,130
know hunting just so much shit you find

52
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,939
so much garbage yeah they really don't

53
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:07,139
want that's hard finding keepers isn't

54
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:10,020
it you punk do you guys spent a lot of

55
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:11,809
Everett cookies right yeah yeah when do

56
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,070
you find yourself start taking away

57
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,379
eliminating cats from behind like what

58
00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:18,358
stage like how when it's like third no

59
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:20,370
do you like I guess ones gotta go no we

60
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,019
run it all the way through okay we run

61
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,180
them all the way through and then we

62
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:26,009
females the guys that don't want to get

63
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,379
on being around you guys that don't want

64
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:30,529
to go on camera are the guys I go to to

65
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:32,879
see which ones which strains we like

66
00:04:30,529 --> 00:04:35,279
they make they helped me make a lot of

67
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:38,759
decisions on because I can't smoke them

68
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:41,219
all but they can you know he can he

69
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,610
helps us we didn't know we'd give a lot

70
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,470
of weed out you know we we see we see

71
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,470
the feedback but most importantly it

72
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:54,570
doesn't just have to be you know vigor

73
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:56,490
and THC and crystal content trimming

74
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:57,509
weed too also takes a place whether

75
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,519
you're gonna keep it or not

76
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:01,589
if it trims like shit and it breaks down

77
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,560
like cush minutes breaks down the little

78
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:07,859
buds it's it's as far as in a pack it

79
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,810
looks like shit you you know it's good

80
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,509
for packaging but little tiny buds it's

81
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,730
not appealing

82
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:14,560
you want plus I hear this size you know

83
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,060
bigger you know that's probably almost

84
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,399
an inch but this is probably an eighth

85
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,930
right there you know so you have to

86
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,899
think about you took what you want to

87
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,879
bring in the market and actually use and

88
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:27,429
put in the jar and streamline as well if

89
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,649
you guessed its importance it takes take

90
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:54,730
that all into consideration you know all

91
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:56,529
of it that probably and these guys punch

92
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,319
a lot over cookies they work over

93
00:05:56,529 --> 00:06:10,659
Maywood right on right on yes there so

94
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:15,269
they see a lot of not this area but more

95
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,270
the valley Oh as far as a retail store

96
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:49,870
is over and then what's this who made

97
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:53,159
that that is the Mac one jar tech yeah

98
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:58,300
that's the Mac one jar tech full-term

99
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:00,310
dry-cured there's just a different

100
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,560
temperature that it was pressed at as a

101
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:05,829
matter of fact that's the same Mac that

102
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,139
we pressed here with puffing and because

103
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:10,060
if we pressed it at that 225 temperature

104
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:12,990
the only option for it was to become jar

105
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:15,259
tech so I a jar technique and that's it

106
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:17,900
heroes

107
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:20,120
yeah otherwise it would look like that

108
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:22,549
with the way I would normally press it

109
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:31,670
and it's temperature based this is temps

110
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:33,949
at 180 to 25 but it's there both Mac the

111
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:37,610
same material same presses just

112
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:40,189
different temps these are the tests that

113
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,610
I actually similar I sent them off to

114
00:07:40,189 --> 00:07:47,060
the lab I took my ice water hash my 159

115
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:49,490
to my 45 you that's my base line so I

116
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,189
sent that in for analysis of potency and

117
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:55,430
terpene content and then I did the

118
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:58,129
hundred and eighty degree 52nd press

119
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,189
getting that potency and terpene profile

120
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:03,949
and then I did another press at two 10

121
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:07,279
50 seconds also terpene profile and then

122
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:10,039
the jar tech at 225 three days 80

123
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,679
degrees in the jar so we're gonna see

124
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,720
what happens with the cannabinoid

125
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,139
profiles as the extra heat is applied

126
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,180
see what kind of acids are gonna convert

127
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:21,949
see and if there's any change in the

128
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,600
terpene profiles so that's what I'm

129
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:30,529
looking to find out well know by the end

130
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:33,440
of the week I actually have something in

131
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:37,220
the truck that is uh it's like it's a

132
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,640
spectrometer to to actually test weed

133
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:43,070
right here THC what yeah yeah it's to

134
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:46,340
test you I just got that couple days ago

135
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:49,730
it's designed by an Israeli company to

136
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,620
be able to give you th see analysis on

137
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,019
the go and it can do flour in a room

138
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,179
what I like about it is the phenol

139
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:58,759
hunting aspect behind it so I might not

140
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:01,219
need to test every single plant and set

141
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:03,379
it off to test and I can basically test

142
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,670
it there and if it tests really low I

143
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:08,980
can eliminate it as I can

144
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:13,240
17:16 percent I can eliminate it quickly

145
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,860
interesting yep wow that's nice and uh I

146
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,370
just bought it two days ago you have to

147
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:21,159
leave this membership online is like $20

148
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:23,679
and you just pay yearly membership and

149
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:26,589
you can basically test any flower in a

150
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:31,839
room dry like what's the name of the

151

164
00:10:06,549 --> 00:10:10,479
possible no this week still you want to

165
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,850
look at some different rosin that we

166
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:22,180
pressed research absolutely bro okay and

167
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:23,560
who's the other mate I met him and Chris

168
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:27,328
is that who you think you know that she

169
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:32,938
met at Frenchy's he's not here none and

170
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:37,888
this is Sunkiss see the other two this

171
00:10:32,938 --> 00:10:41,488
is the 180 and the to 10 and then chart

172
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:43,230
a so you can see they're all the same

173
00:10:41,489 --> 00:10:45,119
material just dressed a little bit

174
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,278
different this is that post the recent

175
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:50,939
posts I think right this I didn't test I

176
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:53,519
what I did was the Cushman see I said

177
00:10:50,938 --> 00:10:57,389
Tom was asking really what I look for

178
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:01,169
with rosin and I said texture and then

179
00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:03,419
taste I don't judge on look too much you

180
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:08,399
know and like what this one see I would

181
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:11,009
punch a % choose this is it's it's it's

182
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,278
it's interesting that's definitely other

183
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:16,048
person because it goes both ways

184
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:19,798
it's a and I get the same thing you're

185
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:22,019
not your consumer right I like this I

186
00:11:19,798 --> 00:11:24,328
like this and I and I'm hoping the test

187
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:26,220
results point to that one as the as the

188
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:28,558
positive like the most effective the

189
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:32,639
most concerned and most preserved but

190
00:11:28,558 --> 00:11:34,708
yeah I'm making an educated decision you

191
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,028
know from experience I mean experience

192
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:38,458
decision I guess my educated by

193
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:40,259
experienced this look I know it's like I

194
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:42,268
guess it was a little too hot and maybe

195
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:43,739
egg fresh it's like more fresh kind of

196
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:46,198
this one looks more they're both

197
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:49,379
percentage right yeah it's just if the

198
00:11:46,198 --> 00:11:51,568
hotter tempted the acids yes so that's

199
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:53,759
what that lower temp preserves crazy

200
00:11:51,568 --> 00:11:55,769
there's a difference in it so the the

201
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:59,389
taste and stuff they have a different

202
00:11:55,769 --> 00:12:01,948
effect there could be a decarboxylation

203
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:05,519
effect that could increase the actual

204
00:12:01,948 --> 00:12:07,548
delta-9 in here what I was learning from

205
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,448
Frenchy he was saying that pre dark

206
00:12:07,548 --> 00:12:11,879
decarboxylated our products could

207
00:12:09,448 --> 00:12:14,668
possibly give us an additional 30%

208
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,649
uptake in our bloodstream compared to

209
00:12:14,668 --> 00:12:18,509
smoking at over three hundred and forty

210
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:20,789
degrees which most of us are dabbing at

211
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:22,918
five hundred smoking at like seven

212
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:24,568
hundred where that's where a joint

213
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:26,399
doesn't get you as high because we're

214
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:30,028
actually converting these Delta nines

215
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:33,418
into CBE ends and stuff like that so

216
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:36,600
he's saying it might be interesting to

217
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:38,668
see this initial pre decarboxylation

218
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,670
that might make the product stronger

219
00:12:38,668 --> 00:12:42,769
when we smoke it

220
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:44,029
so what I told him I was gonna send

221
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:45,590
these to the test he was excited he's

222
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,929
like cuz that's really the only way

223
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:49,040
we're gonna know how these things you

224
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:51,169
know it wasn't it wasn't cheap either

225
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:54,139
you know they run these stephen tests i

226
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:55,039
had to do one to eight hundred isaac

227
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:57,049
eight tests

228
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,349
i had to do eight tests because I'm

229
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:02,089
doing potency and now I'm doing Turing

230
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:10,070
right yeah it adds up quick just for

231
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:12,110
research right pop test angel bucks a

232
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,930
test no no I'm not doing I'm doing R&amp;D

233
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:16,730
testing I'm not doing the full state lab

234
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:20,209
testing because that's that why would

235
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:23,240
you do would not want to spend that much

236
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:26,450
on R&amp;D nice yeah that would have cost me

237
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,009
a lot that me hair like yeah if I would

238
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,300
it that way Dimmie this was already a

239
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:34,700
lot it was like under eight hundred

240
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:36,979
bucks so that's just for R&amp;D but the

241
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,629
answers it's gonna give me it's gonna

242
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,810
make me more educated it's gonna be

243
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:43,490
allowed me to actually speak and more

244
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:46,429
educated about my product not just in

245
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,680
theory right now cuz right now it's all

246
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:50,929
in theory based on what I think most

247
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:55,219
people is in theory yeah and most people

248
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:58,399
believe in theory first well that's all

249
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,810
you know yeah that's the thing you know

250
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,179
you go by what you believe and what you

251
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:04,549
think and what you what you what you

252
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:06,859
what you've experienced right so having

253
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:09,859
a test to give you another experience to

254
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,740
to to make a judgement off of is a lot

255
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:18,680
more solid than just I think an idea

256
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:21,019
theory I got that's what you're testing

257
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:26,059
with the lab that I took into was right

258
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:30,829
here so what's your present California

259
00:14:26,059 --> 00:14:34,429
cannabis what would you prefer me these

260
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:37,610
guys make so much different types of

261
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:41,299
rosin it's hard for me to keep up but I

262
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:44,269
like this one better five to say but

263
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:46,669
they're both you know everyone wants the

264
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:48,799
white color but white doesn't mean

265
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:52,339
anything brown doesn't mean anything if

266
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,769
anything the brown aged hash tastes

267
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,230
better in the long run

268
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:58,329
in Frenchy cannoli tell say that uh

269
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,440
there's different compounds that are

270
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:03,460
formed the hash Sheen the terpene a

271
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,779
terpene that has been given the name

272
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:08,889
machine has only created during the

273
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:11,100
concentrated form in the pressing and

274
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:13,870
plying the heat to hashish which like

275
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,120
this particular hash that's the

276
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,580
traditional dark ash I'm not sure if

277
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:21,240
that hash Sheen would come out and rosin

278
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,240
whoa

279
00:15:21,909 --> 00:15:26,110
well it's your traditional ice water

280
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:32,019
hash yeah that's really Moroccan style

281
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:34,360
traditional hash this is the there's and

282
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:36,458
that's the type of hash that they talk

283
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,950
about the the neuter penis created

284
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:40,719
during the production of that and it

285
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,730
doesn't grow on the plant it's just when

286
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,230
the chemicals get concentrated and

287
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:46,209
washed and pressed and heat applied

288
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,519
there's a neuter peeing that's created

289
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:57,429
that's only found in hash and they named

290
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:59,889
it hashing has met yeah and then this is

291
00:15:57,429 --> 00:16:01,809
the Cushman we do so many different

292
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:03,909
flavors this is what I sent out to the

293
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:10,269
last so much different hash and the

294
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:13,509
whole lab which one's this cam I can't

295
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:18,699
Cushman's yes that's the rabbit hippie

296
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:23,588
cut sure you're right the sunkissed rose

297
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:26,400
and smells better than the flower too we

298
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:26,400
have to run it again

299
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:37,310
so it looks great it smells gorilla man

300
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:42,110
instead of me oh he did oh because he

301
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:45,679
dropped another awesome oh good thing

302
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:50,990
it's not that sticky I can fan it out

303
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:54,099
that's fine what else we got up in here

304
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:59,600
so we got some new stuff that we pressed

305
00:16:54,100 --> 00:17:03,589
twisted velvet rose a damn I just dried

306
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,179
it you already have rosin of it you know

307
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,189
it this is your day that's as soon as I

308
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:11,089
got sitting on a shelf and washed it the

309
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:13,009
same night cuz I've you knew names is

310
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:15,259
where it's at it's like a new strain new

311
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:18,259
flavor on the bed I just posted pictures

312
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:22,548
of the dry flour and now his rosin Jesus

313
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:24,949
we don't wait yeah a rose a though the

314
00:17:22,548 --> 00:17:27,259
cookies we have a lot of deers the lower

315
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:30,048
temp press a little bomb it actually has

316
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:31,009
a stronger smell that's the same thing

317
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:33,529
though

318
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:35,480
lower temp press you can see the the

319
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:39,649
consistency on the look nice

320
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,450
you're welcome to triumph I hope someone

321
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:43,610
brought a rig or something they got some

322
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:48,710
peaks over there you guys want to bring

323
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:51,319
a peak over here okay yeah well load you

324
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,960

do they still have cocoa in the facility

355
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,558
they're still transitioning all the way

356
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:35,538
through I think on a big scale

357
00:19:33,558 --> 00:19:37,369
production I do believe that rock wall

358
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:40,339
is probably the best to get it going

359
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:43,369
they have 500 lights 500 lights are

360

376
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:39,860
about the Cushman's to have one time I

377
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:41,210
mean you read you watch yourself we've

378
00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:42,558
never grown real too long we always

379
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:45,319
thought we had just a lot of cuts when

380
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,420
they weren't we have the bacio the 41

381
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:51,309
now that we're

382
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:55,170
that will fritter the Oreos yeah I would

383
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:55,169
love to see some good gelato

384
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:02,740
you will I have my friend here disprove

385
00:20:59,829 --> 00:21:04,779
that but he's gotta grow it first yeah

386
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:08,470
if somebody else grows that it may not

387
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:10,029
come out the same way we've always have

388
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:12,279
always taken taking other people's

389
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:15,849
product that are in in this industry in

390
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:18,490
LA and none of it has ever watched like

391
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:21,789
this because he's right true the way

392
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:23,740
they handle it drama is very time that

393
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:25,659
conversation what I do myself that's

394
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,190
exactly what verbatim he said that's all

395
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:32,830
the reason why I even brought it up what

396
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:36,970
he said because yeah we heard feel

397
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:39,609
extracts told me that cush mints doesn't

398
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,410
wash well and it washes dark and let me

399
00:21:39,609 --> 00:21:43,779
tell you they checked out our Cushman's

400
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:46,000
right here brother you know a full term

401
00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:50,859
we're not pulling you know seven six and

402
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,420
actually when it when it's like this it

403
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:54,549
looks a lot darker but when it's just

404
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,600
one gram it looks a lot lighter well

405
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:58,659
here's what's what it looks like well

406
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:01,480
here's just one gram right here

407
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:05,320
Cushman's watch how white it is I know

408
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,730
you know see the difference but it's

409
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:08,439
just a different temperature pressing

410
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:12,160
this was pressed at a hundred and eighty

411
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:22,120
you turn so that's my but there's a lot

412
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:24,130
of complainers that like that look we

413
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:26,379
think we were thinking it was straight

414
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,600
independent well what I'm saying is that

415
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,570
this you got ahead of that mints and you

416
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:34,659
got three presses oh there's a peak

417
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:38,169
who's in who's in for a Dem press is

418
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:40,180
dark and it doesn't press dark oh yeah

419
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,220
it cures that they cure his darker away

420
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,750
no I'm just saying that when they were

421
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,569
they said they were an it came out

422
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:48,579
darker but when we ran it in a different

423
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:50,559
different way different tech it came out

424
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:52,720
lighter all of its coming out way it's

425
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,059
it's a combination of the growing tech

426
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,339
yeah and the washing power flower

427
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:58,599
so whoever they source their flower from

428
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:00,189
you know it didn't turn out right

429
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:01,719
strains get a bad name

430
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,538
when it come thank you you have to grow

431
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:07,389
your own or know your source you know

432
00:23:04,538 --> 00:23:09,460
the practices that are taking you know

433
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:10,928
during that flower stage the

434
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,569
temperatures of the room the

435
00:23:10,929 --> 00:23:16,059
temperatures consist of the entire grow

436
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:19,000
how close the the buds end up to the

437
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:21,519
light how bright the lights are shining

438
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,829
on these buds those all take a toll on

439
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,450
those trichome heads so just like you

440
00:23:23,829 --> 00:23:29,349
know the sunlight you know midsummer

441
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:31,120
you know you gets hot yeah you so those

442
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:34,599
things you really got to pay attention

443
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:37,538
to and I believe because la family farms

444
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:40,148
pays attention to every detail from

445
00:23:37,538 --> 00:23:42,460
genetics from choosing a seed pack even

446
00:23:40,148 --> 00:23:44,349
you know will sit around table and we'll

447
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,509
all talk about them just looking at

448
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:48,730
packs and then try to figure out and

449
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:51,190
merit this guy's got thousands of packs

450
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:53,048
so it's not an easy task you know and

451
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,940
obviously you want to go with with the

452
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:56,619
what what's out there you got to touch

453
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,288
your ears to the industry you're trying

454
00:23:56,619 --> 00:24:01,658
to see what they like what there is at

455
00:23:59,288 --> 00:24:03,609
what what what's their palate we follow

456
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:08,019
the hype you know we follow all that

457
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:10,990
Cushman's mac you know animal mints a

458
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:13,569
lot of what cookies is now breeding with

459
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,829
like the Cushman's is now it's that's

460
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:17,619
the hype they're creating a lot of

461
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:20,048
crosses with that like the gelati and km

462
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:22,479
is as a torture pie I was gonna say sort

463
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:24,278
of pies it's gonna because we were just

464
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:29,558
talking on this on the way here there's

465
00:24:24,278 --> 00:24:30,878
no km 11 and Angelotti is georgia pies

466
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:34,359
so it's like there's a lot of crosses

467
00:24:30,878 --> 00:24:38,019
that are being used now to form other

468
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:40,388
lines which is great because we follow

469
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:43,769
have to be nice to find packs and go

470
00:24:40,388 --> 00:24:46,329
through seeds and and in hunt and find

471
00:24:43,769 --> 00:24:48,730
the really the big winners and create

472
00:24:46,329 --> 00:24:51,548
that hype yeah well just that's a great

473
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:53,730
who Creek yeah it's like cap you later

474
00:24:51,548 --> 00:24:56,408
created the hype with the Mac you know

475
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:59,889
real the map the map now everyone's

476
00:24:56,409 --> 00:25:04,059
producing all kinds of rows and closes I

477
00:24:59,888 --> 00:25:06,918
actually seen a lot of shitty Mac but I

478
00:25:04,058 --> 00:25:09,918
saw recently caps Mac

479
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:12,649
cap smack is that's how max should be

480
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,509
grown on caps cut the caps cut which is

481
00:25:12,648 --> 00:25:19,248
when we have which is a largest tissue

482
00:25:14,509 --> 00:25:20,989
culture - and it does grow a little bit

483
00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:23,899
more vigorous we're told through tissue

484
00:25:20,989 --> 00:25:24,999
culture but it still grows fucking so

485
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:27,618
well as fuck

486
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:29,298
yeah it's not something Joel you

487
00:25:27,618 --> 00:25:31,298
wouldn't I offered you the cut to grow

488
00:25:29,298 --> 00:25:35,778
at your place you'd only want to grow it

489
00:25:31,298 --> 00:25:40,069
how about GMO huh hello I do it GMO goes

490
00:25:35,778 --> 00:25:44,058
long it can go okay you know 70 80 days

491
00:25:40,069 --> 00:25:46,668
Oh commercial in you know commercial

492
00:25:44,058 --> 00:25:50,058
spot and the rec market you don't really

493
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:52,249
want to go 80 days you know it's uh it

494
00:25:50,058 --> 00:25:53,720
takes too long takes to turn and so you

495
00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:56,210
know what you're getting being charged

496
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,579
by landlords as far as prices per square

497
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:00,259
foot so it adds up so you want to

498
00:25:58,579 --> 00:26:02,989
utilize your space as much as possible

499
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:05,450
and having GMO go 80 days isn't

500
00:26:02,989 --> 00:26:09,798
something you want most strains what do

501
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:14,569
you guys pull 60 365 days oh honey

502
00:26:09,798 --> 00:26:17,450
restrains dirty ones yeah well you pull

503
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:19,668
that's 65 days yeah I think your brother

504
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:22,249
said you'd pull about 65 days most

505
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:23,749
places don't finish full term you know

506
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:25,669
we were talking about this before you

507
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:27,319
guys came about pulling early or whatnot

508
00:26:25,669 --> 00:26:30,019
and then we would keep in mind that this

509
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:33,019
is you guys this is for the legal market

510
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:35,058
you know and so time matters yeah

511
00:26:33,019 --> 00:26:38,388
someone at home may have time to do

512
00:26:35,058 --> 00:26:41,569
something you know there's more on them

513
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:44,959
they have run just to see I've gone 80

514
00:26:41,569 --> 00:26:47,239
days justice I'm out on I've gone 81

515
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:51,558
days and I did that on triangle mints

516
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:54,470
but we hit 4.3 alight you know so it's

517
00:26:51,558 --> 00:26:56,210
kind of worth it but you know you know

518
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,909
it's kind of worth it but you know you

519
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:01,639
get a lot of you know a lot of yield per

520
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:04,070
square foot is great if it's all buds

521
00:27:01,638 --> 00:27:06,319
that are like this and beautiful but if

522
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:09,048
it's buds that are like this and you're

523
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:10,939
having to labor-intensive you know

524
00:27:09,048 --> 00:27:13,940
having people trim it it's not

525
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:15,379
cost-effective you know less plants and

526
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,409
this is what we're gonna do in the next

527
00:27:15,378 --> 00:27:19,939
spot less plants per square foot like

528
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:20,780
these cut he's always growing nine

529
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,180
plants

530
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:25,639
always and he can get the same yield we

531
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:27,740
do in nine plant with nine plants it's

532
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,220
because you're using the whole 25 square

533
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,870
feet

534
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:33,049
and you're just letting the plants grow

535
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:34,699
about 260 inches which is five feet four

536
00:27:33,049 --> 00:27:37,309
and a half to five feet max and you

537
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:40,519
don't you have a to be buzzed rather

538
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:43,159
than a B and C buds and it makes it to

539
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:44,930
where you can actually trim it

540
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:48,980
streamlines everything there's less

541
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:51,920
labor to fucking de leaf there's you

542
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:53,839
know all kinds of benefits so we're

543
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:58,000
talking less playing count but in larger

544
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,000
larger plants yep giving them more room

545
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:06,619
its ratio and you can literally we don't

546
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:09,169
strip our plants two feet up like most

547
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:10,849
people do and strip it because all that

548
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:12,500
you can produce but through there but

549
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:15,549
the reason you can't is because you've

550
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,990
made the top canopy so fit clutter and

551
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:20,000
not allowing any light to come through

552
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:21,829
with too many plants people think too

553
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,990
many plants are gonna equal more money

554
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:29,689
more more pounds well we proven through

555
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:33,789
with three three rows or nine plants in

556
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:38,509
a 25 you can produce the same yield and

557
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:42,109
the better quality and less labor clear

558
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:44,329
believer that yeah was always more it

559
00:28:42,109 --> 00:28:46,429
can be it can be if you've done you take

560
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:48,589
care of and give them the asserts that

561
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:53,060
strain dependent like the Mac you could

562
00:28:48,589 --> 00:28:55,039
put you could put 12 plants you short

563
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:56,599
you 12 plans to Shorty's

564
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:00,200
you know you I really have to run the

565
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:02,809
number is like do a table or two and see

566
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,450
where you yield at and then do it three

567
00:29:02,809 --> 00:29:08,149
rows or nine plants or and then do the

568
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,740
twelve plants and run the numbers and

569
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,930
see where your yield is you'll probably

570
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:15,440
get more from the twelve Cushman's grow

571
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:18,610
is kind of like really narrow and sore I

572
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:21,140
don't know at least the ones we have but

573
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:24,019
you know just a strain dependent really

574
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:26,509
knowing the plan knowing yes there is we

575
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:29,150
grew it for so long it's like we knew

576
00:29:26,509 --> 00:29:31,069
that plant well we go triangle mints for

577
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:33,500
a year and it starts to the hunt

578
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:36,259

you legal shops okay so many illegal

608
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:23,630
grows for the black market you know

609
00:31:21,009 --> 00:31:25,279
people are probably taking rec market

610
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:29,000
weed and selling in the black market I

611
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,750
wouldn't be surprised you know it oh you

612
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,029
see it all time

613
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,619
it can happen it's you see those I've

614
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:36,619
ever seen it I've seen it in other

615
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:38,689
states I've never seen it local some

616
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:42,229
people don't believe in quality or

617
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:43,539
quantity you want quantity you know of

618
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:45,069
course

619
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:46,960
but people don't pay you what you're

620
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:50,710
with where your weed is worth a lot of

621
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:53,620
the times because they want to resell it

622
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:55,110
so they can make the project a lot of

623
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:59,319
people come in from all over the country

624
00:31:55,109 --> 00:32:01,719
want wanting to buy you know although

625
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:04,269
Cali weed cuz on the East Coast it's all

626
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,450
worth more you know it's all worth more

627
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:10,539
you know and California has the best

628
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:13,660
weed in the nation if not the planet you

629
00:32:10,539 --> 00:32:15,759
know it used to be you know Europe

630
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:18,910
Amsterdam Canada but I think it's

631
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:21,430
California now you know and og is really

632
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:23,529
spawned this whole thing western

633
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:25,900
cannabis you know OG created all this

634
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:28,089
and then cookies came along and that

635
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,920
what happened with cookies and now

636
00:32:28,089 --> 00:32:32,259
there's the next generation of who knows

637
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,120
what's gonna happen you know jungle boys

638
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:37,119
help push the whole brand a wedding cake

639
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:41,349
and spawn help see junkies it's it's

640
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:43,119
become a whole you know crazy industry

641
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:44,949
was just the beginning it's really

642
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:48,009
history if you think about it cannabis

643
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:50,019
United States and California we're at

644
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:52,750
the right place at the right time all of

645
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:55,539
us appreciate it right yeah we're

646
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:58,119
crossing over that line that so many

647
00:32:55,539 --> 00:33:00,639
people have been there thinking all the

648
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:02,439
alcohol company love trouble prohibition

649
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,770
what happened then you know as far as

650
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,000
you know all the companies that wanted

651
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:08,680
to stay in business that couldn't

652
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,480
because the bigger companies actually

653
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,430
bought them out or push them out it's

654
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,519
gonna happen in cannabis but if we can

655
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:17,620
all hold our you know be self-funded and

656
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,420
and ride it out as much as you can and

657
00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:22,209
do it for the love of the plant you know

658
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:24,519
and and and bring good cannabis because

659
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:26,980
a lot of us grew up on you know the

660
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:29,139
valley a lot of people did you know PG

661
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:31,750
ours phosp allowed you know to increase

662
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,650
yield and spray with micro butanol you

663
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,269
know any better

664
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,860
no one knew and and we're that

665
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:38,440
generation that has been smoking that

666
00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:40,119
we're gonna all suffer from it you know

667
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,769
this next generation of kids they're

668
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:43,299
gonna be smoking recreational weed guess

669
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,859
what they're not gonna do that shit

670
00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:46,539
they're not a part of that nope

671
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:49,569
you know and it sucks that we had to be

672
00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:51,450
a part of it but it's somehow benefiting

673
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:53,278
the next generation

674
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:55,288
for sure you know as I've caught me this

675
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:57,598
is all clean baby you know I would offer

676
00:33:55,288 --> 00:34:00,868
this to my niece if she smoked you know

677
00:33:57,598 --> 00:34:04,648
if she wanted to it's clean its we use

678
00:34:00,868 --> 00:34:06,778
salts and we use a very you know simple

679
00:34:04,648 --> 00:34:10,138
way of growing but it works for us

680
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:12,929
you know it's really experienced it

681
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:14,760
allows you to grow like this truly the

682
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:17,119
more you grow the more you understand of

683
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,419
strain you know the better can turn out

684
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,480
you know

685
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:25,668
are you making your own nutrient mixes

686
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,809
are you buying no we're buying HGB yeah

687
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:41,940
you said a lot of good things right

688
00:34:27,809 --> 00:34:44,278
there that's a new tree line yeah a lot

689
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:45,210
of great value a lot of people are using

690
00:34:44,278 --> 00:34:48,318
it um

691
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:51,990
these guys just start losing it yeah huh

692
00:34:48,318 --> 00:34:53,960
washing Washington Washington yeah a guy

693

he's uh he's there to help you he wants

695
00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:02,250
you succeed he knows how to grow is not

696
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:05,730
just like a guy that created nutrients

697
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:07,259
just just to you know to make money but

698
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:09,358

00:35:13,259 --> 00:35:16,619
knows how in and they don't solve

703
00:35:14,789 --> 00:35:18,359
everybody there's only one shop that I

704
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:21,150
know in Southern California actually

705
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:24,058
sells HGV and they want it that way they

706
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:25,250
want it limited you know but all the big

707
00:35:24,059 --> 00:35:29,609
girls are starting to use it

708
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:30,929
cookies trade craft farms you know it's

709
00:35:29,608 --> 00:35:32,400
catching on you know there's a lot of

710
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:35,068
people other names than the one I

711
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,028
mentioned yeah jbz you know they're all

712
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:42,239
using dr. green thumbs they all use it

713
00:35:39,028 --> 00:35:46,949
you know but it's a good nutrient a high

714
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:49,189
quality able chelated clean nutrient

715
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:50,689
that's basically what it comes down

716
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:53,929
that's one of the cleanest nutrient

717
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:57,349
lines I like it for Rocco a lot you see

718
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:59,719
the way the plants grow you don't see

719
00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:02,480
any deficiencies pretty stable it's

720
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:05,509
basically a tomato formula he told me it

721
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,250
just tweaked tomato formula that he says

722
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:09,410
those plants grow really is very similar

723
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:11,539
didn't you tell him it to me Joel at one

724
00:36:09,409 --> 00:36:13,129
time yeah yeah that's why we used to

725
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:15,559
always say we're growing tomatoes at the

726
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:18,858
hydros yeah yeah that's pretty much the

727
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:24,170
same yeah and I just saw it happen to me

728
00:36:18,858 --> 00:36:28,269
that's growing in their example I still

729
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:28,269
do weird rubbing followed all the time

730
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:38,298
Oh God yeah recently people used to use

731
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:41,058
dr. pepper in the formula you did you

732
00:36:38,298 --> 00:36:43,730
ever hear that tool no he told me about

733
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:48,019
that recently guys were using dr. pepper

734
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:49,909
but you know there was a old OG recipe

735
00:36:48,019 --> 00:36:52,940
that was going around that joel has been

736
00:36:49,909 --> 00:36:57,318
using for 20-plus years that really

737
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:59,420
I've grown HEV with OG with a CV and

738
00:36:57,318 --> 00:37:01,308
it's just not the same it's that

739
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,528
something about that formula when you

740
00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:06,500
have real OG from this valley just that

741
00:37:03,528 --> 00:37:08,449
we walk into a room and the whole room

742
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,460
smells it with 1/8 in your pocket you

743
00:37:08,449 --> 00:37:12,288
don't have weed like that anymore it's

744
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,690
nothing like that and I think those

745
00:37:12,289 --> 00:37:17,390
formulas really were like heat into

746
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:19,909
those specific strains cuz OG was grown

747
00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:29,358
for so long in this valley like 20 how

748
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:31,038
many years 25 years now 92 96 96 for

749
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:32,960
that they supposedly claimed that they

750
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:37,640
were growing something very similar in

751
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:40,010
the kilo type and in other places yeah I

752
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:42,858
heard that recently two bunkers

753
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:45,710
underground yeah

754
00:37:42,858 --> 00:37:49,730
because as Hindu Kush real OG Hindu Kush

755
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:53,539
an emerald triangle that's OG that a

756
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:56,960
back seat from that was found by people

757
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:58,910
that origins TK Martino's and that's how

758
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,559
the original og was found through back

759
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:02,119
seat that's what the TK was found to

760
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,310
trying to push

761
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:07,009

told it everyone was kind of cool

765
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:26,269
I've gotta that how it was a part of

766
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:29,059
that history you know yeah yeah we were

00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,680

795
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:46,550
twisted velvet rose a cross which is

796
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:48,409
purple like no dark dark like black

797
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:51,170
almost yeah when you put them next to

798
00:39:48,409 --> 00:39:53,869
this you're like whoa that's dark and

799
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:55,789
then I have mazes you live the rock and

800

00:39:58,429 --> 00:40:03,750
which is a mint chocolate chip and

803
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:08,220
kosher cook

804
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:10,260
I believe it has a lot to do with the

805
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:13,709
growing conditions how the farmer

806
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:16,740
treated it during the rain or not the

807
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:18,750
spraying of stuff completely has a big

808
00:40:16,739 --> 00:40:20,969
effect and they don't spray so that

809
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,980
helps preserve the turps and the heads

810
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:25,199
they're not getting melted with any oils

811
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:28,800
or alcohol or any kind of h2o2

812
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:31,439
which can change those things a lot of

813
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,039
these natural oils neem oil

814
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,590
citronella all these extra plants

815
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:42,150
extract oils that are organic and

816
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:43,740
they're good for you know pests because

817
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:45,599
they're organic they're they're made

818
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:47,989
there they're real organic they're made

819
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,420
from plants and trees but these plants

820
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:53,399
have natural but you know Terps that

821
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:56,490
they're using and they're spraying them

822
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:58,619
so it then it changes the profile and

823
00:40:56,489 --> 00:41:01,229
then when you actually extract it with

824
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:03,059
ice water and hash and you do that you

825
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:06,420
start smelling those other smells come

826
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:09,090
through and those things change the

827
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:11,309
color so there's a lot of times where

828
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:13,140
after you've done the work you get it to

829
00:41:11,309 --> 00:41:15,599
the press it carries the next day and

830
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:19,079
then you're just like I smell this

831
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,730
ingredient you know and it's it's it's

832
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:22,259
it's a it's like a palette it's like

833
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:24,269
something that you have to acquire

834
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,520
because there's a lot of times where I

835
00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:28,739
would blame myself thinking that I did a

836
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:30,360
bad job on the wash I beat it up too

837
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:33,989
much there maybe I did something wrong

838
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:36,120
and then we started whenever I would

839
00:41:33,989 --> 00:41:39,149
notice that we started not washing the

840
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:41,039
full batches do a small test batch dry

841
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:43,050
it press it and see what it looks like

842
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:45,150
if we didn't like what it looked like

843
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:49,170
then we would send it off to a pho

844
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:51,090
processing and then sometimes the

845
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:53,190
product would come out beautiful and

846
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,480
then there's other times where they

847
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:56,369
would send it back and they say there's

848
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,490
nothing we can do with it and that's

849
00:41:56,369 --> 00:42:02,279
what I'm like okay it wasn't me you know

850
00:41:59,489 --> 00:42:04,109
it was the material so growing

851
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,640
conditions how you stored it what you

852
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:11,430
sprayed on it all of those things and

853
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:13,049
you know how affect that end result so

854
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:15,210
we were talking about

855
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:18,230
if sourcing and how important that was

856
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:20,519
and you know saves you time and money

857
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:22,440
especially if someone wants to try to do

858
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:25,679
this there's been a lot of material that

859
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,590
we processed that we can't sell and it's

860
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:30,629
just part of the the the risk factor

861
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:32,880
that you take it's an education it's an

862
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:35,400
education for one that's the biggest

863
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,320
benefit that we can put on it versus

864
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,420
saying it's a total loss it's the

865
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:43,080
experience that we acquired that's now

866
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:43,800
in our head forever so I enjoy that

867
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:45,960
process

868
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,300
I don't enjoy taking the loss but you

869
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,220
you have to to acquire that knowledge

870
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:51,960
yeah if you were able to go to the

871
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:54,569
facility of their processing at and

872
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,269
still show them exactly how you process

873
00:42:54,570 --> 00:43:00,150
it to not beat it up and handle it with

874
00:42:57,269 --> 00:43:02,070
care whatever they did that before that

875
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:04,289
would have an effect on the flower

876
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:13,620
around the house in the long run yeah

877
00:43:04,289 --> 00:43:16,699
you know if you're got a close

878
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:21,059
relationship with the the the the farmer

879
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:22,799
there I'm able to show him what's

880
00:43:21,059 --> 00:43:25,619
happening at the end and then he's able

881
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,600
to go and make changes and we didn't do

882
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:29,130
this the first day you know we've been

883
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:33,179
making rasam together for a couple of

884
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:33,869
years now - and we didn't produce stuff

885
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:36,239
like this

886
00:43:33,869 --> 00:43:39,089
we used to spray organics up until a

887
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,949
certain week and those are the things

888
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:43,230
that we loved so you learned through

889
00:43:40,949 --> 00:43:45,809
that yeah it's an evolving process

890
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:47,880
someone was using plant therapy we found

891
00:43:45,809 --> 00:43:50,759
out those using plant theory which is

892
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,010
totally fine to use it's just that that

893
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,260
has an effect on how the outcome of the

894
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:57,090
rosin that's what we kind of pinpointed

895
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:58,860
it to when it was turning out like now

896
00:43:57,090 --> 00:44:01,410
you had mentioned that before right yeah

897
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:03,660
you know dark dark rosin isn't

898
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:06,659
necessarily bad rosin it's just that the

899
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:08,940
consumer wants white pretty rosin it's

900
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:12,929
are the truth I like the color too it's

901
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:15,599
nicer but hash is hash taste is worth

902
00:44:12,929 --> 00:44:17,699
that and you know the darker sign is

903
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:21,110
just too light

904
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:23,489
yeah and oxygen you know simple basic

905
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:26,180
natural things these flowers are

906
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:29,479
naturally going to oxidize get

907
00:44:26,179 --> 00:44:31,159
yellow-brown just because like heat any

908
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,710
temperature is he anything over say

909
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:35,899
forty degrees is warm

910
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:36,619
that's why humidifying my where I store

911
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,010
all my weed

912
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:44,029
i-ight humidify the room I have been as

913
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:46,040
of recently to what anywhere from like

914
00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:48,470
fifty to sixty I want a little more

915
00:44:46,039 --> 00:44:50,989
humid because the valleys kind of dry

916
00:44:48,469 --> 00:44:52,939
this time of year cuz really windy you

917
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:54,589
guys don't really know but I everyday I

918
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,090
walk into a growing room we're in her

919
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:59,090
thirties right now I keep all my

920
00:44:56,090 --> 00:45:04,309
genetics at my house so I basically I'm

921
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:05,690
around at 24/7 I can't escape it there's

922
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:07,639
nothing like living in with it and

923
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:10,070
growing growing growing there you know

924
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:11,539
it's like it's the worst it can be it

925
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:14,300
can be nice you can never get a which

926
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:16,789
guy does you know you know one of these

927
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:22,370
guys do or two of them have many many

928
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:24,529
times you know mostly we all started

929
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:28,210
indoors in homes most of all of us yeah

930
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:32,840
you know from a1 lighter you know yeah

931
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:35,929
so now a four hundred lighter my first

932
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:37,610
grow was in a PC grow box remember

933
00:45:35,929 --> 00:45:39,109
though I remember and you dispensary had

934
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:42,470
a dispensary in this valley that was

935
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:44,870
back in those seven yeah yeah yeah yeah

936
00:45:42,469 --> 00:45:48,679
so we were just at this event a San

937
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:51,559
Diego it was all about indoor energy

938
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:55,159
saving with all the total focus on and

939
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:59,150
this vertical grow rooms from back east

940
00:45:55,159 --> 00:46:01,639
you know like like HVAC experts were

941
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:03,559
there lighting experts from fluence and

942
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:04,309
bios and the other lighting companies

943
00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:09,679
were there

944
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:11,809
they're water experts yeah we're going

945
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:14,809
led in our bedroom we have a double

946
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:16,759
stacked led room with a 160 to 200

947
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:18,619
lights in there right what kind of

948
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,270
lights we're actually going with a

949
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:22,880
company you've probably never heard of

950
00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:25,639
it's called signify okay there are the

951
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,920
ones if you remember Phillips they did

952
00:46:25,639 --> 00:46:30,769
Phillips I'm they were at the conference

953
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:34,389
MGM J bisque oh no no no this guy down

954
00:46:30,769 --> 00:46:36,820
in San Diego yeah so so basically he's

955
00:46:34,389 --> 00:46:39,379
signifies a Phillips company and

956
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:41,300
Phillips has been making lights for

957
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,490
every are making components for everyone

958
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:46,100
I insist

959
00:46:43,489 --> 00:46:48,589
he aligning and other other companies

960
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:51,860
that they've been making components for

961
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:53,510
and they waited till the all these

962
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:55,309
lights came out they took all the lights

963
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:59,420
they are indeed them with a specialist

964
00:46:55,309 --> 00:47:01,880
from Holland and they they put together

965
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:03,710
they believe a better light and what I

966
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:07,010
like about this company is that it comes

967
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:09,320
with a specialist for 30 days he teaches

968
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:11,180
us how to grow no lighting company that

969
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,580
ever gives you a light says here I'm

970
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:18,829
gonna sell you a light by that's all

971
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:22,099
they do that's all I do so they do they

972
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:24,079
did that for us we wanted to go you give

973
00:47:22,099 --> 00:47:27,170
him a square feet of the of the room and

974
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:30,440
the plan of your facility and todaya

975
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:32,240
they map it out per square foot kavita

976
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,869
was a hundred and eight lights for a

977
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:44,239
room that we had Lux was a 81 so we went

978
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:47,449
with 81 lights per room but you know we

979
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:52,909
wanted to go with signify just because

980
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:55,819
it came with someone of course yeah

981
00:47:52,909 --> 00:47:59,929
power power of course you know a power

982
00:47:55,820 --> 00:48:02,480
cost in LA County astronomical you know

983
00:47:59,929 --> 00:48:04,099
a hundred lighter is you know it's

984
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,050
twelve thirteen fourteen thousand

985
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:08,150
dollars a month you know can you imagine

986
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:09,920
when it cost for you know hundreds and

987
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:11,990
hundreds of lights these guys have 550

988
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,510
lights that's a flower you're not even

989
00:48:11,989 --> 00:48:16,969
you're not even talking about veg they

990
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:18,080
have another I'm gonna how nursery I'm

991
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:20,599
gonna have toll of

992
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:23,090
800 lights you know that's a lot of

993
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:26,000
power 3000 amps we have a pole dropped

994
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:28,250
out front so it's a lot it's uh it's

995
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,010
probably risk at a certain time where no

996
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:34,039
one is actually doing well so I'm taking

997
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:36,110
a big risk here we're all self funded so

998
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:49,369
it's my brother my sister I and that's

999
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:51,349
it yeah they take that you basically you

1000
00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:54,440
know you punch a hole in your roof and

1001
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:56,360
you bring I don't like you know I I have

1002
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:58,400
a construction company that's basically

1003
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:59,809
punched a hole in the ceiling up let's

1004
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,869
say you want you have a drop ceiling

1005
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:04,789
right here and then the end up is

1006
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:07,309
inclined you could put a hole in it and

1007
00:49:04,789 --> 00:49:09,079
run a tube like just a dyke a mirror top

1008
00:49:07,309 --> 00:49:10,909
terrace cool a duck with reflective

1009
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:12,829
material like mylar inside they run it

1010
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:17,799
down and you can actually get sunlight

1011
00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:17,799
that way yeah I've actually put one in

1012
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:30,200
was to this guy Jonathan cachet he did a

1013
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:33,260
proof of concept where he he in Sonoma

1014
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:38,059
he had an indoor grow entirely with

1015
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:40,310
those lights solar tubes yeah just son I

1016
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:48,739
wonder if you had enough hours to keep

1017
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:51,019
it to keep the lights cycle but uh but

1018
00:49:48,739 --> 00:49:52,819
in conjunction with the solar tubes like

1019
00:49:51,019 --> 00:49:55,219
baby why don't you just do a glass out

1020
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:57,380
of glass roof isn't there like a glass

1021
00:49:55,219 --> 00:49:59,959
roof spot somewhere back down like near

1022
00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:03,079
Palomar like the ballon somewhere like

1023
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:04,880
100 there's a lot of places there's

1024
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:06,409
thousands and thousands of lights going

1025
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,450
up right now I know someone that just

1026
00:50:06,409 --> 00:50:11,289
finished two thousand lights and they're

1027
00:50:08,449 --> 00:50:14,509
doing another two thousand and on Alonso

1028
00:50:11,289 --> 00:50:16,699
too much these guys these guys just got

1029
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:19,580
a 48 thousand square foot placing on a

1030
00:50:16,699 --> 00:50:22,329
lawn so that's gonna be you know seven

1031
00:50:19,579 --> 00:50:26,389
eight hundred lights who's that you know

1032
00:50:22,329 --> 00:50:30,199
his brother Mike is partners with the

1033
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:35,259
surge in the Maywood cookies

1034
00:50:30,199 --> 00:50:38,299
yeah so we're all good friends so they

1035
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:41,210
it's good to be in a group of people

1036
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:44,930
that have the same drive and passion as

1037
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:49,179
your own to bounce ideas off to go and

1038
00:50:44,929 --> 00:50:52,909
ask them what they think an experience

1039
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:55,190
palettes that these guys have is would

1040
00:50:52,909 --> 00:50:57,549
you throw us in the room together the

1041
00:50:55,190 --> 00:51:00,860
amount of weed that we have consumed is

1042
00:50:57,550 --> 00:51:03,830
is uncountable you know so that

1043
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:05,870
knowledge is what the corporate cannabis

1044
00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:09,049
doesn't have when they come from a

1045
00:51:05,869 --> 00:51:11,299
different business background so that's

1046
00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:13,670
something that we try to choose cherish

1047
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,590
and keep each other and help each other

1048
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:17,659
we're not in it for four weeks of every

1049
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:19,940
Joe hunt anyway you know they pick it

1050
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:22,039
how would they pick weed based on weight

1051
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:24,470
it's difficult I think they sell weight

1052
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:27,699
by corporate weed and like when you're

1053
00:51:24,469 --> 00:51:33,109
scaling out at what flinches like does

1054
00:51:27,699 --> 00:51:43,639
crap we become scale up to something

1055
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:45,740
else you know it's the only one way to

1056
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:47,239
find out if you look at Samuel Adams

1057
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:49,729
they're still in business

1058
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:53,239
you know Firestone they're a family

1059
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:56,690
company still so you know hog and dogs

1060
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:57,739
Ben and Jerry's you know those are those

1061
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:58,909
are companies are still being around

1062
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,799
we're not gonna say we're ain't gonna be

1063
00:51:58,909 --> 00:52:02,869
anywhere near those those companies but

1064
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,750
uh we just want to produce craft

1065
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:08,659
cannabis and and just have a taste room

1066
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:11,300
at 27,000 court facilities in the in the

1067
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:13,789
grand scope of what throwing ball come

1068
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:17,360
is tiny compared to very big facility

1069
00:52:13,789 --> 00:52:20,469
uh-huh where no more no more no more

1070
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:23,180
California we have licensing up there

1071
00:52:20,469 --> 00:52:24,529
these guys have licensing in Maywood and

1072
00:52:23,179 --> 00:52:30,109
they will have licensing and all the

1073
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:32,080
lawn so pretty soon it's small compared

1074
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:34,490
to these big huge you know huge

1075
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:38,960
facilities they're talking 2,000 lights

1076
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:41,209
so the bet the fact that these guys have

1077
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,309
been growing for so long from a little

1078
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:47,570
tiny room to more

1079
00:52:43,309 --> 00:52:50,210
to a nice decent-sized facility but the

1080
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:52,640
same concepts are being applied the same

1081
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:55,460
knowledge that you've acquired is being

1082
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:58,639
transitioned so it's not like this is

1083
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:00,740
gross sweet and that's the challenge

1084
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:02,750
that a lot of the corporate business are

1085
00:53:00,739 --> 00:53:06,969
gonna have they haven't had the failures

1086
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:09,860
or the the losses that we have taken

1087
00:53:06,969 --> 00:53:15,319
we're a strong crew of people that that

1088
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:18,800
we don't take losses lightly we've all

1089
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:21,769
lost big big ways and we've picked our

1090
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:23,330
self up and and rebuilt ourselves

1091
00:53:21,769 --> 00:53:24,920
the only way my dad used to say the only

1092
00:53:23,329 --> 00:53:27,679
way to learn how to make money is to

1093
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:31,220
lose money you know money don't make

1094
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:33,379
money yeah it's kind of true loss alone

1095
00:53:31,219 --> 00:53:35,719
all of us has been robbed these guys he

1096
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:37,940
had a facility were first harvest they

1097
00:53:35,719 --> 00:53:41,209
stole everything very first he'd never

1098
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:43,340
even got a run out of it strong yeah

1099
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:45,860
they fucked him up I was so pissed I was

1100
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:48,530
hoping so well for him you know he

1101
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:50,090
worked at a you know a famous farm we're

1102
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:51,800
not gonna say the name right now and you

1103
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:53,660
know he turned around their whole

1104
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:56,269
company and propagation and clones

1105
00:53:53,659 --> 00:53:58,549
because really to produce craft cannabis

1106
00:53:56,269 --> 00:54:01,309
I'm gonna tell you this right now if mom

1107
00:53:58,550 --> 00:54:03,410
stock and veg is by far the most

1108
00:54:01,309 --> 00:54:06,349
important which is always undersized in

1109
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:08,420
most facilities we fortunately over

1110
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:11,210
sized it you know we went less on the

1111
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:14,510
flower rooms but more on mom space and

1112
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:16,670
veg space so we could produce you know

1113
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:19,280
think about if you took way more clones

1114
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:20,809
and you needed and way more veg plants

1115
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,910
and you needed and you could put the

1116
00:54:20,809 --> 00:54:25,190
best of the best the most elite plants

1117
00:54:22,909 --> 00:54:27,699
in there you'd crush there'd be no

1118
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:30,920
reason why you wouldn't ever you know

1119
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:33,829
you know precision watering you know way

1120
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:36,650
we water now these days is the way

1121
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:39,289
athletes kind of eat you know they eat

1122
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:43,099
ten times a day five times a small meals

1123
00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:45,019
you know and look look how they look

1124
00:54:43,099 --> 00:54:48,409
they're metallo was high and we can feed

1125
00:54:45,019 --> 00:54:50,989
plants in dried ec I just heard today my

1126
00:54:48,409 --> 00:54:53,809
buddy Ramsey says he he goes in his

1127
00:54:50,989 --> 00:54:56,149
medium up to 12 EC I don't know if you

1128
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:57,199
know what that is 12 you see it's 12

1129
00:54:56,150 --> 00:55:00,769
times 500

1130
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:04,969
12 times 7 or 7 times 700 so that how

1131
00:55:00,769 --> 00:55:08,269
much ppm is it would be you know writing

1132
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:14,119
writing the medium and base and fuck

1133
00:55:08,269 --> 00:55:19,610
what's going on back there they're

1134
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:21,619
playing this peeking tickle know when

1135
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:24,730
you were talking about athletes huh

1136
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:28,690
when you're talking about athletes

1137
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:30,110
paschal eats that's what we're growing

1138
00:55:28,690 --> 00:55:33,950
at leats

1139
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:37,340
if we were going to say that we're we're

1140
00:55:33,949 --> 00:55:40,809
hash guys these guys are definitely soft

1141
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:43,100
guys yeah yes back there on the opposite

1142
00:55:40,809 --> 00:55:45,259
that's probably why they're back there

1143
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:47,779
and not on camera because they're there

1144
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:49,730

1146
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:54,320
dabbing since we've been here

1147
00:55:51,889 --> 00:55:55,579
the only reason they stopped is there

1148
00:55:54,320 --> 00:56:05,110
was when we first came and they didn't

1149
00:55:55,579 --> 00:56:05,110
have a rig you don't jab la family farms

1150
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:17,210
[Music]

1151
00:56:08,409 --> 00:56:20,149
that we got more yeah well these guys

1152
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:23,030
are the guys I come to to really run

1153
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:26,990
flavors through if it's all if I could

1154
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:30,620
find a way companies research and

1155
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:32,389
development he could really do tests for

1156
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:35,150
people he has the best palate everyone I

1157
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:37,159
ever met he he can spot thing is second

1158
00:56:35,150 --> 00:56:39,320
and he grows we burned from him how to

1159
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:41,690
grow you know it all come so far I'm

1160
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:45,039
second in line huh I'm second in line

1161
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:45,039
we're having the best palate

1162
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:52,739
you're not even old enough still good

1163
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:56,159
enough I do gotta give it to you got the

1164
00:56:52,739 --> 00:56:58,739
visual perspective that we don't have no

1165
00:56:56,159 --> 00:57:00,599
no we have it no he's get these in shops

1166
00:56:58,739 --> 00:57:03,899
more that he's seen more shops and I've

1167
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:12,569
ever seen he so you know girl I've seen

1168
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:13,920
his weight he grows closer to everybody

1169
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:15,840
I know girl only when he comes to my

1170
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,119
house come on

1171
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:20,130
well at least he's seen a lot of stuff

1172
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:22,829
in the stores cuz he's definitely been

1173
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:25,769
to a lot more retail outlets he's seen

1174
00:57:22,829 --> 00:57:30,299
more brands probably smelled and smoked

1175
00:57:25,769 --> 00:57:32,969
more brands than I have because most of

1176
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:34,920
us out there don't do this for me you

1177
00:57:32,969 --> 00:57:36,779
know I didn't say was it you know what

1178
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:39,900
the hardest thing than the rest market

1179
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:42,390
is is consistency it's like you want

1180
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:44,639
someone to open up I'll just use Gary

1181
00:57:42,389 --> 00:57:47,429
Payton as an example cuz I've seen some

1182
00:57:44,639 --> 00:57:49,109
really good Gary Payton you know snowmen

1183
00:57:47,429 --> 00:57:50,849
and the wire that's the cross you want

1184
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:52,680
someone to basically open up the Gary

1185
00:57:50,849 --> 00:57:54,989
paint and go you know what this is dank

1186
00:57:52,679 --> 00:57:56,849
and then six months a year later if

1187
00:57:54,989 --> 00:57:58,589
they're still growing it opening again

1188
00:57:56,849 --> 00:58:01,589
and go like you know what this is just

1189
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:03,420
as good or better that's what you want

1190
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:05,640
that's how you get people to go you know

1191
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:07,860
what I have respect for that brand still

1192
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:09,869
good it's it's right it's definitely

1193
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:11,430
that's how you get a customer like

1194
00:58:09,869 --> 00:58:16,349
because we're all consumers it's a

1195
00:58:11,429 --> 00:58:18,750
harvest we've all bought weed yeah

1196
00:58:16,349 --> 00:58:21,839
that's key and people some people think

1197
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:23,309
you guys have an SOP and be done we have

1198
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:26,910
an SOP but it doesn't it doesn't

1199
00:58:23,309 --> 00:58:28,769
translate to everybody's grow just

1200
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:30,989
because of the SOP that they're using

1201
00:58:28,769 --> 00:58:32,639
you know what I mean so it's like yeah

1202
00:58:30,989 --> 00:58:34,679
we have enough but there's so many

1203
00:58:32,639 --> 00:58:36,900
details that go into this one you can't

1204
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:39,059
fully transfer it over unless you built

1205
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:40,289
an exact duplicate yeah but you know

1206
00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:41,670
what a lot of important things like

1207
00:58:40,289 --> 00:58:44,159
plant health is one of the most

1208
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:46,639
important things in in a grow if not the

1209
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:49,440
most important like I said moms and veg

1210
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:50,879
without that your facility for flowering

1211
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,519
it's not going to come out with flower

1212
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,200
like that we turn over mom's every we

1213
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:57,338
take cuttings three times and the moms

1214
00:58:55,199 --> 00:59:00,248
go away the most we keep a mom is like

1215
00:58:57,338 --> 00:59:02,139
months that's it the healthier the mom

1216
00:59:00,248 --> 00:59:05,379
the more you replenish them and then we

1217
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:08,828
call it every stage which means when we

1218
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:11,588
take cuts for 300 plants we take 500

1219
00:59:08,829 --> 00:59:14,528
cuts we take way more and the ones that

1220
00:59:11,588 --> 00:59:16,389
usually root first we separate because

1221
00:59:14,528 --> 00:59:18,278
those for sure most likely are going to

1222
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:19,989
end up in the flower room most nine

1223
00:59:18,278 --> 00:59:21,728
times out of ten unless you fuck up

1224
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:23,588
that's just gonna end up in the flower

1225
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:25,629
room and you're gonna you're gonna kill

1226
00:59:23,588 --> 00:59:27,759
it with that so we separate the ones

1227
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:31,539
that root first runners front runners

1228
00:59:27,759 --> 00:59:33,670
basically separate those and that's the

1229
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:35,769
key to success most likely if you're

1230
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:37,659
calling for moms 1 through 10 if you're

1231
00:59:35,768 --> 00:59:39,968
calling for moms you're taking from the

1232
00:59:37,659 --> 00:59:42,129
healthiest mom in that mom room the best

1233
00:59:39,969 --> 00:59:43,929
one you're taking only cuts from that

1234
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:46,420
one and then the cuts that come off of

1235
00:59:43,929 --> 00:59:49,118
that that route first or the best cuts

1236
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:50,170
that go on to be moms only the best of

1237
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,509
the best at come on you're not gonna

1238
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:54,099
take an unhealthy mom and take cuts from

1239
00:59:52,509 --> 00:59:55,960
a whole room no you're gonna take from

1240
00:59:54,099 --> 00:59:58,450
the healthiest mom that's the way we do

1241
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:00,429
it honestly that's the way I do it in my

1242
00:59:58,449 --> 01:00:02,978
house that's the way my sister Jackie

1243
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:04,868
does it live taller it's like that's and

1244
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:07,149
again that took how many years you guys

1245
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:08,710
are doing it so to over 20 years I give

1246
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:10,539
you our secret you know one of our

1247
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:14,019
secrets but you know I can write down

1248
01:00:10,539 --> 01:00:15,609
exactly what to do like like a chef you

1249
01:00:14,018 --> 01:00:18,399
can give you a recipe and go here you go

1250
01:00:15,608 --> 01:00:20,828
but it will not translate right roll the

1251
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:23,200
magic go ahead it's the experience it's

1252
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:24,910
it's trial and error it's like you have

1253
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:27,068
to have that experience to be able to

1254
01:00:24,909 --> 01:00:29,228
understand it like what the room may

1255
01:00:27,068 --> 01:00:30,909
need but once you figure out a strain

1256
01:00:29,228 --> 01:00:33,338
you can dial things in and kind of

1257
01:00:30,909 --> 01:00:34,358
almost walk away because it's just like

1258
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:36,219
clockwork

1259
01:00:34,358 --> 01:00:38,440
it's like BAM I got to figure it out I

1260
01:00:36,219 --> 01:00:39,880
got her figured out yeah she ran into

1261
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:43,150
with me you know two or three times

1262
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:48,329
no I'm talking 10 years 15 years yeah

1263
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:52,088
yeah try keeping a cut alive since

1264
01:00:48,329 --> 01:00:54,309
2000-2001 I've had the og cut since then

1265
01:00:52,088 --> 01:00:56,650
and I've kept we've captured alive we

1266
01:00:54,309 --> 01:00:58,569
have me growing the whole time so think

1267
01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:00,460
about even when we weren't growing guess

1268
01:00:58,568 --> 01:01:01,449
what we still kept that bitch alive

1269
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:03,818
who's the mama

1270
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:05,618
we always had moms of it so we've always

1271
01:01:03,818 --> 01:01:08,558
kept it alive we've actually recently

1272
01:01:05,619 --> 01:01:09,740
tissue cultured her and gave her to Josh

1273
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:11,600
D farms to ax

1274
01:01:09,739 --> 01:01:18,769
run in a greenhouse and see how they run

1275
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:19,730
you know so that's a houseplant alive

1276
01:01:18,769 --> 01:01:21,440
for a year

1277
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:23,329
yeah truck keeping house is the one

1278
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:26,240
they're all here and then come to me you

1279
01:01:23,329 --> 01:01:28,730
want to be a grower for a year

1280
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:30,649
grow it be successful and then come back

1281
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:32,150
and we'll talk about going to be an

1282
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:35,090
annual you know it's supposed to be dad

1283
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:36,800
right was to live one year yeah my

1284
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:38,450
brother says that to people

1285
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,740
I'm keeping my soil alive for three

1286
01:01:38,449 --> 01:01:41,089
years and that's an accomplishment I'm

1287
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:42,589
not keeping a plant I live for three

1288
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:44,360
years that's a hold you got two jobs now

1289
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:47,119
that's crazy yeah yeah you're feeding

1290
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:53,110
your soil and your plants right two jobs

1291
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:56,390
mutton that's crazy that's awesome

1292
01:01:53,110 --> 01:02:02,960
someone asked what breeders your respect

1293
01:01:56,389 --> 01:02:05,989
I respect all of them I respect all of

1294
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:08,210
them there's a lot every single one you

1295
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:11,059
know a lot that might be known as like

1296
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:13,699
pollen chuckers I just take a mound you

1297
01:02:11,059 --> 01:02:15,590
know just chuck it on a female and find

1298
01:02:13,699 --> 01:02:17,629
seeds and sell them and not even test

1299
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:19,700
them you know there could be hermès

1300
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:23,450
there could be all kinds of problems you

1301
01:02:19,699 --> 01:02:24,980
know mutants you know there could be all

1302
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:27,889
kinds of issues they not they might not

1303
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:29,900
germinate you know you might get more

1304
01:02:27,889 --> 01:02:32,480
males you know you might pick a male

1305
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:36,800
that you pollinate with a female and it

1306
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:38,869
might produce 40 percent males or forty

1307
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:42,320
percent females you might get a high two

1308
01:02:38,869 --> 01:02:45,380
male to female ratio so there's a lot of

1309
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:48,080
a lot of thought you know breeding is

1310
01:02:45,380 --> 01:02:50,300
really in the life of breeding cannabis

1311
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:53,929
is very short people I'm a breeding

1312
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:55,910
cannabis for like you know 50 70 years I

1313
01:02:53,929 --> 01:02:57,618
don't think so how people started like

1314
01:02:55,909 --> 01:03:00,409
in the late eighties in Humboldt County

1315
01:02:57,619 --> 01:03:02,809
started so where did it start breeding

1316
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:04,819
did you see North Pond or pop or maybe

1317
01:03:02,809 --> 01:03:07,009
in Afghanistan I mean people breeding

1318
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:09,440
them that happen actually natural

1319
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:11,750
breeding you BRE with land race to that

1320
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,059
did like the Mac anything eyes bred with

1321
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:17,630
the Mac which has land race in it turns

1322
01:03:14,059 --> 01:03:21,529
out that that trade rest wrong train

1323
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:23,250
wreck kind of hazy kind of smell because

1324
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:25,980
those are strains that survive

1325
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:27,570
the environments in real life and

1326
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:29,429
actually traveled in the wind and made

1327
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:31,289
their crossbreeding and they owned that

1328
01:03:29,429 --> 01:03:32,940
land that's why they call me land races

1329
01:03:31,289 --> 01:03:35,579
those are the ones that that came from

1330
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:37,079
those regions and they're strong you

1331
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:39,829
know there's strong genetics and when

1332
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:42,690
you get those crossed in they stand out

1333
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:45,179
well I like the genetics breeders I like

1334
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:47,490

done the purple punch relentless

1338
01:03:52,409 --> 01:03:59,579
recently well symbiotic actually took

1339
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:01,710

really they give them oh that if you

1554
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:39,500
ever go to green fire genetics and you

1555
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:42,680
see their list of strains they give you

1556
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:45,800
such a detailed detailed of what they

1557
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:49,039
did what they cross what mail they use

1558
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:51,289
from what line and as a seed collector I

1559
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:53,630
really enjoy seeing that because they

1560
01:17:51,289 --> 01:17:54,829
really give you because you know all the

1561
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:56,659
seed packs we buy to give you no

1562
01:17:54,829 --> 01:17:58,640
information that's that's key when

1563
01:17:56,659 --> 01:18:01,399
you're when you're buying genetics that

1564
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:03,590
cost $200 and you're hoping that there's

1565
01:18:01,399 --> 01:18:06,439
good work that's behind it a good

1566
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:08,600
breeding practices they use good stable

1567
01:18:06,439 --> 01:18:10,129
stock is it a what kind of mail do they

1568
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:12,110
use you know breeding is all

1569
01:18:10,130 --> 01:18:14,779
interpretation really on on what you

1570
01:18:12,109 --> 01:18:16,729
like like a mail do you want a mail that

1571
01:18:14,779 --> 01:18:19,309
short stout do you want to mail that's

1572
01:18:16,729 --> 01:18:22,099
vigorous tall and skinny you know it's

1573
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:23,960
based on traits you know that's why I

1574
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:26,630
got a lot of people pick different males

1575
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:29,149
and they'll use pollen from each male so

1576
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:31,609
he hit one of each one of their females

1577
01:18:29,149 --> 01:18:33,649
so those still the label everything is a

1578
01:18:31,609 --> 01:18:35,569
lot of work and you need a lot of space

1579
01:18:33,649 --> 01:18:38,689
the place they're building you're

1580
01:18:35,569 --> 01:18:46,159
bringing a breeding area aren't you up

1581
01:18:38,689 --> 01:18:48,289

white ash I'm like why - disease yeah

1685
01:24:05,829 --> 01:24:08,670
what do you guys think about why - does

1686
01:24:07,239 --> 01:24:12,069
that even matter

1687
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:15,940
say what why - does it even matter cuz

1688
01:24:12,069 --> 01:24:18,069
coma is a speaking about coma come was a

1689
01:24:15,939 --> 01:24:20,739
big believer that why - theory is

1690
01:24:18,069 --> 01:24:22,659
bullshit so what do you guys think about

1691
01:24:20,739 --> 01:24:24,489
that because they'll just be real

1692
01:24:22,659 --> 01:24:28,420
something can be clean and can be in

1693
01:24:24,489 --> 01:24:30,279
soil supposedly all organic living soil

1694
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:33,730
the whole nine it could be a burn black

1695
01:24:30,279 --> 01:24:36,009
I mean there's different takes on it

1696
01:24:33,729 --> 01:24:38,559
we've heard that scientifically it could

1697
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:40,930
be one of the elements that's in the

1698
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:42,700
nutrients that burns that way we've

1699
01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:46,060
heard what if there's a nutrient that

1700
01:24:42,699 --> 01:24:48,039
it's it is living soil all organic and

1701
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:50,650
the silver is black well you can't flush

1702
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:54,850
living soil but it's supposed to be the

1703
01:24:50,649 --> 01:24:57,309
most organic way why - I'm just saying

1704
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:58,930
this the the soil sulfur has too much of

1705
01:24:57,310 --> 01:25:02,260
something though it could produce too

1706
01:24:58,930 --> 01:25:03,820
much of one thing the soil or soil I

1707
01:25:02,260 --> 01:25:05,949
definitely understand that part but my

1708
01:25:03,819 --> 01:25:08,259
question would be to you guys and does

1709
01:25:05,949 --> 01:25:11,319
that necessarily make the whole why -

1710
01:25:08,260 --> 01:25:14,829
theory bullshit that's all I'm sayin I

1711
01:25:11,319 --> 01:25:17,409
think that theory because then I don't

1712
01:25:14,829 --> 01:25:20,220
know I can't say all bomb but I've had

1713
01:25:17,409 --> 01:25:23,050
is better why - you know have you know

1714
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:25,930
when you burn when you roll a joint in a

1715
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:27,699
trim room when it's not fully sure - yes

1716
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:29,950
that's what I'm about to say you burn

1717
01:25:27,699 --> 01:25:32,590
that that shit will burn black no matter

1718
01:25:29,949 --> 01:25:34,569
what after cares even right now this is

1719
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:36,460
only like a week and a half old it's

1720
01:25:34,569 --> 01:25:38,500
burning wider and wider and wider the

1721
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:39,760
more the better it cures and drier yeah

1722
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:42,189
that's fair enough

1723
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:44,440
I agree to some well bakoma it's

1724
01:25:42,189 --> 01:25:46,869
becoming a super-hype right now what

1725
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:49,089
we're like the whole white ash I would

1726
01:25:46,869 --> 01:25:50,029
agree - because think about cigarettes

1727
01:25:49,090 --> 01:25:53,239
okay thanks

1728
01:25:50,029 --> 01:25:55,579
chemicals into cigarettes to make them

1729
01:25:53,239 --> 01:25:58,399
light yes I'm not going to judge your

1730
01:25:55,579 --> 01:26:03,039
weed on yeah do people like the light

1731
01:25:58,399 --> 01:26:05,239
colors yes that's crazy

1732
01:26:03,039 --> 01:26:08,890
that's like judging that's like judging

1733
01:26:05,239 --> 01:26:11,149
your extractions on color you know why

1734
01:26:08,890 --> 01:26:13,460
that's how they judge it like I know

1735
01:26:11,149 --> 01:26:15,920
people same thing grate up roll up a

1736
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:17,270
joint they'll sit there they'll smoke it

1737
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:19,039
and they'll start looking at that right

1738
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:20,810
and they're not they're not tasting

1739
01:26:19,039 --> 01:26:24,250
their palate they're not they're not

1740
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:24,250
looking at all the other important fact

1741
01:26:26,710 --> 01:26:31,939
it's crazy how people are judging just

1742
01:26:29,779 --> 01:26:33,619
off that yeah it's right or not

1743
01:26:31,939 --> 01:26:35,899
well the same thing it goes down to all

1744
01:26:33,619 --> 01:26:39,170
of the products all of the products are

1745
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:42,170
getting visually judged before the smell

1746
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:43,069
or the taste so or the effect even you

1747
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:44,750
know so they're first

1748
01:26:43,069 --> 01:26:47,149
most of the consumers now and they can't

1749
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:49,220
open a jar up and smell the flower they

1750
01:26:47,149 --> 01:26:51,229
have to look through a piece of glass or

1751
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:52,940
look through a jar and look at numbers

1752
01:26:51,229 --> 01:26:55,849
all right and now they're just looked

1753
01:26:52,939 --> 01:26:57,500
old percentages and stuff and then by

1754
01:26:55,850 --> 01:26:58,850
the time they get their jar they still

1755
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:00,619
can't see the one they're buying until

1756
01:26:58,850 --> 01:27:02,780
they've actually paid for it and then

1757
01:27:00,619 --> 01:27:05,239
they can crack it you know so there's a

1758
01:27:02,779 --> 01:27:07,969
there's all right so someone wanted you

1759
01:27:05,239 --> 01:27:10,729
to share some flush secrets best

1760
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:13,070

01:27:13,069 --> 01:27:25,489
and flush it long as you can pepper the

1763
01:27:21,079 --> 01:27:27,710
turpis please tell me am i bullshitting

1764
01:27:25,489 --> 01:27:32,289
that people use dr. pepper as their

1765
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:35,960
flesh yeah what the SVA recipe okay yeah

1766
01:27:32,289 --> 01:27:39,409
so we've watched all different types of

1767
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:41,060
ways we used to flush was straight ro we

1768
01:27:39,409 --> 01:27:42,739
used to flush with clear X we sit flush

1769
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:45,470
with final flush we still flush with

1770
01:27:42,739 --> 01:27:47,630
molasses Joe will help me out here my

1771
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:49,820
missing anything sweet I flush with

1772
01:27:47,630 --> 01:27:53,270
sweet before of you yep

1773
01:27:49,819 --> 01:27:55,939
you have sweet many different things and

1774
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:59,810
what we found out since we went to salts

1775
01:27:55,939 --> 01:28:02,929
we actually never flush now currently

1776
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:04,460
ever with just straight ro we just don't

1777
01:28:02,930 --> 01:28:08,210
do it we fly

1778
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:10,340
usually up to 0.5 EC it's a dilution or

1779
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:13,130
more than more diluting it bringing it

1780
01:28:10,340 --> 01:28:14,210
down and we change the climate without

1781
01:28:13,130 --> 01:28:19,340
saying too much

1782
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:22,550
we basically you know manipulate it in a

1783
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:25,670
way when we nor off yeah wiener off and

1784
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:29,420
we've actually done as of recently we

1785
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:33,230
flushed 21.5 EC which is higher than

1786
01:28:29,420 --> 01:28:37,960
most anyone would go and I haven't seen

1787
01:28:33,229 --> 01:28:41,479
no difference in flushing with nutrients

1788
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:45,770
versus RO versus anything else I've done

1789
01:28:41,479 --> 01:28:47,388
I don't see no difference personally but

1790
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:48,920
it's depending on the nutrient you're

1791
01:28:47,389 --> 01:28:51,069
using you couldn't do that with like

1792
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:53,929
advanced nutrient the EC that we water

1793
01:28:51,069 --> 01:28:56,269
you would kill your plants heavy 16 you

1794
01:28:53,929 --> 01:29:01,010
would murder them even the old recipes

1795
01:28:56,270 --> 01:29:03,409
be cities with og2 gravity well we we we

1796
01:29:01,010 --> 01:29:05,960
couldn't we couldn't we couldn't flop we

1797
01:29:03,408 --> 01:29:08,000
couldn't do it at that ec we couldn't do

1798
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:09,829
much because most plants it's like you

1799
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:11,719
said it's chelated yeah they'll build up

1800
01:29:09,829 --> 01:29:16,729
and the salt to all these people online

1801
01:29:11,719 --> 01:29:18,800
they're talking about you soil better

1802
01:29:16,729 --> 01:29:24,709
not see you out there selling PTR packs

1803
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:26,510
guys a 1/8 is full of people that use PG

1804
01:29:24,710 --> 01:29:29,090
ours and if people actually ever tested

1805
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:31,429
it yeah like PG are as you get Packer

1806
01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:33,319
abuse all and you also get something

1807
01:29:31,429 --> 01:29:36,050
called de mins a night if I'm not

1808
01:29:33,319 --> 01:29:39,139
pronouncing these correctly I'm sorry

1809
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:44,239
but those are very harmful chemicals and

1810
01:29:39,139 --> 01:29:46,789
no matter if you use 0.3 0.5 101.5 2

1811
01:29:44,238 --> 01:29:47,899
mils you're still micro dosing yourself

1812
01:29:46,789 --> 01:29:51,590
with toxins

1813
01:29:47,899 --> 01:29:54,559
you know people spray micro butanol you

1814
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:59,329
know you're gonna basically produce you

1815
01:29:54,560 --> 01:30:01,400
know toxic weed you know but as long as

1816
01:29:59,329 --> 01:30:04,010
you know how to fight against proper

1817
01:30:01,399 --> 01:30:05,929
pathogens you don't really you don't

1818
01:30:04,010 --> 01:30:06,619
need to use that you can fight do it all

1819
01:30:05,929 --> 01:30:09,079
organically

1820
01:30:06,619 --> 01:30:11,569
it's the healthiness of the plant that

1821
01:30:09,079 --> 01:30:12,159
keeps your harvest away from pests and

1822
01:30:11,569 --> 01:30:14,829
disease

1823
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:17,050
if you keep it clean and healthy you're

1824
01:30:14,829 --> 01:30:19,420
gonna have way less chance of a pester

1825
01:30:17,050 --> 01:30:20,289
disease most as the most SF is

1826
01:30:19,420 --> 01:30:22,539
introduced

1827
01:30:20,289 --> 01:30:26,439
Joel you ever had just a might just show

1828
01:30:22,539 --> 01:30:29,769
up no right huh it always introduced

1829
01:30:26,439 --> 01:30:31,479
right bring a cut in you know p.m. p.m.

1830
01:30:29,770 --> 01:30:33,850
just doesn't come on your shoulder and

1831
01:30:31,479 --> 01:30:35,709
then you go into a room and you put on

1832
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:37,990
in a room it's also you're introducing

1833
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:40,210
that things those those cuts those dirty

1834
01:30:37,989 --> 01:30:42,429
cuts how many times you got him come in

1835
01:30:40,210 --> 01:30:44,409
on your shoulder yeah they can hem bring

1836
01:30:42,430 --> 01:30:46,630
in enough plants outside you can if

1837
01:30:44,409 --> 01:30:49,359
you're outside you can you're right you

1838
01:30:46,630 --> 01:30:51,609
can but if you're conscious of it and

1839
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:53,170
you're not parking up against a rosebush

1840
01:30:51,609 --> 01:30:55,089
and rubbing up against a rosebush that

1841
01:30:53,170 --> 01:30:57,340
has p.m. and you're not changing your

1842
01:30:55,090 --> 01:31:00,069
clothes yeah you can bring it in but

1843
01:30:57,340 --> 01:31:02,680
most likely the way I've always ever had

1844
01:31:00,069 --> 01:31:04,659
problems is getting a cut that you think

1845
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:07,510
is clean the first time we ever got

1846
01:31:04,659 --> 01:31:10,779
powdery Milly sty got powdery mildew was

1847
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:14,079
by introducing a cut that was dirty from

1848
01:31:10,779 --> 01:31:16,719
a clone nursery you guys got your pre

1849
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:23,319
share what role nursery was it let's

1850
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:29,909
chat about make sure what call nursery

1851
01:31:23,319 --> 01:31:34,659
was it was shot about I'm not gonna say

1852
01:31:29,909 --> 01:31:38,139
they're in uh I'll just say this they're

1853
01:31:34,659 --> 01:31:40,840
in a turbo Santa Cruz that's all they're

1854
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:43,270
in Santa Cruz which is you know a lot of

1855
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:46,029
strains coming from North skittles and a

1856
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:48,580
lot of this cuts that we've got down

1857
01:31:46,029 --> 01:31:51,929
here the Girl Scout cookies all came

1858
01:31:48,579 --> 01:31:54,539

1859
01:31:51,930 --> 01:31:59,110
skittle is this the one in it

1860
01:31:54,539 --> 01:32:01,420
skittles it's a bitch to root my buddy

1861
01:31:59,109 --> 01:32:03,909
Nigel talked about this quite a bit to

1862
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:07,840
route skittles you have to bring it to a

1863
01:32:03,909 --> 01:32:10,779
point of almost death Rachel to a point

1864
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:12,579
of death we if you know a plant so well

1865
01:32:10,779 --> 01:32:16,929
and you know how to route it you know

1866
01:32:12,579 --> 01:32:19,539
how you learn it well and and skittles

1867
01:32:16,930 --> 01:32:21,250
is an ugly short plant the buzz never

1868
01:32:19,539 --> 01:32:23,019
look great but the Terps on it are

1869
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:24,970
wonderful that's why people breed with

1870
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:28,990
it to get that his herb that

you know you know as much as me for

1891
01:33:31,210 --> 01:33:35,470
sprain/strain

1892
01:33:31,989 --> 01:33:37,300
well that you know and much as um no no

1893
01:33:35,470 --> 01:33:39,340
we we sat down and we looked through all

1894
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:41,170
my seeds and you got the one night to

1895
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:43,329
like three in the morning and we

1896
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:46,539
separated what we felt was we created

1897
01:33:43,329 --> 01:33:48,909
hide with I put all the the best ones in

1898
01:33:46,539 --> 01:33:51,250
one yeah we put all one Tupperware and

1899
01:33:48,909 --> 01:33:53,109
it was like it started off as a small

1900
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:54,789
pile and then it got bigger and bigger

1901
01:33:53,109 --> 01:33:57,509
and then we had to take that pile and we

1902
01:33:54,789 --> 01:34:01,239
and dwindle it down from there so

1903
01:33:57,510 --> 01:34:02,949
there's a lot of really good breeders in

1904
01:34:01,239 --> 01:34:05,679
there I pretty much buy from everyone I

1905
01:34:02,949 --> 01:34:07,779

will be next maybe the green fire

1913
01:34:23,949 --> 01:34:28,689
genetics

1914
01:34:25,649 --> 01:34:33,039
maybe koma koma has some honey tree i

1915
01:34:28,689 --> 01:34:35,779
want to do that one the way to go

1916
01:34:33,039 --> 01:34:37,939
I heard someone like it's like oh gee

1917
01:34:35,779 --> 01:34:40,099
I'm not sure about the cross I have so

1918
01:34:37,939 --> 01:34:42,198
many seeds I have once I grow them I

1919
01:34:40,099 --> 01:34:43,449
know what the cross is because people

1920
01:34:42,198 --> 01:34:47,268
ask me all the time

1921
01:34:43,448 --> 01:34:48,469
oh geez I'm a hash pretty well if I

1922
01:34:47,269 --> 01:34:49,610
remember correctly when I first heard

1923
01:34:48,469 --> 01:34:51,319
about it I think that's what turned me

1924
01:34:49,609 --> 01:34:52,759
onto it nice that's what we looking at

1925
01:34:51,319 --> 01:34:54,979
the end yeah you know when I was talking

1926
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:57,349
about checking the boxes hash is also on

1927
01:34:54,979 --> 01:35:00,908
that list like how it has like trimming

1928
01:34:57,349 --> 01:35:03,319
and you know vigor and all that you know

1929
01:35:00,908 --> 01:35:06,408
whether it makes good hash is also

1930
01:35:03,319 --> 01:35:08,058
important for us you know maybe the Sun

1931
01:35:06,408 --> 01:35:10,189
kiss they said you know maybe isn't as

1932
01:35:08,059 --> 01:35:12,498
pretty as a flower and great as some of

1933
01:35:10,189 --> 01:35:15,308
some of this right here but it produces

1934
01:35:12,498 --> 01:35:18,828
really good cause you know what hash

1935
01:35:15,309 --> 01:35:20,599
yeah really I like it's one of mine but

1936
01:35:18,828 --> 01:35:24,679
I've only grown some kiss once it was

1937
01:35:20,599 --> 01:35:27,619
gifted to us from it's pretty innate it

1938
01:35:24,679 --> 01:35:32,449
was purple it yielded four point seven a

1939
01:35:27,618 --> 01:35:40,279
light five plants I got it was four

1940
01:35:32,448 --> 01:35:44,328
point seven pounds perlite nineteen

1941
01:35:40,279 --> 01:35:45,828
plants I got five and a half pounds so I

1942
01:35:44,328 --> 01:35:47,268
think when we were roughly around four

1943
01:35:45,828 --> 01:35:49,759
point seven I think it was like around

1944
01:35:47,269 --> 01:35:52,280
eighteen yeah we know that's just trim

1945
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:54,199
them that's a fun case right that's a

1946
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:56,929
sun-kissed yeah which is sour strawberry

1947
01:35:54,198 --> 01:35:59,569
cush and triangle mints f2 try not to

1948
01:35:56,929 --> 01:36:01,368
surfer yeah I got the surfer that's

1949
01:35:59,569 --> 01:36:03,469

new Lars yeah triangle mint male there

1951
01:36:03,469 --> 01:36:07,460
and then he also made the point break

1952
01:36:05,389 --> 01:36:09,650
yeah which we're gonna put that in the

1953

and I really listen to them even the

1988
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:50,340
plant if it doesn't grow ideal if it has

1989
01:37:47,609 --> 01:37:52,639
the Terps these uh these maniacs back

1993
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:10,670
world without herbs and Turks never I'm

1994
01:38:05,159 --> 01:38:13,469
just saying we need more people like

1995
01:38:10,670 --> 01:38:16,109
that's too lot of gas and less chad's in

1996
01:38:13,469 --> 01:38:19,380
this industry yeah Jules

1997
01:38:16,109 --> 01:38:22,109
you gotta smell this yes what's this

1998
01:38:19,380 --> 01:38:32,789
remind you of boys smell that come on

1999
01:38:22,109 --> 01:38:35,630
just shush no no baby what sort of deep

2000
01:38:32,789 --> 01:38:38,399
East Oakland does that smell like to you

2001
01:38:35,630 --> 01:38:41,460
there's some turps in there brother

2002
01:38:38,399 --> 01:38:47,250
not surplice and I only ran that once I

2003
01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:49,409
hunted that yeah yeah you should you

2004
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:52,199
should because that is some rare stuff

2005
01:38:49,409 --> 01:38:54,210
see when we know hunted is the best part

2006
01:38:52,199 --> 01:38:57,059
is that no one in the world has that

2007
01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:59,939
right there we are the only ones in here

2008
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:01,260
that really are can consume that because

2009
01:38:59,939 --> 01:39:02,879
we're the only ones that have

2010
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:05,250
and that's the best part it's like

2011
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:08,130
having children and each child has its

2012
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:11,729
own way of growing and absorbing water

2013
01:39:08,130 --> 01:39:14,850
and giving you a fucking thank you hey

2014
01:39:11,729 --> 01:39:20,189
Don give you a heart attack or you fall

2015
01:39:14,850 --> 01:39:21,960
in love tissue culture you're you're

2016
01:39:20,189 --> 01:39:23,759
using it but what's the future of it

2017
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:25,739
like it's play my god the future is

2018
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:32,400
bright for tissue culture yeah this guy

2019
01:39:25,738 --> 01:39:34,379
we we did the right unless you're buying

2020
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:37,019
the nurseries and makes it easier to

2021
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:39,210
grow a plant for 15 years it makes a lot

2022
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:48,510
easier you can hold moms in a tube like

2023
01:39:39,210 --> 01:39:51,630
this or you can park strange genetic

2024
01:39:48,510 --> 01:39:54,210
problems no no awesome brother oh that's

2025
01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:55,380
that yeah tissue culture some Bubba a

2026
01:39:54,210 --> 01:39:56,640
little thing in the two little tubes

2027
01:39:55,380 --> 01:39:59,130
like this and you can have like a bunch

2028
01:39:56,640 --> 01:40:02,820
of that's helping me I tissue culture of

2029
01:39:59,130 --> 01:40:04,859
the Mac and I have tissue cultured our

2030
01:40:02,819 --> 01:40:09,029
triangle mints and I have tissue culture

2031
01:40:04,859 --> 01:40:11,789
at our 90 SOG and so far all of them all

2032
01:40:09,029 --> 01:40:17,279
of them have increase in vigor except

2033
01:40:11,789 --> 01:40:19,829
unfortunately the og the the og now

2034
01:40:17,279 --> 01:40:22,319
roots the tissue culture og roots great

2035
01:40:19,829 --> 01:40:24,960
I just haven't really ran it too much

2036
01:40:22,319 --> 01:40:26,789
yeah that's really neurone she hasn't

2037
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,680
got a room on her own you really dial in

2038
01:40:26,789 --> 01:40:32,189
strains you really want to run it with

2039
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:35,760
one strain but these days everyone wants

2040
01:40:32,189 --> 01:40:38,460
flavors you know that was raised you

2041
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:40,079
know on the old recipe yeah and there's

2042
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:42,779
something that says that that oh yeah

2043
01:40:40,079 --> 01:40:45,210
really likes that and when you ran it in

2044
01:40:42,779 --> 01:40:46,649
its own little well little section it

2045
01:40:45,210 --> 01:40:48,060
was covered by everybody else a whole

2046
01:40:46,649 --> 01:40:50,460
different environment whole different

2047
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:53,880
set of newts she wasn't having it no she

2048
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:56,850
wasn't she wasn't but uh-huh

2049
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:58,920
oh she will track it unbelievably in the

2050
01:40:56,850 --> 01:41:03,140
plant smell like a to me even when it's

2051
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:05,520
still growing so nothing wrong so you

2052
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:07,950
know other than that tissue culture is

2053
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:13,020
great I think the I think a lot of

2054
01:41:07,949 --> 01:41:15,090
people can marish them a lot of you know

2055
01:41:13,020 --> 01:41:19,830
viroids out potentially

2056
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:21,929
phoo cerium or what else there's no

2057
01:41:19,829 --> 01:41:24,569
cutting disease also duh ting disease

2058
01:41:21,929 --> 01:41:30,359
you can leighton thyroid any any kind of

2059
01:41:24,569 --> 01:41:32,039
viroids you can tissue culture ya may

2060
01:41:30,359 --> 01:41:34,679
not but you can also teach the business

2061
01:41:32,039 --> 01:41:38,130
something a couple times to potentially

2062
01:41:34,679 --> 01:41:40,399
meristem it out but that could take you

2063
01:41:38,130 --> 01:41:43,279
know a year it could take a year

2064
01:41:40,399 --> 01:41:46,710
sometimes the og really doesn't bring

2065
01:41:43,279 --> 01:41:49,050
system and this is point break just you

2066
01:41:46,710 --> 01:41:54,149
know the oh geez just temperamental even

2067
01:41:49,050 --> 01:41:58,670
in tissue culture no I don't know anyone

2068
01:41:54,149 --> 01:42:00,929
that has it's tissue cultured skittles

2069
01:41:58,670 --> 01:42:02,699
but we don't want to grow skittles we

2070
01:42:00,929 --> 01:42:05,190
want to go crosses of skittles like that

2071
01:42:02,698 --> 01:42:05,399
that legit we just passed around right

2072
01:42:05,189 --> 01:42:07,919
now

2073
01:42:05,399 --> 01:42:09,719
excuse cake skittles cake because you

2074
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:12,060
get the yield you get different

2075
01:42:09,719 --> 01:42:17,239
structure but you get that Terp that

2076
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:19,590

2173
01:47:10,238 --> 01:47:14,049
that was our first facility in the

2174
01:47:12,010 --> 01:47:16,520
valley because I think it's there at

2175
01:47:14,050 --> 01:47:20,900
Northridge or because I went there

2176

with Brett and with it cam yes and did

2178
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:37,730
they move south because of like just

2179
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:41,450
stacked big long beach is more cannabis

2180
01:47:37,729 --> 01:47:43,069
friendly in terms of cultivation it

2181
01:47:41,449 --> 01:47:45,409
happened to be that they got a license

2182
01:47:43,069 --> 01:47:49,250
there that was able to accommodate the

2183
01:47:45,409 --> 01:47:52,819
facility that is strictly that just more

2184
01:47:49,250 --> 01:47:55,670
necessity yeah sometimes it's not a

2185
01:47:52,819 --> 01:47:57,949
choice and where you kind of go s'more

2186
01:47:55,670 --> 01:48:00,590
what's available licenses on and over

2187
01:47:57,949 --> 01:48:03,529
like that easily especially on a bigger

2188
01:48:00,590 --> 01:48:05,659
scale able to provide blue branch

2189
01:48:03,529 --> 01:48:09,769
we're wondering why they're big

2190
01:48:05,659 --> 01:48:12,260
believers on being able to provide the

2191
01:48:09,770 --> 01:48:12,590
brand their own products and nothing

2192
01:48:12,260 --> 01:48:16,159
else

2193
01:48:12,590 --> 01:48:19,340
Derek they're not really big into it's a

2194
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:21,199
basically sourcing product right they're

2195
01:48:19,340 --> 01:48:23,360
trying to not to ever get to that for it

2196
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:26,179
so how many square feet is the new

2197
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:28,549
facility it's it's just amazing

2198
01:48:26,180 --> 01:48:31,909
state-of-the-art facility it's a hundred

2199
01:48:28,550 --> 01:48:34,579

01:48:31,909 --> 01:48:36,439
lights 36 rooms everything's on the flex

2201
01:48:34,579 --> 01:48:38,989
as well bad everything's done in small

2202
01:48:36,439 --> 01:48:39,979
batches I'm a grower builder I pay

2203
01:48:38,989 --> 01:48:42,800
attention to those things

2204
01:48:39,979 --> 01:48:44,239
that's impressive it's very impressive

2205
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:46,840
and that's flower lights by the way

2206
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:49,039
everything's dirty not a flower lights

2207
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:50,659
200 employees probably how many

2208
01:48:49,039 --> 01:48:53,000
employees you guys got there it's a lot

2209
01:48:50,659 --> 01:48:55,970
but everything's done in small batches

2210
01:48:53,000 --> 01:49:01,880
duh yeah well they harvest three times a

2211
01:48:55,970 --> 01:49:06,500
week that's a lot harvest three times a

2212
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:10,190
week that's enticing that means you're

2213
01:49:06,500 --> 01:49:13,270
planting three times a week - and taking

2214
01:49:10,189 --> 01:49:13,269
cuts three times a week

2215
01:49:14,418 --> 01:49:38,488
so we could run that place maybe with

2216
01:49:19,078 --> 01:49:40,408
12-foot ceilings be a lot of hours is

2217
01:49:38,488 --> 01:49:52,228
that about done after three or four hits

2218
01:49:40,408 --> 01:49:54,029
or you just keep puffing no it's good if

2219
01:49:52,229 --> 01:49:57,809
I go too hot it's gonna change the taste

2220
01:49:54,029 --> 01:50:01,889
it is yeah four different different kind

2221
01:49:57,809 --> 01:50:05,099
of experience yeah that's about the temp

2222
01:50:01,889 --> 01:50:19,949
I put it usually about 360 380 on my

2223
01:50:05,099 --> 01:50:22,498
volcanoe hybrid someone keeps saying go

2224
01:50:19,948 --> 01:50:24,509
get the Israeli portable THC tester from

2225
01:50:22,498 --> 01:50:25,529
the truck I need you saying it like a

2226
01:50:24,510 --> 01:50:29,130
hundred times

2227
01:50:25,529 --> 01:50:31,198
yeah but you don't have it no what

2228
01:50:29,130 --> 01:50:33,179
happened is that before we came here

2229
01:50:31,198 --> 01:50:34,708
they all came my truck and I took

2230
01:50:33,179 --> 01:50:39,449
everything out of my truck and I put it

2231
01:50:34,708 --> 01:50:41,219
in my Audi and it's in there yeah so I

2232
01:50:39,448 --> 01:50:43,078
just think it's funny that someone

2233
01:50:41,219 --> 01:50:49,319
remembered that you had mentioned yes it

2234
01:50:43,078 --> 01:50:50,578
was I'm sure the damn thing if if I ever

2235
01:50:49,319 --> 01:50:53,099

you know just heat it up and there in a

2261
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:13,520
in a rig that you basically once it

a little longer little bubble and you

2264
01:52:15,770 --> 01:52:21,050
