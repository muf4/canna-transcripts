00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,950
hi my name is Jeremy Moberg I'm CEO of

3
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:15,479
Kennesaw farms and president and founder

4
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:17,129
of The Washington Sun Growers Industry

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,990
Association which is a group in

6
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:22,618
Washington state that represents some

7
00:00:18,989 --> 00:00:25,169
growers and hi guys I'm Jade Stefano and

8
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:27,809
I'm CEO and co-founder of puffin farm

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:29,368
also a Sun grown farm and I'm also on

10
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:30,750
the board of directors of the Delta

11
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:33,689
Washington some growers Industry

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,850
Association as well and we were going to

13
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:39,869
talk about start the conversation off

14
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,969
with how we select strains and how we

15
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:44,369
kind of follow the market trends on

16
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:48,660
strains which can be a really annoying

17
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:50,759
thing actually so I know that I I don't

18
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:52,558
think I've chased the strains as much

19
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,599
and I don't think you're big change

20
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,698
trace chaser either I'm not following

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,039
the instagrams looking for what's hot

22
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:01,738
you know was it wedding cake or wedding

23
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,558
mac or mac or any of that I think we've

24
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,629
I've taken sort of a kind of a slower

25
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,989
approach but not to say that we don't

26
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:12,449
have what we call signature strains in

27
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:14,099
Kennesaw farms which is a really

28
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,579
difficult thing to do to kind of claim a

29
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:19,289
strain and to make it sort of your brand

30
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:23,099
strain I know you've had you have a

31
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,630
couple strains strains that we are that

32
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:26,789
are have a cult following in Washington

33
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:29,159
we have a hindu kush which originally

34
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,380
came out of Oregon as a clone only and

35
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,179
we also have a high CBD strain called

36
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:35,310
dancehall which originated from Spain

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,460
and those are seeds that we imported

38
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,109
from Spain prior to legalization back in

39
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:42,000
the medical day so you sprouted and we

40
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:43,260
sprouted that one yeah and so both other

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,730
one was a clone the other one was a

42
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,430
clone that we were given by an Oregon

43
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:49,020
grower a friend of ours and so those two

44
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,370
strains the reason why we have stuck

45
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:53,340
with those is when you're growing

46
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,930
outdoors you can't really grow every

47
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,549
strain you have to grow it works in your

48
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,860
environment so we originally started out

49
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,239
with maybe 50 100 strains and we've

50
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,939
winnowed it down to like the ones that

51
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,079
really win on our terroir so like some

52
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:06,060
strains they might be beautifully

53
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,280
indoors at our farm they don't do well

54
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,659
and they might do well at Jeremy's far

55
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,009
I've taken a little bit of different

56
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:12,849
approach I believe that I can grow any

57
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,429
strain except for the completely

58
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:17,259
equatorial strains those are just out of

59
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,270
the question can't be can't really be

60
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:22,269
grown in a commercial environment at all

61
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:25,180
um do you get irritated when you see or

62
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:27,730
have you ever seen a different like the

63
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:30,909
Hindukush produced by a different farm

64
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:32,469
yeah so there are other phenotypes out

65
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:34,139
there and which we've been told ours is

66
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:36,639
the best one in Washington and so

67
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:38,229
they're not the other ones are not super

68
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,000
popular from what I can tell and people

69
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:42,549
say that ours is the best so ours is

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,770
kind of really establish yourself in the

71
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:48,580
market but there are and it's kind of

72
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:50,980
hard to own a string but we have this

73
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:54,340
phenotype though is is very special it

74
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:57,939
is a huge producer outdoors it is an

75
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,610
early season finisher and it tastes

76
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:02,439
amazing yeah it's beautiful bud

77
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,000
structure it looks like indoor weed so

78
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:05,859
it's got everything going for is disease

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,900
resistant it's like a miracle strain and

80
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,940
we just got so lucky and blessed to be

81
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,260
given that and so you know that was pure

82
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,870
luck we didn't even seek that out

83
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:15,699
someone gave that to us as a gift yeah

84
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,280
so that was our that was definitely a

85
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:20,649
clear champion and every year after year

86
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,050
it's a great producer and does amazing

87
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:26,170
it produces often 10:00 to 1:00 to other

88
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:28,480
strains that we grow like dancehall for

89
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:30,309
instance and some of the CBD strains we

90
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:31,659
do specialize in CBD strains which has

91
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,670
differentiated us in the market but

92
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:35,620
there are abysmal producers for the most

93
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:37,209
part but we provide that for people that

94
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,770
need it we like to grow it and it helps

95
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,930
us get a niche that we wouldn't

96
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:43,870
otherwise have we have 3/4 of an acre of

97
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:46,360
canopy 30,000 square feet our farm we're

98
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,599
on a 20 acre farm by the river we do

99
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,010
full season Jeremy does job and so we've

100
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,810
got a little different model going as

101
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:54,370
far as and he can grow more strains like

102
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,509
he said he can grow anything because he

103
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,310
does like that but with a full season

104
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:58,870
you're much more limited you're so

105
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,580
limited at the northern latitudes by

106
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,500
what you can grow full term and so it

107
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:05,800
really becomes the full terms you know

108
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:09,699
it's great its low its low cost you can

109
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,530
produce some really nice material from

110
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:13,569
it and it's really an expression of the

111
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:16,480
tirar of the of the weather and

112
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:18,670
everything and so we do have sort of our

113
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,220
signature strains we call them kind of

114
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:22,780
pick them up when you know in 2011 when

115
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,250
you started seeing clone markets in

116
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:26,228
Seattle you know that was the very first

117
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,439
time where I could like go get genetics

118
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:28,629
and

119
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:31,000
by a clone you know besides like from a

120
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:33,040
friend you know and that was really

121
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,199
amazing so I started just getting

122
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,990
everything that I could and I went up to

123
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,629
about 250 clones at the beginning and

124
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,490
have whittled that down and I'm always

125
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:45,490
somewhere between 80 and a hundred and

126
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,470
fifty different clones and our signature

127
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,120
strains as we call them are our Alice in

128
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:52,830
Wonderland which was a clone that we

129
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,180
picked up in the medical market in 2011

130
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:57,519
mm and cheesecake was also a Columbia

131
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:01,060
picked up back then and then cashy's

132
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:03,219
honey which came from the CBD project

133
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:06,430
and Ringo's farm in California and

134
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:09,130
that's been an amazing one that we have

135
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:13,329
popularized as as a strain and then in

136
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:17,290
the full term side we had a strain that

137
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:20,649
local Okanagan where we our man had been

138
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,780
breeding and it was it was harvested

139
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:24,669
like in mid-september which is just

140
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:26,500
great for outdoors and so we started

141
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:28,420
crossing that with everything because it

142
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,829
was high terpene high camera noise so

143
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,569
now we have all these juicy crosses I

144
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,310
got the juicy double lemon juicy turbine

145
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:35,649
juicy Allison Wonderland

146
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:38,649
and so that's kind of how we've handled

147
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:39,759
the full term outdoor market one thing

148
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:41,709
we've discovered we've both been

149
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,000
licensed for five and a half years at

150
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:45,310
this point we're going into our sixth

151
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,660
season and so it's definitely a game of

152
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:49,269
like branding and distinguishing

153
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,250
yourself and and going in and talking to

154
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:52,509
people and you know getting to know the

155
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,850
bud tenders getting to know the buyers

156
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:57,069
and so we spend quite a bit of time at

157
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,140
events going into stores talking to

158
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:01,719
people making friends you know smoking

159
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:03,219
people out and there's a large social

160
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,780
element to all this and you know you

161
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,120
could be a really great grower and have

162
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:09,219
beautiful flower but if you can't get in

163
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,740
and and be there on the ground - I'm

164
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,210
interact with people it gets really

165
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,230
difficult and then in the brand is

166
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:15,789
really important - you have to have a

167
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,350
brand that resonates with people that's

168
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,180
attractive that's pretty you have to

169
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,530
think about packaging and there's a lot

170
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:22,180
to this it's not I mean you can grow

171
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:24,489
great weed but if you can't sell it

172
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,220
it doesn't do any good and selling it is

173
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,710
a lot more about personal relationships

174
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,210
as well as packaging and branding than

175
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:32,560
it is necessarily about the quality and

176
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:34,750
that is actually proven when there's a

177
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,120
lot of shitty weed and beautiful well

178
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:40,980
branded packages it's doing quite well

179
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:43,829
ya know it's and when you have a brand

180
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:46,950
you're trying to appeal say to a 45 year

181
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:49,019
old demographic and your bud tenders and

182
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:50,969
your and your buyers are in their

183
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:53,189
mid-20s and more concerned about the

184
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,930
Instagram account then really you know

185
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:57,480
the sustainability or the practices that

186
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:00,629
you're using that becomes very difficult

187
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:03,360
so your your audience is maybe a 40 year

188
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:05,819
old woman but you've got to get past the

189
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,710
25 year old kid that you know for some

190
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:09,659
reason is in charge of buying because

191
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:11,638
the owner is a little bit disconnected

192
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,010
and thinks that well all the other young

193
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,240
kids no we'd the most you know and so

194
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:19,349
that becomes difficult to get past and

195
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,650
you know and then so then you're like

196
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:24,689
you're really having to schmooze these

197
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:26,039
these bud tenders and you know and

198
00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:27,660
they're the ones that are reacting like

199
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,040
to the next greatest strain and

200
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,919
everything yeah and so there is

201
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,680
definitely this market pressure to sort

202
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,389
of chase the next batch strain we kind

203
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,639
of believe or I kind of believe that a

204
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:40,889
lot of my demographic or chemical

205
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,418
consumers really want to establish what

206
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:44,699
they like and they want to stick with

207
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:46,079
that and they're not really chasing the

208
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,689
next thing I think that's more of the

209
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,978
younger ya generation yeah I agree with

210
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:50,910
all that and one thing I am seeing

211
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:53,310
though just to give a little more hope

212
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,140
to the situation is that um some of

213
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,850
these young kids are they're smart and

214
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,740
they they they start learning about

215
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,970
terpenes and they start actually tasting

216
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:01,350
a difference themselves and it kind of

217
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:03,030
opens their eyes to like this whole new

218
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,680
world so once you get past that barrier

219
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:06,299
with them that they can that it's about

220
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,490
terpenes and it's about the experience

221
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,250
and the flavor and it's not about the

222
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:12,418
brand or how the buds look they get

223
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,649
really excited about it and there's

224
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:15,418
actually you become a following there's

225
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:17,310
like young you know millennial kids who

226
00:08:15,418 --> 00:08:19,049
are like living soil fanboys and

227
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,759
fangirls and it's really great to see

228
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,560
that and that's something that is kind

229
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:23,819
of the last two years is becoming more

230
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,610
and more evident where you'll see these

231
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,139
millennial but hunters showing up to

232
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:30,930
cultivation panels to listen about

233
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:32,610
living soil which is just great and

234
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,099
that's given me some hope and Washington

235
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,379
in particular like Oregon in California

236
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,089
doesn't have this problem so much in

237
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:41,668
Washington we have such a long history

238
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:45,210
of indoor growing that uh there's just

239
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:50,019
this there is this sort of look and feel

240
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:53,589
for marijuana that the market has has

241
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:56,769
going after and to see the bud tenders

242
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:59,200
finally starting to understand that high

243
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:00,490
quality cannabis can be grown under the

244
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,500
Sun in fact what we're learning is

245
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:04,060
higher quality cannabis because we're

246
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,409
not only not even to mention the

247
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:07,179
environmental impacts but also the

248
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:09,519
camera noise and the terpenes are

249
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:11,109
generally higher when grown outside

250
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,208
under the right conditions and

251
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,060
particularly light up when you're taking

252
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:19,299
advantage of those hot dry summer days

253
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:20,769
and so we're we're slowly starting to

254
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:23,469
get some bud tenders to kind of come

255
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:25,689
around and understand the value of Sun

256
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,870
grown and the harm of indoor grown and

257
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,339
in one way we do that is that we we are

258
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:34,089
about ready to come on to our second

259
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:36,040
annual Sun Cup and that's held right

260
00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:37,450
around 4:20 and Earth Day because before

261
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:39,909
4:20 there was another holiday it was

262
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:42,550
called Earth Day and now 420 kind of

263
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:45,189
took over Earth Day and in Washington

264
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:48,009
particular they're celebrating indoor

265
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:50,290
grown a cannabis that just has a huge

266
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:51,669
environmental impact so we're trying to

267
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:54,490
bring that discussion back in and then

268
00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:57,669
the judges are all bud tenders so we're

269
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:59,680
you know trying to get bud tenders to to

270
00:09:57,669 --> 00:10:02,019
appreciate sun-grown

271
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:05,199
give them give them a judging position

272
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:06,730
they all get excited they they tell all

273
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,560
their friends you know and then all of a

274
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,539
sudden you start to lose the biased

275
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,399
against it but Washington unlike other

276
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:14,259
markets well at least what California

277
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,850
and Oregon is very biased towards

278
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:18,370
endorse and I think we're gonna see this

279
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,528
bias continue as legalization goes to

280
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,240
the east and we really Washington really

281
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:23,950
needs to get a handle on this I mean for

282
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,950
example you know Willie Nelson has a

283
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:29,709
brand out there and it's primarily

284
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:32,800
indoor grown and then he puts out a

285
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:35,049
brand called Sun grown and of course

286
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,639
it's cheaper and and lower quality and

287
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:38,379
at the bottom of the shelf so even

288
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:42,539
Willie you know probably unbeknownst to

289
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:46,208
him is is propagating this idea that

290
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:47,528
indoor cannabis is is a higher quality

291
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,989
and should be more expensive our

292
00:10:47,528 --> 00:10:52,179
companies in particular we're where we

293
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,789
believe that people want to pay for

294
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:57,039
these words sustainability organic

295
00:10:54,789 --> 00:11:00,189
things that they're used to seeing as as

296
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,379
as top shelf you know when the when the

297
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,520
consumer comes in and they're driving a

298
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:05,350
Prius and we're in Paragon

299
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,850
and they asked for Sustainable weed and

300
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,259
they're sent to the bottom shelf you

301
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:10,480
know that retailer just left money on

302
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:12,250
the table and so that it's starting to

303
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,509
change where we're being active in

304
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,799
changing those perceptions but

305
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:17,279
Washington in particular has a really

306
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:21,609
strong biased against sun-grown

307
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,980
absolutely yeah we get one harvest a

308
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:26,080
year maybe two so we can we can grow the

309
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,539
same canopy we've got 30,000 square feet

310
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,900
as does an indoor farm which can flip

311
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:34,809
that canopy five plus times so I'm an

312
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:37,799
indoor farm of the same license size can

313
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:39,969
grow five to ten times the amount

314
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:41,109
depending on the strain choice and a lot

315
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,610
of growing methods there's a lot of

316
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:45,370
other stuff that goes into yield co2

317
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,470
enrichment light intensity so they can

318
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,870
grow much much much more cannabis at an

319
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:51,639
indoor farm and we have to shoulder all

320
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,259
the same expenses the only the only

321
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:54,789
place we have the lower costs of

322
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:57,340
production is with electrical the

323
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:59,049
lighting the HVAC which is a nice place

324
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,450
to be able to save money but when they

325
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:03,009
have the economy of scale of having five

326
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,980
to ten times the production they can

327
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:07,539
kind of absorb that extra cost and put

328
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,950
the craft growers in a really hard

329
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:11,019
position where we have a lot of the same

330
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:14,140
expenses we can't sell our weed for as

331
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:16,389
much because it's outdoor and we can't

332
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:18,699
grow as much and it's it's it's

333
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:21,850
surprising to hear probably that we you

334
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:25,450
know would say that indoor has the scale

335
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:27,820
and that's because of the of how the LCB

336
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,800
in Washington has regulated canopy it's

337
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,960
by the square foot so they didn't pay

338
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:33,609
attention at all to the annual cycle or

339
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,820
how many times you could run that square

340
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:39,550
foot so our square foot of a Sun grower

341
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:41,290
is not equal to an indoor square fly you

342
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:45,159
know you can run that indoor square foot

343
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:47,740
five times so a Tier three indoor is

344
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:49,689
actually equivalent to five two or three

345
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:52,509
sun-grown and so that's where that

346
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:54,310
difference comes and we've we've you

347
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:56,259
know there's there's an idea in the

348
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:58,569
industry that the overproduction is

349
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:01,179
coming from outdoor grown and that

350
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:05,440
definitely is partially true however

351
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:07,870
indoor growers are also adding to it and

352
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,810
it really hasn't that impact has not

353
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:13,060
been assessed correctly by the LCB they

354
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:15,369
just did a canopy report and came out

355
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:18,289
and did canopy assessments at all the

356
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:21,360
farms and they failed to

357
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:23,879
to account for how many times that

358
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,379
square footage was being used and so all

359
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:27,389
the things all other things being equal

360
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:29,429
they want to say well the outdoor

361
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:32,850
growers have seemed to be growing more

362
00:13:29,429 --> 00:13:36,689
over canopy but really without the

363
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:38,550
temporal aspect of it clearly the indoor

364
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,750
growers are able under the same amount

365
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:41,759
of square footage able to produce much

366
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,320
much more yeah and in fact Washington

367
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,360
State was gonna make outdoor growing

368
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,310
completely illegal initially and thanks

369
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,870
to Jeremy here he kind of saved the day

370
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:51,539
along with a couple other people they

371
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:55,110
went in and he lobbied and he educated

372
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:58,169
the politicians and the administrators

373
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:01,019
and you know was able to make it so that

374
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:02,490
we can grow outdoors but at the end of

375
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:04,589
the day we were given a penalty which is

376
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:08,100
the canopy he was we weren't able to get

377
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:09,870
a canopy with parody to indoor growing

378
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,370
and so and we were put at a disadvantage

379
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,870
and a liquor board has been quoted as

380
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:15,120
saying that we made a business decision

381
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,490
to grow outdoors so we can grow less

382
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,169
that's our fault for not choosing to

383
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,700
grow indoors and having to spend five

384
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:22,979
million dollars to build out a facility

385
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,140
is the unsaid part there as well as

386
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,550
pollute the environment and increase

387
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:29,129
global warming and do all these other

388
00:14:26,549 --> 00:14:31,109
things that really kill the orcas if

389
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:33,509
they don't benefit society while we're

390
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:37,528
in the midst of a environmental global

391
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:39,450
warming carbon crisis rolled out that is

392
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:41,159
increasing this problem by our governor

393
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:43,410
who's running for president who was kind

394
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:45,629
of asleep at the wheel as as the

395
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:48,360
cannabis industry sort of you know just

396
00:14:45,629 --> 00:14:49,828
came into being and started consuming

397
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,839
two to four percent of the state's

398
00:14:49,828 --> 00:14:54,120
hydroelectric power you know this is

399
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,980
clean power that is not producing

400
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,328
carbons and should be protected the last

401
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,690
thing we should be doing with our clean

402
00:14:57,328 --> 00:15:02,458
hydroelectric resources is producing a

403
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,279
recreational drug crop when you can

404
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:08,669
produce it under the Sun and you know

405
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:10,860
the governor has really not sort of been

406
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:14,129
sensitive to this issue even though he

407
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:16,350
claims to be you know a staunch carbon

408
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:19,769
carbon governor and and one example of

409
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:22,110
that is recently Washington passed a law

410
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:24,870
last year that for an organic standard

411
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:26,909
in in the state and we were both on that

412
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,589
Advisory Committee to the that the

413
00:15:26,909 --> 00:15:31,199
double USDA the Washington Department of

414
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:33,360
Ag put together and we were adamant

415
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,519
a plant that has never seen the light of

416
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,889
day or put its roots in soil should not

417
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,060
be called organic well some threw some

418
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:44,789
wonky sort of federal rules governing

419
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:47,638
USDA and hydroponic rules it's actually

420
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:49,500
allowed you know we we appealed to the

421
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:51,600
governor and said hey you know you don't

422
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:55,129
we're not federally regulated you do not

423
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,680
have to follow the W the USDA organics

424
00:15:55,129 --> 00:16:00,990
lead here you can say no that we are not

425
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:02,489
going to allow indoor grown cannabis to

426
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:05,060
be called organic and we failed at that

427
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:07,948
we didn't get that and that was a real

428
00:16:05,059 --> 00:16:09,899
missed opportunity for a governor that

429
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:11,789
you know claims to be concerned about

430
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:15,208
carbon yeah and you're giving the the

431
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:17,338
consumers real information when they

432
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:19,409
when they're buying organic they're also

433
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:21,060
buying sustainable absolutely and I

434
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:22,828
think one of the failures that have

435
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:24,778
happened here is that cannabis

436
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:27,479
legalization is a very typically a

437
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:30,929
liberal kind of Democrat left-wing issue

438
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,940
and so and it's been grown indoors due

439
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:35,969
to prohibition and whatnot and so I

440
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,980
think a lot of the policymakers didn't

441
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,899
actually understand that you can grow it

442
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,800
outdoors they saw indoor cultivation as

443
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:45,360
like the default kind of best way only

444
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:46,500
way you can do it in fact and they're

445
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,940
people there's a narrative out there

446
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,159
that you can't grow good cannabis

447
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,380
indoors and supporting the narrative

448
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,899
show that is dominated by light

449
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:57,208
companies HVAC companies led companies

450
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:59,399
there is there's an industrial complex

451
00:16:57,208 --> 00:17:02,429
that has a vested interest in keeping

452
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,078
very expensive indoor operations or now

453
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:06,599
that kind of see oh well we have a

454
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,428
problem with you know with how bad

455
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,750
indoor is for the environment well we're

456
00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:11,220
gonna move it to these greenhouses but

457
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:13,289
we're gonna add more lights and we're

458
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,360
gonna we're gonna add more HVAC and

459
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:17,759
those we're calling hyper greenhouses

460
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,558
and dr. Ivan Mills who's well known for

461
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:21,539
assessing environmental impacts of

462
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:24,000
indoor grows recently put out a white

463
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:25,918
paper I was about a year ago sort of

464
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,539
assessing that these hyper greenhouses

465
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,220
are really better and I feel like the

466
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:31,319
excitement of cannabis legalization

467
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,140
among the liberal left and the kind of

468
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:36,269
Pro cannabis people in general had

469
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,610
they're not so excited that they forgot

470
00:17:36,269 --> 00:17:40,259
to get deep into the environmental

471
00:17:38,609 --> 00:17:43,229
policy about it they just want it legal

472
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:45,509
so badly and so it let them

473
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,519
they gave a big hand out to corporate

474
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:49,740
infrastructure companies unintentionally

475
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,539
I think to some extent because we're so

476
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,000
excited to just get cannabis legal and

477
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:55,139
and the drug war and well and your

478
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
company I mean you made the right

479
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,850
decision even though you were based out

480
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,679
of Seattle and kind of lived you know

481
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:04,918
cuz Seattle is you may know is not a

482
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,780
good place to grow cannabis outdoors so

483
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,100
Jade actually sort of you know a lot of

484
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:09,389
people looked at that and said oh well

485
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:11,279
we can't do that we have to go to

486
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,049
indoors we live in Seattle well she was

487
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,750
like no there's Eastern Washington and

488
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:17,250
so she's got half of her her productions

489
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,660
out in eastern Washington and her

490
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,769
processing is in Seattle which it's kind

491
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,269
of the best of both worlds because

492
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:22,529
you're close to the market but you're

493
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:25,619
growing sustainable a lot of people

494
00:18:22,529 --> 00:18:27,029
won't make that decision and I've heard

495
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:30,449
people say well what were we supposed to

496
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:33,769
do you know were we supposed to move to

497
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,769
Eastern Washington yes

498
00:18:36,019 --> 00:18:40,230
Central Washington where our farm is

499
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:42,359
actually 90 miles from Seattle so it's

500
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,860
not even that bad yeah I'm for that he's

501
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:45,269
four and a half hours but there were

502
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:47,159
options there are options that are

503
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:49,349
closer in I think some of the bigger

504
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,210
Tier three companies ran numbers on

505
00:18:49,349 --> 00:18:53,699
production really the 5-time canopy

506
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,400
would be something that they could yeah

507
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,440
and I think a pet peeve of ours is these

508
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,419
when these indoor growers sort of steal

509
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,789
our language and they start claiming

510
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:04,230
sustainability that becomes a real

511
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:06,089
problem for us like you know just

512
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:09,089
because you put up LED lights does not

513
00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:10,798
make your your indoor grow sustainable

514
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:13,709
and so the you know these people are

515
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:15,690
taking our language they they're they're

516
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,460
putting in little you know the LED

517
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,019
revolution you know and even even

518
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,850
calling themselves there's some farms

519
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:22,529
called there's one indoor grown farm

520
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:25,439
that is sunshine farms you know and then

521
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:28,500
I saw a tagline that said yeah indoor

522
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,269
Sun grown and it's just like what do you

523
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,000
mean are oh there was one indoor grown

524
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:34,889
light touched or Sun touched Sun Sun

525
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,150
types that was a good one you know I

526
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,820
actually have more respect for these

527
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:41,790
indoor companies that you know don't

528
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:43,470
really take that language from us you

529
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:45,750
know and and then we've got policies

530
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:48,569
sort of backing this up where you could

531
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:51,119
you can be running an indoor grow and

532
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:53,789
you can go to your your local utility

533
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,639
district and you can get a rebate and

534
00:19:53,789 --> 00:19:58,430
there has been like 200

535
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,530
thousand dollar rebates given to 502

536
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:04,580
farms in Washington in order for them to

537
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:06,319
buy their LED lighting which is just

538
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:08,000
ridiculous like we don't have any funds

539
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,549
available to us and we're already

540
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,190
sustainable like why didn't we given

541
00:20:10,549 --> 00:20:15,919
money to or why not give them money to

542
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:17,390
not have lighting at all give us light

543
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:24,800
money because we're not using lights

544
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:27,140
there's some crazy sort of wonky rolling

545
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:29,029
out across the country is that the kind

546
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,200
of the infrastructure lobbyists and

547
00:20:29,029 --> 00:20:32,029
stuff are actually getting ahead of it

548
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,130
so even before medical becomes legal in

549
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:37,940
states there are already people at those

550
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:45,050
government agencies and lobbying against

551
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:47,330
saying that in outdoor is a hazard or

552
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:58,309
outdoor is gonna be dirty pot we can't

553
00:20:47,329 --> 00:21:00,079
keep stairs and they're well ahead of us

554
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:01,669
and so right now they're in states like

555
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,679
you know in the Midwest and Missouri

556
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:06,590
Oklahoma everywhere and they are already

557
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,410
crafting policy that is gonna make it

558
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:11,029
really difficult to grow outdoors

559
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:12,680
nationwide and when it's really scary

560
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:13,970
yeah we for a long time we always

561
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,750
thought we needed a little a little

562
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:19,549
committee like a little I don't know

563
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,200
fired committee or something that would

564
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:22,849
fly to these different places and be

565
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,039
like hey guys you can crow it out sore

566
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:26,179
outside and if you don't this is the

567
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,220
carbon footprint you're looking at

568
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:30,380
because I mean Western Washington is

569
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,360
fortunate to have a lot of carbon free

570
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,990
power as soon as you start going east

571
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:38,359
it's all carbon or nuclear so you know

572
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,500
it becomes much more important as we

573
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:44,059
start legalizing to the east that they

574
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,650
grow outdoors but like you said there's

575
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:47,599
they have lobbyists now they're

576
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:50,269
protecting their their industry we just

577
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,559
saw plant growth canopies the big

578
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:53,539
company out of Canada

579
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:56,720
you know they they've got the massive

580
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:59,629
massive indoor gross well we saw the CEO

581
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,400
their lobbying the Parliament that maybe

582
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,660
we shouldn't have sun-grown and that was

583
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,800
the worst thing they could possible do

584
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:08,909
and invoking the children's actually

585
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,098
illegal and is going to be allowed

586
00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:13,320
in 2020 but that's two years after the

587
00:22:11,098 --> 00:22:14,878
rollout of medical legalization so

588
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:16,259
that's giving the Indore big

589
00:22:14,878 --> 00:22:19,048
infrastructure company that huge head

590
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:20,249
start and and there yeah and so I've

591
00:22:19,048 --> 00:22:21,418
been talking about Canadian actually

592
00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:23,489
about this so he's gonna start growing

593
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:24,840
in two years outdoors in Canada but but

594
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:26,278
they are way behind because they were

595
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:27,898
not they were not allowed to grow

596
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,940
outdoors and I'm thirty miles from the

597
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:31,709
water I mean I could take my operation

598
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,840
which you know a sustainable low-cost

599
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:35,369
high quality product and just move it

600
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,978
right across the border there's any

601
00:22:35,368 --> 00:22:39,988
Canadian sir and the unfortunate part is

602
00:22:37,979 --> 00:22:41,940
the regulators and the policy makers in

603
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:42,899
the states outside of like the kind of

604
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,909
epicenter on the west coast they're

605
00:22:42,898 --> 00:22:46,888
they're kind of ignorant about how it

606
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:48,359
grows so they have like quote experts

607
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:49,888
coming in and telling them it has to be

608
00:22:48,358 --> 00:22:52,259
indoors it's not safe if it's not

609
00:22:49,888 --> 00:22:53,579
indoors it's not clean there's gonna be

610
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:56,249
security issues and so they're being

611
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:58,048
lobbied like really early on with you

612
00:22:56,249 --> 00:23:00,058
know typical reefer madness on fear

613
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:02,398
tactics actually about the kind of

614
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:05,128
scourge and danger of outdoor cannabis

615
00:23:02,398 --> 00:23:06,748
and and their their driving policy as

616
00:23:05,128 --> 00:23:07,978
this stuff rolls out nationwide and

617
00:23:06,749 --> 00:23:10,108
there's really no one and there's no

618
00:23:07,979 --> 00:23:12,509
organizations in a national level yet to

619
00:23:10,108 --> 00:23:14,579
kind of counter this and so that's

620
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:17,339
something I would like to do soon Jeremy

621
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:19,378
is we need to deal with this yeah yeah

622
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:20,788
yeah we need to try to stay ahead of it

623
00:23:19,378 --> 00:23:23,278
a little bit because we don't want to

624
00:23:20,788 --> 00:23:25,679
see the entire country with 90 percent

625
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:29,579
indoor cannabis creating a huge carbon

626
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,769
disaster that while you know our world

627
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:33,358
is drowning and people are dying and and

628
00:23:31,769 --> 00:23:34,440
our children are gonna have a really

629
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:36,329
shitty place to live in our

630
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,710
grandchildren and you know maybe it's

631
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:39,509
too late but I like to think we should

632
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:42,028
still you know try to at least do what

633
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:44,489
we can to modulate how bad it is we also

634
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:47,519
have to realize what cannabis has done

635
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:49,590
to it has created this whole new form of

636
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:52,048
Agriculture called industrialized indoor

637
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:55,288
agriculture so well now it took a

638
00:23:52,048 --> 00:23:58,108
high-value crop like marijuana to sort

639
00:23:55,288 --> 00:24:00,118
of advance the science enough that LEDs

640
00:23:58,108 --> 00:24:03,228
are cheap enough and that you can kind

641
00:24:00,118 --> 00:24:06,538
of you know now we can consider sort of

642
00:24:03,229 --> 00:24:08,999
just full indoor agriculture which is

643
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:12,028
just kills my yeah you know it just it

644
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:13,829
it's it's yes maybe in some futuristic

645
00:24:12,028 --> 00:24:15,239
world where we can't breathe the air or

646
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:18,418
we got to go to different planets we

647
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:20,909
need this technology but farming is is

648
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:22,170
the way that you sustainably produce

649
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:25,200
goods

650
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,430
food in this country remain yeah and we

651
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,930
need to try to preserve what we have

652
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,580
like you know I don't think we're at the

653
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:31,560
point where we just write it all off as

654
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:35,309
a complete disaster and that let's just

655
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:36,690
you know fuck like you know we're not at

656
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:37,889
that point yet and we should never be at

657
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:39,620
that point there's always hope and we

658
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,850
want to try to have this planet at least

659
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:45,629
you know go downhill a little bit slower

660
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:47,639
we want to I keep stuff nice so and the

661
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:50,970
other thing that sun-grown has done at

662
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,860
least in Washington Washington really

663
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,720
has the most successful legalization in

664
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:57,839
the country and because the people that

665
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,640
are measure legalization success is not

666
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,919
the business owners it's the tax

667
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,460
collectors and the consumers and the tax

668
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:07,380
collectors are reaping it in in

669
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,660
Washington and the consumers are loving

670
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,730
it too they've got an you know of course

671
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,769
it's all on the backs of farmers let's

672
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,450
not let's not forget who's actually

673
00:25:13,769 --> 00:25:17,730
bearing the cost it's not the retailer's

674
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:19,620
it's even not even the processors it's

675
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,240
the producers that are that are the ones

676
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:22,979
and we've seen this story over and over

677
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,490
and over right this is how agriculture

678
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:30,180
is gone in America is that the farmers

679
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:31,799
get screwed so we're kind of we're what

680
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,570
we think it was gonna be any different

681
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:37,349
but sun-grown

682
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:39,929
really is what made Washington such a

683
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:41,579
successful experiment and legalization

684
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:42,900
because you come to eat you go to

685
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:44,279
Colorado you're gonna pay more and

686
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,810
you're gonna have less quality you're

687
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:47,460
gonna have less choices and they're

688
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:49,679
collecting less taxes you go to

689
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,789
Washington you're gonna pay less even

690
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,500
though there's more taxes collected

691
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:54,720
you're gonna have more choices and the

692
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,930
quality's gonna be higher so you know

693
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,180
you can thank your son growers for that

694
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:02,220
the question is what's sort of peaking

695
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:06,539
our interest in the production side of

696
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:09,360
of cannabis and you know I've actually

697
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:12,149
sort of taken it the other way I'm

698
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:16,319
buying less products than I ever have I

699
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:19,140
am doing less sort of compost teas or or

700
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:22,700
or anything and and it's really because

701
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:25,920
I've fully adopted living soils and and

702
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:28,230
understanding what living soils are you

703
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,240
don't buy living soils you don't

704
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,819
purchase products that get you living

705
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,669
soils it's really a long term

706
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:38,638
to building up your soil health and

707
00:26:35,669 --> 00:26:41,070
after five years you know I'm finally

708
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:43,288
realizing that benefit and so I'm buying

709
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:45,058
very very little nutrients you know

710
00:26:43,288 --> 00:26:47,519
there's two ways to look at nutrients

711
00:26:45,058 --> 00:26:49,648
one is as a streamflow right and

712
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:51,690
hydroponics are exactly that right the

713
00:26:49,648 --> 00:26:52,168
nutrients go by the roots and when

714
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,820
they're done

715
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:55,740
they go down the drain and then if you

716
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:58,678
gotta bite be treated before phosphates

717
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,759
or nitrates whereas my view of nutrients

718
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:01,860
are the more sustainable view of

719
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,019
nutrients is it's a bucket and you fill

720
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:05,459
the bucket and then as you grow you know

721
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:06,870
you pull just a little bit out of that

722
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,399
bucket as you harvest and you just need

723
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:10,829
to tap that bucket off a little bit you

724
00:27:08,398 --> 00:27:12,569
know and so that's kind of how I how I

725
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:16,079
think about it and so it's really just

726
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:17,759
my thinking that's changed and and it

727
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,278
reminds me back at their guerrilla days

728
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,378
of growing in the hills you know because

729
00:27:20,278 --> 00:27:24,509
that was the Korean natural farming we

730
00:27:22,378 --> 00:27:26,069
just didn't have the words for it you

731
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,929
know we used to go out into the woods

732
00:27:26,069 --> 00:27:29,579
and we kind of carry fertilizers they

733
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:31,200
were too heavy and so we would go out

734
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:32,849
there and we'd oh there's some deciduous

735
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,460
trees you know we'd go grab the

736
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:37,259
deciduous soil and then we'd grab the

737
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,879
Duff under the pines and then we would

738
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:41,519
you know get them all together and that

739
00:27:38,878 --> 00:27:45,240
that's really kind of what's got me

740
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:47,909
excited and really just not having to do

741
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:50,250
anything to your soil and still

742
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:52,350
producing high-quality product is yeah

743
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:54,599
and I I'm right there with you Jeremy

744
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:56,819
I'm like just reducing inputs like your

745
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:58,528
year after year and the same thing our

746
00:27:56,819 --> 00:28:00,599
first few years we bought a lot of stuff

747
00:27:58,528 --> 00:28:02,519
and every year we buy less and less soil

748
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:03,869
gets better and better and that's like

749
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:06,690
that's a really and the nutrient

750
00:28:03,869 --> 00:28:08,609
deficiencies exactly and trying to juice

751
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,769
and trying to figure out ways to also to

752
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:13,349
streamline via like reduction in

753
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:15,179
nutrients and also you know utilizing

754
00:28:13,349 --> 00:28:16,888
kind of conventional agricultural

755
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:18,509
techniques like you know vineyard

756
00:28:16,888 --> 00:28:19,859
trellising so that's something we have

757
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:22,470
been geeking out on the last two years

758
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:24,028
is for some reason cannabis trellising

759
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,528
has always been this like huge truckin

760
00:28:24,028 --> 00:28:28,019
project like you know they'd use like

761
00:28:25,528 --> 00:28:30,329
like fence like metal fencing and like

762
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:32,190
you know that plastic net ena so just

763
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:33,538
know it's disposable every year you have

764
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,769
to throw out a bunch of platen asti

765
00:28:33,538 --> 00:28:36,028
plastic netting where does that end up

766
00:28:34,769 --> 00:28:38,069
probably in the ocean some of its

767
00:28:36,028 --> 00:28:39,808
getting swallowed by whales I mean so

768
00:28:38,069 --> 00:28:41,308
we've been eliminating plastics from our

769
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:44,038
operation and the form of ground cover

770
00:28:41,308 --> 00:28:45,269
we have moved to all you know basically

771
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:46,859
cover crop

772
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:48,779
weed so we have a blend of cover crop

773
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:50,309
and natural weeds and you know whereas

774
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:52,019
we used to be much more concerned about

775
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:53,339
the weeds we've realized actually the

776
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:54,480
weeds are not causing any problem

777
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:55,740
they're helping us retain water and

778
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,690
they're providing a habitat for

779
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,519
beneficial insects and they're keeping

780
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:01,559
the dust down and like so we've stopped

781
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,809
stressing out about weeds oh we we do

782
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:06,569
fetch clover and then we do some

783
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:11,909
beneficial insect attracting plants like

784
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:14,519
yarrow Colangelo some radish family type

785
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:16,200
plants cilantro parsley so we put a

786
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,940
bunch of that out kind of around our

787
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,700
parameters to kind of provide habitat

788
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,529
for beneficial x' on our Isles we do a

789
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,210
mixture of we seed with vaatrik and

790
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:25,680
clover and then the natural weeds are

791
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:27,420
very vigorous and we can't really stop

792
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,100
them and we've given up crying and it

793
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,600
causes no problems and so we've saved a

794
00:29:29,099 --> 00:29:31,709
lot of labor and energy like fighting

795
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:33,899
weeds and that's something where a lot

796
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,370
of new farmers they think weeds are the

797
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,380
enemy and we've got to fight the weeds

798
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:39,689
you got to weed it you got to hold them

799
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,940
up and it is such a waste of effort cuz

800
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:46,680
we were there we tried that and all it

801
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:49,769
was was labor and back-breaking horrible

802
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,539
you know sweaty well anywhere that grew

803
00:29:49,769 --> 00:29:54,180
back two weeks later I better was set up

804
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:55,859
by rule you know but then we were

805
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,480
talking earlier about how there's

806
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:59,299
constantly rules that seem to be

807
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,500
advantageous for indoor growers and

808
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:04,230
disadvantageous for outdoor growers and

809
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,480
one of them was yeast in molds yeast and

810
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:08,400
molds is the most arbitrary measure of

811
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,099
that you could possibly apply it means

812
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,330
nothing you know in fact we know that a

813
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:15,059
lot of these yeasts and molds are very

814
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:16,649
beneficial and so in the early days I

815
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:20,399
was so concerned about yeast and mold

816
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:22,320
that I we buried my entire farm and I'm

817
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,980
glad I did I think I've totally reduced

818
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:28,139
my amounts of fails for for use in molds

819
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,880
we eventually got that that requirement

820
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,259
for testing removed thank goodness

821
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,030
there's still some states out there

822
00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:35,609
doing it totally dumb you should stop

823
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:37,319
now we replaced it with with testing for

824
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:39,479
mycotoxins which actually kill people

825
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:41,689
can actually hurt people I mean before

826
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,160
under the old rules you could pass a

827
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:46,769
yeast and mold test and you could be

828
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,050
full of acidulous and actually be

829
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:51,839
harmful so now you know that was a huge

830
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:54,059
win for the Sun growers another rule

831
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:56,279
that was really disadvantageous to us

832
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:59,129
was the requirement for the harvest date

833
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:01,559
on the packaging and you know

834
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:03,660
didn't understand that curing and all

835
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:05,789
that and so they would just call it old

836
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,410
and then the retailers you know they

837
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:09,119
would use that date to see be like oh

838
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,710
it's been six months we want a 20%

839
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:12,419
decrease in your cosmic well actually

840
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,769
it's cured longer and it's more

841
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,680
expensive yeah

842
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:19,379
and so but back to the cover cropping

843
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,960
I'm totally geeking out on that for the

844
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,460
first time too because my new farm you

845
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,130
know that I don't that I'm building now

846
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,480
I I don't have those same concerns

847
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:30,030
anymore now that the yeast and mold

848
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:33,200
requirement is gone so I'm adopting much

849
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:35,490
more of the practices that Jade has and

850
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,769
totally geeking out on like what you

851
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:42,029
know crimson are not crimson but a white

852
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:44,309
clover and annual ryegrass and that's

853
00:31:42,029 --> 00:31:47,339
you know hopefully to knock out some of

854
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:48,750
the perennial grasses and and compete

855
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:50,970
with the weeds so I'm really excited

856
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:54,690
about that I'm getting a roller for my

857
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:56,910
tractor so I can roll them in and yeah

858
00:31:54,690 --> 00:32:00,299
and start to start to put that nitrogen

859
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:02,490
fixing stuff in there just don't pay for

860
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:04,710
stuff yeah I stuff in plastic bags don't

861
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:06,720
generate waste and your farming you

862
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:08,910
really don't need to at the end of the

863
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,009
day it's a plant and it's a very special

864
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:12,540
plant but as far as growing it and stuff

865
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:14,460
it's not that special and there been

866
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:16,049
farmers growing all kinds of crops for

867
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:18,630
thousands of years and humans know how

868
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:21,210
to farm and so just applying like you

869
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:22,230
know ancient you know you knowledge and

870
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:24,960
farming knowledge that we've been

871
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:27,120
gathering for thousands of years to

872
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,039
cannabis is a perfectly reasonable and

873
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,779
preferable approach everyone wants to

874
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,389
reinvent the wheel of cannabis and it's

875
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:35,700
just it's already we can do this we know

876
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:37,830
how to grow plants humans are excellent

877
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,930
at it so we just need to you know use

878
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:47,819
our existing knowledge and and just get

879
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:51,539
better that way we're ground growers

880
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:54,149
we're in the ground we're big believers

881
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:56,250
of being in the ground you know the

882
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:58,650
smart pots I call them dumb pots I mean

883
00:32:56,250 --> 00:33:00,779
they're they're so dumb I mean you got

884
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:03,450
two hundred gallon yeah I know they're

885
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:04,829
around here somewhere you know you got a

886
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:06,210
two hundred gallon pot you can't you

887
00:33:04,829 --> 00:33:09,389
can't move

888
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:10,579
you got a fabric a case that's Denari

889
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,750
elastics

890
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:15,029
you know you don't yeah you don't

891
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:16,319
totally know what it's what's my about a

892
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:17,910
Grampa

893
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:20,129
and they're just silly and they dry out

894
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:22,040
you know right especially when you're in

895
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:24,690
the desert and whatnot just doesn't work

896
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:26,759
every farm is different we are blessed

897
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:28,920
with sandy loam soils so we can tractor

898
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:30,960
til it we can plant you know we got good

899
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,060
drainage there are situations where you

900
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,549
might have poor drainage the soil is

901
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:37,019
rocky clay where I'm remediating that

902
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:39,059
soil and getting it to a point where you

903
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:40,920
get drainage would be ridiculously

904
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:42,419
expensive so bringing in soil and doing

905
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,980
raised beds is a very reasonable

906
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,800
approach in some situations and that's

907
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:48,960
what we did and that's what yeah you

908
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,389
have to assess your individual soil type

909
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,640
and location and make the decision we've

910
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:56,160
done that we followed Phil we did Phil

911
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:58,800
and drill because you know the cost of

912
00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:02,340
just basically bringing in 12 inches of

913
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:04,740
soil is extreme and often with negative

914
00:34:02,339 --> 00:34:07,949
environmental impacts so our approach

915
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:10,918
was to drill a hole in the ground and

916
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:12,418
fill it up with soil and of course you

917
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:15,059
know we don't use Fagin on peat moss

918
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:17,309
that's a unsustainable non-renewable

919
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:21,269
product that is widely used in this

920
00:34:17,309 --> 00:34:23,579
industry we have a peat bog within 30

921
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:25,259
miles of the farm that's hip numpy which

922
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:27,418
is actually a much better peat in my

923
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,300
mind as far as holding water and whatnot

924
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:32,369
and that is deliver mixed up by a local

925
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,250
guy and then delivered in a 60 yard

926
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:37,648
truck so you know we don't grow in the

927
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:39,869
native soil at all in fact I I'm very

928
00:34:37,648 --> 00:34:43,319
careful to keep the native soil even

929
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:46,799
from even from coming into my holes it's

930
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,870
just it's this it's this silt that if it

931
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,820
gets on the top of a hole it'll create

932
00:34:48,869 --> 00:34:53,309
an impermeable layer and the oxygen

933
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,769
can't get through so you're lucky to

934
00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:57,148
have good soil we've it's probably been

935
00:34:55,769 --> 00:34:59,610
one of our biggest cost but it was a

936
00:34:57,148 --> 00:35:02,039
one-time cost you know you we brought

937
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:04,230
the soil in one time and now we're in

938
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:13,829
our we're going in our sixth year of no

939
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:16,380
tail living soil yes yeah so Tarara can

940
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:18,809
only go so far you know like in you

941
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:20,519
gotta have good soil for grapes like bad

942
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:22,889
soil seems to be a thing yeah you know

943
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:25,710
but for marijuana no it ya likes good

944
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:26,219
soil and you've got to have good soil so

945
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,869
you

946
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:29,519
it gets difficult to talk about tirar

947
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:29,970
and particularly if you're an indoor

948
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:32,369
grower

949
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:33,598
don't talk about tirar just leave that

950
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:38,000
alone that's our language

951
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:47,130
you've got drywall terroir indoors

952
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:49,050
Chinese drywall but it's the surrounding

953
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:52,200
structures in the environment so yeah

954
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:54,960
welcome 156 percent humidity and 72

955
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:57,179
degrees do for you 24 hours a day you

956
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,980
know I mean here's the thing with indoor

957
00:35:57,179 --> 00:36:00,539
gross right there they're the they're

958
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:02,639
the definition of monoculture

959
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:04,619
environments I mean they are such a

960
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:07,108
controlled environment that that plant

961
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:08,490
is not expressing itself I mean the

962
00:36:07,108 --> 00:36:10,650
terpenes are a response to the

963
00:36:08,489 --> 00:36:12,569
environment and if your environment is

964
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:14,369
always 72 degrees and 56 percent

965
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:16,800
humidity you're not good you're not

966
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:18,780
getting a response out of that we're not

967
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,840
gonna get a higher quality product at

968
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:24,060
Bastyr I studied herbal medicine and so

969
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,460
one of my teachers who I see as one of

970
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:28,019
my mentors he's one of the most

971
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,519
brilliant minds in herbal medicine he

972
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,289
taught us in this class called farm acog

973
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,389
nnessee he said the best herbal

974
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:36,119
medicines come from plants that are

975
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:39,088
slightly nutrient deprived slightly

976
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:40,980
water deprived have weeds when there's

977
00:36:39,088 --> 00:36:42,239
insects around and insect pressure and

978
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,980
those plants you're gonna get the

979
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:45,899
highest production of secondary plant

980
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,400
compounds which are what cannabinoids

981
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,170
and terpenoids are they are plant

982
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,730
defense mechanisms and so by having

983
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:53,010
those stressors you're gonna get a

984
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:54,630
higher quality medicine and cannabis is

985
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:56,070
a medicine and those compounds that

986
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:58,230
we're all looking for terpenes and

987
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,580
cannabinoids those are those compounds

988
00:36:58,230 --> 00:37:02,280
that you need those stressors to

989
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:03,539
maximize those items and that was

990
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,740
something that he taught us not he

991
00:37:03,539 --> 00:37:06,630
didn't even teach about cannabis at all

992
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:08,729
but that applies obviously to cannabis

993
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,769
and and we need to get that narrative

994
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,000
out there oh yeah and and you know I've

995
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:13,440
got some old-timers that have been

996
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,059
around weed forever and they're like oh

997
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,070
that indoor weed just doesn't do it for

998
00:37:15,059 --> 00:37:18,719
me and and there's reason that it's not

999
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,010
doing them for forum and you know that I

1000
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:21,659
have one guy who's like just doesn't

1001
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,820
have legs you know and it doesn't

1002
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:24,539
because the Cameron oi profile is very

1003
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,240
narrow

1004
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:28,858
you know indoor growers are harvesting

1005
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:30,329
early because they want to they want it

1006
00:37:28,858 --> 00:37:31,559
they got a big power bail and they don't

1007
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:33,329
want to keep on going so they're not

1008
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:35,849
allowing the cannabinoid profile to

1009
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:39,119
widen out with the CBN CBG CBC's

1010
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:39,900
everything else that that really adds to

1011
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,420
that

1012
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:45,480
a fact and if and if all you're doing is

1013
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:47,760
is growing short flowering time early

1014
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,099
harvest then you're gonna end up with a

1015
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,960
very narrow terpene profile and a very

1016
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,489
narrow camera knowing profile and that's

1017
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:55,050
why the old-timers there's some truth to

1018
00:37:53,489 --> 00:37:56,399
what they're saying you've got to go

1019
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,140
back and you got to hit that bonk ten

1020
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,730
minutes after you eat it and it's just

1021
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:01,079
they don't doesn't have legs it doesn't

1022
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:03,690
stick with you because it doesn't have

1023
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,309
all of those camera noids interacting

1024
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:07,559
themselves in the entourage effect and

1025
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:14,519
making that long-lasting effect but it

1026
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:20,639
looks pretty right it looks in the joint

1027
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:24,179
you see it that's what's driving these

1028
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:27,059
these bud tenders to sort of you know

1029
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:29,279
have this undue preference for indoor

1030
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:30,509
grown is that they they look at it and

1031
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,220
I've tried to explain to them it's like

1032
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:35,100
look you're not looking at it you're

1033
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:36,539
gonna smoke it you know and and and I

1034
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:39,119
call it loud weed I've been calling

1035
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:41,909
indoor weed loud weed for you know ten

1036
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,619
years and it's not a compliment and you

1037
00:38:41,909 --> 00:38:46,649
know loud weed is it

1038
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:48,839
it looks bright green because they was

1039
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:50,340
pumped full of ammonium nitrates because

1040
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:53,880
they wanted the yield you know and then

1041
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:56,400
they had to use a cleaner too like those

1042
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:00,059
nitrates so it doesn't you know end up

1043
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:03,030
being a black ash at the end it's it's

1044
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:05,639
white and try Co me because it's like

1045
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:08,610
like crystal try because it wasn't

1046
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:10,379
allowed to mature so a lot of those

1047
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:11,670
trichome structures get really jacked up

1048
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,410
and so it's not that there's actually

1049
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:15,840
more cannabinoid in there but the

1050
00:39:13,409 --> 00:39:17,789
surrounding cuticles on it cry trichomes

1051
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,890
are larger and so it looks more

1052
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:22,110
crystalline it's not more cannabinoid

1053
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:24,500
it's just more kind of the surrounding

1054
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:27,570
structure of that try crow trichome

1055
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:29,639
filling in from extra carbon dioxide and

1056
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:31,890
nutrients and also not allowed to turn

1057
00:39:29,639 --> 00:39:33,869
milky or even not allowed to turn

1058
00:39:31,889 --> 00:39:36,199
reddish which is an indication that your

1059
00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:39,269
gut your CBN's and that you're actually

1060
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:41,189
getting to a mature plant you know so

1061
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:43,259
there's all of these forces that that

1062
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:44,880
kind of contribute to this loud weed the

1063
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:46,950
other thing is that you know you open it

1064
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,920
up and it kind of overwhelms you in the

1065
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:52,679
initial or odor well that's when your

1066
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,670
volatize entertain like that that means

1067
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:56,489
you didn't cure

1068
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:58,440
at all and and and that's not gonna be

1069
00:39:56,489 --> 00:40:00,028
good either because you're gonna end up

1070
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,150
the taste is gonna have this fresh e

1071
00:40:00,028 --> 00:40:06,750
greenish taste because it wasn't allowed

1072
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:08,700
to mellow some of those compounds out so

1073
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:11,579
that's what loud weed is bright green

1074
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:15,528
smells amazing and doesn't get you high

1075
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:15,528
as like got like sun-grown does

1076
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,679
