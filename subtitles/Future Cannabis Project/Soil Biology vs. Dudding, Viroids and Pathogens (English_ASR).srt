1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,080
Scot we have a bunch of living soil G

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:11,910
damn KNF enthusiasts watching right now

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,548
and I know you run a lot of you you do a

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,399
lot of experimentation and so can you

5
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:18,629
talk about maybe like I love that you I

6
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:21,028
don't know if you still have your home

7
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:23,099
bro but like it seems like you were

8
00:00:21,028 --> 00:00:25,710
always experimenting there to you know

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,769
prove or disprove things so can you talk

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,880
about some things that you've been

11
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:33,869
experimenting and what you've learned

12
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:36,469
whether it's related to pests or plant

13
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:39,238
growth but generally the kind of

14
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:43,308
ecosystem of microbes plant roots and

15
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:43,308
plants and soil and all that stuff

16
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:50,609
mm-hmm yes deep I guess yeah I guess to

17
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:52,649
clarify yeah my wife Sarah and I we we

18
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:55,920
use our personal home grow to really

19
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,480
just go bananas on and it's one of the

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,300
reasons why I really should is because I

21
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,159
don't think the mindset of the average

22
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:04,048
viewer from the internet can really wrap

23
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,209
their head around what we're doing they

24
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,740
just see that there's mold in my garden

25
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:10,019
and they sat on no shit but they don't

26
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:12,209
understand that we're purposely putting

27
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:13,920
in there so that we can get repetitions

28
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:16,589
on how to defeat it so that I can

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,259
confidently go into the facility and fix

30
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,329
things and so yeah so the last run that

31
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,099
we did we were I purposely let him get

32
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:26,789
moldy so we could clear it out the run

33
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:28,919
before that I took in some spider mite

34
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,600
infested clones and duked it out with

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,090
those and then and so that's what we do

36
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,739
because you know my job is fixing

37
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,540
problems and I come from a sports

38
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:40,949
background so if you're gonna be asked

39
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,130
to hit home runs in the World Series you

40
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,409
better do some batting practice so the

41
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:49,140
stuff that we've seen is pretty much

42
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,719
completely removed any fear of a problem

43
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,819
from us just because we've seen such

44
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:56,629
horrific problems and navigated people

45
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:59,129
out of them using living soil techniques

46
00:01:56,629 --> 00:02:00,750
to kind of tie in what Kevin was saying

47
00:01:59,129 --> 00:02:04,949
earlier is we come into these facilities

48
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:07,049
that have a dysfunctional attachment to

49
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,270
genetics and there's a lot of times we

50
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,730
come in with a new cultivator to

51
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,770
renovate a property and the property

52
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:15,709
owners insist that they maintain

53
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,850
genetics so we've had a lot of

54
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,680
experience taking clones that were

55
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:22,439
contaminated with things like Michael

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,450
butanol and avid and all the things that

57
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,819
you're not at all supposed years but

58
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:31,079
during the times of problem they did use

59
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:32,969
and so what we found is if you have good

60
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,610
mineral density in your soil and you

61
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:38,460
have high populations of good soil food

62
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:40,800
web organisms all the things that tissue

63
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:45,450
culture claims nature also has a

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:48,990
strategy for and so you know if you have

65
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:51,209
really high biological populations if

66
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:54,000
there is a virus in the plant the plant

67
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:56,280
has the ability to kind of quarantine it

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,990
to a branch and it'll form like this

69
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:04,169
really weird callus almost like it has a

70
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:06,840
like scar tissue you know a lot of the

71
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:10,769
things that tissue culture claims that

72
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,780
is the benefit good living soil biology

73
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:15,390
and good or mineral density can also

74
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:19,319
provide those same benefits there was

75
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:21,629
one particular farm that had plants that

76
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:24,090
were you know coated in systemic

77
00:03:21,629 --> 00:03:27,750
fungicides they were treated with avid

78
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,819
things like that and we actually put

79
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:33,209
them into a good living soil system vege

80
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:34,919
dam out we hacked out the that first

81
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,979
biomass that came out and threw it away

82
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:41,009
that next round of biomass that came out

83
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:42,810
we cloned ran through propagation and

84
00:03:41,009 --> 00:03:48,419
into the flowering and all that flower

85
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:50,370
tested clean so in about a you know six

86
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:52,319
week period we were able to clean some

87
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,060
plants up get them ready for production

88
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,530
and the flower tested clean which

89
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,439
actually kind of blew the mind in the

90
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,479
lab stay all all the lab said that there

91
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,479
was no way that was gonna work we didn't

92
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,619
know we were just tinkering and so I

93
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:07,319
think there's a lot of untapped

94
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:11,849
potential out there that people have no

95
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:14,250
real idea exists because you know the

96
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:15,719
peat the people that did that study they

97
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,079
definitely don't tell anybody about it

98
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:21,418
and I was back in I was in like mid 2017

99
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,039
when we did that and you know that farm

100
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,990
is definitely not that information

101
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,710
because that's a tremendous advantage in

102
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,449
the market if you can clean up

103
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:31,000
in a few weeks you're not gonna share

104
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:33,550
that with your neighbor we did that with

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,439
when the years ago would before it

106
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:39,250
before dark heart said that they found

107
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:41,168
the virus Rick crumb was a virologist so

108
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,629
I don't know if you know Rick but crime

109
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:46,240
and a couple guys from I say UCLA

110
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:49,168
brought us plants and Alan Atkinson and

111
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,490
I had a conversation about using

112
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:53,829
biologically driven methodologies to

113
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,650
increase natural resistance and would it

114
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:59,319
work against a virus and so next thing I

115
00:04:56,649 --> 00:05:02,348
know I got some virus plants with me and

116
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:03,788
I was able to do the tests and we were

117
00:05:02,348 --> 00:05:05,978
able to get the plant back to

118
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:07,598
functionality to where it had no change

119
00:05:05,978 --> 00:05:09,848
because we had already had labs on a

120
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:12,728
prior so I knew what it did when it was

121
00:05:09,848 --> 00:05:14,889
clean and then we saw what it did when

122
00:05:12,728 --> 00:05:17,110
it was affected and then we saw what it

123
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:19,840
did after the cleansing but it didn't

124
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,360
remove the virus it just brought it to a

125
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,339
level that was workable so we kind of we

126
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,560
what we used an analogy of it was kind

127
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:28,899
of like the way magic Johnson was able

128
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,810
to get HIV to a level that it was almost

129
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:34,149
non detectable and non-invasive in his

130
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,500
life it doesn't change the fact that he

131
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:39,489
still holds it in his body

132
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:41,529
and so TC doesn't change the fact that

133
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,418
good biologically driven methods of

134
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:46,119
production are to me are the the best

135
00:05:43,418 --> 00:05:49,149
way to get a plant resistance high and

136
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:54,430
and I think that it helps shed and scrub

137
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:55,989
issues but TC is is by far the only it's

138
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,389
you're not going to get that virus

139
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,978
problem any virus out of the plant

140
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:02,348
completely you'll just get it to a

141
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:04,718
workable level and what we found was we

142
00:06:02,348 --> 00:06:06,579
took those plants and then put them into

143
00:06:04,718 --> 00:06:08,529
any other environment other than that

144
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:10,810
biologically driven went back in the

145
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:12,968
like a chemical situation the bio

146
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:14,978
factors that allow that to function

147
00:06:12,968 --> 00:06:16,750
weren't present and we don't know which

148
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:19,089
ones they were because the you know it's

149
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:22,689
too complex it's a combination not a

150
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:25,269
single thing and distress would then if

151
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:27,550
the plant got overheat it if it had too

152
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:30,189
much salinity you would see it start to

153
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,348
exhibit these viral traits and I didn't

154
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:33,848
get a chance to do the any work with

155
00:06:32,348 --> 00:06:37,269
them after that point but I would love

156
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:39,038
to seeing the change in viroid issue

157
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:39,889
within the plant meaning how much of

158
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,769
structure was

159
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:46,490
vascular bundles relative to what was

160
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:48,408
there prior so I'm someone who is like

161
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,120
my farm is biologically driven and I

162
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,199
don't seem to have any issues up top and

163
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,598
I'm grateful for that

164
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,939
but I do a lot of containment where I

165
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,918
don't let anybody go up the hill I don't

166
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:00,560
have any neighbors and I make sure that

167
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,810
my mineral density is as high as I can

168
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,589
drive it so that the plant has as much

169
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,959
natural response as possible but I still

170
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:11,538
think that you know science in in

171
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,908
prepper and preservation of things that

172
00:07:11,538 --> 00:07:17,740
are damaged and to protect the nursery

173
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:20,259
operations the tool to hold and clean I

174
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:23,718
don't see us ever going away from it

175
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:26,000
yeah and I definitely have a Kate tissue

176
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:27,439
culture I wasn't necessarily saying it's

177
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,658
definitely a tool it needs to be

178
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,460
implemented and from providing great

179
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:33,408
benefit I was just necessarily saying it

180
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:35,628
like Nature has a lot of strategies for

181
00:07:33,408 --> 00:07:37,310
these things yeah you know yeah yeah

182
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:38,990
totally totally and I fully agree

183
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:41,538
because you and I've had this

184
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,699
conversation many times about once the

185
00:07:41,538 --> 00:07:46,459
bottom end is right the plant seems to

186
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:48,740
work out the problem pretty well once

187
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:51,739
once we have the correct nutrient

188
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:54,860
balance the plan isn't exhibiting stress

189
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,930
symptoms that bring insects on once our

190
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:59,449
once our epidural layers are adequately

191
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:01,399
built we don't seem to have probing

192
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:04,728
insects penetrating and causing the

193
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:06,348
problems but the the thing is that I

194
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:08,628
know that it's a it's a secret you want

195
00:08:06,348 --> 00:08:10,639
to keep for the for yourself because

196
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:13,129
it's a market advantage but the

197
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,778
situation is that you're you're I mean

198
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:17,599
that's why I try to give information out

199
00:08:14,778 --> 00:08:19,490
all the time it's that we're in the

200
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:23,180
beginning of building an industry and

201
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:26,960
that if if more of us survive the better

202
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:30,379
and what that'll do is it allow much

203
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:32,689
better unity as an industry you have the

204
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:35,509
ability to have success success builds

205
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,399
finances finances built lobby lobby

206
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:38,809
builds influence and that's what we

207
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,000
don't have you don't have any of these

208
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:44,239
things and so a lot of this information

209
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,129
that's why you know these type of little

210
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,500
symposium we're on today is killer

211
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:51,078
because it's all unfiltered shit but you

212
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,370
get it in a real opinion and I think

213
00:08:51,078 --> 00:08:53,719
they know that that's the part that has

214
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,120
to get shared is that

215
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,340
the big picture has to be shown and then

216
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,500
the details that has to be worked out

217
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:04,280
individually

218
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:13,220
yeah we can only if only everybody would

219
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:15,679
get together we've all all of us have

220
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,170
had common interest on projects that we

221
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,209
wanted to see succeed and we try to do

222
00:09:18,169 --> 00:09:23,240
the best we can and I think that's what

223
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:26,180
the the public has to see meaning the

224
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,700
grow Republic is that so much of this

225
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:30,199
stuff is complicated and a lot of times

226
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,720
the only way you're gonna succeed is if

227
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,280
you share the information the larger

228
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,950
corporations they all believe they are

229
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:39,319
proprietary IP each one less we know now

230
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:48,590
we have all this top-secret shit and I'm

231
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:51,440
like it's a fucking sector yeah the

232
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:53,690
hybrid state of the yard all these you

233
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,520
know we're about to show the world you

234
00:09:53,690 --> 00:10:00,830
know it's pretty easy yeah I'm like

235
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,460
you're gonna show anybody shit uh-uh I

236
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:07,030
see a paint sprayer in there

237
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:07,030
[Laughter]
