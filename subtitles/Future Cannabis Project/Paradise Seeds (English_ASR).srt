00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,509
you very much for watching this is Arjun

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,400
from Paradise seeds

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:12,780
we're coming live to you from the

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,548
spannabis expo in barcelona 2019 for

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:17,368
those of you who are not aware of who

7
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:18,868
paradise seeds are well actually we've

8
00:00:17,368 --> 00:00:20,820
been here for a little while we've been

9
00:00:18,868 --> 00:00:22,289
here for twenty five years we're

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,810
actually celebrating our 25th

11
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,660
anniversary this year here at spannabis

12
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:30,210
and it's a great celebration indeed

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,719
because we have entered a few of our

14
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:37,049
varieties in spannabis Champions Cup and

15
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,829
we've actually taken second prize with

16
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:42,569
our Olay amnesia last night during the

17
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,730
awards ceremony so that was really

18
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,590
really exciting one of the three

19
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:49,409
varieties that we brought out together

20
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,359
with Tommy Chong and Chong's choice with

21
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:54,000
the finest seed collection of paradise

22
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:58,039
seeds that brings us now to about 37

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,420
different strains in our catalog here

24
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,730
there's seven different out of flowers

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,500
we've got a few CBD rich strains in

26
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,140
there so there's a whole big variety of

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,170
different things that are nice for

28
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,478
different types of growers indoor and

29
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,549
outdoor there goes a little package that

30
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,099
I wanted to show you so here's our

31
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,560
catalog now you grab the catalog here

32
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:23,609
show me this package let me show you

33
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,728
just because we found out yesterday that

34
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:29,340
there's fake packaging going around as

35
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:32,310
well for Paradise seeds now this is of

36
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,310
course the evident thing that happens

37
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,280
whenever you're successful people start

38
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,769
copying your stuff right so in Russia

39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,560
actually these Russian gangsters they've

40
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:46,019
copied our seeds and the package doesn't

41
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,759
even look anything like this so it's

42
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:49,438
very easy to spot the only thing that's

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,390
on that package is actually the logo

44
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,629
that's the correct thing but for the

45
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,519
rest the package is grey and it's square

46
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:59,578
so it really looks very strange but this

47
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,319
is the original packaging by paradises

48
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,629
this is the way it should should look

49
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:06,209
like so you zoom in to that I'll show

50
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:07,709
you the background of it as well the

51
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,149
back of it should look like this

52
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:12,479
there's a little bar code as well you

53
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:15,449
see now we got three five and ten packs

54
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:18,149
in our collection will very soon add one

55
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:21,810
and 50 packs to that as well so you will

56
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,189
have a lot more choice in in the number

57
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,569
of seeds that you'll find in the packs

58
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:30,930
and yeah so very exciting year for us

59
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:34,379
now the CBD strains today are very very

60
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:38,340
popular today in our portfolio we'll

61
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:41,039
have two strains that are CBD rich but

62
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,450
they're also still THC rich that means

63
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,739
they have a one to one ratio THC CBD

64
00:02:44,449 --> 00:02:50,159
which is very interesting from a

65
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:52,289
medicinal perspective of course and we

66
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,598
are currently in the test phase just

67
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:58,560
before releasing them so hopefully we

68
00:02:54,598 --> 00:03:01,768
will be releasing very soon CBD strains

69
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,259
that are high in CBD but low in THC so

70
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:07,110
they'll be between zero point two up to

71
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:10,828
zero point six percent of THC in there

72
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:13,380
but there'll be a high quantity of CBD

73
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:15,689
in there so we're very close to

74
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:23,068
releasing them so stay tuned for that

75
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:25,709
for sure that's a very difficult

76
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:27,929
question my man it's like asking a child

77
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,629
you know a mother was their favorite

78
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,370
child you know it's a little bit

79
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:34,919
depending on the weed you know also you

80
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:37,950
got good sativa you got bad indica I

81
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,958
love to smoke weed anyway it's for me a

82
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:42,388
sativa in the morning and an IndyCar

83
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:44,370
during the day but I'll do it the other

84
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,409
way around as well if it just comes like

85
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,170
that you know I just smoked liked to

86
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:51,269
smoke and enjoy good quality weed that

87
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:54,030
is clean weed that is preferably

88
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:58,069
organically grown you know that is a

89
00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:00,479
white ash that is a pure nice flavor and

90
00:03:58,068 --> 00:04:03,568
for me that is more important than the

91
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:05,609
indica sativa I think and I'm also very

92
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:08,099
fond of hybrids actually

93
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:10,230
have it yeah sure what are you going to

94
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,280

00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,009
case and this is actually a few years

101

102
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:35,219
excited to see this and well it's now

103

the background of our photo booth so you

104

110
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:06,089
this is the Chung's choice so we bought

111
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:08,310
three varieties to market last year with

112
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:10,649
Tommy Chong and songs choice and a pure

113
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:14,220
indica 90% indica with the blue cush

114
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:17,159
berry and then we did a hybrid with the

115
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,520
Mendocino skunk and we did a very strong

116
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:23,189
sativa with the LA amnesia and that is

117
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:26,399

different so the package here with

122

obviously with Tommy Chong on there and

123

00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,340
we actually ever brought to market 25

128
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:53,009
years ago this is because of our

129
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:54,750

strains in our catalog that we're giving

134
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:06,180

135
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:08,039
these are a little bit smaller packages

136
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,769
right so you see the regular packages

137
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,650
are like this and the promo pack is as

138

the smaller one so with every big one

140
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,649

141
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,720
