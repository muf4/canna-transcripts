1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,089
so here's an update on the auto flower

2
00:00:02,908 --> 00:00:11,910
project you can see the flowers are

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:15,480
starting to set it's June 10th so

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,190
they've been going since April 24th but

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,740
I want to show you is the shining model

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,420
of polyculture here people didn't

7
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:27,179
necessarily know if carrots would be

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:32,099
able to be planted with OTO flowers but

9
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:35,179
as you can clearly see they are working

10
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:37,379
it's working they're all the way down

11
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:40,019
and see there's different types of

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,320
carrots here some are smaller

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,730
fingerlings and some are bigger but

14
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,609
they've been working and there's lady

15
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:50,218
beetles carrots act the carrots are

16
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:53,039
acting as a banker plant system for the

17
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:56,030
lady beetles reproduction see there's

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,308
another one they're seen quite a few

19
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:03,780
reading along this border here of

20
00:00:59,308 --> 00:01:10,379
carrots and look see there's a lady

21
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:13,680
beetle larvae see that so this is a an

22
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:16,170
integrated model of polyculture it's

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:21,390
humboldt seed companies magic Mellon

24
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:25,859
auto flower carrots on one border

25
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:28,739
flanked by chamomile chamomile is also

26
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:32,400
to attract beneficial insects and it is

27
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:34,578
used to extract as medicine you can also

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,770
make a Sun to you with the chamomile

29
00:01:34,578 --> 00:01:40,949
just by harvesting the flowers putting

30
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:43,019
them in water in a glass jar letting

31
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,478
them sit in the Sun for 24 hours and

32
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:47,489
then that extract can be used as a

33
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:51,840
full-year feed for your plants or as a

34
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:55,769
drench it's traditionally used for roots

35
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,009
for sorry for seeds and preventing

36
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:00,298
damping off in seedlings as a antifungal

37
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:01,790
spray for damping off in seedlings

38
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,649
that's what it's traditionally used for

39
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:08,340
human meal does have I believe quite a

40
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:10,949
bit of calcium in it as well so this is

41
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,189
an integrated functioning polyculture

42
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:17,379
system

43
00:02:12,189 --> 00:02:19,000
with herbs cannabis and food and so I

44
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:22,719
just wanted to show you guys it actually

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,110
works and it can be done thanks for

46
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,109
watching
