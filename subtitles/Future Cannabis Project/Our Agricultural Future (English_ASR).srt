2
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:12,570
I'm mark Lester and I'm gonna be giving

3
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:14,099
a quick overview kind of a world of

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,260
controlled environment challenges that

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,910
we see moving forward I'll touch on some

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,789
of my own research but also research of

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:22,410
other individuals I wanted to put up

8
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,090
this slide because these are the factors

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,439
that ultimately we have to care about so

10
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:26,879
we've talked about a bunch of these ones

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,109
through the sessions up to this point

12
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:35,429
I'm the Past Chair of a group known as

13
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,750
the NCR 101 or NC er a 101 group it's a

14
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:38,460
controlled environment working group

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:41,189
that's sponsored by the United States

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,500
Department of Agriculture and as such

17
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:44,909
we're trying to develop stat well.not

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,689
standards we don't work on that directly

19
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:49,699
but we try to develop methodologies and

20
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:51,780
pattern I mean patterns and

21
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,190
recommendations for people to do growing

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,219
so this is a list of all the different

23
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:57,869
factors that we consider to be important

24
00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:00,239
there may be other ones that are need to

25
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:02,488
be added in the future one of the big

26
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,808
claims of the NCR 101 was that we were

27
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:06,688
the ones that came up with the idea of

28
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:08,459
par you will see later that maybe

29
00:01:06,688 --> 00:01:10,438
redefined it incorrectly but that's a

30
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:12,059
bit of a larger challenge it at least

31
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:13,679
allows us to start talking about things

32
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,090
on the same level so one of the

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,549
challenges that I've been seeing for the

34
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,560
last 20 years that I've been working in

35
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,420
this in this field is that when we

36
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,430
started in this area of most people talk

37
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,420
different languages so some people are

38
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:29,640
talking about lumens foot-candles

39
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,859
watts micro moles and all these things

40
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,209
were being used interchangeably and so

41
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,709
one of our goals has been to try to

42
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:36,868
actually unify so we can at least

43
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:38,099
compare apples to at least oranges so

44
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:40,140
that we're not comparing something

45
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:41,519
totally different on this and so you can

46
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,899
walk your way through these things so we

47
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,078
have the energy factors the water

48
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,939
factors atmospheric factors earth or

49
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,099
substrate as well as the structure and

50
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:51,599
the plant the part that we have the

51
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:53,309
poorest understanding by far is the

52
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,789
plant even though that's the system that

53
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,140
we're actually trying to allow to grow

54
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,509
our understanding of what it does and

55
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,670
how it behaves is actually quite poor if

56
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:03,629
we go through energy and light I'll show

57
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,030
that I think we have a poor

58
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:08,189
understanding of that water we're okay

59
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,489
with how much they were great atmosphere

60
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:13,020
were reasonably good substrate it's

61
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,240
still up for debate whether or not we're

62
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,850
quite where we need to be as a whole but

63
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,909
back to the plant ultimately I argue

64
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:22,199
with a lot of plant growers specifically

65
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:23,639
because they keep telling me about how

66
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:25,829
they have to improve the quality of the

67
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,019
soil and from my perspective I'm trying

68
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,730
to improve the quality of the plant soil

69
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,380
is just a mechanism for me to transfer

70
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:32,579
the nutrients and the water and

71
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:34,319
everything that is required for the

72
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,150
plant so if I'm slowly destroying the

73
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,889
soil it doesn't bother me because I'm

74
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:39,870
trying to make my plant healthy if

75
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:42,059
you're trying to grow healthy soil then

76
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,969
don't put plants in it is ultimately

77
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,819
what the solution is for that so

78
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:49,680
challenges that we have with the plants

79
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:51,569
ultimately in specifically in the world

80
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,490
to cannabis we have a large challenge

81
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:55,379
because it's been an illegal for so long

82
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:58,230
that it's not even really considered a

83
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:59,669
crop in its true sense it is a plant and

84
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:02,250
it falls in a lot of categories under

85
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:05,189
that place but plant breeder rights and

86
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,080
legal jurisdiction on who owns what it's

87
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:09,150
still up for debate so if you have a

88
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,500
variety or a strain or kheema for

89
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,300
whatever you want to call it

90
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,789
these aren't protected if I grab one of

91
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,219
those seeds it's now mine and so it

92
00:03:14,789 --> 00:03:18,659
doesn't fall under any legal category at

93
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:20,189
least from a Canadian perspective in

94
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,199
most places around the world fall into

95
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:25,819
that same place unlike if you're growing

96
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,839
wheat where there is an actual genetic

97
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:29,729
mapping that you can do and you can

98
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,110
identify the phenotypes that are being

99
00:03:29,729 --> 00:03:32,639
present in this and as such it can

100
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,930
actually belong to somebody so that we

101
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,729
can allow for the breeding and the

102
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,349
operation of this and this is one of the

103
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:39,000
large challenges that the government is

104
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:41,280
going to have to start to challenge or

105
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,560
put forward across both Canada and the

106
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,000
United States and around the world and

107
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,520
then we get into the whole breeding side

108
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,949
cannabis is the same as all other plants

109
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,570
it is a plant and they have a bit of a

110
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:53,458
genetic variation that happens and they

111
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:55,439
like to mutate and modify themselves

112
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,509
we've seen many plants that you'll have

113
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,800
two branches and one branch is one chemo

114
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:00,359
type and the other branch is a different

115
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,040
chemo type so you can get that with

116
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,230
apples where we do grafting when we see

117
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:06,599
these differences but we can see those

118
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:09,649
also with marijuana or the cannabis

119
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:11,909
strains also we also have the other

120
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,680
regulatory challenges and the actual

121
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:16,019
operational challenges so operation

122
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,549
diseases energy and electricity which

123
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,500
we've been chatting about for the last

124
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,149
couple days here the economics and the

125
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,040
policy and ultimately the end products

126
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,289
so what is it that we're actually after

127
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,970
on these things if we look at it from an

128
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,439
environmental stem

129
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,730
the light water atmosphere everything

130
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:33,209
that I've talked about has to be

131
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:34,740
determined how do we play with this and

132
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:36,539
one of the things that you'll see in

133
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,220
this slide which is why I wanted to

134
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,720
highlight that is most people are used

135
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,090
to growing plants with an overhead light

136
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,320
system but because of LEDs and their

137
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:44,849
lower temperature there's nothing that

138
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:46,949
says that we have to do that we can grow

139
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:49,710
put lights below or in your canopy or

140
00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:51,330
from the side we follow the principles

141
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:53,370
of having overhead lights because the

142
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:55,319
lights were really hot they were bright

143
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:56,759
and we said well we're just gonna mimic

144
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,439
the Sun I'm gonna stick them up in the

145
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,180
roof and shine it down plants to really

146
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,699
don't care where the photons come from

147
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,959
as long as the photon is coming to it it

148
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,699
can come from the bottom or from the

149
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:06,959
side or from the top and it doesn't

150
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:09,089
matter if it comes from an electrical

151
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,250
lighting system or from a solar system

152
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:12,869
the plant does not care what a photon is

153
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,180
once it is released from the reaction

154
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:18,410
and a photon is released the plant will

155
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,410
utilize it as it sees fit

156
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,840
and then finally we have our production

157
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,389
challenges and this is an area where the

158
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:26,429
engineers as well as a few others have

159
00:05:24,389 --> 00:05:27,780
to step up because right now with the

160
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,240
amount of production that we have out

161
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:31,888
there we don't have enough labor most

162
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,978
people don't want to go around and do

163
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:36,629
pruning continuously within their life

164
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:38,069
some people enjoy it it's relaxing but

165
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:39,360
as a whole this is going to be highly

166
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:41,159
labor-intensive and we just don't have

167
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,509
enough labor for this so we have to

168
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,400
figure out how to automate a lot of this

169
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,959
stuff and so I'm expecting we'll start

170
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,250
pushing these things down where human

171
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,959
actually doesn't touch the cannabis

172
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,310
plant the moment the seed is put into

173
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,288
the ground until it comes out the back

174
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,788
end we might have observational or

175
00:05:52,288 --> 00:05:55,139
they'll be computer systems for tracking

176
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:56,668
this but there won't be any human

177
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:58,050
intervention actually physically

178
00:05:56,668 --> 00:06:00,180
touching any of these things everything

179
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,560
will be automated and then as you go

180
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,478
through the list the drying trimming

181
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,550
grinding and extraction all these things

182
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:07,019
have to be automated a lot of these

183
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,669
things have come from the underground

184
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:10,889
market so some of them are quite good

185
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:12,240
some of them are not and one of the big

186
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:13,590
challenges we're gonna have to have is

187
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,180
actually trying to figure out which ones

188
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:17,098
are acceptable and which ones aren't and

189
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,199
the policies that need to be put forward

190
00:06:17,098 --> 00:06:20,909
and this session and the groups that are

191
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,860
involved with this at least been making

192
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:24,090
these efforts to try to put forward some

193
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,160
of these but there's still a lot of

194
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:27,269
disinformation out there I hear a lot of

195
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,370
growers telling me what they're planning

196
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:30,959
on doing and I just shake my head I'm in

197
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,840
awe that they'd be willing to do this to

198
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,939
a plant and I'll discuss a few of those

199
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:38,549
as we work our way through so this is my

200
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:39,660
laboratory I'll talk about almost

201
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,120
everything that's in the blue

202
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,470
there so a lot of pretty pictures and

203
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,470
that's why I like to hold it up there

204
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,300
but as a quick plug for myself the kale

205
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,400
plants in the center which is what

206
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,860
started my whole PhD world on this so I

207
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,560
cared about kale before anyone else did

208
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,180
for some reason little did I know that

209
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,889
other people would care about it because

210
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,680
when I started people would say what the

211
00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:03,930
heck is kale and now you can actually

212
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,670
buy it as a salad at McDonald's which I

213
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:09,449
find even more surreal that we've gone

214
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:10,980
to that statement so this is kind of an

215
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:12,990
overview of what my laboratory does but

216
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,040
it's also an overview of the the parks

217
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,480
that I'm going to talk about so the

218
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,069
parts that are bolded or how I'm going

219
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,020
to walk my way through this so I'll talk

220
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:20,699
about the history a little bit and then

221
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:22,709
the research areas that we have I do

222
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,060
work in the post-harvest the processing

223
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,379
and the monitoring systems out of this

224
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,970
and I can talk for a really long period

225
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:28,589
of time on those things you'll see a

226
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:30,240
little bit as I'm working my way through

227
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:31,799
this but predominantly the last half

228
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,939
will be on LEDs and the first half will

229
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:38,250
be on other projects so the start of

230
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:39,719
controlled environment basically started

231
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,800
well if you want to go all the way back

232
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,960
to the beginning was probably the

233
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,840
babylonians period that actually started

234
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,949
it with the hanging garden type systems

235
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:49,379
and there has been other efforts along

236
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:50,819
the way to try to bring it inside during

237
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,439
the second world war there was a big

238
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,110
push for this as we were doing island

239
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:56,160
hopping during the Pacific campaign and

240
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,720
so trying to figure out how to grow

241
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,919
plants in places that normally don't

242
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,200
grow a lot of plants so if you're on a

243
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:03,000
deserted island how do you pull this off

244
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,469
after a while it was the air force

245
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,480
predominantly that was in control of

246
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:08,220
that Russia did a lot of work with the

247
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,689
bio systems out of this and then NASA

248
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,270
kind of took it on because if we're ever

249
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:13,709
gonna leave Earth orbit we have to be

250
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:15,659
able to produce food for us to actually

251
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:17,789
stay in those locations so the first one

252
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,350
is the the cells project part of the

253
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:20,760
larger breadboard Pro job and that they

254
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,830
had down there there's been a lot of

255
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,110
them that has been tied together they

256
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:27,659
deal with a very very small chamber type

257
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:30,180
system so usually at best one meter by

258
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,260
one meter and in a lot of cases we have

259
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,719
to worry about all these different

260
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,279
control factors within a very very tight

261
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,320
space so one of the jokes that I've

262
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,059
always said is that if if you give me

263
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,490
enough energy I can grow any plant in a

264
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:43,859
thimble and it's not a joke we can do it

265
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,480
it just takes a lot of energy to try to

266
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,570
control this the larger your buffer the

267
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,730
less energy you need and then the second

268
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,360
picture is a plug for a University of

269
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,220
Arizona jean-jacques Mele which was

270
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,959
master's advisor and so they ended up

271
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,629
building a growth chamber that went to

272
00:08:55,958 --> 00:09:01,750
the the South Pole the part that's fun

273
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:04,838
about this is ultimately the food pseudo

274
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:06,370
okay ultimately the people have an

275
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,290
infinity for plants and people love

276
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,909
plants so that little area that you see

277
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:11,919
in front so this area in front right

278
00:09:09,909 --> 00:09:13,838
here is actually just two seats and it's

279
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,879
one of the most popular places at the

280
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,200
South Pole and so people have to book it

281
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:18,939
weeks in advance so that they can sit

282
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,640
there and do work or have a supper there

283
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:23,769
so that they can stare at the plants you

284
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:25,929
are in the middle of a snowy glacier for

285
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:29,289
all intents and purposes and so this is

286
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:30,669
kind of highlighted through we kind of

287
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:32,169
tell stories about amongst ourselves

288
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:33,429
that if you were gonna be isolated from

289
00:09:32,169 --> 00:09:34,838
the rest of the world for the rest of

290
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:36,729
your life what's the one organism you

291
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,730
take with you and for me it would be a

292
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:41,320
plant probably kale ultimately I know I

293
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:42,789
don't like kale that much but it's at

294
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,970
least one that I know that will survive

295
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:47,649
and it has its own quirkiness that makes

296
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,149
it interesting it's not one that's more

297
00:09:47,649 --> 00:09:51,129
passive like lettuce which doesn't do

298
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:55,208
very much it's more of a feisty type

299
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:57,070
plant so if you're walking through this

300
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,299
is a bunch of the NASA stuff so if you

301
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,699
want to hang out with anybody they're

302
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:02,559
kind of fun projects here I worked for

303
00:10:00,698 --> 00:10:04,448
orbit tech for a year and so when I

304
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,458
arrived this was the biomass production

305
00:10:04,448 --> 00:10:08,679
system it flew on the spacial for a

306
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:10,509
couple missions but the work that we

307
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:12,338
were doing actually evolved into the

308
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:14,169
veggie flat system so that's that system

309
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:16,360
so there's two systems that are sitting

310
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:17,769
on the space station right now and so it

311
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,659
allows the astronauts to have lettuce

312
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:21,159
one of the mandates that came about

313
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:22,750
through this is the astronauts now

314
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:25,088
mandate than all future human

315
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:26,649
spaceflight using NASA technology has to

316
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:27,970
have the ability to grow clients which

317
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:30,278
from my perspective is quite cool

318
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,620
because used to be that slightly people

319
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:34,389
cared and now people care a lot one of

320
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,740
the fun stories is that when they tasted

321
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:37,179
the lettuce the first time they said it

322
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,829
was some of the best-tasting lettuce or

323
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:41,319
the best-tasting lettuce that have ever

324
00:10:38,828 --> 00:10:43,179
had in their life about a year later

325
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,680
they grew kale and they asked what the

326
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:49,328
kale tasted like and they said it tasted

327
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:51,159
like kale so and then the the further

328
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:53,859
technology that's happened here is the a

329
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:55,120
pH so the advanced plant habitat so

330
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,740
these chambers are about a foot and a

331
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,259
half by foot now by a foot and a half

332
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,389
roughly in size and so they're fairly

333
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:03,610
small in the full control system for

334
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:05,620
controlling regulating everything light

335
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,430
temperature co2 you name it is all

336
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,049
occurring in that

337
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:10,750
that's spotted on the side here and

338
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:12,370
that's the actual chamber so we can do

339
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,350
fairly good work in very controlled

340
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,060
spaces the reason why I highlight this

341
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:18,790
is usually the people who are pushing

342
00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:20,588
the technology is this side but because

343
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:22,838
of cannabis and the deep pockets that

344
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:24,190
have been arrived because of that some

345
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,510
of the work is now flowing back the

346
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:27,580
other direction so there's this urban

347
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:30,220
flow that's happening in the world of

348
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:33,430
geology oil field is the one that

349
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,899
controls the the technology nASA uses it

350
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:37,389
to go explore Mars but then sometimes

351
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:39,129
Mars technology can come back and help

352
00:11:37,389 --> 00:11:41,019
the oil industry that's from my

353
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:45,458
experience working for a year in the oil

354
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:47,319
industry see you oh one too many so I

355
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:48,939
worked on a project called urban barns

356
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,560
it was an indoor plant growth system

357
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,240
this was when they were fully up and

358
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,629
running our biggest claim to fame was

359
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,180
that we were growing lettuce in a in

360
00:11:55,629 --> 00:12:01,389
under kosher condition so no insects on

361
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:03,429
it and so we actually were functional

362
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:04,659
economically our last quarter we made

363
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:06,939
twenty bucks and then they went defunct

364
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:09,069
thereafter but they were profitable for

365
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,520
one quarter I can say which I thought

366
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:15,490
was exciting okay so into my type of

367
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:17,470
research so we did that work to try to

368
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,269
make it economically viable and I

369
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:22,269
realized that as an academic ultimately

370
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:23,799
I suck at that my ideas are usually too

371
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:25,419
cutting edge too far out there and

372
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:27,759
doesn't always make it to the economic

373
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:29,019
side I still think at some point they're

374
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:30,669
all going to reach that point but I'm

375
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:32,829
not gonna ever be the one that will see

376
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:34,899
that it's kind of a freeing experience

377
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,520
once you realize that the ideas you have

378
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:37,929
are probably going to happen within your

379
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,600
own lifetime because it means I can push

380
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:41,889
on a lot of crazy things one of the big

381
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,720
challenges that we were talking about

382
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:46,000
was how do we actually deal with the

383
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,589
light and between controlled

384
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,360
environments and greenhouse type

385
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:50,560
environments and ultimately I ended up

386
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,329
building this greenhouse for the

387
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,799
northern space and so it actually has a

388
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:56,349
wall that can actually move itself up

389
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:58,419
and down so in the summertime it keeps

390
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,550
it open unless it starts getting too hot

391
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:01,929
and then it will close itself up in the

392
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:03,370
wintertime when there's no light it

393
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:04,989
closes itself up so you can actually use

394
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:06,789
this as a regulatory temperature

395
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,039
regulatory and light regulatory system

396
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:10,689
it also some light some temperature

397
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,009
management systems that also come in on

398
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,720
these things but you can actually see

399
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:15,939
the plants are growing reasonably happy

400
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,440
right on this side and you can actually

401
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,089
start playing with these different

402
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,129
factors so I'm hoping as

403
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:22,509
we start moving down some of this lower

404
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:25,120
carbon footprint type that we actually

405
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:26,829
start to evolve technologies to store

406
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,839
heat that's being produced in this in

407
00:13:26,828 --> 00:13:30,909
the daytime and able to use that in the

408
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:32,139
evening or in the cooler period and so

409
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:35,769
it's one of the challenges that we

410
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:38,049
ultimately have I've also done work on

411
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:39,669
tropical greenhouses so trying to

412
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:41,679
develop cooling systems so here's a

413
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:43,659
fairly standard tropical greenhouse has

414
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,219
the top roof where the Sawtooth design

415
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:45,789
air comes out and flows out through the

416
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,680
top there

417
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:49,299
ina developing a system to actually

418
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:52,568
cause cooling on this typically we use

419
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:54,429
fans I cheated if I can call it that and

420
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:56,110
I added a misting system into the middle

421
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:57,909
of it so it actually causes the coolant

422
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,558
loop to actually start to form naturally

423
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:01,269
within this side so it's a natural

424
00:13:59,558 --> 00:14:03,610
convection loop system using just water

425
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:05,169
out of this the advantage of it is I can

426
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,879
chill down the greenhouse to about five

427
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:08,378
degrees cooler than outside ambient

428
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,058
temperatures and it allows you to

429
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:11,709
actually maintain this so there's a lot

430
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:13,389
of Technology the reason why I'm

431
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:15,068
highlighting this is one big as I did it

432
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:17,558
and I think it's kind of cool technology

433
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:19,778
but the second thing is is that I find

434
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:21,039
that there's a lot of growers both in

435
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:22,929
the tomato industry as well as the

436
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:25,748
cannabis that are resistant to trying

437
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:28,058
new ideas and so sometimes you have to

438
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:30,278
set aside 10% of your greenhouse or your

439
00:14:28,058 --> 00:14:32,049
growth area and just try new technology

440
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:33,879
and see if it works for you I won't say

441
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:35,649
all of them work but there is places

442
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:38,409
that we need to do this if you want to

443
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:40,539
be the big huge canopy or or or such

444
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:41,799
like that fair enough but they should

445
00:14:40,539 --> 00:14:43,539
have their own branch that are doing

446
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:46,240
these technologies to try to test some

447
00:14:43,539 --> 00:14:49,870
of these parts I've also worked on

448
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,068
watering and control systems and so as

449
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,289
part of one of these we actually

450
00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:55,178
developed an automated monitoring system

451
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:57,849
so it was basically a camera that stared

452
00:14:55,178 --> 00:14:59,259
at a fruit so as the fruit grew and you

453
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,178
can actually see the fruit in the center

454
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:02,829
right here so it has a web camera

455
00:15:01,178 --> 00:15:03,698
sitting right there the fruit sitting in

456
00:15:02,828 --> 00:15:05,138
the middle here and we're just taking

457
00:15:03,698 --> 00:15:07,120
pictures of the fruit as it slowly

458
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:08,799
continues to grow people have done this

459
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,839
work in the past but they usually use 10

460
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,458
saw meters or calipers to try to measure

461
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,259
them we measured it about every couple

462
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,549
seconds as it was growing and the part

463
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:17,259
that's kind of fun about this is we can

464
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:19,808
actually see the growth pattern as it

465
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:21,850
moves itself up so from 55 millimeters

466
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:23,438
as it moves up to 55 and a half and you

467
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,199
can slowly see so we have a resolution

468
00:15:23,438 --> 00:15:29,048
of fractions of the millimeter so this

469
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:31,208
is like a fraction basically 1/32 of an

470
00:15:29,048 --> 00:15:32,500
inch kind of side so very very fine

471
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:35,079
changes that can occur

472
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,850
this and so in some cases we we can

473
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,170
track this as normal healthy growth in

474
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:39,399
this case we actually are in drought

475
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:42,309
condition so we're not pumping enough

476
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:45,370
water into it and the case that we found

477
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:48,099
in one one situation is the my student

478
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,450
actually was doing a test he came back

479
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,430
and I started looking at the data and I

480
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,780
go something's wrong with your system

481
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:54,549
but he goes no no everything's good we

482
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:56,199
did the tests everything's fine I'm like

483
00:15:54,549 --> 00:15:57,969
Nana so about 10 minutes later I came

484
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,170
back and I looked at and I go the plants

485
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,970
still shrinking the fruit still

486
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:02,889
shrinking in size something's wrong and

487
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,540
so he walked back out there and realized

488
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:07,000
that he had unplugged the pump so we

489
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:09,219
missed one watering cycle so it was fast

490
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,740
enough to watch one missed watering

491
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:14,680
cycle which is literally in our system

492
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,720
it was a one-hour period and it drought

493
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:18,579
conditions usually at best is 3 hours

494
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,110
typically 6 to 12 hours is when most

495
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,780
people will observe this so the

496
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:25,360
technology ability of using web cameras

497
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:27,189
which is fairly basic allowed us to be

498
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,169
able to monitor missing one watering

499
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:31,720
cycle or missing one system that we were

500
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:33,519
so if the nozzle was plugged we can

501
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,170
actually start to track these things one

502
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,789
of the funky things that we found about

503
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:39,099
this and I have no good at explanation

504
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:41,379
for this as we started seeing this

505
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,370
oscillation so as the plant was growing

506
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:44,049
or the fruit was growing it was

507
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,940
oscillating up and down up and down and

508
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:49,179
it's not a very big oscillation this is

509
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,920
like less than a 1/32 of an inch but

510
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:52,239
it's a very small oscillation and it

511
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:54,009
wasn't making sense why this was

512
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,509
happening so we zoomed in on one of

513
00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:57,549
these things and it basically was

514
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:59,730
telling us that as I'm watering my

515
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:02,409
tomato fruit for some reason it shrinks

516
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:04,390
which makes no sense whatsoever

517
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:06,009
if you add water things should expand

518
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,990
the plants up taking the water and

519
00:17:06,009 --> 00:17:09,940
should go through an expansion so and

520
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:11,650
the reason why I'm highlighting this is

521
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,750
it tells me that we know nothing about

522
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:15,040
plants we know that the plants are there

523
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,569
we know that they're growing and they're

524
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,500
going to continue to grow if I backtrack

525
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,299
on that you can see that they're

526
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:21,220
continuing to grow but there's all this

527
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:23,230
data buried in that we just call noise

528
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,329
which isn't actually noise it's useful

529
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,460
information we're just too stupid to

530
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:29,319
understand what it is and through

531
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,090
technology AI and all these other things

532
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:33,159
maybe we'll start to figure out what the

533
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:35,169
plant is trying to tell us they speak a

534
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:37,360
language we just suck at understanding

535
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,700
what that is but we will slowly start to

536
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,379
figure this thing out

537
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,600
so other fun projects that I've worked

538
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,030
on and I am continuing to work on so

539
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,339
this is a porous concrete

540
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:48,569
structure so we actually took we're not

541
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:50,549
using Portland cement we're using

542
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:52,319
actually a steel slag out of it and so

543
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:53,879
I'm growing grass on it the part that's

544
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:58,529
kind of fun about it is it's a pH

545
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:59,790
between eight eight to ten pH everybody

546
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:01,019
says that you should grow between five

547
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:02,279
and a half and six and a half our

548
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:04,259
research is showing that you can grow up

549
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:05,519
to eight without any problem it doesn't

550
00:18:04,259 --> 00:18:07,140
mean that we have to change our nutrient

551
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,119
ratios so in the next one you can see

552
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,800
that our ratios are being changed and so

553
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,659
standard Rockwell Cube which is sitting

554
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,309
right around that six-and-a-half normal

555
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,590
is where it starts and our three

556
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:18,480
different Rock will mean porous concrete

557
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:20,189
cubes here and then I had to go to a

558
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,259
double nutrient solution to get the same

559
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,730
kind of size out of it the different

560
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:26,519
difference is that this is quite an

561
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:28,740
elongated leaf and elongated stem system

562
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:30,359
well this is more dwarf so we can

563
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,039
actually start to control by these

564
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:34,229
things and so this is a calcium affect

565
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:35,639
as well as a bit of a nutrient effect

566
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,410
that actually starts to play on this I

567
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,820
think it has a lot of other applications

568
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,070
more than just the controlled

569
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:43,009
environment space but it allows us to

570
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:46,349
actually start to push these boundaries

571
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:49,140
so working on cart carbon dioxide

572
00:18:46,349 --> 00:18:51,240
enrichment we can also do co2 in

573
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,880
richmond and so one of our projects is

574
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,809
using biomass as a heating system we

575
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,300
heard yesterday

576
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:59,069
most people have to compost or landfill

577
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:01,649
most of the residues from the cannabis

578
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:02,939
world if we can start doing anaerobic

579
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,100
digestion that'd be good

580
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,720
in my cases I'm just wanting to burn the

581
00:19:05,099 --> 00:19:08,759
stuff and then I could recycle them

582
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,289
almost directly I know I'm producing a

583
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:12,420
lot of co2 through the combustion but

584
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:14,279
ultimately my goal is why can't I use

585
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:17,039
that same co2 over and over again to

586
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:20,579
actually grow the plant so theoretically

587
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,200
you can be carbon zero at best actually

588
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:24,119
you could go negative in some cases if

589
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,799
you can manage this but there's a lot of

590
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:27,509
regulatory requirements for them to

591
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,680
actually get to this point and I know in

592
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:29,640
the island of montreal they've actually

593
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,529
got to the point where they actually

594
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,180
tell us we're not supposed to be burning

595
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:35,609
any image burning any wood because it

596
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,080
causes too much emissions so then I

597
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:39,569
developed this technology which is

598
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:41,699
basically pulls all particles out of the

599
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:43,679
air so it's basically a great big

600
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,930
electrostatic precipitator type system

601
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,640
that can pull stuff out and as such it's

602
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,259
quite good at this and I'm hopeful that

603
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,820
by the government at some point will

604
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:52,920
allow me to start to use this but it's

605
00:19:50,819 --> 00:19:53,970
still in its earlier stages so hopefully

606
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,640
in the next couple of years it will

607
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,558
start to reach itself out so I'm gonna

608
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,960
jump into light now which is Ultima

609
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,788
what my main baby is and what I work on

610
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,499
predominantly we talked about these

611
00:20:02,788 --> 00:20:05,819
basically the different wavelengths and

612
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:08,038
the different spectrum that comes about

613
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:10,349
from these as you see here this is our

614
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:12,210
big solar output and then we have LEDs

615
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:14,219
and everybody says LEDs if it's blue

616
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:15,929
it's blue one of my standard statement

617
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,190
but you can see that we have a full

618
00:20:15,929 --> 00:20:19,350
width half medium which is actually

619
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:21,600
fairly wide 20 nanometers which actually

620
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:23,638
means in some cases we can get up to 159

621
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,079
a meter widths and so this causes a lot

622
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:27,449
of issues because ultimately we're

623
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:28,949
averaging over the 150 and getting the

624
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,319
plant responses as we move across that

625
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,389
so we're not playing with hyper narrow

626
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:35,099
wavelengths where we're dealing with

627
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:36,839
slightly narrow wavelengths and so

628
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:38,278
what's the impact if we try to go even

629
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:40,579
more narrow out of these things and so

630
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:43,259
that's what a lot of my research is on

631
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:44,668
you saw this slide before and so the

632
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:46,319
whole wavelength that we have we talked

633
00:20:44,669 --> 00:20:48,600
about the green gap space here lower

634
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:51,178
productivity but ultimate because of our

635
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:52,648
phosphorus coated systems that we have

636
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:54,809
we can actually produce a bunch of light

637
00:20:52,648 --> 00:20:57,178
within that my gap that I talked about

638
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:58,950
last time is right in that 680 to 700

639
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:00,929
seems to be the place most people don't

640
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,819
seem to care about which is good but me

641
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:05,100
as a researcher hey if people don't care

642
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:07,168
about it's usually a good place to be

643
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:08,759
and so trying to figure out how we can

644
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:12,749
actually see what the responses of these

645
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:14,519
are we know that the technology has been

646
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:17,460
slowly improving so I stole this from

647
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:21,538
Morgan Patterson - with his permission

648
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:23,548
of course and so he's he's done a lot of

649
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:25,200
work on how much is the efficacy and the

650
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,999
output of these and so we're slowly

651
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,769
improving on efficiency of the lights

652
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:31,288
and so you can see blue is slowly

653
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:33,419
creeping up to be the maximum output red

654
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:34,980
systems also improving he added amber

655
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:37,379
because I've been ranting about it for

656
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,819
quite a while so it's still a long ways

657
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:40,798
up but it does have the theoretical

658
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:42,628
capability of being just as efficient as

659
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,579
everything else I might be dead before

660
00:21:42,628 --> 00:21:46,949
this happens but it will be getting up

661
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:48,118
to that point at some place there and

662
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,379
then you can see the other kind of

663
00:21:48,118 --> 00:21:52,199
lights and their efficiency that come

664
00:21:49,378 --> 00:21:54,028
about this the reason why this matters

665
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,129
is ultimately we're trying to fit

666
00:21:54,028 --> 00:21:59,849
different pegs into different holes and

667
00:21:56,128 --> 00:22:01,259
they aren't always a perfect fit so we

668
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:03,089
know that efficiency is one of the

669
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:04,710
things we're chasing but ultimately we

670
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:05,970
also have to be aware of how the plants

671
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:08,610
actually respond to a lot of these

672
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,649
things so our standard system out that

673
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:12,000
were that that we use is are basically

674
00:22:10,648 --> 00:22:14,279
metal halide HPS

675
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,990
some fluorescent is still a good system

676
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:17,789
we just don't get an exceedingly high

677
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:19,829
light output out of most traditional

678
00:22:17,789 --> 00:22:22,139
fluorescent systems white LEDs which are

679
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:23,970
basically the same thing we are getting

680
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,980
a better system so I usually recommend

681
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:28,500
to people to stay in that place and LEDs

682
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:32,430
are used for other secondary

683
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:34,049
applications so and I'll explain why I

684
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,610
make that statement so here's our

685
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:37,799
standard McCree curve that everybody's

686
00:22:35,609 --> 00:22:39,649
familiar with and then there's the whole

687
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:42,389
I can't even ride a hog ooh engine

688
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,160
system that he also did it as a mapping

689
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,750
system we have a bunch of older

690
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,060
technology that they use for these

691
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:50,730
things this was done back in the 1970s

692
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:52,139
before LEDs came along and it's kind of

693
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,819
been the standard on how we're gonna

694
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:55,380
grow so and most people looked at this

695
00:22:53,819 --> 00:22:57,059
chlorophyll pigment so we have our

696
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,470
chlorophyll a is the dark coloration

697
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:00,149
here and our chlorophyll B is the

698
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:02,039
lighter green coloration and we looked

699
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:04,170
at it and say well they kind of line up

700
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:06,509
with this peak here and they kind of

701
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:07,920
line up with this peak here but if we

702
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:09,990
look across at the bottom here they

703
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,570
don't really line up on that shoulder

704
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:14,009
and this edge doesn't seem to line up so

705
00:23:12,569 --> 00:23:16,919
how come we have fairly good

706
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:17,970
efficiencies when we play here which is

707
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,289
good because it lines up with

708
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,180
chlorophyll a but then we play in this

709
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:23,009
area and it still grows plants

710
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:25,019
exceedingly well but then I come down

711
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:27,660
into the green don't get quite as good a

712
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:29,430
results so when I was a student I looked

713
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,810
at this and goes we don't understand the

714
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,549
system and everybody goes no no it's

715
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:36,899
well explained pigments cause

716
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:38,309
photosynthesis may be but as they look

717
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,080
at the different kind of systems I can

718
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:41,369
choose LEDs so one of the first LEDs

719
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,859
that people played with was actually

720
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:45,149
that 680 LED does not work well at

721
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:47,129
growing plants you get long spindly

722
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:49,170
plants nobody likes them almost

723
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,520
destroyed the LED industry initially 10

724
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,440
years later then we end it with our six

725
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:54,569
sixty six forty started coming in people

726
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,759
started being quite positive to this low

727
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:58,319
pressure sodium few tests were done on

728
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:00,990
that most people have never really grown

729
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:03,029
larger scale with that but it falls in

730
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:05,069
that nice little peak area where that is

731
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:08,549
so why don't we do more work with that

732
00:24:05,069 --> 00:24:10,109
short the short answer is no one has if

733
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:12,210
we look at metal halide fairly broad

734
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:13,679
spectrum across it a lot more blue but

735
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,809
still has a fair bit in that amber

736
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,090
coloration lacking in the red as opposed

737
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:19,450
to HPS which is very amber driven on

738
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:21,308
this little bit of blue

739
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:25,740
and a bit more red than we actually see

740
00:24:21,308 --> 00:24:28,269
in the metal-halide most people like HPS

741
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,980
Bruce Bugbee and the crew at Utah have

742
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:31,690
done a lot of work trying to figure out

743
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,278
what these different sensors are the

744
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,288
different systems within the plant based

745
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,089
so this was a paper of his in nature

746
00:24:35,288 --> 00:24:39,700
that was published it was two years ago

747
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:41,168
or so and so you can actually see these

748
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:43,899
are the standard LEDs that I've shown

749
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:45,610
you before and then we actually have all

750
00:24:43,898 --> 00:24:47,079
the pigments that are within plants and

751
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:50,229
the actual responses of the human eye

752
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:51,699
systems also and with this it makes it

753
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,990
look like there's a lot of sensors that

754
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,429
are present on this and they have the

755
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,500
ability to actually monitor these

756
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:59,288
different wavelengths some of them are

757
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,759
very slight so if I am at very dim light

758
00:24:59,288 --> 00:25:02,319
conditions I get a fairly strong

759
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:04,839
response out of the plant if I'm not

760
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:06,460
sitting at dim light conditions I go to

761
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:07,720
bright light conditions I swamp out that

762
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,600
and I actually don't get any of the

763
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,220
responses at that point and then human

764
00:25:10,599 --> 00:25:14,048
eye responds and there are different

765
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,819
plant responses and overlaying them you

766
00:25:14,048 --> 00:25:18,129
can see that the amber of kind of

767
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:19,898
follows that sorry the HPS follows the

768
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:20,980
amber spot that's right there and so

769
00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:22,959
these are kind of some of the

770
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:24,429
conclusions that were made and so one of

771
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,528
the things that I've been pushing for

772
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:28,899
for quite a period of time is the fact

773
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:30,759
that within the cannabis world we've had

774
00:25:28,898 --> 00:25:32,319
this idea that red light is very good

775
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:35,619
for flowering and blue light is very

776
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:38,319
good for vegetative growth it doesn't

777
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:39,548
happen I'm sorry I've done a lot of

778
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:41,859
literature review I've done a lot of my

779
00:25:39,548 --> 00:25:43,929
own studies on this a lot of studies on

780
00:25:41,859 --> 00:25:45,969
this both on cannabis as well as other

781
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:48,070
plants cannabis is a plant it behaves

782
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,740
like all other plants what that is is up

783
00:25:48,069 --> 00:25:52,839
for debate but it is a plant and so as

784
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:54,849
such in most of our cases we find red

785
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:57,089
light drives photosynthesis and blue

786
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:59,168
light is used as a stress response

787
00:25:57,089 --> 00:26:00,759
induction system so it's the sensory

788
00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:03,038
system which causes the plant to be

789
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:04,720
aware that it should start to flower and

790
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,298
so there's different mechanisms if you

791
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,730
have purely red it will still flower but

792
00:26:07,298 --> 00:26:10,898
it's because of a saturation of energy

793
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,909
that starts to occurring and the plant

794
00:26:10,898 --> 00:26:14,259
goes okay I'm just happy fat enough that

795
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:17,110
I can now start to go to this flowering

796
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:18,579
period and but I can use my my blue for

797
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:21,609
actually induction of these flowering

798
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:22,990
quicker Bruce Bugbee he's also published

799
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:24,969
this paper which just came out actually

800
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:27,759
a few days ago which is based on the

801
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:30,579
emerson effect so up to this point Parr

802
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,829
has been between 400 and 700 he came

803
00:26:30,579 --> 00:26:36,129
along and says well if I start adding

804
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:38,740
my far-red light into this I can

805
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:40,600
actually induce better yield and so if I

806
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,730
measure based purely on a power response

807
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:45,579
I basically am increasing my yield in

808
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:49,298
this lettuce under about 400 micro moles

809
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:51,788
of light and so if but if I take it and

810
00:26:49,298 --> 00:26:53,918
change my part to 750 now it starts

811
00:26:51,788 --> 00:26:55,750
behaving it like a normal curve the

812
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,120
challenge that happens with this is if I

813
00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:00,819
give only far-red my plants will not

814
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:02,889
grow so Emerson effect is this kind

815
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:05,769
combined effect of other wavelengths of

816
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:08,769
light with far with the the far red

817
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:10,298
light if I provide just far red light

818
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:13,240
I'm not gonna get a positive response

819
00:27:10,298 --> 00:27:15,038
I've tried it it doesn't work so you

820
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,359
have to have the two light system so if

821
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:18,190
you're using it as kind of an induction

822
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:20,349
to say let's get my plants woken up by

823
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:22,000
giving it some fire Rhett you're getting

824
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:24,158
a little bit of red because the tails

825
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,380
that happen on these things but

826
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,510
ultimately it's not completely driven by

827
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:30,220
that system and it's saying that

828
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:33,129
basically some of our units a measure

829
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:34,778
might be incorrect which makes for a lot

830
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:38,440
of people to pull out their hair because

831
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:40,630
we've been staying with 400 to 700 of

832
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,220
the system so work that I've been

833
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,929
working on which i think is kind of fun

834
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:46,298
is we've been looking at really high

835
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:48,309
intensity type light systems and

836
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:49,480
different locations and how intense we

837
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:51,069
can get up to so there in this case

838
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,808
we're getting up to about 1400 micro

839
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:54,220
moles of light and we're looking at what

840
00:27:52,808 --> 00:27:55,658
the growth rate was at different

841
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,308
wavelengths so we're looking at our

842
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:59,230
amber we're looking at our red and we're

843
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:02,440
looking at our blue so this is on tomato

844
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:04,179
which is one of our model plants out of

845
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,980
this and you can see blue light seems to

846
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:07,690
be non-responsive so there's a bit of an

847
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,909
yield increase as I start to increase

848
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:11,679
and then it seems to flatline out of

849
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:13,059
this these were small plants I

850
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,919
understand it's not full growth out of

851
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:16,509
this one but my red light actually gets

852
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:18,309
a nice bell curve so anything over a

853
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:20,138
thousand for red basically is starting

854
00:28:18,308 --> 00:28:22,839
to cause negative growth so it's

855
00:28:20,138 --> 00:28:24,428
actually causing photo light saturation

856
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:26,379
on the plant and so going above that

857
00:28:24,429 --> 00:28:27,940
isn't beneficial if I go for amber light

858
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,340
pure amber light then it actually seems

859
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,769
to maximise at about that 800 and it

860
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:34,509
starts to drop off after that if I start

861
00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:35,859
combining these then it starts doing a

862
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:37,298
whole bunch of funky stuff and we get

863
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:40,658
those kind of linear responses that

864
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:41,950
we're expecting to see how do that so

865
00:28:40,659 --> 00:28:43,630
these are the plants so different

866
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,220
morphology out of all of them you can

867
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:46,309
actually see amber though causes some

868
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,960
photo

869
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:50,279
photobleaching systems on this and so we

870
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,829
have to understand why those are

871
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:54,509
happening if I do the same tests on

872
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:57,119
lettuce I can see amber causes my

873
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:59,490
maximum growth rate read out of the

874
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,739
system and then my combined as my blue

875
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:04,019
so slightly better responses for my

876
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,519
lettuce relative to my other pigments I

877
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:08,940
mean my other wavelengths that are

878
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,259
working on this the part that I find

879
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,509
kind of fun is that depending on how you

880
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:14,970
grow them so this is varying intensities

881
00:29:12,509 --> 00:29:16,470
I have very small smaller plots to my

882
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,660
large plants but then I get my whole

883
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:19,829
anthocyanin and pigment accumulation so

884
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,720
I can get into very very dark

885
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:23,639
colorations high high anthocyanin

886
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,370
accumulation so that's why I make the

887
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:28,620
statement that blue indexes induces a

888
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:30,959
lot of photo pigments as well as on

889
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:32,909
other parts of it and then if I jump

890
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,220
ahead here to my amber you can see that

891
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,630
I actually are getting in that photo

892
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,950
bleaching type system so I'm actually

893
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:39,690
causing destruction but under the

894
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,789
combined coloration I'm actually getting

895
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:43,798
depending on what my ratio is I can

896
00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:45,119
start changing a lot of the the

897
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:47,039
phytochemicals that are present within

898
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:50,459
this and so here's just a quick summary

899
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,798
of them which i think is kind of fun as

900
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,880
kind of the last part that I have for

901
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:56,190
the last three minutes before the

902
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,700
questions ultimately we've done some

903
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:01,769
work on amber amber wavelengths and just

904
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:04,470
started to filter these so we actually

905
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:05,940
took different wavelengths so 595 and

906
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,548
just put a notch filter in it and then

907
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,500
we did a 615 and did an N filter on this

908
00:30:08,548 --> 00:30:12,480
to try to actually control what happens

909
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,970
if I shift my wavelength slightly within

910
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,370
this space and this is the resultant out

911
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:19,798
of it so 595 fairly normal looking to a

912
00:30:17,369 --> 00:30:21,808
compact plant by going to a 603 so just

913
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:24,000
literally taking a notch out of it and

914
00:30:21,808 --> 00:30:25,649
then if I do the same basically

915
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,500
overlaying the other wavelengths out of

916
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:30,780
that I end up with this intensity is the

917
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,089
exact same wavelength is shifted in some

918
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:34,859
cases three to five nanometers and that

919
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:36,928
caused that large of a differential of

920
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:38,639
the response of how the plants were so

921
00:30:36,929 --> 00:30:40,080
back to that statement I said we don't

922
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,120
understand what plants are up to here

923
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,039
and so we're trying to figure out how

924
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:45,689
these are so when somebody says I tested

925
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:47,579
at my location and I got this response

926
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:49,289
but I tested a different location and I

927
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:50,939
got a different response it's possible

928
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:52,440
it was a temperature differential which

929
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,759
caused a difference in your I'm not

930
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,740
saying temperatures and growth I'm

931
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,319
saying temperature of your bulb caused a

932
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,319
2 to 3 nanometer shift of the the wave

933
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:01,990
output and you

934
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:03,429
getting that response and we have to

935
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:05,200
start to figure out how these shifts are

936
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:07,539
happening and from a policy standpoint

937
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,190
if we're saying we're chasing always the

938
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:11,829
most efficient it might not be the most

939
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,940
efficient for the plant and then you can

940
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:15,309
see our fresh wait and our

941
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,870
photosynthetic rates so I do a lot of

942
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:18,159
photosynthetic measurement on this and

943
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:19,989
you can see these two are quite similar

944
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,420
but they result in a different result

945
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:24,549
and very high photosynthetic rates here

946
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:27,160
but not very good growth rates and so we

947
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:29,829
need to try to separate those things so

948
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:32,050
main takeaways of this science is a poor

949
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:35,230
understanding of plants and base of many

950
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:38,109
of the assumptions are incorrect if you

951
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:40,450
want to come to NC R 101 I'll rip a few

952
00:31:38,109 --> 00:31:42,459
more things apart at that point not

953
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,720
willing to do it quite here and we need

954
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,789
to have a better understanding of how

955
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,319
plants evolve into these environments it

956
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:49,359
doesn't mean that we don't have a good

957
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:50,919
ability to grow the plants we just don't

958
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,500
have a good explanation on why it's

959
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,390
doing it individual wavelengths can be

960
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,130
both positive negative and neutral and

961
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:59,170
so in some cases we find them very

962
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:02,260
detrimental but in some cases very

963
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:04,690
beneficial and then ultimately I'm a big

964
00:32:02,259 --> 00:32:06,250
supporter of amber which giving plugs to

965
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,360
companies that use broad spectrum lights

966
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:11,650
I'm a fan of it

967
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:14,379
so if you are interested in these things

968
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:18,040
I am part of almost all of these groups

969
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:20,110
well with the exception of ASHRAE so NC

970
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:22,359
R 101 which does a lot of standards a sa

971
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:25,269
B which did the plug before so thank you

972
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:27,909
as well as we're also trying to well

973
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:29,589
DLS the DL C also is a group and then

974
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:30,700
seeds we're trying to work on trying to

975
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:32,709
set up standards for controlled

976
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,360
environment across the board and if

977
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:35,829
anybody is interested in that there's a

978
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:37,659
few of us here that actually are on that

979
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:39,189
committee and so trying to figure out

980
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,630
what the standard should be or how we

981
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:42,759
can actually monitor and work these

982
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:44,830
things forward and then all my

983
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:46,539
acknowledgments for this was from the

984
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:48,399
main people that have worked on these

985
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:50,139
set of slides with me and then everybody

986
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,860
that's in my lab so it's a fairly large

987
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:55,390
lab and I'm willing to take some

988
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:59,589
questions for I think I have a couple

989
00:32:55,390 --> 00:33:02,230
minutes at this fire it was it's known

990
00:32:59,589 --> 00:33:05,259
as Darth Vader it was an asteroid that

991
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,069
landed near my father's farm so so if

992
00:33:05,259 --> 00:33:08,319
you want to go see it's at the

993
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:10,599
University of Alberta I also loved that

994
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,980
little island there so there's six sheep

995
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:15,379
that hang out on a coast of Scotland

996
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,269
and so it's the epitome of controlled

997
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:22,490
environment because they can't go

998
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:24,019
anywhere they bring a boat in and then

999
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,880
they have to go grab them before they

1000
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:27,500
jump in the ocean and drowned because

1001
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,870
they're full of wool at that point so

1002
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,039
you bring two boats in a few dogs and

1003
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:35,750
then try to herd them together and get

1004
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:46,339
them off the island once a year so so

1005
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:46,730
that's er thank you I thank you very

1006
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:48,980
much

1007
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:50,990
dr. Lester I would appreciate a little

1008
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,960
more recommendations on the policy front

1009
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:55,819
you you kind of dipped into that so so

1010
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,789
the one challenge that we have and so

1011
00:33:55,819 --> 00:34:00,259
I'm actually so I'm in Montreal which is

1012
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:02,889
part of Quebec and we have really cheap

1013
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:05,869
electricity rates there hovers between

1014
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:09,619
I've heard as low as like 3.2 cents per

1015
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:12,019
kilowatt-hour to as high as five Ontario

1016
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:12,889
goes above that obviously and we're

1017
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:15,500
probably not gonna have much

1018
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:17,119
restrictions on power usage so here in

1019
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,619
California or Massachusetts when they

1020
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,000
put on a restriction of some power I'm

1021
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:21,850
actually quite happy about it because it

1022
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,668
means Montreal will export to you guys

1023
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:27,469
is what I'm after and so the challenge

1024
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:29,929
that we have ultimately is that some of

1025
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:31,699
this technology for the amber sucks at

1026
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:34,190
efficacy and you saw that on the slides

1027
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:35,569
so if we're putting in barriers we're

1028
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,648
gonna be testing them elsewhere which

1029
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:39,139
might be good because it's not a

1030
00:34:36,648 --> 00:34:40,608
bleeding edge it's just a you're waiting

1031
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:43,490
for the new technologies to come along

1032
00:34:40,608 --> 00:34:45,590
but there has to be a mechanism set up

1033
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:47,118
in place to allow for new technologies

1034
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,220
that have the potential of being even

1035
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,679
better down the road and until we get to

1036
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:53,449
that point it's hard to make that full

1037
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,668
final recommendation I like the idea of

1038
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:57,019
a framework and so that the seeds group

1039
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:59,059
that I'm working with we're wanting to

1040
00:34:57,019 --> 00:35:00,949
do a ranking system so high medium and

1041
00:34:59,059 --> 00:35:03,139
low or bronze silver gold however you

1042
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:06,500
want to rank them good better best type

1043
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:10,159
system so that and if it's just power I

1044
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:12,050
think water electricity for light HVAC

1045
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,730
systems are three separate systems and

1046
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,350
they should all be kind of grouped

1047
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:17,269
together but also allowed to be worked

1048
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:20,150
independent so if you want to focus on a

1049
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:21,739
high-efficiency LED but don't want to

1050
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,760
have the other stuff you should be

1051
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:23,959
allowed that and that's one of the

1052
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,880
challenges that's happening with the

1053
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,880
current policy is that people will cheat

1054
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,470
on one system

1055
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,480
the other but I think all of them have

1056
00:35:28,469 --> 00:35:34,500
to be considered in the end and so

1057
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,139
that's my recommendation doctor for a

1058
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,900
given intensity of light does the

1059
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:42,420
evapotranspiration change by spectrum

1060
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:45,000
yeah yeah that's a we're working a lot

1061
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:47,608
on that so we can change stomata opening

1062
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,739
enclosure by doing wavelength selection

1063
00:35:47,608 --> 00:35:52,710
on that so green light predominantly

1064
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:54,719
will close it but we still grow quite a

1065
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:57,349
happy healthy plant and part of the

1066
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:59,278
challenge is also leaf temperature so

1067
00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:01,200
depending on the wavelength you're using

1068
00:35:59,278 --> 00:36:03,929
control leaf temperature and stomata

1069
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,669
opening and we're just at the early

1070
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:07,018
stages of having a good understanding of

1071
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:09,088
how these things are inter playing with

1072
00:36:07,018 --> 00:36:11,838
each other to be perfectly honest we

1073
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:14,489
don't know why stomata open or close and

1074
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:16,108
we have ideas we know that wavelengths

1075
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:17,489
can do this we know temperature can do

1076
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:19,348
it there's a bunch of factors but there

1077
00:36:17,489 --> 00:36:20,939
has to be some underlining mechanisms

1078
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:23,640
that will do this and we don't have a

1079
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:26,369
strong understanding of this so that we

1080
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:27,690
can control that and we should but it

1081
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:28,980
doesn't mean that I'd say that you

1082
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,950
should be betting the farm on that

1083
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,990
mechanism okay

1084
00:36:31,949 --> 00:36:36,480
I'm mark thanks for the presentation on

1085
00:36:33,989 --> 00:36:39,929
the amber LED did you look into the

1086
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:43,048
efficacy on the plants of fusing the

1087
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:46,318
amber LEDs itself versus phosphorus

1088
00:36:43,048 --> 00:36:48,449
converted yeah so we've done we have

1089
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:51,150
done both the phosphorus code it is it

1090
00:36:48,449 --> 00:36:52,980
has quite a high efficiency out of it or

1091
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,480
efficacy out of it so they're comparable

1092
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,039
to almost every other system that's out

1093
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,659
there they play with the HPS as

1094
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:58,980
efficiency if you're doing narrow

1095
00:36:57,659 --> 00:37:00,328
spectrum which is what those last

1096
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:04,199
wavelengths were where we're filtering

1097
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:05,910
them down they suck and so that but I

1098
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:08,129
personally think they have a greater

1099
00:37:05,909 --> 00:37:11,250
potential of changing the industry then

1100
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:12,720
the broad spectrum does the challenges

1101
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,500
that I can't say with certainty how

1102
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:15,500
that's going to play out

1103
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,280
okay thank you Mark

1104
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:22,279
[Applause]
