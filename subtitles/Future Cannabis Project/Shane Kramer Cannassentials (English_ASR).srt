[Music]

2
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:14,638
can you kind of talk about your

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,379
greenhouse and what sets it apart like

4
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:18,239
why people find it why you find it

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,140
interesting and how you got there yeah

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:24,719
so I had quite a bit of experience in

7
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,820
indoor farming and for quite a few years

8
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,098
and it's kind of came from that world

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,079
and then actually transitioned into a

10
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,409
lot of vegetable a lot of vegetable

11
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:33,409
farming

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:48,829

[Music]

16
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:30,390
okay so you're doing vegetables yes so

17
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,969
I'm so no outdoor you know so we 13

18
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:38,730
years ago we got our farm that is more

19
00:01:32,969 --> 00:01:41,579
farmland and in Eugene and so I started

20
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:44,280
going market veggies and a little bit

21
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,489
wholesale and did that for quite a few

22
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:51,060
years while kinda transitioning the

23
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:53,339
indoor cannabis getting more into deep

24
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,920
organic practices indoors and using you

25
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,109
know getting into plant based fertility

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,670
and so getting away from all the animal

27
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:01,739
animal products getting away from the

28
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,740
back Lanos and phloem eels and the blood

29
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:08,039
meals and using more plant-based

30
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:10,679
fertilizers what was each one of those

31
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,139
animal based things doing like what were

32
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,500
you using back 104 and then what was a

33
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:20,759
substitute that works so in in your

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,099
quick cycle of kind of more than you

35
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:24,659
know indoor continuous production you

36
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,180
you only have the two months you know

37
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:30,569
really a flower and trying to get the

38
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,159
soil or Gantt in and or you know drill

39
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:33,689
organic soil try to get that to release

40
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,479
the nutrients to have those nutrients

41
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:37,859
soluble to the plant get chelated that's

42
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:39,780
that's a tough thing unless you have a

43
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,340
lot of microbes so conventional farming

44
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,550
uses a lot soluble foods that are

45
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,979
already broken down and so you know from

46
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,450
the chemically derived where it's in

47
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:51,329
sulfate form ready to go into the plant

48
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:52,859
or to the sub there's some people make

49
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:54,780
organic bottled foods that are animal

50
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,709
products that they basically isolate you

51
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,000
know but basically they're trying to

52
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,189
make them soluble so it goes right into

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,629
the plant and just so you really get

54
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:03,359
that boom so you get that that nice

55
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:06,919
growth you know quickly and that's in

56
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,540
that in that two months so replacing

57
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,949
basically those heavy duty foods that

58
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:12,449
were quick-acting with with plant

59
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:14,518
ferments that was really a big thing

60
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:16,829
plant and fruit for mints so basically

61
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,830
fermenting plant material which which

62
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:21,450
pretty much comes all from our farm so

63
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,590
we're just gathering and even a lot of

64
00:03:21,449 --> 00:03:24,030
weeds a lot of things that have deep

65
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,560
roots even like thistles that you think

66
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,659
a hard

67
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,098
really bad weed they are bringing up all

68
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:29,629
these minerals from the subsoil and

69
00:03:28,098 --> 00:03:32,149
they're making basically a fertilizer

70
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:34,340
that's beyond a lot of these other

71
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,020
fertilizers even if you're using like an

72
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,670
alfalfa Muller sling if that field that

73
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,290
the alfalfa meal fertilizer came from

74
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:40,639
was devoid of minerals you know you're

75
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:42,859
not getting as many minerals whereas if

76
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,479
you're using weeds that are you know

77
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,950
nutrient accumulators you're really

78
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,509
getting all these weeds the reason

79
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:49,068
they're sending that taproot in down to

80
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:51,889
the ground is to bring out minerals and

81
00:03:49,068 --> 00:03:53,359
regenerate the soil so so using plant

82
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:55,669
ferments and fruit ferments to really

83
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,330
supplement that that extra boost and

84
00:03:55,669 --> 00:04:14,089
then this plant material and kelp meal

85
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:17,199
rocked us seeds and really so yet seeds

86
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,199
really replace a lot of

87
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:52,410
so you know people use a lot of seed

88
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:53,609
meals so seed meals are really plants

89
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,990
basically have plants everything plant

90
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,790
needs you know so you have this balanced

91
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,829
form of nutrition it's just getting that

92
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:00,360
to go uptake into the plant in the

93
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:02,759
amount of time you want and if you have

94
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,050
a really living soil it's it's a lot

95
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,389
easier but starting out when I did

96
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,329
transition from the indoor it was trying

97
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:11,669
to get these containers to have that

98
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:13,500
have the fertility to make those really

99
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,410
like indoor quality buds you know really

100
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,649
have that full quality in that amount of

101
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:22,620
time and and so transitioning to a more

102
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:25,169
like ferments and and ways of

103
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,449
solubilizing those those nutrients out

104
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:29,460
of the out of the organic matter so is

105
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:31,740
that what the fermentation process does

106
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,209
so all the microbes that are in the soil

107
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,910
that are in our gut that are in a cows

108
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:37,500
gut so you know animals are all the same

109
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,820
type of microbes like the probiotics we

110
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,529
take or the same probiotics that they

111
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:42,000
sell you for your soil and the same that

112
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:43,019
are in a cow's gut and the cow is

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,879
basically having this fermentation

114
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:46,379
process happening in their stomach when

115
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,790
you're making a ferment you're taking

116
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,990
all the stuff that the cow would eat or

117
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,580
the horse would eat and you're

118
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,780
fermenting it in water and those same

119
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:54,899
microbes are breaking everything down

120
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:57,229
and basically killing those nutrients

121
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:59,370
making em chelating is just making those

122
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,660
molecules smaller and smaller so that

123
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,000
they're I basically be I've taken by the

124
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,200
plants and microbes are chelating

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,230
they're just breaking down to a smaller

126
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:08,969
smaller particle and so that all happens

127
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,680
in your ferment and instead of like when

128
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,120
you're using animal manure you're

129
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,470
getting with animal didn't use the

130
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,550
animals using the calcium-magnesium a

131
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,890
lot of the micronutrients and getting

132
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,199
the macronutrients and so I mean you can

133
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:20,550
use it's useful of it but but it's a lot

134
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,079
of times it's over fertilizes a lot of

135
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,639
people in this intercept for years it's

136
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,019
been over fertilizing especially without

137
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,879
soil testing so we're really in the soil

138
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:28,109
testing now as well to know what's there

139
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,879
to make sure that we're not missing

140
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,500
anything and to make sure we have it all

141
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,959
our basis you know basic covered and and

142
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,129
and not overdoing anything because the

143
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,870
balance of the soil is really important

144
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:40,168
if you overdo macronutrients especially

145
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:42,540
the micronutrients get locked out and so

146
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:45,000
and that's really the micronutrients

147
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,439
were really the plant really depends on

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,668
him to make the secondary metabolites

149
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,550
which are all the terpenes the

150
00:06:47,668 --> 00:06:58,629
cannabinoids the flavonoids

151
00:06:50,550 --> 00:07:01,000
yeah and the the the seed meal is

152
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:03,788
literally taking the seeds from plants

153
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,418
that are native to your area

154
00:07:03,788 --> 00:07:08,918
ideally ring we're using a lot of

155
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:09,399
actually foods he's like flax amaranth

156
00:07:08,918 --> 00:07:12,250
Chia

157
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:13,870
buckwheat and then the cover crop seeds

158
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,728
too but a lot of those like the flax and

159
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,959
Chia they're really oily really super

160
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:19,000
nutritious you know for us they're like

161
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,709
they're super nutrient dense foods so I

162
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,120
like to use those where I toss them in

163
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:23,258
there some of them get broken down and

164
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,228
eaten by the worms some of them sprout

165
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:28,389
into cover crops which are cycle of what

166
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:30,459
we're doing now is a lot of planting top

167
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:32,168
dress that cover crops come up and then

168
00:07:30,459 --> 00:07:33,638
we mulch them in really about three

169
00:07:32,168 --> 00:07:35,079
weeks like three weeks like also letting

170
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:37,750
them sprout and then mulching them back

171
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,848
in so so currently fast forward is where

172
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:41,560
we are with the greenhouse is we've

173
00:07:39,848 --> 00:07:43,478
brought that I brought that indoor that

174
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,250
that that was one service all this

175
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:46,478
thinking was when you were indoor and

176
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,810
you wanted to do kind of like a living

177
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:51,399
soil indoor transitioning over yeah and

178
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:54,339
it was still doing big containers and

179
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:56,138
you knows but before the the current

180
00:07:54,339 --> 00:07:58,989
pull regulated you know in the medical

181
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:01,360
days but once wreck happened and we

182
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,220
built our farm we wanted to really build

183
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,949
it out with what we feel is like the

184
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,000
best of both worlds which is to get the

185
00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:09,879
quality that you need the indoor

186
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,199
environment and to get that really good

187
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:13,959
taste and what we really want is that

188
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,939
deep organic soil culture and so our

189
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:18,069
greenhouse has beds that go down into

190
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:19,990
the native soil but are raised up two

191
00:08:18,069 --> 00:08:22,389
feet out of it and it with our custom

192
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:23,978
mix and and so that custom blends a

193
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:26,439
really nutrient dense like

194
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:28,449
nutrient dense we do use a little bit of

195
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,889
fish bone meal to build our soils

196
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:32,620
initially and I really like it

197
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:34,778
I find it adds to everything and like

198
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,278
just like the fish used to swim up from

199
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:37,838
the ocean they'd swim up the rivers and

200
00:08:36,278 --> 00:08:39,338
bring all their nutrients back that fish

201
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,479
bone from the ocean has a lot of

202
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:42,310
minerals and there's a lot of really

203
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,509
things that I feel brings in but that's

204
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:45,578
that's the only animal products we're

205
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:47,539
using besides that we're you know

206
00:08:45,578 --> 00:08:52,609
building all that with different

207
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:55,879
plant meals quel rocked us seeds bran

208
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:57,829
and then even so that's where with the

209
00:08:55,879 --> 00:09:00,708
seeds using high quality seeds I find

210
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:04,159
you know it's a step up from using like

211
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:06,828
like a like a cottonseed meal or

212
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,000
something which a lot of people are

213
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:09,409
using grandchildren they take out all

214
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,458
the oils from that con seed meal where

215
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:11,328
when you're using just the whole seeds

216
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,129
you're getting all the oils and

217
00:09:11,328 --> 00:09:15,349
everything and but then even with your

218
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:16,730
plants when you're using plants to

219
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,959
fertilize if you're using herbs that

220
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:19,339
have terpenes in them already

221
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,869
all these elements that made those

222
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:22,250
molecules are in there and you're then

223
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,230
translating into your soil and you're

224
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,339
just packing more of the elements you

225
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,350
want that are gonna translate into what

226
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:29,959
you really want so so I try to use like

227
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:33,528
as many herbs and really fragrant you

228
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:35,659
know for exactly done any testing where

229
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:37,879
it's like this plant is high in this

230
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:41,360
terpene and I'm going to take I'm gonna

231
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:43,789
test a cultivar that I grew but or I

232
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,829
introduce that and the Steve after I

233
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:47,568
introduced it as more of that talk about

234
00:09:45,828 --> 00:09:48,679
it I have not yet and I totally someone

235
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:49,969
had thought to told me that you know you

236
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:52,759
should use plants that are high in the

237
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:54,620
same turfy into like Bert and I mean I'm

238
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,149
sure it would be a benefit all our

239
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:58,009
practices our numbers have gone

240
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:00,759
completer fiends cannabinoids everything

241
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:02,929
so we've seen a general you know really

242
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,730
pretty amazing

243
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:08,929
just woodsy and the community analytics

244
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:12,319
showing it so yeah but I haven't gotten

245
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:14,809
that yeah um so we're operating right

246
00:10:12,318 --> 00:10:16,219
now 2000 we were 5000 and we lost three

247
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:18,439
thousand square feet in a snowstorm last

248
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,000
year so we like I mean serious fart like

249
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,829
we're all of a sudden two feet of snow

250
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,839
and it was like really freaked row area

251
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:26,179
and just three thousand square but

252
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,949
greenhouses and so it was a pretty big

253
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:29,479
it's pretty big lost it and we're

254
00:10:27,948 --> 00:10:31,609
rebuilding right now so we'll we back up

255
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,370
to 5,000 our license is five thousand of

256
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,050
lighted greenhouse space and then we can

257
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,799
do up to a half acre outside but we are

258
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:40,349
doing 10,000 square feet outside

259
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:42,299
and then all these inputs you're growing

260
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,620
on the same farm oh yeah we're going we

261
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:45,958
have the veggie we have about 20 acres

262
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,209
total and and so we're growing a lot of

263
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:50,129
the inputs we do bring in some seeds and

264
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,869
you know a few little things like the

265
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:53,879
kelp and the rock dust so we're bringing

266
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:55,440
a little bits of things but really with

267
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:57,539
them so our current situation with the

268
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,700
greenhouse and the beds the fertility is

269
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:02,039
there we do soil tests and I mean it's

270
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:03,390
basically everything's there we're

271
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:05,429
adding like little bits of things that

272
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:07,259
are a little low and then really what we

273
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:08,939
really weren't beds I mean when you pull

274
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:10,439
it apart they're just wool worms what

275
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,480
we're doing is really just feeding that

276
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,130
top of the soil letting the worms have a

277
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,500
lot at their healthy environment and

278
00:11:14,129 --> 00:11:17,879
some stuff to eat to really just break

279
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,110
down what's in the soil more and make it

280
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,039
available because all that stuff's in

281
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,720
the soil but it needs to be made

282
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:22,980
available to the plants and so really

283
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,230
that's what we're focusing on now is

284
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:27,600
really just these top dresses that have

285
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,339
the seeds popping up and just make that

286
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,690
worm activity happen to really just make

287
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:32,640
that stuff that's in the soil available

288
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,990
and then just giving a little bit I

289
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:35,429
still give a little bit of some plant

290
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,959
permits and permits at certain times

291
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,759
it's a lot of it's green natural farming

292
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,229
stuff and a lot of them are just to

293
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:42,059
stimulate certain different like

294
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,409
flowering with the fruit ferment and

295
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:45,059
then we use like a water soluble calcium

296
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:46,919
that we make out of eggshells and

297
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,208
vinegar and we do that in transition

298
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:53,219
when we when we transplant and in

299
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:54,629
transitions times and then sprouted CTS

300
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,100
I do which is another technique where

301
00:11:54,629 --> 00:11:59,578
sprouts have a lot of enzymes in them

302
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:01,769
and so I'll use a corn sprouted CT going

303
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:04,588
into flour for the first two weeks about

304
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:06,328
once a week and that has a cytokine in

305
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:07,800
it which is the shoot more Mon and so it

306
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:09,479
makes your you know buds just stack

307
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,769
really in that first two weeks and then

308
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,300
after that we'll go to barley seed

309
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:14,669
sprout and barley has a lot of

310
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:17,609
phosphatase because in the in the spring

311
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:19,019
it has to be 60 65 degrees really for

312
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,509
the soil to for the plants uptake

313
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:24,028
prosperous but barley is usually growing

314
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:26,159
before then and it's it's colder so they

315
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:27,929
make their own phosphatase enzyme to

316
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,980
help themselves uptake in that cold

317
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:30,778
temperatures so we're basically

318
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,339
sprouting that barley and then making a

319
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:34,049
tea of it and taking that phosphatase

320
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:35,880
and that phosphatase helps our plants

321
00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:37,109
absorb phosphorus which is what makes

322
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,259
buds you know what makes them the nice

323
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,639
buds and so really that's what we're

324
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,980
kind of using some techniques to make

325
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,240
our our indoor quality where we're in

326
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,610
the indoor market you know and

327
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,169
getting up in the price for it able to

328
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,778
kind of grow a little bit less in a

329
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:53,549
little more focused way and kind of

330
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:55,708
really and there's a really big demand

331
00:12:53,549 --> 00:12:57,689
for it so that's the the balance we

332
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,879
really we are using some resources that

333
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,110
are more than a lot of the I mean the

334
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,059
weight way more than a lot of Sun

335
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,709
growing especially and stuff but but are

336
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:05,609
a lot most of our fertility resources

337
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,109
are coming from our land

338
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:08,370
you know our beds go down into the

339
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,769
native soil it really is this deep

340
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,000
organic culture we have the Sun involved

341
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:13,289
you know in the greenhouse but we also

342
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,958
do have the lights and the climate

343
00:13:13,289 --> 00:13:18,599
control supplementing light you have

344
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:20,338
supplemental lighting like double-ended

345
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,740
yeah we don't have a LED led the price

346
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:25,410
which is so restrictive and prohibitive

347
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,549
that it's as hard it's a hard one to

348
00:13:25,409 --> 00:13:28,350
judge and also they don't give any heat

349
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:30,329
which we actually when we use the lights

350
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,709
is in the winter and we like the heat

351
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,820
and so in the summer we don't really

352
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:35,009
hardly usually in summer it's and

353
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,209
amazingly where you don't use the light

354
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:38,370
and you can we're getting an indoor

355
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:40,289
quality product for you know almost like

356
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,839
two of the seasons and then for like two

357
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:46,139
of the harvests we're using more lights

358
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:48,330
and and you know depending some days or

359
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:50,278
more sunnier we've got a meter that

360
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,079
turns lights on and off so you know as

361
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:54,059
efficient as we can be dialed and we

362
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,769
have sensors and meters for everything

363
00:13:54,059 --> 00:13:58,679
that that that only turns it on if it

364
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:00,299
needs it and but you know if we are

365
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:02,729
using some resources to basically get

366
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:04,539
the quality products are our people

367
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:07,090
using climate batteries

368
00:14:04,539 --> 00:14:09,099
like what are some concepts you're using

369
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,519
to kind of manage the heat like at a

370
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,950
summer

371
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,659
that's hot so yeah the summer gets hot

372
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,300
and also the other problem is that it's

373
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:17,469
dry and so the dryness the leaves get

374
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:19,029
impacted by that you want to keep the

375
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,379
vapor pressure deficit up when it gets

376
00:14:19,029 --> 00:14:22,600
hotter you want to keep the humidity

377
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:24,490
higher and that basically keeps the the

378
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,070
leaves healthy and the sand and the

379
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:29,500
transpiration happening correctly if it

380
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:30,520
gets it gets too hot and dry the plants

381
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,450
close up their stomata

382
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:34,600
and they're not functioning correctly

383
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:36,550
and if it gets too wet and cold the

384
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,720
plants open up and they just try to

385
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:38,889
water just comes out of them and then

386
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,250
water sits on the leaves and it gets

387
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:41,919
moldy

388
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:43,840
so really the vapor pressure deficit is

389
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:46,029
hot and dry and so we have like a wet

390
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:49,389
wall where the air comes through through

391
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:50,919
water and we're in our veg we actually

392
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:53,289
have an earth battery where we kick all

393
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:55,509
the air from we excavated underneath it

394
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:58,329
when we were building it yeah yeah we

395
00:14:55,509 --> 00:15:00,279
kick the air in and we take air from we

396
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,290
basically ran pipes next to each other

397
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,809
and one comes from in the greenhouse and

398
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:07,029
the other ones bring outside air pass

399
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:08,379
that warm air and bring it in so the air

400
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:11,829
is tempered when it comes in it's a

401
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:13,480
little bit warmer that one so we in our

402
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,820
air we have a really high water table

403
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:20,440
and so for that one we only went about

404
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:24,220
three feet and so we've been the water

405
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,240
and so it's a it's kind of new there's

406
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,470
some people doing a different greenhouse

407
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,090
companies doing it we were kind of going

408
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,389
off over there and it is almost new in

409
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:33,399
itself so we didn't have it definitely

410
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,080
works but I think ideally it would be

411
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,699
nice to go deeper to get you know the

412
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,320
more constant temperature but definitely

413
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,700
the air coming in is tempered and some

414
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,410
of that heat gets translated into the

415
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:43,410
ground and so that'd be acts like a

416
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:46,059
birth battery so we did that for our veg

417
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:47,139
for our big greenhouse and actually our

418
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:49,419
new greenhouse we're trying to figure

419
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:52,059
out some way of bringing in air from

420
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:53,769
we're thinking like an undergrad like

421
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:55,269
where it's some kind of trench so that

422
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:56,529
air just gonna be coming from there

423
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:57,879
because really that's what we need to do

424
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:59,500
is we need to take that that coolness

425
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,279
from the ground and the heat we don't

426
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,309
get too hot

427
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:05,079
I guess California but we definitely do

428
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:07,209
have days when it's 90 and really the

429
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,070
biggest part is in the end of flower

430
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,910
that's when the quality gets rude if

431
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,700
it's hot at the end of flower

432
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:15,589
makes it you know the first month you

433
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,970
know you can have nice hot you can human

434
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,889
make it humid and just really get them

435
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:21,560
to rage but it really is that end of

436
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:24,289
flower that that that'll ruin the

437
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:27,079
quality so and then also the end of

438
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:29,029
flower just the humidity thing is really

439
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,740
the dehumidifiers so that when the

440
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:33,589
lights do go off they can just get rid

441
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:35,000
of that initial load and it really it's

442
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,250
a pretty crucial part to is getting rid

443
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,129
that humidity so I think thatthat to it

444
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:42,019
people are coming like definitely the

445
00:16:39,129 --> 00:16:43,309
the technology is really advancing for

446
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:45,470
all this stuff too and the engineering

447
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:47,239
where I think that it's gonna come leaps

448
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,740
and bounds you know the efficiencies and

449
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,330
there's like cirrus greenhouses which

450
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,889
are like in Colorado serious

451
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:53,360
they're super efficient really

452
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:55,250
interesting if you want to look up and

453
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,620
it's just it's going that way where cuz

454
00:16:55,250 --> 00:17:00,980
you can make an indoor product in a way

455
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:02,240
more efficient sustainable way and get a

456
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,059
premium for it you know we're really

457
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,470
it's it's translating the the cost of

458
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:08,509
goods translating to what we're getting

459
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,160
and the demand really makes the business

460
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:12,410
part of it really easy like we're not

461
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,779
you know there's no if it's taking out

462
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:17,840
that part of the struggle of the sales

463
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:20,389
and everything you know so it's well

464
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,889
what's the specific differentiator of

465
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:26,240
those greenhouses what are they call

466
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:29,960
them so as far as the OCR SCE re s so so

467
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,240
the there's the company yeah and the

468
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,799
whole back of it is a insulated panels

469
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,490
so the whole back and it's almost like a

470
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:39,289
it's like a warehouse almost that that

471
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,870
has one side that's that's your

472
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:44,180
greenhouse and it's acrylic so that it

473
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:45,500
gets more UV but then they're doing the

474
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,320
earth batteries so it's like a full

475
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,960
closed system and it's just really built

476
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,789
with efficiency of making a closed

477
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,930
system kind of go closest and efficiency

478
00:17:52,789 --> 00:17:55,279
built in it instead of like ultra

479
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,840
greenhouse where it's just air coming in

480
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,099
one side going out the other that's

481
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:59,689
really the traditional greenhouse is

482
00:17:58,099 --> 00:18:01,909
just bring area and bend it out and

483
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:04,100
where this one is like a closed more and

484
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:06,870
and the blue the back you don't lose as

485
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:08,730
much heat out of the back and

486
00:18:06,869 --> 00:18:10,889
yeah the way it's built just for

487
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:14,640
efficiency really so but very pricey

488
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:16,670
what once one like when you get back

489
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,660
what's kind of one of the first like

490
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,890
experiments you're gonna like something

491
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,509
you're going to be playing with whether

492
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:24,090
it's in the greenhouse infrastructure

493
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:25,589
the soil the compost tea we're getting a

494
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:27,750
lot more into wood chips and really

495
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:29,309
using them so you know peat moss is

496
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:31,019
usually or if you're just potting

497
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,909
material peat moss is that fluff and

498
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:35,849
it's really what the people use coconut

499
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:39,870
as well but it's not as good and really

500
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:41,969
that soil component you can replace with

501
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:43,679
wood chips that are fungally like broken

502
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,620
down but usually takes about like two to

503
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,759
three years and can work on getting that

504
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:49,739
to happen a little sooner with

505
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,599
inoculating with fungus and really is

506
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,920
pulling branches from the problem yeah

507
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,079
we have a lot we have a little woodlot

508
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,460
and so a lot of alder that needs to be

509
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:58,799
thinned out anyway and it's to thin it

510
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,720
out to make the firs grow a little

511
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,609
better and you know they definitely

512
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,980
there's a real room to take them out

513
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:07,769
so using that and just turning that into

514
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,029
into soil basically for our our potting

515
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:10,710
because our beds are there they're you

516
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:12,000
know note so we just leave the bed we're

517
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:14,850
just planting in them but but all our

518
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,829
starts in our vegetative we we need soil

519
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:19,289
and so we have been getting a soil mix

520
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:21,029
that we have a custom blend but I kinda

521
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:22,710
wanna get away from bringing in that

522
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:25,319
outside you know a little bit of peat

523
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:27,059
moss really does work amazingly but but

524
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,339
what I've been seeing for most

525
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:31,049
experimentation and hearing from some

526
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:32,849
other antidotal is that it really can

527
00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:35,579
replace the wood chips can replace the

528
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:39,000
moss fumbly broken-down wood chips and

529
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:42,149
so yeah that'll be a big part other

530
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,339
experiments we're getting a lot more

531
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:50,550
perennial plantings around the farm just

532
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:51,480
creating that long-term if it's hard not

533
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:53,099
to just get caught up in the day-to-day

534
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,870
just grow in the weed but just kind of

535
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:56,099
that whole system's thing so really just

536
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:58,379
bring in the more permaculture and we do

537
00:19:56,099 --> 00:20:01,169
a lot because most of the the ferments

538
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:03,920
we use a lot of in our own art base all

539
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:05,940
our own plants and herbs but you also do

540
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,630
IPM integrated like pest management

541
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:12,080
sprays and stuff with herbal teas and so

542
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,270
we do like a heavy herbal tea

543
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,859
of different things but Jerusalem

544
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:19,460
artichoke is one thing but then thyme

545
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:21,529
and oregano and mints and you can roll

546
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,940
around on the property and we will make

547
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:24,259
a heavy T of that and then we make a

548
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,779
wetting agent which is a castile soap

549
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:29,660
and we use that as our as our pesto as

550
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:31,910
our pesto when you and when dear yes

551
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,830
yeah the JWA so it's all jude and

552
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:35,660
methods that we're basically bleeding

553
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:37,549
from we used some korean natural farming

554
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,550
sunja dams and biodynamic really just

555
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:43,250
taking whatever we can glean from these

556
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:45,230
different methods for you know where we

557
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:50,089
need to fill in those and the whole shit

558
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:52,400
is a Jedi JD a.m. so it's basically

559
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:57,230
addressing what was the issue that kind

560
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:59,660
of KNF doesn't quite address that it's a

561
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:03,019
big scale it's more for like so Master

562
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:06,019
Choa we started KNF you saw that all the

563
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:08,480
old farmers were using like using their

564
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:10,250
kimchi juice and using these ferments to

565
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,470
help their food production as well as

566
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,329
making permits of all their crop waste

567
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,009
and using that as fertilizer because

568
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:17,419
Korea was Island so they're not bringing

569
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:20,240
in stuff you know a lot of agriculture

570
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:21,800
like 50 years based on ramen your

571
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,450
fertilizer being an input you know

572
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:25,099
usually a waste material input that they

573
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:27,140
put into in the fertilizer for something

574
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:28,490
else Korea they didn't have that so they

575
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,670
really had to like close the loop and

576
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,440
and then the ferments as well we're just

577
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:34,940
part of the agriculture and and you know

578
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,350
feeding the soil those microbes could

579
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:38,240
break all the nutrients down which is

580
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:39,829
the same thing for us the probiotic with

581
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,670
the microbes are like our probiotics

582
00:21:39,829 --> 00:21:41,960
they're what's breaking down our

583
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:43,009
nutrients and being unavailable there

584
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:45,980
was breaking down the nutrients in the

585
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:47,329
soil making them available and so so the

586
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,519
more of those microbes the more you can

587
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:52,009
you know inoculate with that the more

588
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:54,680
breakdown you're getting and so a lot of

589
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:56,420
those is for like small-scale and really

590
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:59,269
the crea natural farming I think to for

591
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:00,840
like quality giving that little boost to

592
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:03,970
make that that

593
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:05,589
what conventional agriculture does to

594
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,660
make it that marketable fruit you know

595
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:09,099
marketable really nice fruit it's like

596
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,870
hard to get without giving it all that's

597
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:13,449
a little boost and so I think that very

598
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:15,189
natural farming is really that extra to

599
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:17,289
give that market a bold that net really

600
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:20,410
nice and then but it uses different

601
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:22,629
sugars and some outside materials to

602
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:25,360
make experiments which a lot of them are

603
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,740
stable though so they're easy but but

604
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,409
they do have a cost involved where's

605
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:31,299
your damn so master Joe's son learned

606
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:33,310
from Master Joe and then went to

607
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:34,779
university went to chemistry and biology

608
00:22:33,309 --> 00:22:36,539
and everything and then farmed for

609
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:37,960
fifteen years so this would be like

610
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:42,159
Bruce Lee

611
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:45,039
- if man like he learned from some guy

612
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:48,700
and then he's like let me yeah and then

613
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,589
also with a lot more of a science like

614
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,850
he's been like testing and he does you

615
00:22:50,589 --> 00:22:53,500
know nutrient tests on all these things

616
00:22:51,849 --> 00:22:56,230
so a little more of a science background

617
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:58,450
you know it's definitely like KNF 2.0 it

618
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:00,279
will it's but it's scaled more for not

619
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,900
his whole thing is that organic farmers

620
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:03,670
and this is like food farmers can

621
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,960
survive it could thrive if they don't

622
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:06,400
have to buy all their inputs if you're

623
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,140
buying inputs and if you're like

624
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,670
fertilizer and pesticides and everything

625
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,110
that are organic but still you're buying

626
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:13,150
them and you're bringing them in there's

627
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:14,169
you're you're losing your you know

628
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,820
you're spending too much money you're

629
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:17,380
basically costs are too high so his

630
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:20,169
thing is we would make everything with

631
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,130
with inexpensive you know organic inputs

632
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:24,279
you're basically going to be making

633
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:25,330
money and or inputs that work and so so

634
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:27,250
he came up with all these different math

635
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:30,460
it's a lot of them just ferments or ways

636
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:31,900
to ferment and examples that that and a

637
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,920
lot of it's just your your crop waste if

638
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,600
you're growing strawberries you take all

639
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,610
your strawberry waste and you firm in it

640
00:23:34,599 --> 00:23:38,439
and the next year you use it on your

641
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:42,250
crop but he also has a microbe solution

642
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:45,160
that uses mashed potatoes and forests

643
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,329
like the leaf mold I go to like nice

644
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,860
healthy forests and where it's like

645
00:23:46,329 --> 00:23:49,210
fungal and stuff you take that leaf mold

646
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:51,099
and then nice place in the field and

647
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,410
take that and take all those that's your

648
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:55,149
like your microbial inoculation and use

649
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:57,550
the potatoes mashed potatoes and sea

650
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:58,810
salt and you make a you take the starch

651
00:23:57,549 --> 00:24:01,029
out of the potatoes and the sea salt

652
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:03,069
into the water and then add that microbe

653
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:05,139
inoculation and it sits for about three

654
00:24:03,069 --> 00:24:07,509
days it starts to bubble and

655
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:10,090
just like this the roots of the plants

656
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:19,839
are feeding microbes so what's happening

657
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:20,619
in what's happening in so in the soil

658
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:22,539
naturally that plants are

659
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:24,039
photosynthesizing right and forty

660
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:25,480
percent up to forty percent sometimes

661
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:28,058
like you could say that more or less of

662
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,798
the sugars are going down into the soil

663
00:24:28,058 --> 00:24:31,178
and feeding the microbes so that's the

664
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:32,950
natural process the natural process if

665
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:35,250
the microbes get fed by the root

666
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:38,980
exudates that come out of the plant and

667
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:40,929
and so basically when I make the microbe

668
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,390
solution you're using that potato which

669
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:45,280
is a root to feed as the sugar the

670
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,690
microbes and the sea salts the minerals

671
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:48,730
and you're basically growing those

672
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,558
microbes and proliferating them and then

673
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,240
we're feeding that to the soil and so

674
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,759
that's our microbial inoculation that's

675
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,120
another JDAM method the herbal solution

676
00:24:54,759 --> 00:25:01,359
he has a sulfur spray that is uh pretty

677
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:04,689
amazing so I think pajetta management

678
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:09,119
was one of its more for like a

679
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:11,350
commercial agriculture kind of see where

680
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,659
green natural farming seems like it's

681
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:14,949
more for really the high quality it's

682
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,660
really that's what makes like quality

683
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,730
it's always little extras like super for

684
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,950
the heddes and to dance more like the

685
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:23,410
utility that's what I find it's like the

686
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,970
yeah it's for the crop that Korean

687
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,590
natural farming really helps the quality

688
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,569
and and the jus damn really helps with

689
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:33,389
the the bulk stuff that you can just do

690
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:37,000
for a lot cheaper and so in a nutshell

691
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:40,030
yes quickly one cultivar that you're

692
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,109
growing that maybe doesn't have market

693
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:45,339
appeal but that you love so it's an

694
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:49,029
interesting one that we have a turbine

695
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:52,899
chocolate that not the most bag appeal

696
00:25:49,029 --> 00:25:54,910
and it's by 16 percent THC and but it

697
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,769
really it gets like three to four plus

698
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:59,320
percent torque means and it's amazing

699
00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:00,819
terpene and and we actually we entered

700
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:02,470
in the cultivation classic up in Oregon

701
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:04,450
and it didn't really have too much inner

702
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:06,220
I didn't think it would win at all and

703
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,590
it actually took first place against all

704
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,058
the indoor which showed it was I mean

705
00:26:08,589 --> 00:26:12,189
it's super high chirpy really nice

706
00:26:10,058 --> 00:26:14,589
smoking really lively strain that

707
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,769
basically won against all these I mean

708
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:17,808
really

709
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:20,750
new thing you know all these new

710
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:22,428
designer and like an all indoor but it

711
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,679
kind of really shows yeah we've seen a

712
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:25,940
lot that some of these really they have

713
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:28,340
strains that aren't heavy-duty that

714
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:30,080
don't seem as much just when the smoke

715
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:32,419
comes out it's really it's what's in

716
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:35,169
that smoke and what's in that final so

717
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:37,970
now really that's an interesting one

718
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:39,740
I'd say though we are we're selecting

719
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:43,400
for marketability so most of the things

720
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,870
I mean we're we're definitely it's a

721
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,429
hard day yeah it's a little bit hard

722
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:48,019
we're definitely have to so much fear

723
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:50,690
towards what the market wants which is a

724
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:52,129
strong you know but we really when we

725
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:54,230
phenotype it's all for what it smokes

726
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:56,000
like we want to oily residence smoke you

727
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:57,410
know we'll we'll basically it could grow

728
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,970
great I could look creating smell great

729
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,380
but how does it actually translate into

730
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,690
smoking and we found through our

731
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:04,520
phenotyping that some yes some strains

732
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,470
it could be the same ten seeds and a few

733
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:08,599
of them will smoke amazing and be oily

734
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:10,100
or maybe one of them and and some of

735
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:11,990
them and you know majority of them will

736
00:27:10,099 --> 00:27:13,639
just be like leafy and just not not have

737
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,190
a nice smoke to them and even if they

738
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,650
look beautiful they and over it's pretty

739
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:19,850
amazing it's it's kind of a some strange

740
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,080
definitely so that's what we're really

741
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:22,609
in the flower market I find that's our

742
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,960
niche I find that that's gonna be the

743
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:25,129
niche because only so many people want

744
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,240
to grow a good flower only if twenty

745
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:28,160
people know how to grow a good flower

746
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,980
want to put the love and energy into it

747
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,330
it's a very hands-on thing and and so I

748
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:34,190
feel there's always gonna be that market

749
00:27:32,329 --> 00:27:36,439
it's gonna be that fine wine and you

750
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,840
flower-like solvent let's hash I feel

751
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,769
like we have we do make some and our

752
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:44,269
well our outdoor production it goes to

753
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:47,808
extraction which some of it's been co2

754
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:49,129
now some good solvent list but uh that's

755
00:27:47,808 --> 00:27:52,700
mostly we don't really have enough and

756
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:54,800
waste or leftover like trim material to

757
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,120
make too much product just cos art we

758
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:00,289
have small batches we do so much small

759
00:27:56,119 --> 00:28:02,959
batches of different flavors and so yeah

760
00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:09,889
that's our can essentials that's our

761
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:13,190
brand right there yeah I it's so my

762
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:16,750
whole journey to came over a lot I had a

763
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:18,919
lot of I love digestive problems and I

764
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:20,569
was really into the food I guess I got

765
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:22,160
into veganism early and it was real odd

766
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:23,779
because the animal thing but if you're

767
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,429
my veganism I got really unhealthy

768
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:31,730
because I wasn't eating right and I a

769
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:33,470
lot of digestive problems and and fast

770
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:35,390
for tied to grow some weed it didn't

771
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:36,980
really grow I was like I need to take

772
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,690
botany I dropped out of high school I

773
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,990
saw at the Community College was botany

774
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:43,789
a win and I took botany and and just

775
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,470
learned all about how actually

776
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:47,569
everything works that you know how our

777
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,370
our DNA is actually putting the other

778
00:28:47,569 --> 00:28:50,659
proteins to build everything and and you

779
00:28:49,369 --> 00:28:52,939
need those raw materials to make all

780
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,019
that happen and and just translating

781
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,160
that into like the plant I was like oh

782
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:56,690
I'm not feeding these plans for the

783
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,808
plants are drying and then I realized

784
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:01,220
well I'm not feeding myself enough and

785
00:28:58,808 --> 00:29:03,649
really like growing cannabis has shown

786
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,419
me with growing them and seeing how you

787
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,798
can make them super healthy you can take

788
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:08,299
a plant that's totally sick and bring it

789
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:12,139
back by feeding it and even out in the

790
00:29:08,298 --> 00:29:13,519
field to vegetables and I really like to

791
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,350
you know it's really taught me about

792
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,819
feeding myself and being healthy and

793
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:19,129
that's what I kind of like to get out to

794
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:20,509
I like to have a platform of the herb

795
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:22,610
where it's like you like wow that herbs

796
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,660
amazing and say well it's grown with all

797
00:29:22,609 --> 00:29:25,039
these things all these nutrients

798
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,630
nutrient-dense things that translates

799
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,678
into it and this is how the soil works

800
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:29,150
and everything works and this is the

801
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,009
same as our bodies our bodies have the

802
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,840
same kind of system little microbiome

803
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:35,000
going on in us and we need all these

804
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:36,558
base materials you can take us through

805
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,298
how impressed they are with the flap

806
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:39,678
that's what I feel it's I mean I could

807
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:41,179
all day long be like I got kale I got

808
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,798
kale but people most people don't care

809
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,850
about the flower I can get in front

810
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:45,410
equation I love going to like

811
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:47,689
dispensaries and talking about tenders

812
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:49,680
and everything because I I have a little

813
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:51,240
bit of a plateau

814
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,200
a minute of their time because I have

815
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:57,450
their attention and that's what I like

816
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,860
follow the flower exactly and then I can

817
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,000
really like download stuff that they're

818
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:02,039
really like Wow

819
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,049
and then able to you know you could put

820
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:05,519
out even more because there is we do

821
00:30:04,049 --> 00:30:06,930
have the you know they're talking to

822
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,420
people and they're sharing information

823
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,710
so we have this kind of a really cool

824
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,029
information sharing community thing

825
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:14,220
happening with the cannabis that's

826
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:15,450
really and it's a lot of conscious it's

827
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,039
mostly people that are a little bit more

828
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,600
trying to think a little different and

829
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,740
conscious which is kind of what we need

830
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:20,669
you know what I mean hopefully we need

831
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:23,430
to get the people that aren't thinking

832
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:26,340
to get on our train tube but I really

833
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:28,590
feel it is this this this movement and

834
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:31,019
and seeing it in my you know short

835
00:30:28,589 --> 00:30:33,269
lifetime and experience with it is from

836
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:35,279
20 years ago it being completely you

837
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:37,740
know illegal and and not really it was

838
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,690
all over but now it's just so normalized

839
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,849
that everybody and what I mean like my

840
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:43,470
mom smoked and we my grant but you know

841
00:30:41,849 --> 00:30:46,259
it's like the kids grandma everybody

842
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:49,500
it's like you know it's such a and it's

843
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:51,079
not stigmatize it's it's so really yeah

844
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,890
it's pretty amazing to see that it

845
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:55,199
there's no reason it shouldn't have been

846
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:57,120
anyway but I don't know it's just kind

847
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,009
of amazing to see what really is and I

848
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,899
think we should definitely use it as a

849
00:30:59,009 --> 00:31:02,279
platform to spread more better things

850
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,630
you know not just again of it so that

851
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:06,500
that's my whole thing that's how I pull

852
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,500
it all for a full circle
