2
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:19,109
some of the common things that were seen

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,539
from established growers who are

4
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,400
sophisticated operators who let's say

5
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,830
have a number of grows across the state

6
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:27,750
of California and have been preparing

7
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:31,079
for this transition and who are well

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,630
prepared to comply with all the state

9
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:37,199
regulations with regard to cultivation

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,780
and already have really you know a very

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,359
well-known brand and distribution system

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,489
and all of that so get what the state is

13
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:47,308
attempting to do and is in the process

14
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:50,729
of doing is one of the biggest

15
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:54,058
challenges is the I need a home for my

16
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:55,468
business or I need to be able to have

17
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,589
the city or county in which I'm

18
00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:01,198
operating issue business permits so

19
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:04,948
that's kind of number one is you know

20
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:07,560
where do I land or I am landed and can I

21
00:01:04,948 --> 00:01:15,179
move forward in that area do they have a

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:17,430
permitting process in place that's right

23
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,799
that's right and then what we're finding

24
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,110
now if you look at City okay so so how

25
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,560
to address that maybe let me speak to

26
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:27,509
that first how to address if your

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,909
municipality does not specifically

28
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,819
authorize cultivation or any type of

29
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,859
cannabis business now this is when even

30
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:36,688
though I am a lawyer and I'm a business

31
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:41,039
and corporate attorney to the cannabis

32
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:42,898
industry we do especially over the last

33
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,450
several years you know there's a lot of

34
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:49,049
political work and political strategy

35
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:53,100
that goes into working on these types of

36
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:56,790
matters these days so and it all the

37
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:59,819
analysis is always client and site and

38
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:03,118
moment in time specific so it isn't

39
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:05,669
because the child the challenges the

40
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:09,149
political mechanism is not in place yet

41
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,640
that that's that's the challenge I want

42
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,889
to be able to have a cultivation permit

43
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:15,809
from my County but that political

44
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,059
mechanism isn't in place how do we get

45
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,979
there then it's understanding what is

46
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,229
the political process in my particular

47
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:24,419
area who are the players involved right

48
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:27,899
it's this it's a really a political

49
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:29,879
strategy and that type of very detailed

50
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,740
and out analysis what will it take to

51
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,719
get me there is it meetings with

52
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:36,600
particular people within the Economic

53
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,939
Development Department is it a very

54
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,949
coordinated effort and organizing

55
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:43,770
amongst other growers like we did in

56
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:45,839
Santa Barbara County saying here's you

57
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:49,439
know we've got a bunch of farmers here a

58
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,450
bunch of flower farms that are all I

59
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,329
mean many of whom are having some

60
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:56,969
challenges because yes that's right and

61
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,769
so you know people are foreclosing on

62
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,269
their farms or what do I do you know

63
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,789
like not being able to kind of support

64
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:04,709
themselves anymore well geez here's this

65
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:06,629
cannabis industry or men at many

66
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,759
cannabis farmers that had already

67
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:11,609
located there over a long period of time

68
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:13,799
so kind of recognizing that there's a

69
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,080
collective need getting organized

70
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,269
understanding that a political process

71
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,340
and interfacing with local elected

72
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:23,640
officials and various agencies requires

73
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,500
coordination sophistication thinking

74
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,229
about what is good public policy in this

75
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,959
area how do we how do we explain that we

76
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:33,298
are indeed responsible community members

77
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,269
what sort of messaging is going to be

78
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:38,489
around this and listen listen to what

79
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:41,569
the needs are of the community don't be

80
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:45,180
shy about that political discourse

81
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:47,669
involves many different perspectives one

82
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,430
has to be calm and understand that the

83
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:52,559
way that things are best done usually

84
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,150
involves that we sit around a table and

85
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,909
we listen to each other and we come up

86
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,950
with strategy and we come up with you

87
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:01,199
know some solution that maybe doesn't

88
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:03,689
meet everyone's need as needs as much as

89
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,849
they act think that they have needs but

90
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:08,219
you know is is is this building

91
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:10,799
collaborative effort and we're seeing

92
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:13,709
that done in Santa Barbara County it's

93
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,739
really such a lovely thing so you know

94
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,988
however it takes two so you're positive

95
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:21,629
about what you are currently seeing

96
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:24,379
where Santa Barbara County is going as

97
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:28,009
it relates to cannabis cultivation

98
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:32,329
absolutely at all of that said nothing

99
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:34,939
as we I think become older in life we

100
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:36,709
recognize nothing is fully black and

101
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:38,899
white right and there are so it's

102
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:41,180
contoured there are challenges there

103
00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:43,729
right there and there will be challenges

104
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,920
in this process and the role of the

105
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:49,160
industry or the role of the growers is

106
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:52,490
to identify that this proposal by the

107
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:56,720
county is not workable and why that is

108
00:04:52,490 --> 00:05:00,710
and give support for that in terms of at

109
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,570
the hearings through talking with media

110
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:04,699
through talking with each other through

111
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:07,009
talking with their neighbors who are not

112
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:10,099
in the cannabis industry so continuing a

113
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:12,589
process of education around why a part

114
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,330
of you know a proposal by the county

115
00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:17,000
wouldn't be workable right this is a

116
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:19,159
conversation so is it positive at least

117
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,500
the county is having the conversation my

118
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,870
god they have they actually have town

119
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,389
hall meetings and will take meetings

120
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:31,550
with folks in the industry so that very

121
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:35,089
open door process is a really remarkable

122
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,430
one when you have that you know we have

123
00:05:35,089 --> 00:05:39,769
so so so many cities and counties that

124
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,290
don't even want to have the conversation

125
00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:44,389
don't want to talk to people who are in

126
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:47,360
the industry or really make that

127
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:50,659
political process and incredibly non

128
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,449
transparent one so that instead what you

129
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,640
see is and now we'll skip to here's a

130
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:57,889
challenge that folks are having instead

131
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:59,719
what you see is a municipality says

132
00:05:57,889 --> 00:06:01,339
alright we want to get in the industry

133
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,100
or we've got some folks who are pushing

134
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:07,699
us to allow the industry to site their

135
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:09,830
businesses in our municipality we like

136
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:11,839
the idea because of revenue jobs and

137
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:13,490
whatever really positive public pot or

138
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,879
we believe in it as a what you know

139
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:19,610
whatever reasoning behind it and so

140
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:22,750
because but for whatever reasons not

141
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:26,180
creating a transparent or very public

142
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:28,550
rulemaking process or a very short and

143
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:31,459
time frame for that or very little

144
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,780
feedback from the community you have a

145
00:06:31,459 --> 00:06:35,089
finalized

146
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:36,949
set of local rules the local ordinance

147
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:38,029
owning ordinance and maybe a regulatory

148
00:06:36,949 --> 00:06:39,920
ordinance in the

149
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:41,899
that deals with kind of operations and

150
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,759
applications and all of that that gets

151
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:49,459
finalized 3-4 weeks later the

152
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:53,629
application comes out and two to four

153
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:56,539
weeks later a very voluminous expensive

154
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:58,490
application that may be a $70,000 like

155
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:00,670
what is being proposed in the city of LA

156
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:05,030
to the fees just to apply for one permit

157
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:08,300
comes at no cultivation - for anything

158
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:11,959
in the city of LA so you know they come

159
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:15,460
out and suddenly you you know you're

160
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:20,029
kind of one is kind of scrambling to get

161
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:22,870
organized and on board for you know for

162
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:25,069
an application and to kind of try to

163
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,949
secure that permitting in that

164
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:29,779
particular municipality and so that's an

165
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:33,620
example you know that that's an example

166
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:36,379
of a challenge that that many many folks

167
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:39,220
are facing which is okay now we have a

168
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:41,449
process in play which is also not

169
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,770
necessarily a well-oiled machine in

170
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:46,159
these municipalities because they've

171
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:49,250
never permitted these businesses and so

172
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:53,600
trying to scramble and put together

173
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:55,310
their best effort to apply through what

174
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,220
is a very expensive incredibly

175
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,139
voluminous incredibly complicated local

176
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,140
permitting process we've run some of

177
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:04,639
these numbers for folks just in terms of

178
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:06,709
what is it gonna take to get through a

179
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,360
local permitting process state licensing

180
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:10,430
let's say you rent your property and

181
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,810
build out in blah blah blah you know

182
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,660
kind of depending on the license type

183
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:17,240
but we're seeing you know from 750,000

184
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,770
to 5.6 million I mean now we're talking

185
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,819
about like volatile manufacturing but

186
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:24,529
you know a lot of my role these days is

187
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:26,569
having real honest conversations with

188
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:29,229
folks about what all of this actually

189
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:33,289
involves financially and otherwise

190
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:36,279
because I want and I want I want us all

191
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:38,750
to make good decisions for our lives and

192
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:41,089
really the only way we can do that is if

193
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,889
we have accurate information and there's

194
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:44,509
a lot of information that's not knowable

195
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:47,689
and there's a lot of inaccurate

196
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:51,409
information out there so you know really

197
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,620
just again as as I spoke about at the

198
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:54,799
bee

199
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:57,740
this conversation taking the time to

200
00:08:54,799 --> 00:09:00,679
really understand in detail what does

201
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,720
this process involve to get to the

202
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:06,039
regulated market what does that involve

203
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,040
for the legacy grower

204
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:23,239
