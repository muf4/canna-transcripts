[Music]

2
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:20,910
so I'm really interested in what you

3
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:25,009
think about the elevation team of our

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:29,960
and phenotype in the cannabis plant

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:32,759
through earth conscious through

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,149
microbiology conscious through

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,359
environmental conscious and breeding as

8
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:44,640
well I guess ways how how do you think

9
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:47,308
that that that intertwined we we're

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,308
seeing a real dichotomy in the cannabis

11
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:53,159
industry between what I'll call factory

12
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:55,948
production of cannabis and I've seen

13
00:00:53,159 --> 00:01:02,419
some very sophisticated operations all

14
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:05,849
under LED lights artificial media and

15
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,609
there's a uniform product that results

16
00:01:05,849 --> 00:01:10,289
but whether this is really something

17
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:14,909
that's going to be truly therapeutic is

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:17,850
an open question somewhere in the middle

19
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,609
I've seen indoor operations with all

20
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:25,949
organic media and a real effort to

21
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:28,799
create a biological foundation for

22
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,290
healthy plants and it shows in terms of

23
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,990
what the plants look like they're

24
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,860
trichome density and all those good

25
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:41,039
things on the other side is regenerative

26
00:01:37,859 --> 00:01:43,879
agriculture which philosophically and

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,939
conceptually really appeals to me is

28
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:51,519
trying to maximize the potential of what

29
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:53,529
the plant can do but

30
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:56,670
there again there are different

31
00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:00,070
considerations I'm fond of saying that

32
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:05,340
if you want to produce good terpenoids

33
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:07,929
like in lavender you actually need an

34
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,750
environment like in Provence and France

35
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:14,230
they have a very poorer rocky soil and

36
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:18,909
it's actually that stress to the plant

37
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:22,049
that causes it to produce more of these

38
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:25,479
protective materials so is it possible

39
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,819
question is for a plant to be too happy

40
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:31,719
and it's not going to produce as much of

41
00:02:27,818 --> 00:02:34,030
these materials because it's getting

42
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:37,269
everything it does need from the soil or

43
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,039
in the question sure is it producing all

44
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:42,549
of it because you're giving it an

45
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:46,030
ultimate nutrient from what I've seen so

46
00:02:42,549 --> 00:02:49,689
far the answer is the latter we have a

47
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:52,870
situation where a plant that's in a rich

48
00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:56,439
soil and he has the proper mycorrhizae

49
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:59,650
there has the ability to uptake anything

50
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:01,509
it needs and under those conditions you

51
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:04,090
definitely going to have a happy plant

52
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:07,689
and my suspicion is you're going to have

53
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:09,489
the most therapeutic kind of plant it

54
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:12,189
would be helpful at this point they have

55
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:16,090
a few more scientific studies that

56
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:18,639
either confirm or refute this kind of

57
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,629
concept but it is a question we can

58
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,629
easily answer

59
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:29,980
pretty amazing but I think that we're

60
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:36,519
noticing now from breeding maybe like to

61
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:38,348
see varietal for 1213 years and just you

62
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,439
know not keeping a mother for that whole

63
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:44,219
time but you know picking out varietals

64
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:48,609
each year for seed production that

65
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:51,609
visually looks like that all the factory

66
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:54,010
look like that are growing the same way

67
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:58,359
and that's the way that we do our

68
00:03:54,009 --> 00:04:00,429
breeding so you know it's not so

69
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:02,140
scientific although we have done you

70
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:04,930
know labs and different tests we haven't

71
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:07,298
done it in particular of what we're

72
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:11,170
seeing with varietal starting to raise

73
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:13,689
their CDG CVG especially so we'll get

74
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:17,620
something maybe even a one-point

75
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:21,699
whatever and have varietal for a long

76
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:24,370
time CVG levels are really skyrocketing

77
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:26,949
the other thing that I noticed is that

78
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:31,560
and I want to ask you this next is that

79
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:34,990
the THC goes down and other cannabinoids

80
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,720
raise up well certainly I think that's a

81
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,610
good thing somebody who believes in the

82
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,620
entourage and the benefits of these

83
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:47,310
other components it shouldn't all be

84
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:50,699
about THC that is in contrast the aim of

85
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:54,699
production in most of the factory

86
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:57,879
situations either super high THC or

87
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:59,439
super high CBD again I have no

88
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:01,459
confidence that that's going to produce

89
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:07,509
the best medicine

90
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:10,849
so I like to see this diversity and

91
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:13,819
experientially what we hear from doctors

92
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:17,180
that are using diversified material as

93
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:18,620
they're seeing better results that it's

94
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,769
working better for a variety of

95
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:25,340
conditions also better toleration by the

96
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:31,789
patient's you know it shouldn't be all

97
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:36,728
about getting a high THC number like if

98
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:41,750
you're milking heavily one cannabinoid

99
00:05:36,728 --> 00:05:44,839
then it's almost like a ratio thing the

100
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:47,569
other cannabinoids will go down to well

101
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:50,929
it doesn't need to be we're seeing some

102
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:53,120
more balanced normally you've got one

103
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:55,400
that's predominant and maybe another one

104
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,090
that could have close to the same amount

105
00:05:55,399 --> 00:06:02,089
or more often a lower amount but we're

106
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:04,399
also seeing some very balanced ones

107
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:07,869
where they're actually reasonable

108
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,870
amounts of four different cannabinoids

109
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:18,740
there's really a max amount of weight

110
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:24,250
that can be well that's absolutely true

111
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:27,319
I don't believe anything above 30% 25 is

112
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:30,699
logical upper limit and that would be

113
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,978
from a top bud that's well manicured

114
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:37,189
where everything has been done to

115
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:39,939
maximize that number but that'd be a

116
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:43,399
total so it is a reciprocal relationship

117
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:48,649
you could have 25% THC but you can't

118
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:51,259
have 25% THC and 12% of CBD you know a

119
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:56,829
trichome is only a certain percentage of

120
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:59,420
the mass of a flower so there are limits

121
00:06:56,829 --> 00:07:03,139
but yeah I'm very interested in seeing

122
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:07,730
these balance king of ours again in

123
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:10,810
contrast there is tendency the approach

124
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:13,870
at GW Pharmaceuticals was definitely

125
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:17,329
specific cannabinoids in the highest

126
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:20,509
concentrations and then if necessary

127
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:23,930
could use that to blend sativex is in

128
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:27,230
fact a combination of a high THC and a

129
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:30,980
high CBD kimura BER so that's another

130
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:32,810
way to do it a blended medicine ideally

131
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,600
it's nice if you get what you need from

132
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:38,720
one plant but that is going to take a

133
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,750
lot of selective breeding and a lot of

134
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:46,130
experimentation with patients to see

135
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:50,149
what works so what about the idea you

136
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:54,829
know not only our soil beds and really

137
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:57,979
rich microbiology environments that are

138
00:07:54,829 --> 00:08:01,189
heavy and fungi and a continuous feeding

139
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:05,500
cycle good for cannabis as we know and

140
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,500
we need to study in it we need to

141
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,569
absolutely so there are two issues here

142
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:13,399
one is what's best for the plant and its

143
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:15,409
therapeutic potential the other is

144
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:18,739
what's best for the earth and the

145
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:21,560
environment that's no contest we already

146
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:25,730
know people should be doing this because

147
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:28,970
it is the most ecologically relevant and

148
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:30,919
helpful you know idea that you can have

149
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,899
a rich soil you haven't added any

150
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:34,848
nitrogen there's not going to be any

151
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:35,799
runoff that's getting into the water

152
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:39,740
table

153
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:43,639
producing elgible ohms downstream this

154
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:45,320
is critical because you know things are

155
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,419
changing we're going to have an

156
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,090
increasingly harsh environment on this

157
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:52,309
planet and we need to be doing

158
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:55,129
everything we can to mitigate the harms

159
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:57,949
and regenerative agriculture is

160
00:08:55,129 --> 00:09:01,458
absolutely one of the top priorities

161
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:04,670
yeah and we're really noticing that as

162
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:08,449
cannabis farmers right now because we

163
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:11,000
are getting pathogens on our plants that

164
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,519
we've never had before in amounts that

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,600
we've never had before of course that

166
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:19,459
definitely has to do with the trade of

167
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,560
this plant and being able to make clones

168
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:23,448
and then you're passing on the pathogens

169
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:25,309
with the clones and you're even up

170
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:28,879
passing on you know pathogens of

171
00:09:25,309 --> 00:09:31,849
chemicals and and long-term systemic

172
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:33,679
things but what I wanted to get to is

173
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,329
not only are we noticing that deep rich

174
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,819
soils are good for the cannabis plant

175
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:40,789
but because of these pathogens in our

176
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:44,360
environment being so pressing and so

177
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:49,759
toxic we're also noticing that the plant

178
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:52,190
does best in a multi you know faceted

179
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:55,069
garden beds with many different

180
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:58,760
varietals in there that are feeding

181
00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:01,579
Colin aiders and I'm wondering about now

182
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:04,069
the idea that it just only seems natural

183
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:06,799
to me and to a lot of other cannabis

184
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:09,699
farmers and growers about compounding

185
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:13,059
this medicine with other herbs and

186
00:10:09,698 --> 00:10:16,219
utilizing you know the grams spectrum of

187
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:17,528
herbs on this planet to help with

188
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,120
cannabis what do you think about

189
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:21,370
compounding

190
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,709
oh it's something I'm rich I I think

191
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:30,278
there's great promise it is something

192
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:33,818
that hasn't really been accepted very

193
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:36,610
well yet by the supplement industry but

194
00:10:33,818 --> 00:10:39,909
that could change I mean they have to be

195
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:42,938
considering the competitive advantage

196
00:10:39,909 --> 00:10:44,289
they would have I'm actually surprised

197
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:47,438
that some of the bigger companies

198
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:51,399
haven't come out with cannabidiol lines

199
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:53,198
at this point I've explored this with

200
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:57,039
some of the companies and said basically

201
00:10:53,198 --> 00:11:00,188
if you're interested in doing this I'd

202
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:04,409
love to be involved but nobody's taking

203
00:11:00,188 --> 00:11:07,480
the bait so far I think it'll be coming

204
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:10,360
trouble is again government's sorting

205
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:15,009
out the regulations on this kind of

206
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:17,680
thing and it is a morass scientifically

207
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:20,970
it shouldn't be difficult legislatively

208
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,969
it's extremely difficult
