2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:14,700
this is us to do with the CDT FA and the

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:19,439
tax excise tax regulations and this is

4
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:21,839
very nuanced so in a non arms-length

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:27,329
transaction you tax on the wholesale

6
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:29,250
price and there is not a clear

7
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,849
differentiation although in their new

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,488
round of proposed regulations they are

9
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:38,550
suggesting an option for this but I

10
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:39,929
believe that when there is a calculation

11
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:41,519
of the average wholesale price of

12
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:44,238
cannabis which is what it says in the

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,460
law it should just be the cannabis but

14
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:49,649
there are a lot of the calculations are

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,090
being made based on the product which

16
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,808
means the entire cost which means the

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,489
hardware the packaging all of it and I

18
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:59,399
believe that all of that needs to be

19
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:01,019
exempt and it needs to just there needs

20
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,899
to be two separate invoices and the

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,280
excise tax needs to just be paid on the

22
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,290
cannabis that's what it says in the law

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,560
and that's what should be reflected in

24
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,460
the regulations that's a biggie what

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,460
about the luxury tax

26
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:23,879
oh yeah Wow taxes yeah absolutely the

27
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:26,219
tax in the text they I mean they're the

28
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:29,969
layers and layers of your local your

29
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:31,978
sales your ex ice and the way that you

30
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:33,929
break it down is you're actually the ex

31
00:01:31,978 --> 00:01:37,259
ice is put in first so you're kept your

32
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,409
local taxes is being calculated with the

33
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:44,969
excise tax already incorporated into the

34
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,530
amount it's a tax on a tax yes the sales

35
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:48,989
because you're adding in the excise tax

36
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:54,060
first and then ever all the other taxes

37
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:56,519
is includes the excise tax yeah the

38
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:01,170
calculation but the reason that this

39
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:03,780
exclusion of the of the the parts of the

40
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:07,140
product that is not cannabis as legally

41
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,840
defined cannabis or cannabis products so

42
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,699
that and that means the oil or whatever

43
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,348
cannabis accessory is a very specific

44
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,739
definition which means packaging and

45
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:16,250
hard

46
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,689
and all of that that increases the value

47
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,430
significantly and we're already paying a

48
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:23,129
lot of money for this every this is very

49
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:26,580
expensive stuff but for vaporizers

50
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:29,129
specifically on the China the tariffs on

51
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:32,730
China there's actually I've received

52
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:34,259
emails and I've seen this I this is

53
00:02:32,729 --> 00:02:36,539
going to become a thing but because the

54
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:39,120
the taxes on bait pens is gonna go up

55
00:02:36,539 --> 00:02:42,060
because most of these vape pens come in

56
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,280
from China that means the price of the

57
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,530
products going to go up which means and

58
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,360
if they are including these vape pens

59
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,490
the hardware and the price of the

60
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,320
hardware including those tariffs into

61
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:56,280
the product price that's being

62
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,780
calculated for the excise tax that's

63
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,939
gonna be a big hit that's twenty five

64
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,590
percent and the hardware is one of the

65
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:04,409
most expensive parts I mean the cannabis

66
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,509
is expensive but so that is that is the

67
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,849
big reason why I say especially and

68
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:10,349
because packaging is expensive to making

69
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,329
sure things are child resistant and

70
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:14,699
following all the other regulations that

71
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:19,200
have to do with packaging it's expensive

72
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:21,209
so you remove those costs then your

73
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:26,459
taxes that you're calculating is a lot

74
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:29,040
lower absolutely so here's another

75
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:31,770
situation where the consumer has a

76
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,489
potential class action complaint against

77
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:37,530
the state for over taxing it against the

78
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:40,260
the mandates of the law against the

79
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,789
provisions of the law I'm sure an

80
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:51,599
argument probably could be made for that

81
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:54,389
I think it's pretty clear that yeah I

82
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,799
mean cannabis there's very clear

83
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:58,759
definitions for cannabis cannabis

84
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,770
products and cannabis accessories and

85
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:04,409
the seed ETF a to their credit are

86
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:08,570
giving an option for that for

87
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:10,590
distributors to market separately but on

88
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:13,650
invoices but I know that there's been a

89
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:18,810
lot of disagreement because the there's

90
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:22,310
concern of exposing you know certain

91
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:25,439
price agreements with vendors on

92
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,860
hardware I I'm not really sure what the

93
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,620
deal is I don't do

94
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,479
factoring or so I don't know but I do

95
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,769
know that at some point you are ordering

96
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:35,529
hardware and at some point you're

97
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:37,750
ordering weed and they are separate and

98
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:42,638
then you put it together so you know

99
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:44,468
what the cost is and the weight and the

100
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,439
transfer is all in Metrix so it should

101
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:50,019
be easy to calculate

102
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,400
but that's so that's something and I

103
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:53,258
just think because everything is so

104
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:55,829
expensive any possible way that we can

105
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:58,270
reduce the taxes and then that we're

106
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,589
moving is the cost to the consumer is

107
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:08,528
something that we need to be exploring

108
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:10,538
right now yeah well the the state

109
00:05:08,528 --> 00:05:15,370
doesn't even want to lower the excise

110
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:17,769
tax in general so far it sounds like

111
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:34,478
there's not a lot of enthusiasm for that

112
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:37,658
so yeah what's left of it yeah that's

113
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,908
the economic sweet spot mm-hmm yep yeah

114
00:05:37,658 --> 00:05:43,329
we got Berkeley to cut their taxes in

115
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:51,509
half and very early on which was great

116
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:51,508
and very helpful but not not working
