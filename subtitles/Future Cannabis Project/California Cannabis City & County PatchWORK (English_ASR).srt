00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,170
little summary the state has figured it

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,198
out sort of we just need the local

7
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,079
governments to do their jobs so I'll do

8
00:00:37,198 --> 00:00:41,429

and delivery services so we work with

17
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:04,500
California retailers across the state so

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,609
local government local regulation is

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,909

industry and also advocating for social

25
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:28,140
justice and equity in cannabis so our

28
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,549

and Ariana just give people a little

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:44,130
brief summary of what you do day to day

31
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:47,129
to do this patchwork on the local level

32
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:49,890
day to day I do licensing and compliance

33
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:52,548
for cannabis businesses all over the

34
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,319
state of California mostly working on

35
00:01:52,549 --> 00:01:58,409
local licenses and preparation for state

36
00:01:55,319 --> 00:02:00,718
licenses and then navigating through the

37
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:05,009
regulations as they change day-to-day

38
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,640
and week-to-week awesome Thank You

39
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,060
Ariana

40
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,459
next we have Jackie McGowan you've

41
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,939
probably heard her already giving some

42
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:16,409
of the Q&amp;A portions of the other panels

43
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:18,030
she is director of licensing and

44
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:20,669
business development at K Street

45
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,289
consulting and Jackie tell us a little

46
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:25,439
bit about how you do patch work

47
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:27,509
day-to-day so hi my name is Jackie

48
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,878
McGowan I work for K Street consulting

49
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:32,098
I'm a local licensing consultant but my

50
00:02:29,878 --> 00:02:33,000
background is I am a former Wall Street

51
00:02:32,098 --> 00:02:35,669
stockbroker

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,069
and when I got into this space I

53
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:41,579
realized that there wasn't a centralized

54
00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:44,099
location for anyone to go to to get

55
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,160
late-breaking news of everything that

56
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:49,919
was going on throughout the state so I

57
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:53,359
decided to use my Wall Street background

58
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:55,919
and create my own news feed and I set up

59
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,140
540 Google email alerts one for every

60
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,789
city in the county run for every city

61
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,369
and county in the state and then I

62
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:04,639
decided to dump all of that data into a

63
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,840
Facebook group that I first named

64
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:10,049
California City &amp; County band watch

65
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:15,030
because at the time this was early 2016

66
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:16,050
when we dubbed banna Palooza as what was

67
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,959
going on in the industry at the time

68
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:22,400
I've since changed the name to city and

69
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,709
county regulation Watch and we have

70
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,239
7,000 members that are all California

71
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:28,020
residents that was really important to

72
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,629
me

73
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,760
to make sure that the conversation being

74
00:03:30,629 --> 00:03:35,459
had was about people that were being

75
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:37,229
affected by these problems so that we

76
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:40,560
could come up solutions together its

77
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:43,709
California residents and we have about

78
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,219

frequently being updated with

80
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:53,849
late-breaking news and we have probably

81
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:56,970
about 1300 in individual posts that come

82
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:58,919
through the group each month and our

83
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:00,780
moderators are making sure that

84
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,429

89
00:04:13,289 --> 00:04:21,120

00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:01,680
Sunset Strip for about a hundred years

104
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,240
100 cannabis has been part of the Sunset

105
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,970
Strip and the nightlife in the City of

108
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:11,459
introducing the first ordinance to

109
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:15,149
actually get into the regulation of

110
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:17,039
cannabis in our city my mayorship as a

111
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:19,319
local elected official like most local

112
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,240
electeds it's a part-time gig so I have

113
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,129
a real job in the day I'm a criminal

114
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,460
defense lawyer that's what I do in the

115
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:28,439
daytime and my practice I've been in

116
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,439
practice for 30 years has been

117
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:33,180
representing a whole lot of lawbreakers

118
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,620
first act up in queer nation when they

119
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,870
were blocking government buildings to

120
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,420
demand drugs and treatment for HIV and

121
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,949
AIDS then I was the attorney for clean

122
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,140
needles now which was the very first

123
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:46,829
needle exchange in Southern California

124
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,149
giving clean needles to junkies who we

125
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:50,579
were afraid we're going to contract HIV

126
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:52,109
passing around dirty needles and then I

127
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:54,629
became legal counsel for the Los Angeles

128
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:58,350
cannabis resource center in the early

129
00:05:54,629 --> 00:06:01,620
90s it was the very first medicinal

130
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:03,629
marijuana organized facility on the

131
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,519

00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:48,168
and as previous panelists have have

169
00:07:45,348 --> 00:07:49,968
talked about generally speaking there

170
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:51,588
isn't anything that necessarily comes

171
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:53,120
easy on this issue it's a very hot

172
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:56,019
button issue people get very very

173
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,689
passionate I understand that and so

174
00:07:56,019 --> 00:08:01,359
again I am excited to be here today and

175
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:03,500
looking forward to a robust discussion

176
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,830
just before we get into the more

177
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:09,110
specific questions this is about local

178
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:13,008
government this is about you know city

179
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:14,870
to city what what is local government

180
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:17,240
what does that mean to you what who

181
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,709
really holds the power in local

182
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,348
government so if you can talk a little

183
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:23,168
bit about who actually has the control

184
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:25,338
and where it comes from those might be

185
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:26,688
two different answers to the audience

186
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:29,838
and maybe one you have in your head feel

187
00:08:26,689 --> 00:08:32,060
free to share both but anyone can go

188
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:37,099
first I think it depends on the

189
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:40,268
jurisdiction yeah I've been on the

190
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:42,829
ground in several different areas where

191
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:45,139
the sheriff you know is the one making

192
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:47,659
the decisions and calling it his County

193
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:49,179
I've been in the opposite situation

194
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:51,899
where the sheriff has

195
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:55,389
I answer to the Board of Supervisors

196
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:57,159
I've been in situations where it's clear

197
00:08:55,389 --> 00:09:01,449
that it's the city manager that is

198
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:03,779
pulling the strings and and then you

199
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:07,030
know really you follow the money

200
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:09,100
whoever is supporting the people that

201
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:10,779
are making the decisions that's really

202
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,220
who's pulling the strings in my opinion

203
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:18,459
I want to agree with that that's exactly

204
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,460
that's exactly right I was a proponent

205
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:23,889
of forming a West Hollywood Police

206
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:30,190
Department's on the ballot in 1991 we

207
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:32,830
lost but we lost 51% to 49% so we just

208
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:34,930
lost and when that happened the Los

209
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:36,629
Angeles County Sheriff called me in and

210
00:09:34,929 --> 00:09:40,239
said what do we need to do to improve

211
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:41,980
it's a 14 million dollar contract and so

212
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,919
we gave him a list and one of the things

213
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:47,080
on the list was that the City of West

214
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:49,120
Hollywood in 2003 declared marijuana

215
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,879
enforcement to be the lowest level

216
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,039
priority for the city of West Hollywood

217
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:56,019
and the sheriff said well you know I'm

218
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:57,909
going to publicly oppose you I said care

219
00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:00,039
what you do publicly I just don't want

220
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:01,209
you arresting people for smoking a joint

221
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:03,909
on the Sunset Strip

222
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:05,680
so can we work together here you say

223
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:08,289
whatever you need to say for your

224
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,659
election but we're not gonna we don't

225
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:12,039
want any of the 14 million going into

226
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:13,809
marijuana enforcement you want to

227
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:16,449
enforce drug law let's go after crystal

228
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:18,369
meth that is a nasty drug that destroys

229
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,200
people in their lives but leave

230
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,060
marijuana alone and that's been the

231
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,640
state of affairs since then but I I

232
00:10:22,059 --> 00:10:27,369
agree the city manager he is the CEO of

233
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,009
our city most small cities have a city

234
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,629
manager who runs a government but it's

235
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:33,429
the power of three it's like you know

236
00:10:31,629 --> 00:10:36,039
the three sisters on the TV show charm

237
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:38,049
you got the power of three you can do

238
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:39,269
anything and so I'm always trying to

239
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:42,399
find two other votes

240
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:45,639
to make significant policy change and

241
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,529
fortunately I'm in a city that leans so

242
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:50,949
far left where you don't even know right

243
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:52,689
so I'm the conservative on the council

244
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:55,870
and I'm the guy doing cannabis reform

245
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:57,760
that's how far left we go so it's it's

246
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,320
an exception to the rule it's a little

247
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,789
like solid blue dot

248
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,389
in the middle of Los Angeles County but

249
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:06,099
we get because we are so solidly left we

250
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:08,680
get to do a lot of progressive stuff and

251
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:16,870
so that's why we we passed our ordinance

252
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:19,088
last year removed a wee ho no I I'm

253
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:22,179
going to disagree just slightly with

254
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:25,509
both of you because I think local

255
00:11:22,179 --> 00:11:28,599
government is is one of the rare

256
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:31,329
opportunities where it is about every

257
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,389
citizen and there's much more of an

258
00:11:31,328 --> 00:11:36,698
opportunity to have your voice heard at

259
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:39,250
the local government level then there

260
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:42,370
might be at state government and often

261
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,769
it really only takes a few voices to go

262
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:47,860
and talk to your City Council members

263
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:49,568
talk to your city managers talk to talk

264
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:52,360
to the folks the police department and

265
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:52,919
resolve the issues as before they get

266
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,579
started

267
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:59,078
ideally but that is the unique part of

268
00:11:57,578 --> 00:12:03,250
local government that I think is

269
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:05,458
extremely important for for everybody in

270
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,458
this industry

271
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:15,278
she stole my answer it's a cop out it

272
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:16,660
can't do that one so it's interests I

273
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:20,769
mean it's interesting you mentioned

274
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:22,088
obviously the citizens a lot of a lot of

275
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:25,110
California right now like we heard on

276
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:27,790
the other panels have bands everywhere

277
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,610
80 to 90 percent of California has a ban

278
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:33,068
on cannabis so given sort of the

279
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,769
differences in who holds the powers at

280
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:37,919
the sheriff is that the the city you

281
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:40,539
know is that the mayor is the people

282
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:43,688
what is the biggest hurdle and finding

283
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:46,149
out how to infiltrate these cities and

284
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:48,568
these localities that have bands and get

285
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:51,698
to the people who hold power when it

286
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:53,919
differs from city to city how do we

287
00:12:51,698 --> 00:12:55,778
effectively in your own jurisdiction

288
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,429
know oh I am the one that holds the

289
00:12:55,778 --> 00:13:01,120
power or no I got a go to my share

290
00:12:57,429 --> 00:13:04,269
because he or she holds the power first

291
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,970
starters and I'm curious to to kind of

292
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:09,009
get the actual statistics on on what

293
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,499
you're reporting as far as the number of

294
00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:12,239
jurisdictions that have

295
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:14,219
that have ordinances prohibiting you

296
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:16,499
know prohibiting any form of cannabis

297
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:19,469
maybe maybe canna regs over there can

298
00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:21,479
help out with that I don't know but you

299
00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:23,729
know I think part of it starts with with

300
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:26,579
education I mean it's been mentioned

301
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:28,619
before but at least with respect to

302
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:32,399
cities I can't speak for four counties

303
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:34,528
necessarily but but with cities you know

304
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,828
there are there are a lot of

305
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:39,509
opportunities as mentioned with respect

306
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:44,128
to going to council meetings and whatnot

307
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:46,408
to try and just directly engage an

308
00:13:44,129 --> 00:13:50,788
office a City Councilmember office or

309
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:53,448
whomever as far as you know why why you

310
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:56,489
may think that or why you know that

311
00:13:53,448 --> 00:13:59,068
cannabis is good for for for someone's

312
00:13:56,489 --> 00:14:01,649
jurisdiction or or why you believe the

313
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:06,748
constituents of that jurisdiction you

314
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:08,668
know want cannabis where you know when

315
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:10,859
when a council member or some other

316
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:12,778
elected official you know might might

317
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:14,309
see otherwise or has or has already put

318
00:14:12,778 --> 00:14:18,448
you know some sort of prohibition in

319
00:14:14,308 --> 00:14:20,009
place so I think you know it starts with

320
00:14:18,448 --> 00:14:22,469
it starts with council meetings first

321
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:26,308
and foremost with respect to cities but

322
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:28,109
but beyond that I mean you know whether

323
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:32,428
whether it's a social media push whether

324
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:34,918
there is whether there are I mean I know

325
00:14:32,428 --> 00:14:37,558
we have a lot of opportunities at the

326
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:40,470
league too to have organizations come

327
00:14:37,558 --> 00:14:42,328
out and educate our members directly and

328
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:44,069
and interface with them directly in

329
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:46,138
terms of you know offering their

330
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:48,838
services and and and what is what what

331
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:51,298
it is that they believe you know should

332
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,619
take place at our internal board

333
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:53,848
meetings and whatnot we there are

334
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:56,609
different opportunities to do that but

335
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:58,649
by and large I think you know it needs

336
00:14:56,609 --> 00:15:01,829
to start with with the council meetings

337
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:04,979
and with the with the staff at the city

338
00:15:01,828 --> 00:15:07,528
level as far as trying to you know

339
00:15:04,979 --> 00:15:10,499
trying to just get get the word out or

340
00:15:07,528 --> 00:15:13,918
make your point known from where you

341
00:15:10,499 --> 00:15:16,558
stand and you know perhaps this

342
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:19,348
gentleman to my right can can give some

343
00:15:16,558 --> 00:15:21,568
more poignant examples but but I think

344
00:15:19,349 --> 00:15:23,170
that's where it starts it has to start

345
00:15:21,568 --> 00:15:26,139
with communication and you want to

346
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:28,389
try to work with cities it's a lot

347
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:31,690
easier to work with us then then too

348
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:35,409
then to fight us I'm learning that every

349
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:36,850
day that I work at the league so I could

350
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:41,939
just add to that I'd say first of all

351
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:47,199
abandon logic right because logic

352
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:49,570
doesn't work but push common sense and

353
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:52,149
there's a distinction between logic and

354
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:54,160
common sense there are 32 states in the

355
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:57,399
United States now that have some form of

356
00:15:54,159 --> 00:16:00,100
regulation of marijuana the polling on

357
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:04,720
medicinal marijuana nationwide is over

358
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:08,350
90% it's over 90% like that debate is

359
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,089
over and I think for a lot of electeds

360
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:13,750
who are worried about their next

361
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:15,610
election usually if going in on the

362
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,860
discussion on medicinal there's not a

363
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,379
person on a council who doesn't have a

364
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:24,009
relative or somebody who has suffered

365
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:26,259
from some form of cancer or some form of

366
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:28,179
epilepsy or HIV or all these other

367
00:16:26,259 --> 00:16:30,909
debilitating illnesses that the

368
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:33,429
medicines in it works it works there's

369
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:35,169
no more debate around that and and

370
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:37,479
getting in there to find out what the

371
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:39,009
real objections are well the real

372
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,670
objections are driving under the

373
00:16:39,009 --> 00:16:42,250
influence

374
00:16:39,669 --> 00:16:44,019
great don't let people smoke and drive

375
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:47,019
just like you don't let people drink and

376
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:49,028
drive let's use some common sense and

377
00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:50,980
it's said in politics that rather than a

378
00:16:49,028 --> 00:16:53,019
spectrum of left to right it's actually

379
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:56,430
a circle and and the left and the right

380
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:59,948
on this issue I think meet on the policy

381
00:16:56,429 --> 00:17:03,759
perception of libertarianism California

382
00:16:59,948 --> 00:17:04,688
has a very strong libertarian bet stay

383
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,910
out of my life

384
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:09,429
leave me alone people on the left or the

385
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:10,750
right seek privacy don't want anyone

386
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:13,030
else intruding to my private

387
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:15,519
decision-making that's a really strong

388
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:17,259
political argument for both the left and

389
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,838
the right and I think that there's a

390
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:22,720
common-sense way to get to a lot of

391
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:24,308
these issues from either perspective and

392
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,078
it's just I think takes one heroic

393
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:28,058
council member I have friends on the

394
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:30,730
Santa Ana Council there they're kind of

395
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:32,470
going through it right now and there are

396
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,669
there are suburban communities it's just

397
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,380
not going to you know it's just not

398
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:36,090
going to happen

399
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,170
gonna get there but that's okay the more

400
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,759
business that comes to West Hollywood

401
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,410
I'm fine with it you know

402
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:41,879
and at some point they're gonna wake up

403
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,960
and they're gonna say what's happening

404
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,820
what's time but they got a hundred

405
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,440
million dollar reserve yeah well no

406
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:51,629
kidding because we're doing common-sense

407
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,190
policy over here and if you get off your

408
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,770
point of view and get to common sense

409
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:58,980
you'd see that this is really not what

410
00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:00,569
you fear it to be I just want to say

411
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,789
that the eighty to ninety percent

412
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:06,509
statistic that was dropped earlier by

413
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:08,970
Max was a statistic from 2016 and that

414
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:12,059
was after the League of Cities was on a

415
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:15,210
road show encouraging local

416
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:17,009
jurisdictions to ban since they felt

417
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:21,779
like there was a gun under their head at

418
00:18:17,009 --> 00:18:23,819
their head mandating them to regulate by

419
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:25,859
March first it was an erroneous deadline

420
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:28,220
and a bill was then introduced to

421
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:30,809
rectify that but we are at right now

422
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,700
about thirty five percent of the state

423
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:36,419
that either has regulations on the books

424
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:38,460
or is moving towards creating sensible

425
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,259
regulations and I will just give an

426
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:43,440
example of like how long this process

427
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:48,960
takes I've been in Yolo County for three

428
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:50,130
years and I and day one of me being on

429
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,840
the ground and attending a Board of

430
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,640
Supervisors meeting I went right up to

431
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:57,209
the opposition which was a group of

432
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:01,590
mothers who right away I could tell that

433
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:03,360
they didn't really care about marijuana

434
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:06,119
in general they did believe that it was

435
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:08,369
medicine but there was guys with guns

436
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:10,219
and dogs and they were living next door

437
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:13,529
to them and they couldn't have their

438
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,990
Girl Scout meetings and I it was you

439
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:19,230
know solved this problem for me and I

440
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:21,120
will go away so I did something that I

441
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,980
wouldn't recommend anyone else do and I

442
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,509
went knocked on that growers door and

443
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,039
told him that the laws were about to

444
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:29,309
change we were passing an ordinance and

445
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:31,529
he was going to have to move that is not

446
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:35,669
I did suffer some consequences for that

447
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:37,559
so I would and I did I did have a friend

448
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:39,779
that was beat with a baseball bat in rep

449
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:42,539
and that was retaliation for that action

450
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:45,029
so I don't recommend that anybody does

451
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,970
that however I never had those mothers

452
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:49,059
come back to another

453
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:51,700
meeting we have moved forward in that

454
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:55,569
jurisdiction we are awaiting the results

455
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,830
of an e ir and we spent as a community

456
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,450
the cannabis community spend about

457
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:02,710
seventy-five thousand dollars on various

458
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:06,250
tax measure and supporting local elected

459
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:08,470
officials that were pro cannabis and we

460
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:12,009
still don't have an ordinance we are

461
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:14,680
awaiting the IR hopefully in early 2019

462
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:16,240
we will have a permanent ordinance in

463
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:21,160
place but that's been three long years

464
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,779
of a lot of work and I always this that

465
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,390
and the strategy does not always work

466
00:20:22,779 --> 00:20:27,639
but I always make a beeline up to the

467
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:29,200
opposition immediately I want to have a

468
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,030
conversation I want to know what their

469
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,730
concerns are I want to know if I can fix

470
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:36,480
them and if they're actually reasonable

471
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:39,640
you know if there is a reasonable

472
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,450
solution to their concerns or if they

473
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:45,640
are you know a Evangelist so and you

474
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,769
know this is something that is a

475
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,390
religious thing then that that's a whole

476
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:51,039
nother thing I actually really want to

477
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,750
see a religious debate on this issue but

478
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,009
it's a whole nother topic I want to see

479
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,750
Bibles come out and I want them to

480
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:57,069
decide once and for all is Jesus Pro

481
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,990
cannabis or not I really want to see

482
00:20:57,069 --> 00:21:01,559
that because there are jurisdictions

483
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:04,990
that that's what the issue is you know

484
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:07,690
but I really I haven't always been

485
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:10,990
successful in that strategy but more

486
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:14,350
often than not I have been able to

487
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:17,650
address concerns and seem like the

488
00:21:14,349 --> 00:21:19,480
reasonable one while you know addressing

489
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:21,160
them with the council members or the

490
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:25,299
supervisors whatever the jurisdiction is

491
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,550
that I'm in I think Jackie make a great

492
00:21:25,299 --> 00:21:29,139
great point about that going to the

493
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:30,549
opposition and finding out what the

494
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,759
opposition looks like and what their

495
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:35,710
real concerns are because often the the

496
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,779
initial concern presented is Public

497
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:39,910
Safety well that can mean a hundred

498
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:42,069
different things and and addressing that

499
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:45,840
and being willing to listen to what

500
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:49,569
those concerns are is a helpful way to

501
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:52,929
get regulations to progress in addition

502
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:54,450
to that I think that going into a

503
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:57,240
jurisdiction that

504
00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:02,100
a ban on commercial cannabis activity

505
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:05,460
the it's often a negative or neutral so

506
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:09,569
looking at a group of advocates who want

507
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,430
to who want to create a regulated

508
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:14,759
cannabis market in a particular city or

509
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:17,310
county and then on the flipside is a

510
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:22,799
negative of concerns about public safety

511
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:24,839
or or the children and there isn't

512
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:28,049
necessarily there aren't necessarily

513
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:30,269
points made on the other side so going

514
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:32,159
in and saying not just it's a neutral

515
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:36,059
that are negative because that makes it

516
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:39,420
very easy to vote down a regulation but

517
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:41,039
on the flipside looking at this is this

518
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,289
is how much money is going to be brought

519
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:45,539
into this city or county this is what

520
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:47,399
regulation is going to do earlier

521
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:50,129
someone said you cannot be in cannabis

522
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,530
you can only be in legal cannabis that

523
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,360
is that is accurate but saying look

524
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:59,970
we're going to turn this public safety

525
00:22:54,359 --> 00:23:02,250
risk into a into a positive and also

526
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,799
we're going to create jobs in this

527
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:07,500
community and we're going to create jobs

528
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,529
that require degrees and we're oh by the

529
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:12,960
way we as this particular group are

530
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:16,289
going to put money into early childhood

531
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,240
education or building a public pool or

532
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:20,879
whatever that particular community is

533
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,279
interested in but in order to do that

534
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,660
you have to go into that community and

535
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,200
find out what their what their

536
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:31,110
particular needs are and listen to what

537
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,150
those negatives are so that you end up

538
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:35,789
tipping the scales and all of the sudden

539
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:38,160
it's looking at all of this positive and

540
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:40,409
how can the City Council or Board of

541
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,090
Supervisors vote that down because of

542
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:45,300
all those positives and the negatives

543
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:47,579
have been addressed both Arianna and and

544
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:49,529
mayor Durham mentioned something they

545
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:52,109
brought up really great points as far as

546
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:54,269
as far as common sense solutions right

547
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:56,069
so with respect to cities and and

548
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:59,549
perhaps all of you know this already but

549
00:23:56,069 --> 00:24:01,500
you know cities are scrambling for for

550
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:03,548
revenue okay and so when you talk about

551
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,259
you know solutions that

552
00:24:03,548 --> 00:24:06,609
gonna bring revenue bring tax revenues

553
00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:08,788
to cities I mean they're looking at the

554
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:12,158
past and they're singing like you know

555
00:24:08,788 --> 00:24:16,658
redevelopment gone Enterprise Zones off

556
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:19,360
the table so cannabis is you know it it

557
00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:23,409
certainly provides an opportunity to to

558
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:26,319
help build city coffers if done in a

559
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:28,149
smart way and so I think you know if

560
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,579
there's if there's a way to communicate

561
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:34,268
that message and and and kind of lay out

562
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:36,249
the how there are going to be a lot of

563
00:24:34,269 --> 00:24:38,138
jurisdictions a lot of jurisdictions who

564
00:24:36,249 --> 00:24:40,389
are already you know seeing their

565
00:24:38,138 --> 00:24:42,579
neighboring jurisdictions you know reap

566
00:24:40,388 --> 00:24:45,069
benefits you know at this point in time

567
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:47,319
that are going to gonna want to come on

568
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:49,480
board themselves so just wanted to put

569
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,608
that and thank you jackie for being

570
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,308
panelist and fact-checker so we're not

571
00:24:51,608 --> 00:24:57,908
at 80 or 90 percent we're at 65 not

572
00:24:54,308 --> 00:25:02,108
great but let's get maybe a more apt

573
00:24:57,909 --> 00:25:04,570
example you know of sort of the neutral

574
00:25:02,108 --> 00:25:06,128
or negative and Charles you're kind of

575
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:08,980
pointing out like you know we need the

576
00:25:06,128 --> 00:25:12,638
pros we need why is this good why is it

577
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:15,099
revenue is it jobs so let's talk about a

578
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:17,858
you know something that happened very

579
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:22,028
recently with the League of Cities and

580
00:25:17,858 --> 00:25:25,148
there was you know obviously you

581
00:25:22,028 --> 00:25:28,388
represent 482 municipalities there is

582
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:31,178
this delivery regulation and the

583
00:25:28,388 --> 00:25:32,618
proposed regs where delivery can you can

584
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:34,028
deliver to any jurisdiction regardless

585
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:36,638
of whether it has a banner or not

586
00:25:34,028 --> 00:25:40,329
obviously very controversial what are

587
00:25:36,638 --> 00:25:42,788
some of the nose or the reasons why not

588
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:44,470
or the reasons that are neutral or

589
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:46,658
negative that the League of Cities is

590
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:49,239
expressing genuinely what you know

591
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:50,830
obviously we talk about common sense the

592
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:54,220
numbers are behind the cannabis movement

593
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:56,710
you know what is the League of Cities so

594
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:58,600
worried about with delivery in any

595
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,009
jurisdiction regardless of whether it's

596
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:02,709
banned or not the League of California

597
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:04,720
cities contrary to to what some may

598
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:07,509
think I mean so where we are neither pro

599
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,190
nor anti cannabis that's that's that's

600
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:11,259
that's never been the case I mean that's

601
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,570
not the case despite what some may think

602
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:16,179
about the organization with respect to

603
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:16,960
delivery and and what a lot of our

604
00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:20,080
cities

605
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,500
see as as the cons or the negatives a

606
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,918
lot of it does boil down to to public

607
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,240
safety

608
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:33,100
for starters as I understand it there

609
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,750
are bare with me I got you so with

610
00:26:33,099 --> 00:26:36,699
respect to with respect to public safety

611
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:38,589
and we talk about deliveries in

612
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,819
particular we're not going we're not

613
00:26:38,589 --> 00:26:42,038
talking about a retail establishment

614
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:45,970
that has various security measures in

615
00:26:42,038 --> 00:26:49,450
place to to you know basically account

616
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:51,788
for all of the cash on hand not just the

617
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,860
product but the cash and so when you lay

618
00:26:51,788 --> 00:26:58,750
out a scenario whereby you know you have

619
00:26:53,859 --> 00:27:02,609
a delivery vehicle going into whatever

620
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:05,890
neighborhood and you know there are

621
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:06,808
there's an opportunity or somebody for

622
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,250
whatever reason

623
00:27:06,808 --> 00:27:11,980
however peeps you know that there is

624
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:14,380
that delivery vehicle is you know

625
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:17,019
containing cannabis has cannabis I mean

626
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:20,140
you put our cities there are cities who

627
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:22,418
don't want to put there they don't want

628
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,740
to have to deal with the risk of you

629
00:27:22,419 --> 00:27:26,649
know putting their drivers that safe

630
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:31,000
drivers at risk delivery drivers they

631
00:27:26,648 --> 00:27:35,319
don't want to put the you know they

632
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,028
don't want to create situations whereby

633
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:39,339
there are robberies whereby there are

634
00:27:37,028 --> 00:27:40,599
you know any other crimes ancillary to

635
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:42,398
robberies where people can get hurt

636
00:27:40,599 --> 00:27:44,439
since this is still an all-cash business

637
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:46,298
as I understand it that is that is one

638
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,509
of the underlying concerns with respect

639
00:27:46,298 --> 00:27:52,720
to the other proposed reg that that's

640
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:53,740
still percolating dynamic delivery as as

641
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,100
its called

642
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:59,769
colloquially where delivery or delivery

643
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:03,129
driver can potentially carry up to ten

644
00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:06,700
thousand dollars in cash that also you

645
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:10,450
know pass or be adopted that's only

646
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:13,659
going to to exacerbate the concerns that

647
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:15,490
cities have beyond that cities are

648
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:17,710
concerned you know whether rational or

649
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:19,538
not they are concerned about you know

650
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:21,880
delivery drivers going to the doors and

651
00:28:19,538 --> 00:28:23,319
you have potentially let's say a

652
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:25,179
thirteen-year-old answers the door for

653
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:26,859
instance oh yeah this this cannabis is

654
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:28,840
for my grandmother you know I'll just

655
00:28:26,859 --> 00:28:30,219
take that now granted delivery drivers

656
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:33,418
aren't supposed to

657
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:35,710
you know hand that over necessarily but

658
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:37,900
who is going to enforce that when you've

659
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:41,319
got cash on the table necessarily and

660
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:44,100
and that's you know I hear that beyond

661
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:47,470
that I hear that there is a you know

662
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:50,589
there is I should say the strongest

663
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:52,659
argument yeah beyond that the strongest

664
00:28:50,589 --> 00:28:55,599
argument against cities and and their

665
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:57,429
concerns you know that that I've heard

666
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,109
throw out there thrown out there is that

667
00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:00,788
you know obviously there there is a

668
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:03,759
concern about patients we have patient

669
00:29:00,788 --> 00:29:05,859
patient access is key I will say that

670
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,950
there you know people with cancer

671
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:10,569
persons that have mobility issues

672
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:13,360
patients should certainly have access to

673
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:16,210
medicine that is a conversation that I

674
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:18,189
will you know say right now I will be

675
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:20,650
will I'm willing to engage anyone on and

676
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:22,360
willing to go back to you know to my

677
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:24,490
colleagues and say hey look you know we

678
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:26,019
really need to discuss this issue every

679
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:28,599
single proposal that we've seen on the

680
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:34,389
table this year as it relates to

681
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:37,658
delivery so it from our vantage point it

682
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:39,820
shows that that patient access is not at

683
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:43,630
the forefront of the delivery issue okay

684
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:45,599
now that you know the city's just

685
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:48,940
specifically are they worried about

686
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:51,548
license delivery operators doing illegal

687
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,590
activity so bright you know obviously

688
00:29:51,548 --> 00:29:55,480
they've put on all the work and money

689
00:29:53,589 --> 00:29:57,038
into getting a license are they worried

690
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,380
about those delivery operators are they

691
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,150
worried about operators who do not want

692
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,559
to do it legally I think they're just

693
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:04,059
concerned in general there are some

694
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,788
cities that are concerned just in

695
00:30:04,058 --> 00:30:09,279
general about how does that get enforced

696
00:30:06,788 --> 00:30:10,450
and you know how feasible it is is it to

697
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,730
enforce you've got law enforcement

698
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,590
telling community or telling our city

699
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:16,569
officials that you know we're not going

700
00:30:14,589 --> 00:30:17,889
to be able to enforce you know these

701
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:20,319
delivery provisions and if stuff goes

702
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:23,288
bad so goes bad in our you know

703
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:25,210
community from a licensed from a

704
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:27,190
licensed operator from another community

705
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:29,288
that falls on us ultimately to handle

706
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:31,659
and so there are some cities like West

707
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:33,879
Hollywood like Pasadena like others who

708
00:30:31,659 --> 00:30:36,010
are more than capable who feel more than

709
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,960
capable of handling delivery in their

710
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:40,029
communities and by all means we want

711
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,200
them to to be able to have that that

712
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:44,480
that option to to

713
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,730
for that to two operators do any of the

714
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,819
other panelists have any thoughts on

715
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:51,980
delivery and sort of this idea that it

716
00:30:49,819 --> 00:30:53,419
can't be regulated even though there's

717
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:55,789
regulation in place and lots of money

718
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:57,590
and licenses that delivery operators are

719
00:30:55,789 --> 00:31:01,399
going through to try to do it the right

720
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:03,049
way the league yeah well and Charles

721
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,890
please don't take any of my comments

722
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:08,480
personally I appreciate you actually

723
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:11,930
coming to the table today to have a

724
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,029
discussion and hopefully we can work

725
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:16,190
together and open the league's mind and

726
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:19,039
and change this adversarial relationship

727
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,750
that I do feel that we have I don't feel

728
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,509
that the league is is pro or anti

729
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:26,750
cannabis I think that they are Pro easy

730
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:29,019
route which is a ban and anti the hard

731
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:32,299
route which is education on regulation

732
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:34,250
and the delivery issue is sort of

733
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:38,000
bringing this adversarial relationship

734
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:41,329
to a peak when the stop the wandering

735
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,490
weed campaign began which was introduced

736
00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:46,460
by the UFCW you guys signed on in

737
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:49,640
support of it on Friday of last week

738
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:53,420
that campaign came down off of their

739
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:56,930
website and we don't know why but only

740
00:31:53,420 --> 00:32:00,740
after 86 of your members signed on in

741
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:02,840
support of the stop the want laundering

742
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:05,930
weed campaign the stop the wandering

743
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:07,579
weed campaign was a cartoon and we're

744
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:09,019
not allowed to use cartoons because we

745
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:12,710
would be marketing to children but yet

746
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:16,099
they used a cat a cartoon to to rail us

747
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:19,519
and showed us driving up to schools and

748
00:32:16,099 --> 00:32:22,549
and dispensing cannabis to children and

749
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,529
as if any licensed operator is going to

750
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:26,899
go through all of the local and state

751
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:29,869
legal hurdles to get licensed to then

752
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:32,509
then to children was offensive it was

753
00:32:29,869 --> 00:32:38,329
repulsive it made my stomach turn it

754
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:40,549
still makes my stomach turn and yet we

755
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:43,250
have to turn the corner and figure out

756
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:46,490
how we can you know come to the table

757
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:48,019
and figure out a compromise and I keep

758
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:50,079
hearing oh well we wouldn't have this

759
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:53,839
issue if it was just about medical

760
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:55,878
really um I I don't know I mean because

761
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:58,999
it always goes back to local

762
00:32:55,878 --> 00:33:01,598
control Oh what about local control does

763
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:04,548
do local governments have control over

764
00:33:01,598 --> 00:33:06,648
Norco is being delivered to a home do

765
00:33:04,548 --> 00:33:08,328
they have control over alcohol being

766
00:33:06,648 --> 00:33:09,678
delivered and making sure a child

767
00:33:08,328 --> 00:33:13,548
doesn't answer the door when that when

768
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:16,369
that package arrives seriously so why

769
00:33:13,548 --> 00:33:20,209
are they so about local control when it

770
00:33:16,368 --> 00:33:22,038
comes to cannabis and you know the more

771
00:33:20,209 --> 00:33:23,839
that we regulate this the less children

772
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:26,868
are going to get access to it and that

773
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:28,818
is a reality the but and then to

774
00:33:26,868 --> 00:33:32,269
conflate the two issues of dynamic

775
00:33:28,818 --> 00:33:35,479
delivery and 54:16 D there are two

776
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:38,959
separate issues yet we got smeared and

777
00:33:35,479 --> 00:33:41,389
and there isn't another campaign to

778
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:43,159
correct that right so let's say that

779
00:33:41,388 --> 00:33:45,948
maybe now the league regrets this

780
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:47,539
decision to support that campaign but

781
00:33:45,949 --> 00:33:49,729
they're not going out to those 86

782
00:33:47,538 --> 00:33:52,638
members and saying hey we screwed up you

783
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:55,159
know the damage is already done and it's

784
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:58,308
ya know it's it's seriously offensive

785
00:33:55,159 --> 00:34:01,369
and um I don't know how we're supposed

786
00:33:58,308 --> 00:34:03,918
to write and so my issue with the league

787
00:34:01,368 --> 00:34:06,738
has been you can say you're you're not

788
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:11,329
anti or pro all you want but you went

789
00:34:06,739 --> 00:34:13,250
out with like just a campaign with a gun

790
00:34:11,329 --> 00:34:16,669
to the heads of the cities back in late

791
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:19,358
2015 and early 2016 and no one has gone

792
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:21,798
out with that same energy to teach

793
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:26,538
jurisdictions how to regulate that's

794
00:34:21,798 --> 00:34:30,048
what we need go ahead Charles and we're

795
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:33,589
gonna do Q a very shortly so okay well

796
00:34:30,048 --> 00:34:37,190
let me just say that let me just say

797
00:34:33,588 --> 00:34:39,679
that with respect to to the last issue

798
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:41,480
you mentioned yeah we had that timeline

799
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,009
cities had that timeline local

800
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,909
governments had the timeline to put an

801
00:34:43,009 --> 00:34:49,668
ordinance on the books and so you know

802
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:51,619
before my time but you know I understand

803
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:53,949
that there may have been conversations

804
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:57,230
that if communities did not want

805
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:58,969
cannabis yes to put an ordinance in

806
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:00,440
place that prohibited cannabis in their

807
00:34:58,969 --> 00:35:04,879
communities the otherwise they would be

808
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:06,920
preempted and so as with anything local

809
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,010
governments or anyone doesn't like being

810
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:12,320
told what to do and so

811
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:14,900
with prop 64 as we know there's

812
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,260
divergent viewpoints on this but yes it

813
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:21,349
was a patchwork of in a sense whereby it

814
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:24,369
allowed for locals to have a retain

815
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:26,839
reasonable regulation Authority and so

816
00:35:24,369 --> 00:35:30,400
with respect to the wandering weed to

817
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:32,780
stop wandering weed I don't have a

818
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,220
strong answer for you I was out on

819
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,630
paternity leave when that happened I was

820
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:38,358
probably the last person to find out

821
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:41,630
about that I never actually saw the

822
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:42,980
cartoon that's it let the panelists talk

823
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:46,730
I got you in the Sun I never actually

824
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:49,849
saw the the cartoon but the the point

825
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:52,490
remains it just goes to show how how

826
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:53,929
much cities are concerned that they

827
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:58,039
would that however many of them would

828
00:35:53,929 --> 00:36:01,849
sign on to it and I don't think you can

829
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:03,079
separate out 54 16 D and dynamic

830
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:05,150
delivery because at the end of the day

831
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:08,299
if both are adopted and I suspect both

832
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:10,639
will be you know it is a public safety

833
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:12,170
issue that cities are going to have to

834
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,059
deal with local governments are going to

835
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,369
have to deal with it who feel in

836
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:19,369
ill-equipped to be able to handle

837
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:21,108
deliveries and so I mean that's where I

838
00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:22,910
think the education you know is

839
00:36:21,108 --> 00:36:24,710
necessary I'm not saying it's easy if it

840
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:27,289
was easy everyone would do it but that's

841
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:29,030
what needs to take place if in fact you

842
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:33,009
know we're gonna get to a place where we

843
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:35,450
can have our local officials you know

844
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:37,790
he'd whatever it is that their

845
00:36:35,449 --> 00:36:39,108
constituents supposedly are saying to

846
00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:41,420
them I mean this is an election year

847
00:36:39,108 --> 00:36:43,400
right so if you want to you know talk to

848
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:45,680
them you want them to listen to you

849
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,230
I mean constituents have the power to do

850
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:49,309
that I mean are you guys listening to

851
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:53,929
his constituents he's not gonna get

852
00:36:49,309 --> 00:36:55,909
voted out are you are you willing is the

853
00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:59,358
league willing to engage in a

854
00:36:55,909 --> 00:37:02,809
conversation about real education for

855
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:04,789
cities and counties and and sitting down

856
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:08,019
at the table with the cannabis industry

857
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:11,119
if it's if the league is not pro or anti

858
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:12,739
can we can we have that conversation I

859
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,100
don't I don't think it's too late we

860
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:18,799
still have 65% of jurisdictions to to

861
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:21,440
educate and to to get regulations

862
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,140
through and I think it's possible the

863
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:28,960
league can be an ally in that

864
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:31,239
than a hindrance I make no make no

865
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,769
commitment as to the result but I'm open

866
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:36,009
to having a conversation with anyone

867
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:38,860
about you know how the league can you

868
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:41,230
know help educate members or how the

869
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:42,640
league at the very least can facilitate

870
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:44,590
education between industry

871
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:50,349
representatives and local officials I'm

872
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:52,329
happy I have a solution real quick what

873
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:53,920
I would like to see the lead do I would

874
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:56,079
like to see the league start with every

875
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,900
jurisdiction every one of their members

876
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:01,719
that passed Proposition 64 beginning

877
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,980
with a survey on what yes meant in their

878
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:05,169
community okay

879
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:07,360
that is where we've gone wrong is we

880
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:08,920
don't know what yes meant in every

881
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,660
single jurisdiction does it mean that

882
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,400
they want home deliveries does it mean

883
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:14,139
they want retail locations does it mean

884
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,880
they want commercial cultivation

885
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:18,069
manufacturing distribution all of that

886
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,869
or did they just vote YES for social

887
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:22,059
justice purposes we need to figure that

888
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:26,099
out in every community and then you

889
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:29,619
regulate from there Thank You panelists

890
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:33,519
my question pertains to the sales tax on

891
00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:35,710
cannabis sales do you feel it was stated

892
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:38,230
earlier that a lot of the illicit shops

893
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:41,320
are not paying any taxes on their

894
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:44,590
cannabis sales do you feel with it being

895
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:47,080
a mainly cash industry that the licensed

896
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,850
shops are paying their true amount of

897
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:50,829
sales tax or do you feel that there may

898
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:53,980
be some false reporting and tax evasion

899
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:55,509
going on first of all in order to tax it

900
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:58,659
requires a vote of the people because of

901
00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:00,520
proposition 218 so in the City of West

902
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:04,599
Hollywood we will probably have on the

903
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:06,789
March 2019 ballot a proposal sponsored

904
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:09,400
by the council to ask the people to vote

905
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:11,800
you know in its acts so taxes city

906
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,880
governments can't just impose a tax you

907
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,360
actually have to go to a vote of the

908
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,430
people and obviously if the tax passes

909
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,930
overwhelmingly it kind of tells you

910
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:22,750
where the people are the people are

911
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:24,279
saying we want this tax it shows you

912
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:26,409
that they're strongly in support on

913
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,700
issues of tax evasion I think that any

914
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:29,259
time you're dealing with cash and we

915
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,879
have a lot of cash businesses in West

916
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:33,160
Hollywood we have a lot of bars and

917
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,140
nightclubs that they also deal heavily

918
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:36,670
in cash every night there's always the

919
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:39,039
opportunity for tax evasion

920
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,769
but they're smart they don't want to get

921
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:44,108
caught and wanted up like Jimmy Hoffa

922
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:45,789
sitting in a federal prison so you know

923
00:39:44,108 --> 00:39:48,429
I think we just have to trust that

924
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:52,019
people are going to comply ultimately I

925
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:54,519
can't speak specifically to what any

926
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:57,489
individual business is doing in terms of

927
00:39:54,519 --> 00:40:00,039
tax evasion I can tell you that our

928
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:02,739
clients that we're working with so hard

929
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:05,739
to get licensed and that that process

930
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:07,659
takes can take a year or two years or

931
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:11,679
three years if regulations aren't yet on

932
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:14,318
the books they are constantly asking

933
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:17,048
questions about how what taxes they owe

934
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:19,269
how the best way to pay their taxes is

935
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:20,500
my advice is always to go and talk to an

936
00:40:19,269 --> 00:40:23,849
accountant because I am NOT an

937
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:26,019
accountant but they are looking to be

938
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:27,940
responsible in paying their taxes

939
00:40:26,019 --> 00:40:29,889
because they work that hard to get their

940
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,358
license they don't want to then turn

941
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:33,639
around and lose it because they didn't

942
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:37,449
pay their taxes yeah I think a big issue

943
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:39,460
is how high the taxes are I mean they're

944
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:40,989
not the same taxes that you have for

945
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,760
other industries in the same city in San

946
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:45,250
Francisco they don't have a tax now but

947
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,720
they want to go 1 to 7 percent so you

948
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:49,679
know there obviously can be always the

949
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:53,469
evasion but you know the taxes are

950
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:56,469
breaking people my name is Dale Shaffer

951
00:40:53,469 --> 00:40:58,269
I'm working with Jackie and I want to at

952
00:40:56,469 --> 00:41:00,939
least start the the question is sort of

953
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:03,219
a dialogue inside of the League of

954
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:04,780
Cities do you have a discussion group

955
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:06,969
that understands that every nook and

956
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,950
cranny of the state is having deliveries

957
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:11,048
happen right now with large amount of

958
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:12,519
products and large amount of cash do you

959
00:41:11,048 --> 00:41:15,309
understand this industry is up and

960
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:19,150
running and we are trying to to work

961
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:21,309
with you and other power brokers to try

962
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:23,440
to bring this regulated that right now

963
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:24,880
you are the enemy and we don't want you

964
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,679
to be so we're trying to reach out to

965
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,150
you like Jackie did at a group you're

966
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:30,460
the person we've got to try to please

967
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:34,059
but you're the people holding keys that

968
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:37,170
are taking us out regularly and does

969
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:39,730
your organization want to work with us

970
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:42,280
first and foremost I don't think that

971
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:43,719
anyone is ignorant to to the fact that

972
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:46,569
there is an illicit market out there

973
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:47,839
right and you know all kinds of

974
00:41:46,568 --> 00:41:51,529
operators

975
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:55,730
are acting illegally and yes that is a

976
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:58,400
that is an issue that that that

977
00:41:55,730 --> 00:42:00,019
legalized operators you know and they're

978
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,889
gonna they're fighting they're trying to

979
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:06,289
contend with as far as the league goes

980
00:42:02,889 --> 00:42:09,319
you know I came into this panel

981
00:42:06,289 --> 00:42:14,929
expecting to be recognized as the bad

982
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:16,160
guy you know I want to find ways or you

983
00:42:14,929 --> 00:42:20,089
know at least yeah I want to find ways

984
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:22,219
to work with with industry I mean it

985
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:25,370
starts with it starts with conversations

986
00:42:22,219 --> 00:42:27,829
and and and civility there obviously

987
00:42:25,369 --> 00:42:29,569
there are there is a lot of again

988
00:42:27,829 --> 00:42:34,759
there's a lot of passion and there's a

989
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:37,700
lot of there's a lot of of I should say

990
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:40,520
hurt feelings based on whatever may have

991
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:46,099
transpired in the past both leading up

992
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:50,059
to and and since the passing of since

993
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:52,400
the passing of prop 64 and so I mean I'm

994
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:54,769
only speak for myself in terms of what

995
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,150
what I am willing to do I'm certainly

996
00:42:54,769 --> 00:42:57,860
willing to have a conversation with you

997
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:01,160
further conversations with Jackie and or

998
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:03,440
whomever else wants to to see what sort

999
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:05,449
of bridges can be built and and we can

1000
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,789
just hopefully go from there okay

1001
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:09,799
can I jump in on that question so I've

1002
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:11,989
been a member of the California League

1003
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,730
of Cities for 18 years and the National

1004
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:14,929
League of Cities and I just want to say

1005
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,579
this is not intended

1006
00:43:14,929 --> 00:43:18,919
I feel like Switzerland between the two

1007
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:20,719
Thank You panelists here but but what I

1008
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,400
what I will say is the California League

1009
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:24,980
of Cities exerts a great deal of

1010
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,500
influence in Sacramento on legislation

1011
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:29,780
they do not exert a great deal of

1012
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:33,500
influence on local government we are

1013
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:35,450
members of local government and what

1014
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,400
happens a lot of time is the people who

1015
00:43:35,449 --> 00:43:39,259
are really actively involved in the

1016
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:41,780
California League of Cities come from

1017
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:44,230
small conservative towns around the

1018
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:47,300
state and the big city council members

1019
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:50,030
don't participate yeah it's very rare

1020
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:52,070
for me to see a San Francisco supervisor

1021
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:54,380
or a Los Angeles City Council member at

1022
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:57,110
illega City's event they just don't

1023
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:58,700
participate so what Charles are saying

1024
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,970
is correct they are supposed to be

1025
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:03,358
neutral I

1026
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:04,679
I would suggest that you all this

1027
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:06,900
morning here tonight she's going to get

1028
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:09,029
my card I know come to the City of West

1029
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,700
Hollywood Santa Cruz Berkeley San

1030
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:13,950
Francisco San Diego Los Angeles

1031
00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:16,009
encourage us to ask the League of Cities

1032
00:44:13,949 --> 00:44:19,409
because we're all members to let us

1033
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:21,000
sponsor a panel on reasonable regulation

1034
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:26,848
at the annual conference of the League

1035
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:29,190
of Cities I'm gonna hold you to that

1036
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:31,260
mayor I'll organize it for you yeah

1037
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:33,240
there we go hi everyone my name is

1038
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:35,160
Joseph chicas I'm a director of

1039
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:38,429
government affairs for cannabis advising

1040
00:44:35,159 --> 00:44:40,799
partners my question was really relating

1041
00:44:38,429 --> 00:44:42,929
to equity and transparency in the

1042
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,789
decision-making for these applications

1043
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:47,339
because what we're finding is that as

1044
00:44:44,789 --> 00:44:50,190
time goes on more and more of these

1045
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,840
decisions regarding licensing across the

1046
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:54,480
board are becoming more and more

1047
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,730
political more and more personal

1048
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,679
interests and competing interests and

1049
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:00,539
conflicts of interest are going into

1050
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:03,210
those decisions so how do we work

1051
00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:05,009
together to improve equity and

1052
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:06,900
transparency and the decisions that are

1053
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:09,900
being made at the local government level

1054
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:14,280
so that the best applicants can really

1055
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:16,950
be the best or can have their foot in

1056
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:18,839
the door rather than the person with the

1057
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:21,179
most contacts or the most contributions

1058
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:23,549
toward a political campaign so when we

1059
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:25,679
looked at this very carefully because we

1060
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:28,380
did not like the first-come first-serve

1061
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:30,569
method and we didn't like the lottery as

1062
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:33,000
we you know didn't want either of those

1063
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:35,640
so we instead developed a merit-based

1064
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,380
system and I gotta say when we were

1065
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:40,289
first starting to discuss this all of a

1066
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:42,630
sudden every pet cause that I am part of

1067
00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:45,029
was suddenly seen a great influx of

1068
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:47,369
cannabis dollars going into all of my

1069
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:49,470
pet causes because that is the way that

1070
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:51,180
you know politics works so we were

1071
00:45:49,469 --> 00:45:53,519
cognizant from the beginning that there

1072
00:45:51,179 --> 00:45:56,819
was going to be an attempt to try to

1073
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:59,099
curry favor us from the electeds on our

1074
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:01,500
Council so we developed a merit-based

1075
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:03,510
system where the applications that we

1076
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,849
have 300 applications that have come in

1077
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:08,190
are being reviewed by a seven-member

1078
00:46:05,849 --> 00:46:10,380
committee none of whom have any interest

1079
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:12,599
or business interest in fact I only know

1080
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:15,269
one of the names because somebody after

1081
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:16,860
accidentally told me that this person

1082
00:46:15,269 --> 00:46:18,809
was on the committee but the five

1083
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:20,880
council members we have no idea who even

1084
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:23,039
the seven committee people are they're

1085
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,570
reviewing the applications they're going

1086
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:26,130
through it on various criteria I wrote

1087
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:27,720
them down innovative business model

1088
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:29,700
connection to West Hollywood business

1089
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:31,889
operations social equity product

1090
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:33,899
offerings design concept security plan

1091
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:35,789
and experience in the industry those are

1092
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,010
the criteria came up with a point system

1093
00:46:35,789 --> 00:46:39,750
and these seven women and men are going

1094
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:41,610
to go through all 300 applications and

1095
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:43,650
they're going to make recommendations to

1096
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:45,960
the business license commission who then

1097
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:46,740
gives them one of the what I call the

1098
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,929
golden tickets

1099
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:50,759
you know Willy Wonka reference one of

1100
00:46:48,929 --> 00:46:52,919
the golden tickets and then go out and

1101
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:56,010
find a location somewhere in the city

1102
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,750
and then only if all of that people are

1103
00:46:56,010 --> 00:47:00,300
unhappy they think something went awry

1104
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:02,159
is it appealable to the council so we

1105
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:05,190
have intentionally tried to keep

1106
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:06,210
ourselves away from the decision making

1107
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:08,309
to the greatest extent possible

1108
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:09,960
ultimately we have to have some concern

1109
00:47:08,309 --> 00:47:11,549
because it's where the electeds we have

1110
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:13,380
to you know we're responsible for

1111
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:15,360
everything but we really try to create a

1112
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:18,059
system where we're out of the evaluation

1113
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:19,920
to avoid the appearance that these

1114
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:22,079
golden tickets were for sale in any

1115
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,269
which way so that's a system we've come

1116
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,039
up with I think it's unique at this

1117
00:47:24,269 --> 00:47:28,250
point if we're still in the middle of

1118
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:30,659
the process and we expect that those

1119
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:33,090
licenses will be handed out at the end

1120
00:47:30,659 --> 00:47:35,460
of October or early November and then

1121
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:37,470
we'll be in the process so I I'm hoping

1122
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:39,059
that what we've come up here as a model

1123
00:47:37,469 --> 00:47:41,909
ordinance that other cities will

1124
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:44,039
replicate it as a way to make decision

1125
00:47:41,909 --> 00:47:46,529
based on merit rather than just

1126
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:48,710
happenstance or first-come first-serve

1127
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:51,150
and just a quick follow up mayor

1128
00:47:48,710 --> 00:47:53,369
specifically because the gentleman asked

1129
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:56,490
about social equity is there anything in

1130
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:59,250
place to be assured that these will be

1131
00:47:56,489 --> 00:48:01,049
sustainable models I'm assuming in the

1132
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:03,030
applications they'll have all the

1133
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:07,080
criteria set including social equity is

1134
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:08,580
there any report that will be given out

1135
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:10,829
quarterly or yearly is there anything

1136
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:13,500
holding these businesses accountable to

1137
00:48:10,829 --> 00:48:16,199
the the criteria that they applied with

1138
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,269
to make sure that they continue that in

1139
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:20,279
the future yes yes and it'll be like a

1140
00:48:18,269 --> 00:48:21,659
lot of the other adult businesses in my

1141
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,310
community I have a lot of adult

1142
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:24,929
businesses have a lot of bars and talk

1143
00:48:23,309 --> 00:48:25,699
book stores have a lot of businesses

1144
00:48:24,929 --> 00:48:28,009
that you know

1145
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:29,689
people consider not worthy of business I

1146
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:32,390
got them all I'm we're happy to have a

1147
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:35,869
bit story and the way that we regulate

1148
00:48:32,389 --> 00:48:37,819
that is using our code enforcement but

1149
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:39,650
there's a commission a business license

1150
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:41,600
Commission who has oversight we did not

1151
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,010
want to grant any permits that ran with

1152
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,809
the land meaning we didn't want to give

1153
00:48:43,010 --> 00:48:46,520
something that ran with the land but

1154
00:48:44,809 --> 00:48:48,349
rather goes with the operation and

1155
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:50,449
that's why it's a business license

1156
00:48:48,349 --> 00:48:53,869
rather than a permit there's a

1157
00:48:50,449 --> 00:48:55,189
distinction there's a distinction in

1158
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:58,210
terms of what it is that we're giving

1159
00:48:55,190 --> 00:49:01,550
and how quickly we can take it away

1160
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:03,079
thank you well that wraps it up this is

1161
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:04,780
an incredible panel thank you again

1162
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:08,150

1163
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:26,070
