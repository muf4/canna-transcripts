1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,669
[Music]

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:18,600
it's just flour and we're gonna be doing

3
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:26,448
some dry sieving yeah we have really

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:29,190
nice yeah I have some really nice well I

5
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:32,660
well I've been into hash for a long time

6
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:35,760
like all kinds of hash not not

7
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:39,269
solvent-based hash or rosin really but

8
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:43,439
like hash you know like resin either dry

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,450
sift or ice water not that's kind of

10
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,390
what I did before like so when I was

11
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,770
like you know like twenty years old and

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,869
when we were in music school when we

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,899
went were like in the classical music in

14
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:57,929
Europe was like we were all about you

15
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,480
know Europe and doing it how they'd work

16
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:03,420
and so we were I've been making hash

17
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,368
like that before I even knew about

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,010
Frenchie or anything like that where

19
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:11,219
you're like but I would I would put it

20
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,930
so he's not know but so this is what I

21
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:15,900
would do is I'd take my dry sift and I'd

22
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,118
put it in like like a little like a bag

23
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,490
like a plastic bag right and then I

24
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:22,379
would fold that bag up really tight

25
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,719
around the resin and then I'd wrap that

26
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:27,269
in a piece of paper and tape it up and I

27
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,670
get the paper soaking wet and I'd put

28
00:01:27,269 --> 00:01:32,188
that in the oven so that didn't burn

29
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,560
right and I put it in there for like a

30
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:36,809
little bit on really low and then I

31
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,219
would roll it with the rolling pin I put

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,390
in the freezer and I take it out and I

33
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:44,328
do it a couple of times and the thing

34
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:46,950
it's pretty much the same thing you know

35
00:01:44,328 --> 00:01:49,618
it would be like whatever I could get

36
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:51,600
from my grinder or what you know what I

37
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:54,090
mean like that's kind of how it started

38
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:58,559
and I didn't grow splits and

39
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:00,539
that's what I like so you know like hash

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,210
I've always just been into hash and then

41
00:02:00,539 --> 00:02:07,129
once we got in the farming we were like

42
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:10,169
got more in there like a good hash and

43
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:11,909
doing a lot of ice water but then you

44
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:23,369
can't do that with the current

45
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:25,739
regulations as a farm you know so I mean

46
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,920
I just love hash but I want to like you

47
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:31,519
know like I want to make good hash and I

48
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:36,059
want to share that with people but I

49
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:40,259
also you know I don't know if I want to

50
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,519
get another license to do that I don't

51
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:42,359
think it's worth it to do that for just

52
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,420
my farm

53
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:50,129
you know but the dry see if I can create

54
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:52,139
like I can basically make a similar it's

55
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:58,108
an equally pure product you know like

56
00:02:52,139 --> 00:03:05,268
we're isolating to 99.99% pure resin

57
00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:05,269
glands and so it's very beautiful

58
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,849
some will be better for dry sip for sure

59
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,700
but the the cool thing is with the

60
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:26,949
cleaning of the dry sip we're able to

61
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:28,539
use we're able to work with a lot of

62
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:32,949
strains that we couldn't necessarily

63
00:03:28,539 --> 00:03:35,819
work with in ice water because well so

64
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:38,069
in ice water if you have a very very

65
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:40,900
greasy

66
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:43,060
melty strain with a thin wax membrane

67
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,060
you have to be very careful to not

68
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,250
damage those resin glands like in the

69
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:51,430
washing because if you do they're gonna

70
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:53,259
break and they're just gonna stick to

71
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:57,159
your material and they're not even going

72
00:03:53,259 --> 00:03:59,409
to end up in your yields and so a lot of

73
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:01,900
hash makers are like like really sand

74
00:03:59,409 --> 00:04:03,699
sandy or strains because they break off

75
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,020
and they go through the bags easier and

76
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:11,799
stuff like that so we're able to

77
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:16,410
actually dry you know these oily or

78
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,410
resin heads and still make a full melt

79
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:28,959
it's kind of a secret proprietary thing

80
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:31,060
yeah I mean I will share it i I don't

81
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,709
know if it's like yeah I might as well

82
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,399
share it with you do we're gonna do it

83
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:38,310
like we gonna have the edge for so long

84
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:42,399
[Laughter]

85
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:46,519
Carla says I don't know I'll share it

86
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:51,179
with you someday once we get it out

87
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:52,889
yeah I understand I mean that's what

88
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,629
it's like a homes an interesting thing

89
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:57,149
all by itself just as far as I'm

90
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:58,560
concerned this idea of like I want to

91
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:00,899
share these certain things but there's

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,040
all these times and places that make

93
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:06,719
sense and like for me I like the idea of

94
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,430
time stamping because people watch this

95
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,500
video and be like I remember that dude

96
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,480
was the one who I learned this from and

97
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,819
I watched that video which was published

98
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:20,069
on this totally and few other people

99
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:22,560
can't be like yeah I mean you can find

100
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:25,290
the info on the internet for sure make

101
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,079
sense for you guys but like I understand

102
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,460
information sure I mean it's hard to to

103
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:34,969
say you know anything because it's like

104
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:34,969
well we could have you know an edge or

105
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:42,500
any was really trying to focus on

106
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,500
quality and

107
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:50,290
I'm picking at the right time and if

108
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:53,990
you're interested in actually producing

109
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:56,560
something with here biomass or with like

110
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:59,680
your seconds or like other than you know

111
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,509
smokeable flower and if you're into into

112
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,060
concentrates and hash is a beautiful

113
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:07,899
thing and dry sip is amazing because

114
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:12,769
you're not even having to use the water

115
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:15,079
you're really using water in front of

116
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:18,319
farming possible you get into like the

117
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:20,209
Department of Public Health and so it's

118
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,699
a different kind of inspection level on

119
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:26,299
your farm that you know depending on the

120
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:28,639
size of your farm may or may not be you

121
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,579
know worth it so dry stuff is a great

122
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:37,009
way to go and essentially you know we're

123
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:42,439
using a tumbler and we're we're doing a

124
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:45,279
cleaning on that and when you do iced

125
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,279
water are you

126
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:53,419
I'm like a paddle guy and I've also done

127
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:57,850
some interesting experiments with for

128
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,850
making vortexes through various means

129
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:14,810
different things you know like I'm I'm

130
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:17,329
definitely so we have like a it's like a

131
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:20,660
stainless steel cone bottom brewing tank

132
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:24,469
and really depending on what I'm doing

133
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,150
I will yeah like a like exactly like a

134
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,370
brewing tank with it and then I'll have

135
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:31,879
like the little thing and it has like a

136
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:38,209
nice wide valve so it comes out really

137
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:39,860
easily and yeah and yeah and then you

138
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:41,839
know there's a we'll put like a grade

139
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:44,930
inside so it doesn't all drop into the

140
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:47,959
cone and then my kind of like a standard

141
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:51,519
hash machine's friend she's doing but

142
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,519
then we gonna do a hand store in that

143
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:08,430
like that's kind of unique um I don't

144
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,000
know there's a few of them there's one I

145
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:14,280
know there's a company that sells like

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,009
like I was doing this and then I saw a

147
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:19,799
company selling these things exact it

148
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:23,629
was like the exact same tank with like

149
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:26,400
their logo on it with like you know

150
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:27,659
little hash thing but they were doing

151
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:32,699
something for they were like shooting

152
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:36,089
co2 in it went into one of the valves to

153
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:39,839
keep it like super cold you know so that

154
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:44,310
you could do a minimal agitation and and

155
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:49,200
not have to very gently melt off your

156
00:08:44,309 --> 00:08:55,319
fresh frozen but I'm not I they don't

157
00:08:49,200 --> 00:09:02,730
have any ice but we've dug our own ice

158
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:04,528
usually yeah and and so now I mostly am

159
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,778
making fresh frozen like for myself

160
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:09,958
because I enjoy it and not doing a whole

161
00:09:06,778 --> 00:09:17,159
lot of it like just because of the hole

162
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:29,189
so when you dry said like it's cured

163
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:30,689
material yeah and so like to keep some

164
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,870
maximum terpenes

165
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:36,690
yeah well the flavors can blend

166
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,899
differently when you cure it so it's a

167
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:42,180
different it's a different component and

168
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,620
the melt you know people are very

169
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:47,309
concerned about the melt the melt it's

170
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:52,679
like the thing is with fresh frozen like

171
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:55,078
because I'm I enjoy it right but when

172
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:57,719
you take fresh frozen you put it in a

173
00:09:55,078 --> 00:10:02,370
freeze dryer your freeze drying it

174
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:04,440
beyond where I dried my resin right and

175
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,570
then a lot of these freeze dryers

176
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,329
depending on where you put your settings

177
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,730
or whatever they'll have they'll suck

178
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:13,099
out terpenes and you'll lose terpene

179
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:16,259
from your

180
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,889
from your hash because you freeze-dried

181
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:21,870
it and that'll get and if you're some

182
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:24,179
people put these cold trap things in

183
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:26,310
there and they'll get the they'll

184
00:10:24,179 --> 00:10:29,489
collect the terpenes that they're losing

185
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:34,469
but you're gonna lose terpenes from that

186
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:37,049
rapid amount of drying absolutely and so

187
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:40,680
I haven't really done test comparisons

188
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:45,299
but I feel like the enjoyment level is

189
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:48,149
is equal and the cool thing I think

190
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:49,889
about dry sift is because people are

191
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:52,309
always saying like Oh hash is so hard to

192
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:57,689
drive well these resin glands are dried

193
00:10:52,309 --> 00:11:00,239
individually and like because they're

194
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:01,830
hanging right there in your room they're

195
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,980
hanging on the plant and they're just

196
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:09,600
they're dry try any fruit drying in the

197
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:12,740
air so when you have finished your

198
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,080
trimming and you have your trim in your

199
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:19,860
your smalls and stuff and you're gonna

200
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:24,450
do dry sift now you have these perfectly

201
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:26,340
dried individual heads and then if you

202
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,980
don't have to go through getting them

203
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,800
wet again you keep them dry and you have

204
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:39,139
and you have the right way to clean them

205
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:43,139
and you you have an equally pure equally

206
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:45,769
dabba Bowl you know equally high-quality

207
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:49,230
product that actually looks like

208
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:51,419
individual single isolated trichome

209
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,039
heads just like when you take it out of

210
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:56,629
a freeze dryer and you put it through a

211
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,629
sieve and it becomes powder again

212
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:02,429
fresh frozen is like there's nothing

213
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:03,629
else you would get from the garden where

214
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:06,659
you'd be psyched to put it in the

215
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:12,120
freezer and then take it out yeah

216
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:14,759
so how come try comes because they're

217
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,560
hard to dry and they take a long time to

218
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:21,569
dry and they're finicky and they do

219
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:23,369
different resin is music it's an

220
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,620
expression on the plant right so it's

221
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,240
just like which it's only creature it's

222
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,070
its own you know it's its own the

223
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,009
expression of that being in and so like

224
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:34,440
yeah in the freezer it's you can dried

225
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:36,539
like so if you're gonna be like air

226
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,240
drying some of these really greasy

227
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:40,799
strains while you're drying them they're

228
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,539
gonna want to grease together they're

229
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,909
gonna want to oxidize on the outside

230
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:46,559
they're gonna turn more Brown you know

231
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:48,360
what I mean and you're gonna end up with

232
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,159
the brown patty of goo and people are

233
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,690
gonna be like dude that's shitty ash I

234
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:53,459
want the white stuff you know what I

235
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,080
mean because that's just what happens

236
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,500
because like and you're like whoa okay

237
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,889
I'll smoke it because it's good but but

238
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:05,059
you really like really the market once

239
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:07,919
wants these these looks you know and

240
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:11,099
there's a couple ways to get them and

241
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:15,120
you you can either dry it air dry it in

242
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:18,330
a very cold room and get those you know

243
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,149
and plane it and sieve it and and get

244
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:23,100
them separated into a powder but you

245
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:26,819
need very cold temperatures you need it

246
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:29,629
to be you know maybe a short window in

247
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:32,129
the winter is how it kind of used to be

248
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:35,129
but now people are using freeze dryers

249
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:38,370
or cold rooms to make you know and so

250
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:41,129
that's really to make a lot of ice water

251
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:45,659
hash is energy intensive you know what I

252
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:49,439
mean and and we're seeing like as people

253
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:51,600
are making like 20,000 gallon washing

254
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,089
machines you know what I mean and it's

255
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,190
like well that's 20,000 gallons of water

256
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:56,889
just to wash the resin off you know what

257
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,949
I mean

258
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:05,448
do you really is that route really gonna

259
00:14:00,948 --> 00:14:11,750
be the best way to make mass-produced

260
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:14,659
products no and that's the other thing

261
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:18,549
with the dry Steve is like I now AM able

262
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:23,509
to keep all of my plant material in

263
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:27,139
composting and I've just you know made a

264
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:29,120
smaller amount of and a value-added

265
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:30,709
product it's a value-added product I can

266
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,870
make you know by just quickly if you

267
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:34,789
guys ever do that when you do a wash you

268
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:37,028
don't use that water back in the soil

269
00:14:34,789 --> 00:14:42,219
yeah we put them on the hearth and

270
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:45,110
usually what I do is so you know like

271
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,690
I've I've been able fortunate to like

272
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,519
hang out with a lot of hash makers and I

273
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,959
have like access to some more of the

274
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,870
great people who have taught me some

275
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:57,549
amazing things it's like not all my

276
00:14:53,870 --> 00:15:00,589
invention totally but you know like what

277
00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:03,828
well the best thing to do is to reuse

278
00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:05,420
your water you know so cuz you've

279
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:07,338
already got it cold like on the farm

280
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:11,088
when you're doing it small and you're

281
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:14,420
gonna wash it again you you read like

282
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:16,189
you catch the cold water when you sieve

283
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:22,639
your bags and then you put that back in

284
00:15:16,188 --> 00:15:25,448
to wash it again yeah and then you have

285
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,448
a huge advantage

286
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,370
it's only a detriment if you've broken

287
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:35,110
the material and you're making green

288
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,419
come through you know if you're if you

289
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,669
have it if you haven't done it if you

290
00:15:37,419 --> 00:15:41,709
didn't do a clean wash and you broke the

291
00:15:39,669 --> 00:15:45,849
green chlorophyll out of the material

292
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:51,670
and that's mixed in with your plant it

293
00:15:45,850 --> 00:16:02,980
with your resin then matching hash was

294
00:15:51,669 --> 00:16:04,569
rough to then Cobra get with you and

295
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,000
that's the thing with having to go

296
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:10,570
through that whole extensive process and

297
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,580
there's risk there's a lot of factors

298
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,500
that can affect the yield and the

299
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:19,420
ultimate outcome and it's a lot of work

300
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:21,549
and so it it's kind of it's been kind of

301
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:23,769
like a blessing that's been cool and a

302
00:16:21,549 --> 00:16:27,669
half that we had that we had a few here

303
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:32,639
that out its scale of like what we want

304
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:35,860
to be wholly full Miller you can

305
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:40,629
something we can make right so it's just

306
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:45,789
our I have some that I pressed out you

307
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:49,629
know like I I didn't just like with a

308
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:52,769
with a little hot thing no I think it's

309
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:52,769
an e wise pocket

310
00:16:54,090 --> 00:17:00,240
it's kind of breaking up because it's

311
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:04,829
like glass but you know I just I pressed

312
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:07,950
it out yeah but um this is dry sieve

313
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:10,639
that was just pressed out and it's like

314
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,640
shatter

315
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:23,908
so who were happy with the product and

316
00:17:18,778 --> 00:17:27,028
we can kind of this is really really

317
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:31,409
nice my my simpleton logic I'm a flower

318
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:34,470
person but I I love this I mean the goal

319
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:38,130
is to isolate the resin heads right so

320
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:54,960
however you do that doesn't matter and

321
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:57,950
like that that look just like you should

322
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,950
put your light on

323
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:02,839
this

324
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,380
through the clean when you talk about

325
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:12,990
cleaning them I'm not trying to pry all

326
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:17,820
your technicality it's like is it

327
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:24,049
suppose it's a post sieving cleaning so

328
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:28,589
we do okay I might as well share yes so

329
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:31,619
basically we do a rough sieve that's

330
00:18:28,589 --> 00:18:39,329
full spectrum and everything goes onto

331
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:41,939
one one surface right so the interesting

332
00:18:39,329 --> 00:18:48,480
thing about the resin is that trichomes

333
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:51,830
heads have a static charge so if you

334
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:56,880
create the right kind of static

335
00:18:51,829 --> 00:19:01,679
situation you can use the static to make

336
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:05,190
the resin cling to that object and then

337
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:07,019
you can brush it and you have pure

338
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:09,778
it's just like when you were a kid and

339
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:11,819
you'd play with the balloon yeah you

340
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:13,829
know right here like or like pull the

341
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:17,489
iron out of the soil or like any of

342
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:22,108
those magnetic kind of games it's it's

343
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:24,749
just it's just using static electricity

344
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:27,689
and they just come right out and so

345
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:29,429
you'll have all your material will

346
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:31,169
separate out and you'll have this

347
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:32,879
perfectly clean it's just all their

348
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:34,919
heads and then on the other side you'll

349
00:19:32,878 --> 00:19:36,988
just have like this tiny little dust

350
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:40,679
kind of which was just like whatever was

351
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:42,239
left through the sifting and to me okay

352
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,830
so this is one of the most beautiful

353
00:19:42,239 --> 00:19:48,778
things about it to me is because the

354
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:53,368
resin is totally dry when you do press

355
00:19:48,778 --> 00:19:56,519
it it retains this like glass marble

356
00:19:53,368 --> 00:19:58,618
like texture and stability

357
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:01,138
it's like stable like that it's not

358
00:19:58,618 --> 00:20:03,509
gonna turn into a wax it's not gonna

359
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:05,459
butter up like hash makers always

360
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:08,848
complain about when they're ice water

361
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:11,009
has butters which means it's getting

362
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:23,509
moisture in it it's totally dry and it's

363
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:26,569
like glass I totally this was done like

364
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:30,378
like a hot-water bottle press you know

365
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:30,378
like in the parchment

366
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:38,089
and then but I don't do it that hot and

367
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:42,319
then you remember I don't like rosin in

368
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:49,308
it I'll tell you I so rosin you know

369
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:51,319
like do you like just okay yeah and I'm

370
00:20:49,308 --> 00:20:54,589
not knocking on rosin this is just my

371
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:57,288
personal thing you know but you know

372
00:20:54,589 --> 00:21:00,079
when like all rosin kind of tastes the

373
00:20:57,288 --> 00:21:03,138
same to me because it's it tastes like

374
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:05,720
juice from concentrate you know like

375
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:08,359
where there's not a lot of there's no

376
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,038
pulp left and there's not a lot of the

377
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:12,109
stuff where you're like this is like

378
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:14,148
like your if you make like the

379
00:21:12,109 --> 00:21:19,699
connection to that conference yeah if

380
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:21,528
you like like if you're gonna make like

381
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,269
how friend she talks about wine or

382
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:25,878
whatever it's like that if you're gonna

383
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:28,819
make I don't really drink wine or make

384
00:21:25,878 --> 00:21:30,558
wine but we like to make like ciders and

385
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:34,548
the moochers but it's like if you're

386
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:37,759
gonna like strain out the cider or you

387
00:21:34,548 --> 00:21:41,569
know like a wheat beer it's not quite

388
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:44,089
the same kind of thing you know what I

389
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:51,470
mean it's like something about that is

390
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:53,628
in the like when you when they all stay

391
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,308
together and they blend they blend

392
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:59,058
together differently and it's like a

393
00:21:55,308 --> 00:22:01,569
fermentation where when you press rosin

394
00:21:59,058 --> 00:22:07,428
it's like making juice from concentrate

395
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:11,500
kind of extractions you have a you have

396
00:22:07,429 --> 00:22:14,480
a maybe the only the most intense

397
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,759
dominant aspects of it really come

398
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,038
through and they're powerful but because

399
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:22,049
they're concentrated but then you lose a

400
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:24,480
lot of the nuance and complexity that

401
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:27,149
really enjoy and I got the product

402
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,880
initially and I also feel like when

403
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:32,880
you're grown well when you're growing a

404
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,280
six-star melt you don't need to rosin

405
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:49,140
press it you know what I mean because of

406
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:51,509
rosin press like making Roz yeah I

407
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:54,300
really like I have been sitting with

408
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:55,950
this like who's the hash thing interests

409
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:58,440
me because it's part of it regards

410
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:01,380
reality like even like I am so into the

411
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,759
flower but I know that there's you know

412
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,230
there's a lot of I products of this

413
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:07,049
plant so then when I look at it from

414
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:12,210
that aspect I say like the thing that

415
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:15,149
the rosin crowd and people are even even

416
00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:17,039
hydrocarbon people is this ultimate

417
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:19,920
refinement in their eyes and they're

418
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,899
removing the the excess their ruin the

419
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,509
skin from the head however you want to

420
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,810
describe that process but that might in

421
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:29,400
some ways be a detractor that there is

422
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:31,679
it's so complex that there's got to be

423
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,600
parts of that that aren't just the fats

424
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,330
and lipids and whatever they complain

425
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:38,369
about but maybe it is different types of

426
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:42,449
terpenes another minor cannabinoids it I

427
00:23:38,369 --> 00:23:45,839
don't know casing is part of the

428
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:48,630
preserving of it and I wonder a big part

429
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,759
of it to me is the second to me the

430
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:53,030
second that press goes down and that

431
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:56,789
heat supplied you just see all the

432
00:23:53,029 --> 00:24:00,990
terpenes everything just kind of gets

433
00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:03,779
first open and so immediately it's going

434
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:05,910
to change and then with the resin it

435
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:07,799
doesn't necessarily burst it open but it

436
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:10,140
bursts it opened and it forces it

437
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:13,359
through a screen you know what I mean so

438
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:18,030
it's like we're stood up into

439
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:20,979
in that it allows it to be now open to

440
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:23,139
the outside world it's not a sterile

441
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:25,000
casing it's kind of like when you get

442
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,280
into like olive oil pressing and you're

443
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,529
like is it urgent is it extra virgin

444
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,279
what are the temps they did it at you

445
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:35,410
know is a cold-pressed you know because

446
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:38,079
like definitely a fresh cold pressed

447
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:40,690
olive oil is something that's amazing

448
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:43,689
and so some of those Rosen's where it's

449
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:46,600
like they're fresh and they're pressed

450
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:50,200
out really low temps they are amazing

451
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:51,159
being so fresh and that I'm not rocking

452
00:24:50,200 --> 00:25:00,009
we're awesome because there's great

453
00:24:51,160 --> 00:25:03,340
Rossi's out there but not too pressed

454
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:06,549
flower I've pressed dry sieve and the

455
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:08,289
thing about rosin is like for me it was

456
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:10,180
like you had to be at the Machine and to

457
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:14,470
get what I wanted out of the Roz and I

458
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:15,670
was making fuck around so long and I

459
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,420
don't just don't like fucking around

460
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:18,420
with machines

461
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:26,980
you know things if you like to do that

462
00:25:23,349 --> 00:25:30,219
you probably really get into it it just

463
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:32,079
wasn't me you know and I don't I totally

464
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:35,980
get why people are into it and I totally

465
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:39,399
get like the melt that you get from

466
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:41,140
Rosen's but I like to see like how when

467
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,910
I grow my hash you know or make hash

468
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:45,130
from when I grew it's like how good how

469
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,810
did I do you know what I mean how how

470
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:50,110
well did I grow it and that's how I get

471
00:25:46,809 --> 00:25:52,599
to feedback is how well Roz and also how

472
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:58,479
good is a hash because you know the hash

473
00:25:52,599 --> 00:26:01,029
it is only as good yeah so it's it's a

474
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,089
great way to like learn about your

475
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:07,170
plants and what you're growing you know

476
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:07,169
and what happens after you

477
00:26:07,349 --> 00:26:13,679
- and the ability for the different

478
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:17,220
types it has to really either show-off

479
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:19,350
the quality and the need for that type

480
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,240
of hash to have good starting material

481
00:26:19,349 --> 00:26:24,959
and then as you move down the line

482
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,339
towards whatever the the less that's

483
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,529
kind of important because there's all

484
00:26:26,339 --> 00:26:30,470
these refinement techniques and now like

485
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:32,399
with the media's that people are pushing

486
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:36,150
product through that's able to hide that

487
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:39,030
but with something like just real hash

488
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:42,810
with sift it needs to be a really good

489
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:45,029
story it's kind of funny because I've

490
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:46,379
been having actually the last couple

491
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:49,950
years I've been having a lot of

492
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:53,460
difficulty with my a shields and they've

493
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:59,519
been really you know kind of on the

494
00:26:53,460 --> 00:27:04,230
lower end and with the dry sieve I've

495
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:07,859
been able to like use bigger screens and

496
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:10,470
like a lot of my a lot of big stuff is

497
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:12,599
just I'm not being I'm not able to get

498
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:15,690
it in the ice water like I'm not able to

499
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:20,219
get stuff that's bigger than 190 190

500
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:23,009
microns in my ice water screen it turns

501
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,860
out really dirty and gross but when I'm

502
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:27,599
cleaning my dry sieve I can keep that

503
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:35,429
and I can keep it all together and it's

504
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:37,439
like so it's a cool to be able to enjoy

505
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:41,460
like some of the things that I've been

506
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:44,490
it's like it's working you know like but

507
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:47,309
how do you get to enjoy that part where

508
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:51,079
it gets just lost in the water so it's

509
00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:51,079
been cool them to do dressing

510
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:58,099
sorry cuz I don't adopt this this is

511
00:27:56,299 --> 00:28:01,220
Amanda you could both touch on this but

512
00:27:58,099 --> 00:28:03,409
let's just go Carlo like so is this

513
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:05,839
partially a cultivar thing or you think

514
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:10,820
it's the way that you're cultivating it

515
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:12,769
that you're seeing in these yes I think

516
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:23,869
partly it's the way we I think any calls

517
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:27,289
available and I think it has something

518
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:30,259
to do with our our app like our region

519
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:34,190
it's unique to that we're at a low

520
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:36,799
elevation in a high elevation mountain

521
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:39,170
area we're only at 1200 but the

522
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:43,099
mountains around us are all five you

523
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:47,779
know it goes up to five six and so we

524
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:50,449
get these really dramatic swings of hot

525
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:54,500
very hot days very cold nights like

526
00:28:50,450 --> 00:29:02,660
almost we can count on 40 degree

527
00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:06,079
temperature swings pretty much and so we

528
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:08,990
get very little coast I mean we get some

529
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:13,629
coastal influence but it's it's kind of

530
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:15,950
blocked by this big mountain range and

531
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:17,480
it's the place that I've kind of found

532
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:21,640
where I'm like okay I can feel like I

533
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:24,230
can grow in door looking weed out side

534
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:27,280
but it's totally different because now

535
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:29,299
the resin is doing different things than

536
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,190
honestly I don't know why the resin has

537
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:35,019
they're so huge it's it's a mystery

538
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:35,019
means cool things are starting to happen

539
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:48,230
area do do also have similar pronounced

540
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:49,900
yeah it's interesting because it affects

541
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:52,400
was what they're talking about in about

542
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,050
190 or G that's going to like what they

543
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,540
in hash would they call like work bags

544
00:29:54,049 --> 00:29:58,669
there isn't a lot of sizes that are

545
00:29:56,539 --> 00:30:01,609
bigger than that so really that

546
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:03,679
typically would catch minor contam plant

547
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:06,079
matter of contaminants and that if your

548
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,460
guys is glad I can see why it's a

549
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,259
difficult situation for making water

550
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,660
hash we're like driveshaft all of a

551
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:14,599
sudden allows me more flexibility in

552
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,790
that range it's kind of amazing I mean

553
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:18,500
it took us while they even and like the

554
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:23,269
thing is the amount of weight that's in

555
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:24,349
a head that's between 190 and 220 is

556
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:26,179
amazing

557
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:31,549
yeah that's your those are your numbers

558
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:37,059
right yeah people in your region at

559
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:41,178
different altitudes not notice well like

560
00:30:37,058 --> 00:30:42,799
we because you notice the inverse which

561
00:30:41,179 --> 00:30:48,080
is other people at the same elevation

562
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:50,419
noticing the same you know how we just

563
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:54,799
have started to really explore this

564
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:57,590
further because we didn't really know

565
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:00,619
that that was the case until recent

566
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:03,169
years where you can really look at micro

567
00:31:00,619 --> 00:31:05,629
imagery of your trichomes on a regular

568
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:08,720
basis I mean that just started to happen

569
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:12,559
in the last few years and so we didn't

570
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,600
and then with with washing technology

571
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:18,678
and just where Jacobs evolution was with

572
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:21,129
passion and like we came to discover by

573
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:22,790
being able to see them on this level

574
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:25,010
that OH

575
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:27,079
there and we didn't know that everybody

576
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:29,470
like it took time to figure out that it

577
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:32,079
was this weird phenomenon

578
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:36,519
that it's unusual oh you want to my

579
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:44,079
little hasher little pieces of glass

580
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:47,109
yeah all right carry on budget

581
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:47,558
production oh no we just that's how we

582
00:31:47,109 --> 00:31:51,369
like it

583
00:31:47,558 --> 00:31:53,798
yeah we didn't know until Reese

584
00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:57,638
this was even a thing like oh our resin

585
00:31:53,798 --> 00:32:02,200
pants are huge that's okay cool and then

586
00:31:57,638 --> 00:32:04,508
it's like sometimes I see it in people

587
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:07,450
who live in our you know a night but I

588
00:32:04,509 --> 00:32:10,179
don't know what all the factors are if

589
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:13,090
it's just that if it has to do with the

590
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:16,200
Sun lunar soil the soil some sort of

591
00:32:13,089 --> 00:32:16,199
combination of things
