1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,230
Kevin what what genetics are you seeing

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,660
trendy like let's get into kind of what

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,030
people are growing this year and what's

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,190
trendy enough what's trending down and

5
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:16,559
then prices and I thank Eric you know

6
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:20,149
you you've been in the price game for a

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:23,399
while and you know are we gonna see

8
00:00:20,149 --> 00:00:26,038

Pepsi's and then the fall harvest or are

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,449
we gonna prices going up are they going

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:37,980
down what cultivars are people growing

12
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:40,980
what's what's the hot stuff what's the

13
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:43,439
trendy but trendy internet driven but it

14
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:46,288
has a commonality in the sense that it's

15
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:49,049
got something gas in it something that's

16
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:52,350
got a battery cake something that has

17
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:55,799
some type of citrus or flavor from like

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:58,500
cherry pie so you you have skittle which

19
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:01,709
drives orange that's in your runs you

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,689
have any of you gelatos and then any of

21
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,090
the cakes then they go ice cream cake

22
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:08,969
they throw the cherry pie back in it

23
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,950
anything that's oh gee driven it's just

24
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:13,530
that the people are seeking oh gee that

25
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,719
used to be more oh gee so they want to

26
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,629
go back to the foundations of OG where

27
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:21,478
they don't have such a changed profile

28
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:24,929
and I think that when people talk about

29
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:27,810
trends you got to understand that if

30
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,390
you're a green house operator and indoor

31
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,009
operator you can control your swing

32
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,469
between day and night you're diurnal

33
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:38,280
temperature change is much smaller than

34
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:41,700
an outdoor grower if you use great as an

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:45,030
example when you start to have a small

36
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,090
swing it produces a lighter more

37
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:51,118
delicate flavor the greater swing

38
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,829
produces a more robust flavor and so

39
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,649
when people take varieties that have a

40
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:58,949
robust full flavor that they're used to

41
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,899
and they transfer them into situations

42
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,950
where they get less of a day/night swing

43
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,689
they turn down the volume and conversely

44
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,159
if someone takes something that has the

45
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:11,519
delicate flavors and they put them in

46
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,919
the outdoor environment it hearkens it

47
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,500
and so you have to be a

48
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:18,839
just determine like what are you doing

49
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,430
as a producer and what works in your

50
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,140
environment that's going to give the

51
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,920
customer what they seek what's their

52
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:28,259
expectation and you're trying to give

53
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,629
someone something that is gonna catch

54
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:32,899
what's currently involved which is

55
00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:36,359
something that has flavor and has power

56
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:38,819
where power addicted low numbers stuff

57
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,400
just doesn't move things that are trendy

58
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:44,430
most definitely move the education on

59
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,650
small batch craft cannabis is an

60
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,520
educational process because the average

61
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:53,129
consumer isn't aware of it so you have

62
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,770
to take a look at what's trending but

63
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:57,689
what is what is on the ass end of a

64
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,510
trend and if you go to a dispensary and

65
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:02,939
you see 17 gelatos you might not want to

66
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:05,189
grow gelato because you're gonna have to

67
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:09,449
compete with 17 other people on the

68
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:13,199
shelf and so what big companies don't do

69
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:15,509
is they don't run past day 65-63 there's

70
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,119
a little sweet spot so that takes them

71
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:21,989
right out of GMO type stuff GMO meaning

72
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,450
that that that beautiful chem cookie

73
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:27,209
cartwright it's just really rich but

74
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:30,988
it'll pull 34 I mean it's hot but it

75
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,969
needs to go a deep cycle stuff like that

76
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:34,950
is where the craft cultivators have to

77
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:36,900
work you you almost you have to go to

78
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:39,449
things that gives you a natural

79
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,150
advantage because the market won't be

80
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:44,009
big enough to overpopulate because

81
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,289
larger companies won't produce those

82
00:03:44,009 --> 00:03:47,189
varieties so you have to go into

83
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:49,379
storefronts

84
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:51,509
you gotta identify because that's where

85
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,159
this is all moving and store fronts so

86
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:56,669
you gotta go take a look and say what's

87
00:03:53,159 --> 00:04:00,030
on the shelves what seems to be not in

88
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:01,530
stock frequently and then what you do is

89
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,330
you don't have to look for that exact

90
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,340
product you have to understand what it

91
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:09,000
is that people are getting from that

92
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,099
product and once you have that now you

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,349
can create something that's a substitute

94
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:15,479
for that product and it allowed the

95
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:16,978
blood tenders the sales people to be

96
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,418
able to move it so as long as if it's a

97
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:21,209
distributor needs where it's above a

98
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:22,829
certain numeric I say and and and this

99
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,990
is Alyssa's doesn't have to be about

100
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:27,269
real and perceptions and on the other

101
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,110
shit it's not about 25 it should sit in

102
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:30,419
a

103
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,240
so it's gonna have numerix that are

104
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:36,030
adequate to move through distribution

105
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,579
and it has to be on a level that's not

106
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:41,039
so over produced that you'll be able to

107
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:43,319
have velocity of return on your products

108
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,060
but the bottom line is cannabis doesn't

109
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:47,069
break up into so many divisions it's

110
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,470
still breaking up into fuel earth fruit

111
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:51,959
and floral and the subsets that follow

112
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:55,580
within that are true and each one of

113
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:58,859
those divisions hit specific markets

114
00:04:55,579 --> 00:05:01,019
differently and for the you as a as the

115
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,210
producer you have to be aware of what

116
00:05:01,019 --> 00:05:06,359
distributor you using and what stores

117
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:08,250
they sell to so that you can understand

118
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,860
where your products going to end up so

119
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,259
that if you're dropping og into San

120
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,360
Francisco it's not going to move to the

121
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,370
tech crowd because that's not what they

122
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,710
desire as an effect maybe in Corona

123
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,750
buyers time because in the house but

124
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:23,609
prior they needed things that are more

125
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,189
cerebral uplifting more in the in the

126
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,139
fruits of laurels if you're moving it to

127
00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:29,759
old school groups they're not looking

128
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,560
for fruit they need something that's got

129
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,779
a heavy or sit-down something reminds

130
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,149
them in the past those earth groups so

131
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:38,009
you know that the trending part about it

132
00:05:36,149 --> 00:05:40,349
is that everyone looks like what's the

133
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:42,389
big picture but you as the grower have

134
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,310
to identify who moves your product does

135
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:46,229
your distributor where does you

136
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,569
distribute a move that product to and

137
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:49,980
all these questions can be answered no

138
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:51,209
one's trying to keep it secret from each

139
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,220
other because the distributor the

140
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:56,189
storefront the producer does not want to

141
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,800
lose money so you just have to be able

142
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,779
to be proactive on this and that's what

143
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,430
people they they just I got some clones

144
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:04,639
I grew it now I'm trying to get rid of

145
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:07,050
it cuz that's how we always agree pop

146
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,769
that is not the way you grow pot right

147
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,540
now you've you form your reliance on

148
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:14,549
your distributor because you need him

149
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,010
without him you can't move the grass he

150
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:19,079
needs you to have product that moves you

151
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,329
can sit down and say where are you short

152
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,639
where do you see supply issues where is

153
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:25,709
our overproduction and then you can

154
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,659
actually start to make the decisions the

155
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:29,069
tough part about trendy shit is trying

156
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,900
to go through the nurseries to get the

157
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:32,849
material because you have so many

158
00:06:30,899 --> 00:06:34,889
nurseries popping up and none of this

159
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,180
shit's necessarily genomic remarks you

160
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,819
don't know goddamn idea what you're

161
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,870
picking up and you get things that are

162
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:42,610
this but they're not really

163
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,879
they're uh they're an S one of its

164
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,919
qualities not present so there's no list

165
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:50,879
of nurseries right now that have the

166
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:53,228
things that you need and that

167
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,089
information has to be present unless you

168
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:57,728
hold all your own stock and you produce

169
00:06:55,089 --> 00:07:00,489
it yourself and you're developing a

170
00:06:57,728 --> 00:07:02,349
stability which is fine it's just that

171
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:04,000
it doesn't let you get trendy markets

172
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:05,439
which is higher price points because

173
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,910
there's less of it and there's more

174
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:09,490
marketing that's built in through the

175
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:11,770
internet so I think you know for the for

176
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,319
the larger producers recognize that your

177
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:17,049
facilities produce a product that has a

178
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,659
lighter more delicate flavor period it

179
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,579
just holds true the stress from that

180
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,280
switch makes the plant produce

181
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:26,859
differently in terms of flavonoid and

182
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:30,250
terpene production so accentuate that

183
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:33,639
fact most people like by old wine not

184
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:36,129
robust one so the crowds that want the

185
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:38,199
robust let them get it from the craft

186
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:40,899
producers because their situation will

187
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,060
accentuate it larger producers go after

188
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:44,409
the varieties as they sift and smoke and

189
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,449
say oh this is delicate and light

190
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:51,039
doesn't make me choke does it make me

191
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:53,740
cough very very refined go that route

192
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:55,569
and identify which which is the hot

193
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,430
items in the market and then try to

194
00:07:55,569 --> 00:08:00,009
figure out why people buying it

195
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,050
repetitively trendy shit only sells once

196
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:03,788
if it's really just trendy if it sells

197
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,819
over and over again it's satisfying

198
00:08:03,788 --> 00:08:08,500
something and I try to identify what

199
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,598
that is I smoke and I go red what am I

200
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:12,160
getting out of this shit and sometimes I

201
00:08:10,598 --> 00:08:13,990
go I'm not getting a damn thing out of

202
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,300
it I'm just getting the best marketing

203
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,519
ever seen where they're able to push

204
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,098
this product so fucking well that they

205
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:23,949
convinced you you need to buy it but if

206
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:25,899
it's genuine you'll buy it again and

207
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:27,728
that's what you're trying to seek what

208
00:08:25,899 --> 00:08:30,399
are the things that are hot why are they

209
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:32,740
moving someone talks about you know we

210
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,299
don't like new strains and it's the it's

211
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,830
the Heritage strains I'm like well

212
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:38,168
fucking white runts one the amarak up

213
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:40,479
the judges of them Roe Cup aren't a

214
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:43,509
bunch of new people they're old smokers

215
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,430
that variety satisfy their needs to the

216
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:48,580
degree that they liked it and then you

217
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:51,129
look at Josh D he's not small

218
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,079
he took the original og cut or he had

219
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:54,429
moved it ended well I think he's an ice

220
00:08:53,078 --> 00:08:57,069
cream cake that moved

221
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:59,739
so using his production methodologies

222
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:02,140
using varieties that have current

223
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,980
applicability he was able to also win an

224
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:07,480
emerald cup for his division and so it

225
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,120
shows that some of these things can

226
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,909
shine in the right environments and that

227
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,100
the people don't swing so radically in

228
00:09:12,909 --> 00:09:16,899
what they want you don't have to chase

229
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,420
the new new perpetually because what

230
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:21,970
takes places you don't have an ability

231
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:23,889
to optimize your production so you never

232
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,720
get comfortable with the cultivar to

233
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:28,299
where you're able to understand what was

234
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,040
the optimization to make the Primo so

235
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:32,199
when when people chase trends I'm like

236
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,208
look twenty percent of you canopy let it

237
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,860
be the trend you know another sixty

238
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:38,109
percent of you can't be let it be the

239
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,149
stuff that's that's your your goodie and

240
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,500
then have another you know twenty

241
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:43,570
percent of the canopy has insurance

242
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,519
where the shit comes off no matter if

243
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,560
the fucking grasshoppers inhaled in it

244
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,778
because you need something to pay the

245
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:52,599
bill and I think that you know the way

246
00:09:49,778 --> 00:09:56,129
you you you stratify your your crop

247
00:09:52,600 --> 00:10:01,480
portfolio is about insurance stability

248
00:09:56,129 --> 00:10:03,009
burgeoning trends is that a solid yeah

249
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,080
that was that was awesome

250
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:07,000
yeah cuz the daytime smokers are the

251
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,650
main consumers that are going to the

252
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,659
dispensaries throughout the day aren't

253
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:12,490
you know trying to get annihilated all

254
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:14,769
the time you know most of us the

255
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,419
seasoned veterans I guess you could say

256
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:20,458
we're you know going for that

257
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:24,069
Annihilator shit first you know fall day

258
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:29,129
the new recreational market is fine with

259
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:32,440
blue dream dream dream cannot be bad

260
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:35,740
that's the problem that if you dream

261
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,270
sold all the weight that it did does

262
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,669
that mean that everyone who smoked it

263
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:41,799
was stupid you mean they didn't they

264
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:45,719
didn't right liked the people that

265
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:45,719
smoked it aren't on Instagram that's all

266
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:55,810
turned into really bunk where people

267
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,969
started pulling it early and just

268
00:10:55,809 --> 00:11:00,338
pushing the shit out of it but long

269
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:04,420
cycle blue dream is really a nice

270
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:07,780
variety and done right it's it's it's

271
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:09,729
good and so those things

272
00:11:07,779 --> 00:11:12,370
certain markets that's if you look at

273
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:17,230
blue dream blue dream Seattle and San

274
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:18,909
Francisco - tech ops product in those

275
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,190
groups because they don't want to get

276
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:24,850
wiped out they need enough mental acuity

277
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,420
to continue stealing all America's money

278
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,500
[Laughter]

279
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:28,500
[Music]

280
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:40,149
[Laughter]

281
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:47,019
what was in the mason jar that you were

282
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:50,319
smelling earlier Reserve f2 from the old

283
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:52,329
aficionado release and then we went into

284
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,370
it and I went looking for something that

285
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:57,040
had really no gas in it and we're in

286
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,899
lined with Jackson's black lime then the

287
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:01,569
black lime reserve because the reserve

288
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:05,230
was that heavy chem that Leo and Ellie

289
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:09,400
put into that mix and rest in peace

290
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:11,320
Ellie the it's just really clear and

291
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,629
light in terms of the smoke and just

292
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,400
gives me this uplifting buzz so it's

293
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:18,519
kind of fun to smoke sometimes when I

294
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:21,639
when I want to get high but I don't want

295
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:23,889
to have to wrestle with the high I'll

296
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:27,639
burn it but it's just really really

297
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:29,588
limey and clean and just it's really

298
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:31,120
good grass man that's a good selection I

299
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:32,920
didn't select it a friend of mine did

300
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,560
but it's got a really develop palette

301
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:37,000
and pulled out a large breeding project

302
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:40,539
he said hey I got the cut you're looking

303
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,399
for I'll hook you and then what when you

304
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:45,309
say you you smoke to knock you out

305
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,819
should starting when you wake up what

306
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:53,379
are you smoking well I mean I'm always

307
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:55,800
an OG leaning towards you know living in

308
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:58,389
Grass Valley for almost 20 years now

309
00:12:55,799 --> 00:13:03,549
there's been a lot of OG we went from

310
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:05,679
Afghan aight around here and the OG just

311
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:08,049
I don't know just sits well with me but

312
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:10,329
I can't always find or get the

313
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:13,240
traditional OG that we started out with

314
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:17,440
so I'm kind of on to that variations of

315
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:19,629
things of different OG fee knows or cuts

316
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,270
or whatever renames they are

317
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:24,429
but you know I'm always happy when I can

318
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:27,340
get linked up with people that have some

319
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:29,769
you know Kim D or I'll I'm happy with

320
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:31,360
gelatos and some of the you know you

321
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:33,669
know like when I'm up north I try to

322
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,200
search out some of the stuff that won

323
00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:37,569
the Emerald cup you know because you

324
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,200
can't find it further south a lot of the

325
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:44,379
local dispensaries up in Humble have the

326
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,440
if not the the variety of those farms

327
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:50,230
and so you know I personally am a big

328
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,780
fan of all the craft farms you know from

329
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:57,720
here to you know any of them anywhere

330
00:13:52,779 --> 00:14:00,519
but from here north of where I'm at so I

331
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:04,210
give some love to some of those farms

332
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:06,689
Kath Kevin since you're based in humbled

333
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:08,860
you want to give some love to some farms

334
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,090
yeah there's a lot of good farms

335
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,300
Ridgeline I know

336
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,920
Delmon that one the amarak up I want to

337
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:17,669
say you know if you look at companies

338
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:20,679
like redwood roots they're distributors

339
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:23,669
almost all the groups that are running

340
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:28,779
under their banner are local good farms

341
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:32,019
that balloon gazer the Jacob and Carla

342
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:36,339
from the farm over in Trinity just

343
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:39,759
stunning farmers braceland you have a

344
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:42,040
lot of really nice farmers in the sense

345
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:45,100
that their their relationship with

346
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:46,629
cannabis is developed and so what

347
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,490
they're really trying to do is give you

348
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:52,149
the best possible product where they

349
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:55,060
take it to the moment of ripeness like

350
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:56,709
there's a level of care it's really

351
00:14:55,059 --> 00:15:00,309
impressive and it's something that I

352
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:02,500
look up to as a farmer because these

353
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:06,009
people that's all they do is farm that

354
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:09,970
grass and and I have a variety of things

355
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:11,379
I'm involved in as a farmer but I most

356
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:13,779
definitely looked at these people for

357
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:18,250
inspiration on terms of the the finest

358
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:19,990
details of care and it just reflects but

359
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,720
it's it's all over the place it's not

360
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:25,029
just us here everywhere I travel to

361
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,519
craft farmers or craft farmers whether

362
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:29,980
they're from New England Michigan the

363
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,899
whole Pacific Northwest it's all the

364
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,610
same it's it's people and and it doesn't

365
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,250
have to be

366
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,980
old or young it's it's it's this desire

367
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:42,028
to do a better job and drive a higher

368
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:44,190
level product and it's it's a beautiful

369
00:15:42,028 --> 00:15:46,078
thing to see and at the same time it's

370
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,510
kind of heavy because they're not

371
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,099
capitalized they can't gain funding it's

372
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:52,049
hard to tell an investor that you're

373
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:53,730
here to do the best job he's like I just

374
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:55,729
need a fucking paid and they're like

375
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:58,500
well I can only make this much money

376
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:00,300
they don't see the value so they can't

377
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,220
gather the funding they need to have

378
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:07,620
liquidity to stay alive during the

379
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:09,959
process and so you see them breaking

380
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:14,370
down you know it's it's it's brutal

381
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:17,309
that's wrong no no mistakes made and

382
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:19,049
they look old man yeah I thought I look

383
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:22,919
old I'm like holy shit they're catching

384
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:25,379
up and it's it's that struggle of trying

385
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:28,078
to hold your ethics on I want to produce

386
00:16:25,379 --> 00:16:29,730
the best grass that I can grow and I

387
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:33,208
want to give it to the customer so the

388
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:35,430
customer gets that experience and and

389
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:36,958
it's it's it's incredible to be able to

390
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:38,609
source those farms and so that's why I

391
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:44,009
shot it out to the roots guys because

392
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:45,778
yes brands forward this there's Humboldt

393
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:46,980
brand humble brand Rubin and the boys

394
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:49,528
they're trying to get the humble

395
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,539
products out into the public and I'm

396
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:53,039
sure there's groups in in other counties

397
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:55,469
that I'm not familiar with they're also

398
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:58,049
the purveyors of farm products and

399
00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:00,800
putting it out it's just the bottom line

400
00:16:58,049 --> 00:17:02,939
is the farms don't get enough of

401
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,980
recognition what happens is you see a

402
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,720
video and it shows some farms but it

403
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:09,689
never lets the farmers sit down and kind

404
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:12,269
of talk to you a little bit and connect

405
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:14,699
to the public about what we're trying to

406
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:16,949
deliver what and then the farmer that

407
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:19,140
the farmer can then portray the picture

408
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:22,318
the consumer can say you know what I

409
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:24,689
like things like that I like stone fruit

410
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:28,139
herb meaning you know peach flavors

411
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:30,360
apricot flavors cherry flavors I like

412
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,549
those things these guys focus on that it

413
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:34,769
seems to do well that's where I'm gonna

414
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:37,950
go make my decision none of this

415
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:40,679
information is accessible by the public

416
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,058
and it's just miserable because the

417
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,410
public is getting fucked because they

418
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:46,549
don't get to get the good grass they

419
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:49,730
want for the exquisite experience

420
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:51,680
and as these farmers disappear so much

421
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:55,430
of that desire to produce anything over

422
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:57,350
60 days disappears yeah and that's the

423
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:59,180
thing a lot of the good there's a lot of

424
00:17:57,349 --> 00:18:01,549
good people on the bench right now still

425
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:04,940
from the changeover of prop 64 whether

426
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:06,740
in a band county or you know just aren't

427
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,539
able to pull a license together yet and

428
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,539
some of the things like that so I mean

429
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:13,190
there's still a lot more to come as soon

430
00:18:11,539 --> 00:18:15,019
as some of those things get worked out

431
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,789
you know a lot of missing people are

432
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:18,410
gonna come back and a lot of people that

433
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:22,399
maybe had to take a break whatever the

434
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:25,850
case is because yeah I mean I think

435
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,950
there's a lot of room for for craft for

436
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:29,959
a long time coming because like we said

437
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,269
earlier some of the bigger facilities

438
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,500
some of the consumers there's a lot of

439
00:18:32,269 --> 00:18:35,809
Education that needs to go to the

440
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:38,329
consumer too because a lot of that craft

441
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:41,210
stuff stays in these crafty areas as

442
00:18:38,329 --> 00:18:43,129
well the consumers that know craft don't

443
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:45,500
let that shit get out very far and like

444
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,690
you were saying I got a second that big

445
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,880
ups to the redwood roots family because

446
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:52,250
they really get it out there and work

447
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,710
with a lot of great farms then and I've

448
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:58,940
always kind of thought they were a cool

449
00:18:54,710 --> 00:19:01,700
group of people so just quickly focusing

450
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,980
on the California market and kind of the

451
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,920
economy right now in front of iris and

452
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,269
all that Eric your your current I mean

453
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:12,800
if I understand correctly you're

454
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:15,920
consulting with a large Salinas project

455
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:19,490
right yeah so so which implies that

456
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:21,529
there's a large investment and they're

457
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:24,200
putting money in they're doubling down

458
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:27,410
in this market so what are you all

459
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:30,920
seeing like is this year are we gonna

460
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:34,070
see your over year growth and in you

461
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:36,080
know acres harvested and total weight

462
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:37,909
and the California like it is stuff

463
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,949
still growing our investments being made

464
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:42,980
are people pulling back what are your

465
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:46,370
predictions for 2020 given that it's a

466
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:48,829
complete knuckleball of the year well I

467
00:19:46,369 --> 00:19:51,379
think people are going for it if they

468
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:53,869
can because the prices have gone up you

469
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:56,150
know I mean we saw a little bit of a

470
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:57,889
drought last year so the idea is to

471
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:59,700
capitalize on the chances that that

472
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:02,630
drought could exist again

473
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,860
now until you know maybe even July

474
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,690
depending on how the weather goes is

475
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:08,490
gonna dictate a lot of that stuff too

476
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:10,528
because with the colder Springs it's

477
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,298
harder to get planted and even though

478
00:20:10,528 --> 00:20:14,630
people get planted a lot of people don't

479
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:16,888
have adequate heating systems to

480
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:19,260
primarily keep the soil and the water

481
00:20:16,888 --> 00:20:21,569
warm so the irrigating with colder water

482
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:23,339
until the temperatures warm up and

483
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:25,950
things like that and so really last year

484
00:20:23,339 --> 00:20:27,869
you know as much as prices were going up

485
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,730
it was hard to get everything to market

486
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:31,678
and have debt season be a true depth

487
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,990
season like it normally was in July

488
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,730
because a good amount of people didn't

489
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,099
get planted right away part of it was

490
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,019
the licensing - if your license was

491
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:41,719
coming out of that temporary zone or

492
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:44,220
whatever and so there was just a lot of

493
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,870
calamities going on at one time but

494
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,639
depending on the weather going forward

495
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:49,949
this year because even more

496
00:20:47,638 --> 00:20:52,229
sophisticated greenhouses are bigger not

497
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:54,149
even that sophisticated don't have a

498
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,038
root zone heating they just have up

499
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:57,509
above heating and nine times out of ten

500
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:59,940
when I go to places they'll tell me the

501
00:20:57,509 --> 00:21:01,500
angle of the Sun and when I ask him what

502
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,990
the temperature of the soil is they

503
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,450
don't know and if it's below 55 degrees

504
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:10,230
we're drawing popcorn and it isn't the

505
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:11,639
angle of the Sun so you know we we kind

506
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,589
of have to see it's hard to make those

507
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:15,388
projections but if everything goes right

508
00:21:13,589 --> 00:21:17,490
weather-wise coming into spring right

509
00:21:15,388 --> 00:21:19,079
now and people get planted and we get

510
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,808
the yields and July is what it's

511
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:23,849
supposed to be then you know I think you

512
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:25,740
know everybody's got a good chance but

513
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:28,558
if we start to see cold spring

514
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,870
continuing areas we're gonna see less

515
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:33,058
product coming out that's viable and not

516
00:21:30,869 --> 00:21:35,459
everybody can bounce to biomass anymore

517
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:37,168
unless you're vertically integrated and

518
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,659
you're making your own oil and freezing

519
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:41,190
your own product right there though not

520
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,019
everybody's running around going where's

521
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,730
the biomass where's the biomass the

522
00:21:43,019 --> 00:21:46,740
people that are hunting biomass are

523
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:48,808
really strict about what they want

524
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,028
anymore it's not just biomass it's got

525
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:54,210
to be high THC non-detect

526
00:21:51,028 --> 00:21:56,759
an intense screening process goes on and

527
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:59,340
things like that and so you know it's

528
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:03,240
always changing in in the art of the

529
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:05,278
pivot is really the name of the game the

530
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,980
art of the pivot your book

531
00:22:05,278 --> 00:22:09,869
yeah well the beard grows did of did it

532
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,829
Ben with the TG genetics on his

533
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:14,229
propagating purpose and

534
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:15,970
was the name of the the podcast but it

535
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,950
couldn't be more poignant because that's

536
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,839
you know I met with the beerd Bros the

537
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,460
other night and then and it's all

538
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,259
strategy and how are we gonna pivot

539
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,970
through this one whether it's an

540
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:27,700
upcoming job that we're trying to pitch

541
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:30,759
or you know work on or if it's just the

542
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:33,340
long-term game how what's next and how

543
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:36,250
do we see what's coming you know without

544
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:37,720
having to revert to news articles and

545
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,579
things like that it's really the boots

546
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,130
on the ground and talking to people and

547
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:44,408
you know luckily some of us like you

548
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,360
know Scott and Kevin and and some of

549
00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:48,340
these other guys are able to get onto

550
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:49,898
farms or talk with farmers and kind of

551
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:51,459
get the real aspect but we're not out

552
00:22:49,898 --> 00:22:53,500
here writing articles and letting

553
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:55,329
everybody know you know it's not a

554
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,069
billboard that you can drive by or a

555
00:22:55,329 --> 00:23:00,398
ticker-tape or something like that it

556
00:22:57,069 --> 00:23:01,839
really is you know like farming you're

557
00:23:00,398 --> 00:23:03,308
talking to people and you're trying to

558
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,990
look at mother nature and you're looking

559
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:07,089
at the other aspects and trying to put

560
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,169
this puzzle together and see you know

561
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:12,129
where it's gonna go

562
00:23:08,169 --> 00:23:13,509
I mean I'm I'm missing the golden tarp

563
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,309
days and wondering if we're ever gonna

564
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:36,009
have any events are we gonna be able to

565
00:23:15,308 --> 00:23:40,720
get together and share enjoy yeah we're

566
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:44,710
not sharing joints we're not sharing and

567
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,819
you've got you know this isn't this

568
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:47,798
isn't done yet

569
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:49,928
this this stuff is just beginning this

570
00:23:47,798 --> 00:23:52,509
type of viral contamination issues for

571
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:56,320
us socially and so it changes

572
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:58,298
dramatically about people's connection

573
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,490
to others and and how they use cannabis

574
00:23:58,298 --> 00:24:01,658
and how they get information so

575
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,490
everyone's on the internet right now

576
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:05,169
that's why that's why the signals jam

577
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:09,058
because anybody's on the net your

578
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:13,028
problem is is so much bullshit info and

579
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:15,308
fucking blows my mind and people are so

580
00:24:13,028 --> 00:24:17,740
quick to attack other people that

581
00:24:15,308 --> 00:24:21,038
anybody that has a question gets beat

582
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:23,558
down by people that can type quickly hmm

583
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:25,660
so nobody nobody has any fucking clue

584
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:28,149
what's going on

585
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:31,509
and the problem is is that you have no

586
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:34,120
no no way to know and so I'm you know

587
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:36,970
I'm just grateful that I've been in the

588
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:38,919
game for a long enough time that it lets

589
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:41,769
me see what's taking place by just

590
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:45,039
virtue being here and I tried to share

591
00:24:41,769 --> 00:24:47,319
the information I can that's not on a

592
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,089
disclosure agreement so a disclosure

593
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,599
agreement I can't tell you any of that

594
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:51,970
shit

595
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,829
but the stuff that I uncover myself I

596
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,600
can share because I know that the

597
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:57,480
information isn't going to make you take

598
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:01,439
me out you're gonna have to go execute

599
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:04,150
whether I want to see people do well

600
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,670
because I I've always had this dream of

601
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:09,280
a unified industry where we could all

602
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:11,110
grow cannabis all over the place and you

603
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,210
got to see the diversity you got to see

604
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:16,389
the complexity you got to see the unity

605
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:21,039
and in my mid-50s you know that's still

606
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:22,210
my goal so it's it's a it's a really

607
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,769
good thing that you know you put this

608
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:26,140
together P to get a bunch of us together

609
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:33,670
to talk to the public I'd love to pick

610
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:36,009
your brain i monetize that you know it's

611
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:38,110
it's it's 300 bucks for an hour on the

612
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:39,879
phone and I tell you so much shit that

613
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:45,329
you don't know what the fuck to do with

614
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,330
it up I'll give you every fucking option

615
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:55,039
let's rap on that and I we still have a

616
00:25:53,109 --> 00:25:58,129
hundred

617
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,129
