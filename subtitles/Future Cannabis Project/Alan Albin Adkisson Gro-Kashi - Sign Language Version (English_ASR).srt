1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,990
and so this is your this is our baby

2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:09,718
this is grow coffee and it's like oh

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:11,699
gosh yeah

4
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:14,699
Oh a fertilizer that can help your

5
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:15,899
garden achieve beneficial runoff be more

6
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:18,538
beneficial if you're gonna leave a

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:19,859
footprint leave a beneficial footprint

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,220
yes I would agree with that

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,220
yes

10
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:31,160
grow Kashi Rhea solid state fermentation

11
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:38,789
technology and effective microorganisms

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:46,530
and a blend of multivitamins to create

13
00:00:38,789 --> 00:01:19,530
that I lost there's no way I could I how

14
00:00:46,530 --> 00:01:23,509
do we say effective microorganisms the

15
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,509
pathogens during our beer making

16
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:37,210
so I come from a dairy background where

17
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:40,810
as a child I traveled with my dad and we

18
00:01:37,209 --> 00:01:46,089
would cover up the feed for the animals

19
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:48,759
at the dairies and it was just at the

20
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:58,990
beginning of a science called solid

21
00:01:48,759 --> 00:02:04,689
state fermentation the runoff from the

22
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:12,609
silage cured the pollution in the manure

23
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:16,599
lagoons so that's when beneficial runoff

24
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:19,510
the idea beneficial runoff came around

25
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:31,959
especially involving lactic acid

26
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:34,269
bacteria so years later I got into the

27
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:37,500
cannabis business when I moved here to

28
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:40,509
the Emerald triangle about 2000 and

29
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,860
because I had a background in the

30
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:47,798
bioremediation

31
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:52,209
of the toxic Superfund site I thought we

32
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:56,110
could use the same microbes when growing

33
00:02:52,209 --> 00:03:14,920
the cannabis to make our farming

34
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:17,290
beneficial I grew up working at many

35
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:22,149
many dairies in Washington State in

36
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:24,729
California and so after I was out of the

37
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:28,900
dairy business I was in the cannabis

38
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:33,030
industry and Jack hare and Eddie lap had

39
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:41,110
me trained to make this Bokashi product

40
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:50,639
because of my background so those were

41
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:54,489
my mentors oh well we try to source our

42
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:56,619
inputs for this product from only people

43
00:03:54,489 --> 00:04:01,000
and companies that have been proven to

44
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:03,640
give back and you know be deemed at

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:12,090
least organic you know in certification

46
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:15,339
processes so my beta testing group vets

47
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:17,790
every single product that goes into this

48
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,790
product

49
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:30,240
she says the ratio is for soil but what

50
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:34,069
with this bag be good for is this for

51
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,800
our soil or is this for 20 square feet

52
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:41,990
if we were building soil we would use

53
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,990
one gallon to one yard

54
00:04:42,319 --> 00:05:02,250
later on we would use 1/3 cup per square

55
00:04:47,129 --> 00:05:09,719
foot top dressed bi-weekly several weeks

56
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:13,848
after your application it is the food

57
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:13,849
for your beneficial microorganisms

58
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:26,110
she says and adding it to your garden

59
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:33,020
top dressing is best in my opinion

60
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:40,338
although you could make a drench and

61
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:44,378
drench your plant and the soil use it to

62
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:52,488
make tea absolutely it's a multi-purpose

63
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:55,249
probiotic we could take an activated

64
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:59,989
area to compost tea like Elaine Ingraham

65
00:05:55,249 --> 00:06:05,139
talks about and then use this product at

66
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:05,139
the end and stabilize it up to ten days

67
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:27,019
throughout the grow season but I tend to

68
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:29,718
stop about halfway into a flowering

69
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:32,778
period because the product has a

70
00:06:29,718 --> 00:06:36,079
tendency with some crops like onions and

71
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:38,569
cannabis to keep the crop from ripening

72
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:42,429
fully I believe that it's because it

73
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:42,429
keeps it in a regenerative state

74
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:56,060
the trichomes would stay clear onions

75
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,370
and other crops are also known to not

76
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:33,379
mature fully if we keep this product

77
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:37,160
going I think the one thing that we all

78
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:40,990
have in common is that we would like for

79
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,990
our farming to be beneficial

80
00:07:41,500 --> 00:08:00,528
