1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,239
Jew or three of you were on a panel at

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,299
the emerald-cut just a few months ago

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,750
where Richard Mendelsohn was speaking on

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,870
cannabis appellations and he said that

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:15,480
it's almost like mining for gold so it's

6
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:17,100
not enough to find the gold whatever

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,160
that is so to speak we're talking about

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,900
cannabis but to be able to mine it right

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,379
those were words that I remember it's

10
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:27,899
saying I have rough notes and in

11
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:30,118
thinking about that you can see that

12
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:32,070
we're talking about science in so many

13
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:35,630
different ways the cultivars this is Dan

14
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,170
kind of practices and I started to read

15
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,579
Appalachian Napa Valley

16
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,109
Richard Middleton's book and there's a

17
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:41,700
wonderful quote at the beginning so

18
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:44,579
before we go anywhere else they just

19
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,410
think if we listened to these words here

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,200
that he opened this booklet so Robert

21
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:51,328
Lewis Stevenson quote and it's very much

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,370
a description about wine and how wine is

23
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,259
like mining but if we think about

24
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:56,640
cannabis cultivation I think very much

25
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:00,718
there are a lot of the same things here

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,820
so this is from the rich California

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,588
earth and the quote is the beginning of

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,540
vine planting is like the beginning of

29
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:09,030
mining for precious metals the

30
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,610
winegrower also prospects one corner of

31
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:13,290
the land is another tried with one kind

32
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:15,750
of grape after another this is the

33
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:17,580
failure that's better a third is best so

34
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,739
bit by bit they grope for their clovers

35
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,539
oh and their love feet those loads and

36
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,879
pockets of Earth's more precious than

37
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,460
the pressure sores that yield individual

38
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:28,289
fragrance and soft butter those virtuous

39
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:30,839
bonanzas where the soil is sublimated

40
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,850
under the Sun and stars to something

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,210
finer and where the wine is bottled

42
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:39,030
poetry these lie undiscovered Cheryl

43
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:41,280
conceals thicket and Bowers them and the

44
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,009
minor chips the rock and wanders further

45
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,868
and the grisly means is undisturbed but

46
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,750
they bide their hour awaiting their

47
00:01:45,868 --> 00:01:51,359
Columbus and nature nurtures nurses and

48
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,700
prepares them the snack of California

49
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,938
earth shall linger on the palate of your

50
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,969
grandson Robert Louis Stevenson from the

51
00:01:56,938 --> 00:02:02,519
Silverado squatters so if we think about

52
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:04,078
how this is very much a science and that

53
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:05,819
gold is not enough but being able to

54
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,969
mine it right I'd love to hand this over

55
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:12,139
to max Montrose and he'll lead us in a

56
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:14,430
presentation max please take it away

57
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:16,500
thank you so much

58
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:19,890
I've been really excited to see cannabis

59
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,819
appellations become a thing for many

60
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:25,789
years now and it is going to help family

61
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:28,469
farmers in the Emerald triangle who

62
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:32,459
deserve to prove that their cannabis is

63
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:35,189
special and so how we do that is going

64
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,500
to be really interesting and I think

65
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:41,340
cannabis Psalms can actually play a

66
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,889
really big role in that and so you know

67
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,400
a cannabis Somalia's is pretty darn new

68
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:51,239
and so I just want to briefly explain

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,980
what it is and what we do and then of

70
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,870
course interact with other participants

71
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:57,719
and answer any questions that name-o and

72
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:00,060
when they have the first thing I'll say

73
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:02,550
is you know us as the cannabis industry

74
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,789
we keep alluding to this thing that we

75
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:07,890
know about which is this expertise which

76
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:11,129
is more than an expertise it's next

77
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:12,929
level expert which is a Somali a but I

78
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:15,090
have to tell you that the wine community

79
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,790
it drives them crazy that we say

80
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,569
cannabis Somali eh

81
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:24,269
and for many different reasons and so

82
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:26,549
one thing that's true is this expertise

83
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:28,849
does exist throughout many other

84
00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:31,430
industries and so you have wine

85
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:35,879
Somalia's you have beer sister owns

86
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:38,310
cheesemongers coffee cup and within the

87
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,919
trichome institute when we were

88
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:43,610
developing how do you certify someone

89
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:46,679
who's actually an expert in how dynamic

90
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:50,220
cannabis is and how complicated it is

91
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,799
and what is it actually we came up with

92
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:56,370
the term in Terpening and so for us a

93
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,219
cannabis psalm is an interpreter and so

94
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,830
what we're doing is we are interpreting

95
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,900
terpenes and we're not just trying to

96
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,790
pretend like we're gas chromatography

97
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,830
and if we're detecting little oil verse

98
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:09,780
marcene we're actually with the

99
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:12,420
trigeminal nerve of your face you can

100
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,969
detect if these varietals are either

101
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,849
stimulating sedative or actually in

102
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:18,569
between that spectrum cannabis isn't one

103
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:21,299
or the either

104
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:26,550
it's a massive spectrum with multiples

105
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:27,310
in between as we all know and so what

106
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,360
can

107
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:33,399
songs do is well it's it's actually very

108
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,160
similar to a wine Psalm what

109
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:39,370
interpreters do because cannabis truly

110
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:42,370
does have an appellation it has terroir

111
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:45,939
it has two pissah tea vintages historic

112
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:50,199
family farmers pairings tastings in so

113
00:04:45,939 --> 00:04:52,600
much more it's probably closer cannabis

114
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,199
and wine than cannabis is to beer or

115
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:59,410
coffee or cheese or any of those other

116
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,360
things and so that's why it's meaningful

117
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:05,080
that there's such a thing as a cannabis

118
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,410
song or an interpreter and there's some

119
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:09,579
really big differences at the same time

120
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:11,500
you know the one of the biggest

121
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:14,079
differences is the wine industry is

122
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:17,529
thousands of years old and the cannabis

123
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:19,719
industry was born yesterday and because

124
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:22,000
of that there's tons of problems such as

125
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,560
the strain name dilemma even the

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,329
speciation dilemma the fact that our

127
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:29,709
industry thinks that it's indica or

128
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:31,538
sativa when it's neither that that's a

129
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:35,049
big deal

130
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:38,918
another huge difference is you know

131
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:40,860
grapes is a perennial fruit that lives

132
00:05:38,918 --> 00:05:44,079
in the earth for decades

133
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,169
cannabis is an annual Bush that lives

134
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:49,990
one lifetime and so I actually have more

135
00:05:47,168 --> 00:05:52,060
questions than I do answers in terms of

136
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:55,930
how are we as an industry going to prove

137
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:57,610
that the geography of origin impacts the

138
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,150
cannabis in terms of where it's grown

139
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,560
how do we test for that and that's

140
00:06:01,149 --> 00:06:05,439
something I would love to dig into in

141
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,970
this in this panel and then I think at

142
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,620
the end of the day the most important

143
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,979
thing and if you want to move through

144
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,478
some of these slides please feel free I

145
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:16,149
think one of the most important

146
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:19,209
differences between a wine expert and a

147
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:22,899
cannabis expert is a wine expert is

148
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:24,759
really cool like it is really cool that

149
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:27,638
you can do these incredible things that

150
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:30,939
you can taste that the capacity of the

151
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:34,769
russian river in a pinot noir is unique

152
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:38,560
due to the geographic origin that's cool

153
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:40,990
and being able to be a cannabis expert

154
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,180
at a really high level is very cool too

155
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:46,960
but something more important than cool

156
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:49,360
is that it's important to have a

157
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,810
cannabis expert in this time period

158
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,160
because even though we have

159
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,470
legislatively mandated lab testing and

160
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,750
thank God that we do thank God we're

161
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:02,530
testing for pesticides microbials and

162
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:06,870
all the things typically labs don't look

163
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:10,149
for what we consider to be quality

164
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:15,550
typically labs don't look for the flush

165
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:19,478
in sex nutrient lock nutrient overdose

166
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:21,069
if the cannabis is ripe or not or where

167
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:24,310
on the spectrum between it being a

168
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:27,339
stimulating drug or a sedative substance

169
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:29,709
it is it lying within labs don't really

170
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:32,019
do that and because we have the strain

171
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:34,629
named dilemma because but attenders

172
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:36,698
aren't legislatively mandated to be

173
00:07:34,629 --> 00:07:39,959
trained licensed or certified like

174
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:43,150
plumbers or people who cut hair or nails

175
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:45,489
it's critical that we have people that

176
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:48,219
have an ability to assess cannabis for

177
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:50,918
its qualitative features what they are

178
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:53,050
so at the end of the day consumers have

179
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:56,408
they know two things not just a stray

180
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,930
name and a THC percentage but is this

181
00:07:56,408 --> 00:08:00,819
product I'm about to consume okay for me

182
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:02,800
to consume and at what level what level

183
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:03,430
of the quality is this and how you know

184
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,400
that

185
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:09,459
and after I consume it what's it going

186
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,718
to do to me those are two really

187
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:12,638
fundamental things and that's something

188
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:15,098
that interpreting does we can help with

189
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,718
that so we've got courses books tools

190
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:19,240
online tons of stuff that trichome

191
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:21,218
Institute but something that you're

192
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,139
looking at right that was just shown

193
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:27,639
below there is that's our objective

194
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:29,168
analysis for grading cannabis quality

195
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,418
for all of the things that labs

196
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:34,208
typically don't look for and what a lot

197
00:08:31,418 --> 00:08:37,028
of those practices can do especially

198
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:39,338
when when it comes to to pissah t is to

199
00:08:37,028 --> 00:08:41,799
know how and why cannabis varietals that

200
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:44,620
are grown in specific regions in

201
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:47,199
northern california are important and

202
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:51,220
deserve labeling that's more meaningful

203
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,509
than cannabis that isn't to me I believe

204
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,670
that that has more to do with quality

205
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:59,230
than it does with a strain name

206
00:08:54,669 --> 00:09:01,079
or the genealogy of the plant and I'm

207
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,700
also not sure how we're going to prove

208
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,310
the geographical origin but I'm really

209
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,800
excited to find out and and open it up

210
00:09:06,309 --> 00:09:12,119
to the other awesome experts that we

211
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:15,490
have on the panel so thank you so much

212
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,340
thank you so much max thank you it was

213
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:22,419
so great to hear your perspective as the

214
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:25,810
beginning and then just thanking right

215
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:28,779
into how some of the things that

216
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:31,269
cannabis sommeliers look at we have this

217
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:33,039
set of regulations draft set of

218
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:35,829
regulations for abolition that address

219
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:40,360
things like cultivars practices and

220
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:43,030
standards and so looking at the the

221
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,330
definition of cultivar here it's defined

222
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:48,669
in Section 9000 a is a means it means a

223
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,770
cultivated variety trade designation or

224
00:09:48,669 --> 00:09:53,649
strain of cannabis

225
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:55,419
I'd love to hand this to you Eleanor so

226
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:58,329
that you could provide us with some of

227
00:09:55,419 --> 00:09:59,709
the key issues or things that we should

228
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,009
know about the state of cannabis

229
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:05,290
genetics right now and how it relates to

230
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:07,090
even just cultivar selection and some of

231
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:08,829
the concepts that a petitioning group

232
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:11,129
might have to look at when they're

233
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:14,770
deciding what to do as it relates to an

234
00:10:11,129 --> 00:10:17,740
Appalachian petition so max you couldn't

235
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:20,529
team me up better I am so excited that

236
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,210
you really were asking you know how can

237
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:25,509
we really place these plants in the

238
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:27,879
environment in which they're in so my

239
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:29,950
training is in population genetics and

240
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:31,509
my specialty has been in the

241
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,420
intersection between agriculture and

242
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:36,220
medicinal plants and so we see this in

243
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:39,309
at this intersection between the place

244
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,720
that plants are grown and the expression

245
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:42,759
of the genes that are housed in their

246
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,860
genomes across all plants and it's

247
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:46,720
particularly powerful in our medicinal

248
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,710
plants and our culinary plants that we

249
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,910
love so much and so when we look at

250
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:54,220
cannabis we do have the stream name

251
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:56,350
issue we have a lot of diversity that's

252
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,990
out there but we also know that we have

253
00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,759
plants that hold pipe we have

254
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,070
characteristics that everyone can

255
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:05,539
recognize we have names that have

256
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:08,660
historical that historical meaning

257
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:11,899
and deep value because they point to the

258
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:13,819
history of this plants as a either a

259
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:16,129
clone that's been held in propagation

260
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,170
for many years or isn't a family or

261
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:20,419
lineage a plant that's been propagated

262
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:23,120
and routinely selected for those

263
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:25,698
individuals that are displaying true to

264
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,709
type right so this is what we see in the

265
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:30,799
evolution of all of our most special

266
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:32,599
plants the more we love them the more

267
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,849
diversity we seem to have in them so

268
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,100
this can be seen in apples or grapes or

269
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,528
any of our other and really beloved

270
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:42,079
plants and so with cannabis we have a

271
00:11:39,528 --> 00:11:44,299
situation where the genetics has really

272
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:47,239
been pushed forward in a major way

273
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:51,289
because of its history with prohibition

274
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:53,360
and so we have this irony that the the

275
00:11:51,289 --> 00:11:55,278
prohibition of cannabis has acted to

276
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,919
really increase the diversity that we

277
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,289
see you within cannabis and so we have a

278
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:02,838
really amazing opportunity now to step

279
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:05,809
back and make definitions of those

280
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:07,130
plants and so when we look at cultivar

281
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:09,739
and one of the most important

282
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:12,528
fundamentals of the entire appellations

283
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,079
program is the definition of cultivars

284
00:12:12,528 --> 00:12:17,259
whether you're going to include them or

285
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:20,208
disclude them in your proposed

286
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:21,588
appellation standard you really need to

287
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:24,469
have a definition of what those plants

288
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:25,790
are and so fundamentally when we do this

289
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,639
with any plant whether it's a new

290
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:31,159
species or it's a cultivar that we've

291
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,899
developed from a population of plants we

292
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:35,509
do this through definitions that

293
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:38,240
fundamentally include herb area which

294
00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:40,278
press that plant and preserve the

295
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,379
definitional qualities of that plant and

296
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:45,708
so this is a really important

297
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:48,169
fundamental first step is the defining

298
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:50,989
of this plants and then when you want to

299
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:53,000
and so we've started candor which is an

300
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,799
herbarium that specializes in cannabis

301
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,299
and really specializes in documenting

302
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,969
the community's history with these

303
00:12:56,299 --> 00:13:00,469
plants just ownership of the community

304
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:02,180
to those plants and also make those

305
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,620
definitions that make sense to the

306
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:05,899
community that's been stirring those

307
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,610
plants from the beginning and so once

308
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,799
you have those definitions you can move

309
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,899
into what we is genetic all G by E

310
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:14,629
experiment so it's basically you take

311
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:16,309
genetics and you put them in specific

312
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:18,588
environments it can either be the same

313
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:19,339
environment or you can put the same

314
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:21,590
plant

315
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:24,500
many different environments and in doing

316
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:28,190
that type of experiment you really link

317
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,710
the expression of those genetics and the

318
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,240
outward phenotype with the place so you

319
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,400
take the genetics and the environment

320
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,740
into account so you can really

321
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,470
understand how that environment is

322
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,330
driving the expression and so you know

323
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,850
if you take some of your Hayes's that do

324
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,379
really well in this beautiful coastal

325
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:49,070
area and they need certain conditions

326
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:52,580
and you move them to north carolina or

327
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:54,830
to arizona you're gonna have very

328
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,360
different plants in their expression

329
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,129
because of that interaction between

330
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,320
their genetics and the environment and

331
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:02,570
so these are things that we really we

332
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,060
know intuitively in our communities oh

333
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,580
this plant grows well here oh this plant

334
00:14:05,059 --> 00:14:10,519
doesn't do well here and it's taking

335
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,170
that information and then also going the

336
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:14,600
next step in doing these experiments

337
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:16,729
that really look specifically at how the

338
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,970
environment and the genetics interact

339
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:23,420
with each other so I'm just going to

340
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,769
take the second Eleanor to take us even

341
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:27,409
deeper into some of the regulatory

342
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:30,049
material in the initial statement of

343
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:35,980
reasons the CDFA had noted that there is

344
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:40,399
to some extent an uncertainty within

345
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:42,860
cannabis genetics testing just the

346
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,620
ability to account for what you have and

347
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,570
to be able to establish that it is in

348
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:50,990
fact what you think it is

349
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:52,730
and the CDFA noted here that the freedom

350
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,100
to require a prohibit list of cultivars

351
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:59,539
allows the petitioners to self define

352
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:01,399
and I'm wondering you know I've heard of

353
00:14:59,539 --> 00:15:02,689
you farmer groups talk about this I know

354
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:07,549
Swami will have something to say about

355
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:09,560
this as well um you know it must it will

356
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:12,289
be difficult for a petitioning group to

357
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:14,419
decide upon or to come to consensus

358
00:15:12,289 --> 00:15:17,089
about even what cultivars they want to

359
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:19,669
include in their petition and you know

360
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:23,090
whether or not they're going to exclude

361
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:25,669
cultivars altogether at all will be a

362
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,200
fundamental and difficult decision but

363
00:15:25,669 --> 00:15:29,599
you know what kinds of discussions have

364
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,700
you had with some of the farmers or the

365
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,080
stakeholder groups that are interested

366
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,030
in pursuing an apple

367
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:37,460
and perhaps also I want to make sure

368
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:41,029
that I free the green box upsets mommy

369
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:44,840
can chime in as well on cultivar and you

370
00:15:41,029 --> 00:15:46,459
know what different issues our farmer is

371
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,300
going to encounter here you know what

372
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:52,070
what what is you know maybe some

373
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:56,000
concepts to keep in mind and you know

374
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:59,840
maybe some glimmers of help as well yeah

375
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,269
I can quickly speak to that again

376
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,250
prohibition has left the scientific

377
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:06,230
community out of the loop for a very

378
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,559
long time in our agricultural sciences

379
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,940
are deeply under invested at this moment

380
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:12,889
and so that's something that we see

381
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,680
picking up pace as we have more and more

382
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:18,399
lifting of that veil of prohibition over

383
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:23,029
the scientific aspects of cannabis

384
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:25,220
biology and agriculture and so we will

385
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:27,649
continue to learn more and more and have

386
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:30,620
more and more tools scientific tools to

387
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:33,740
understand not only diversity in our

388
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,419
agricultural populace within cannabis

389
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:39,620
but also our global diversity of canvass

390
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:41,689
in general and then just to speak

391
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,700
specifically about the regs and in

392
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:47,930
making those decisions about cultivars

393
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:50,210
to include and not include you know it's

394
00:16:47,929 --> 00:16:52,849
sometimes always easier to point to the

395
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:54,230
things you don't want then to bring in

396
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,590
the things you do and then there are

397
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:59,590
other groups who instead of having an

398
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,590
extrordinary

399
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,299
amazing plants that have been held in

400
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,430
community have been specifically

401
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:09,379
selected to do well in their region and

402
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,600
so there's become natural plants to

403
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,000
include and they have a deep history not

404
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,619
only with the land itself being selected

405
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,880
on that land but also with the

406
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,039
communities that are taking care of

407
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,870
those plants as an annual and propagated

408
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,579
them and move them forward generation to

409
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:23,869
generation so I'm going to Swami has a

410
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:27,619
lot to say about this so I'm going to

411
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:30,529
pass it over him well we're talking

412
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:33,229
about how the plant responds to the

413
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:35,899
environment and first of all the

414
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:39,170
cannabis plant is known to be what they

415
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:42,380
call a bio accumulator or a fight or a

416
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:44,300
mediator and just for you to know that

417
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,490
there was an experiment done after

418
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:48,440
Chernobyl nuclear power plant

419
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,940
and they planted hemp all around it

420
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,420
because they have pulled the nuclear

421
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,470
radiation out of the soil and so

422
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:56,480
basically you know where they say in

423
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:58,789
computers garbage in garbage out

424
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,440
it's the same with cannabis whatever's

425
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:02,420
in the soil if the plant is going to

426
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,630
pull up a good bit of that and that will

427
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:08,269
be reflected in the actual flavor and

428
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:10,580
the end of the plant and so that's what

429
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:13,129
you know max refers to as insufficient

430
00:18:10,579 --> 00:18:15,740
flushing and so on so but there are a

431
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:18,230
ways of growing cannabis that you know

432
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:21,289
even flushing doesn't come in and so

433
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,990
what we're talking about is legacy

434
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:25,129
growers here in the mountains all over

435
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,079
California not just in an ephemeral

436
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,720
triangle but also down in Big Sur and

437
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:31,490
Santa Cruz and over in Grass Valley and

438
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,140
up in the various mountains and so on

439
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,349
they all have their own traditions and

440
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,300
as Eleanor was saying that over time we

441
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:39,619
found in various areas oh don't grow

442
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:41,808
that one on the coast you're going to

443
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:43,729
get powdery mildew and don't grow that

444
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:46,940
one over in Grass Valley because it's so

445
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:49,009
hot and dry and so on and so I mean I

446
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,690
know being a judge in the Emerald cup I

447
00:18:49,009 --> 00:18:52,579
really encounter a lot about cannabis

448
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,679
experts people who know more than me in

449
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:56,750
so many ways and so many people out

450
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,790
there who you know who've been buyers

451
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:00,890
and clubs who have been growers for so

452
00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:02,480
many times ears or breeders they can

453
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:04,160
taste something and they say oh that's

454
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,599
that purple Urkel and it's probably

455
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,920
crossed with that train wreck or

456
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,169
something like that people have an

457
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:11,509
amazing ability through their nose and

458
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:14,090
also through tasting the actual smoking

459
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:15,740
to really pinpoint and I have another

460
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:18,589
friend who's like a third generation

461
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:20,058
been growing since he was 12 and he can

462
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:22,189
pretty much tell you almost which

463
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:25,190
mountain that grew on from the shape of

464
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:27,590
the bud and from all the ways that it's

465
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,929
uniquely done but remember in the old

466
00:19:27,589 --> 00:19:31,639
old day is up here in the mountains and

467
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:34,009
all over people were crawling under the

468
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,990
bushes with maybe a bag of soil or maybe

469
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:38,390
they just had the soil in the earth and

470
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:40,039
you know they were growing tiny plants

471
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,660
and they were saving their urine during

472
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:44,240
the winter to use that for nitrogen

473
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,040
fertilizer and so on so these are the

474
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,308
old techniques that nobody uses those

475
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:50,629
anymore but that's where we come from

476
00:19:48,308 --> 00:19:53,269
but over time people have really

477
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:55,309
developed their their techniques and so

478
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:58,129
there's a science and there's an art

479
00:19:55,308 --> 00:20:00,049
also that the science of it has to do

480
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,410
with we're we're now moving into what we

481
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:02,089
know

482
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:04,759
regenerative agriculture and things

483
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:07,369
known as the soil food web living soil

484
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:09,200
and things like this and so when you are

485
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:11,209
attempting to source virtually all of

486
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,610
your ingredients either from your own

487
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:16,370
farm or within the immediate locality

488
00:20:13,609 --> 00:20:18,709
then like I've got wood chips from my

489
00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:21,649
oak trees I got oak leaves you know I've

490
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:23,420
got my compost I've got my worm bin over

491
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,940
here and so on all of those are putting

492
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:28,279
inputs that come from my place and so

493
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,559
they are now creating even more so in

494
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:32,869
association with the plant and its

495
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,759
natural environment and over time we

496
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:37,579
talk about the biome that the total

497
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:40,279
environmental arable life around but

498
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:42,679
also the microbiome the living organisms

499
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:45,440
in the soil and all of those things have

500
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:48,019
have importance and so these become

501
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,759
standards in the sense of do we say ok

502
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:52,129
in Mendocino we had a long tradition

503
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:54,589
nobody grew more than like you know 25

504
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:57,020
or 30 plants whereas up in Humboldt they

505
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:58,339
always through a thousand plants and so

506
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:00,349
there's all those are like traditions

507
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:03,319
that are different within just across

508
00:21:00,349 --> 00:21:04,639
the county line and so those are kind of

509
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:07,429
things that the standards would be

510
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,900
produced by the petitioners to say well

511
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,610
in Mendo we might say well if you're

512
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,530
growing more than half an acre you don't

513
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:14,209
deserve an appellation but up in

514
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:16,250
Humboldt they say that's ridiculous

515
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,620
everybody's been growing an acre and

516
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:21,319
things of like that has it have to be

517
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:22,969
hand trimmed right hand packed or you

518
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:24,950
know do you have to use integrated pest

519
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,289
management all those things become

520
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,090
standards which then you see the thing

521
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:30,710
is that the plant also is always

522
00:21:29,089 --> 00:21:33,679
responding to the environment in the way

523
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:36,710
it makes its terpenes so terpenes are a

524
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,900
protective mechanism just like trichomes

525
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,360
are a protective mechanism to protect

526
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:44,060
the plant and especially its seeds so

527
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:45,799
you honor your environment is creating

528
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:47,629
the threat or the dangers to the plant

529
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:49,940
and then the plant responds with its

530
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,620
terpenes even in relation to its

531
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,990
genetics genetics will have a propensity

532
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:56,000
for a terpene but the local environment

533
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:58,279
will say that terpene is much more

534
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,430
expressed or much more potent or maybe

535
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:03,230
not even present actually and Kevin's

536
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:05,269
Audrey a dear friend of mine he said he

537
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:08,870
has two farms one on the coast and one

538
00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:10,879
up at like 22,000 feet same strain same

539
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:14,269
program everything else completely

540
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,310
different plant the way it expresses so

541
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:18,710
they're just our people who really can't

542
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:21,289
tell the difference and it's the nose

543
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:23,360
that knows but it's the I call it the

544
00:22:21,289 --> 00:22:25,430
ensemble but actually was 500

545
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,079
ingredients it's actually a symphony of

546
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:30,200
everything in there that's all working

547
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:32,809
together and so there's a whole way of

548
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:40,279
judging this and we're working on that

549
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:42,619
and we're making that more precise thank

550
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:43,910
you so much Swami I tried to switch

551
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:46,659
around in some of the slides you know

552
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,529
you can see even having some of the

553
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,330
scientists and practitioners you're

554
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:52,910
speaking about it that standards and

555
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:55,579
practices very much overlap I want to

556
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:58,310
say sometime Swami as well when we talk

557
00:22:55,579 --> 00:23:01,039
about standards to invite you as you

558
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:03,500
started to discuss whether or not a

559
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,539
baseline standard or a more explicit

560
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:08,599
requirement of terroir would be useful

561
00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:11,480
here you know spoken it Wow

562
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:13,909
cannabis is this bioaccumulate expresses

563
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,160
and pulls up so much of the natural

564
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:18,950
environment sometimes the individual

565
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:21,940
farm but of course also you know the

566
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:34,580
both the micro Vario and and their

567
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:35,990
region itself natural the standards and

568
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,639
the difference between standards and

569
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,200
practices I'm still trying to come to

570
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,900
grips with actually understandings that

571
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:47,830
are measurable certifiable or something

572
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:52,490
like that we could say well I think the

573
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:54,769
base and the baseline would be its in

574
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:57,769
contact with the natural soil in the

575
00:23:54,769 --> 00:24:00,470
ground that it's in full Sun and for the

576
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:01,940
long season is the way I like to say

577
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:04,460
though they still without artificial

578
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,830
life in the flowering section so in the

579
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,960
French concept of terroir there is a

580
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:12,109
statement that says no barrier between

581
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,870
the plant and nature and then I think

582
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:16,909
this is the kind of the key concept but

583
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:18,709
also the other part of the concept is

584
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:21,769
brought up several times is the cultural

585
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:23,000
or the fact of what the farmers do so up

586
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:25,759
here in the mountains and all over the

587
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,960
place if one farmer had a disaster maybe

588
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,420
the rats ate there starts

589
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,860
other farmers would give them starts you

590
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,200
know if someone got raided by the police

591
00:24:31,859 --> 00:24:36,689
people would give him their shape there

592
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,690
was this community up here that was all

593
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:42,330
a solid community because we all shared

594
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,820
a risk in the prohibitive era right and

595
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:46,740
so what's happening now is the community

596
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:49,769
split between those who come in to be

597
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:52,140
legal and you are still braving the

598
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:54,420
winds of fate and growing out in the

599
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,950
wilderness and so we used to be one

600
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:58,410
community and that's one of the issues

601
00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:00,990
we have to come across but with

602
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:03,120
standards now we have to realize what

603
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,920
are the important standards you know do

604
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,439
we say for you to be in our group you

605
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:09,840
have to be hand trimmed right and that

606
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,940
would be a standard and that's kind of

607
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,609
verifiable it's not actually measurable

608
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:16,620
right and then maybe you say okay you

609
00:25:14,609 --> 00:25:19,559
have to have like six six feet between

610
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:22,079
each plant right or you can only grow

611
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:24,659
you know you can only have like three to

612
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:27,659
four pounds per plant as a stipulation

613
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:29,509
to disqualify a certain thing but all of

614
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:32,340
those kinds of specific standards

615
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:33,990
practices and so on would be created by

616
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:36,299
the group that comes and I agree with

617
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:38,430
other speakers would say three is too

618
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:41,430
small it needs to be more of a consensus

619
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:43,560
of several farmers in the same area

620
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:45,180
maybe eight or nine something like that

621
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:47,549
and of course it's hard to bring people

622
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,049
together to agree on things but over the

623
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:51,089
years everyone is kind of figured out

624
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:53,159
what grows up here and the best way to

625
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:55,319
do and like I say so many people are

626
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,720
moving into regenerative farming that

627
00:25:55,319 --> 00:25:59,909
you know it's actually an expression of

628
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,009
not just the soil but of a state of

629
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:03,630
consciousness about how we can repair

630
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:06,180
the earth of the world by using

631
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:08,790
regenerative agricultural methods rather

632
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:11,160
than chemical salt based fertilizer

633
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:15,450
methods that are mostly used indoors and

634
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:18,509
at an industrial agriculture you know I

635
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:20,420
I just wanted to take that point to loop

636
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:22,500
it back to that quote that we were

637
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,110
listening to at the beginning because

638
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,509
when I think of mining I actually think

639
00:26:25,109 --> 00:26:28,919
of it being extractive and I think of it

640
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:30,269
being you know damaging to the

641
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:34,140
environment and here when we're talking

642
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:36,980
about this intricate gold mining working

643
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:39,509
with the soil this interaction the

644
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,789
essential and exclusively potentially

645
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:44,220
between you know the farmer intermedia

646
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:45,839
environment and working with it when we

647
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,670
bring in regenerative agriculture

648
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,009
principles those standards if people

649
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:52,350
choose them then it almost is not so

650
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:55,379
much extractive but being back in

651
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:57,359
balance and even more of something to

652
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,560
help the natural environment continue to

653
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,259
flower whether it's you know the

654
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:04,500
pollinators or any other okay you want

655
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:06,450
to get that natural segue to Alec Dixon

656
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,220
because I know that he has many thoughts

657
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:11,190
on these issues as well in terms of what

658
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,200
he sees even now with testing you know

659
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:14,910
whether there's certain kinds of

660
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,490
terpenes that appear in more isolated

661
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:20,220
areas where there isn't big AG present

662
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:22,559
to even you know what a farm might do

663
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,710
individually to have you know these

664
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:28,470
broader terpenes or other expressions

665
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:32,970
within you know the ultimate product

666
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:34,350
from their place i know and i like as

667
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,990
well you may have some thoughts about

668
00:27:34,349 --> 00:27:40,230
what Swami shared on the bio accumulator

669
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:45,269
aspect of the cannabis plants so lots of

670
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:47,220
questions right in a big long

671
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:48,960
yeah get off me everybody hope a breeze

672
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,940
well it's yeah it's an honor to be on

673
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,410
this panel the part of this conversation

674
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,750
it's really exciting progressive

675
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:56,550
conversation I think that the whole can

676
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,900
meet and learn more about yeah so

677
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:00,450
there's been a lot covered

678
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,630
I would love to jump in on a few areas

679
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:05,400
you know one you know kind of around

680
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:06,690
cannabis classification around terpenes

681
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,640
and understanding and having a more

682
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:11,100
sophisticated understanding of that to

683
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,620
really start to define what cultivars

684
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:17,519
actually exist within the cannabis plant

685
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:20,009
pool and genetic pool and chemometric

686
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,869
pool you know kind of from there kind of

687
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:24,359
getting into you organic agricultural

688
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:26,279
practices and ways of regional

689
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:28,079
superiority how you know the really

690
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:30,000
advanced kind of you know teamed with

691
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,189
microbe approaches kind of can actually

692
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,359
help to you know double secondary

693
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:34,049
metabolite production within the

694
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:35,849
cannabis plant

695
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:38,190
you know whenever it's grown in various

696
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:39,029
ways in various regions and then you

697
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,890
know from there there's the whole

698
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:42,990
conversation around bioaccumulation

699
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:44,730
properties of this plant and you know

700
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,740
the extreme kind of testing regulations

701
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,480
that are put in place but you have to

702
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,450
start kind of on the on the chemometrics

703
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,460
um so you know at SC laboratories you

704
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,400
know we've been open testing cannabis

705
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,360
excuse

706
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:02,230
for last ten years and over the time

707
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:04,959
we've you know done and ran over 120,000

708
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:06,190
terpene tests on on on strains of

709
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,590
cannabis that we've tested and came

710
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:10,000
across and in the recent years you know

711
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:12,579
we started working with bioinformatics

712
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,099
assists and data statisticians to help

713
00:29:12,579 --> 00:29:17,619
us cluster data to understand more about

714
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:19,990
the nuances of the conversation around

715
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:22,000
indica hybrid sativa and you know

716
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:24,789
although we're testing currently 35

717
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,589
terpenes you know and there are hundreds

718
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:28,269
of compounds and ultra-trace amounts

719
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:30,970
that are expressed you know really what

720
00:29:28,269 --> 00:29:33,069
we see with cannabis classification is

721
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:36,279
about five to nine terpenes that

722
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:38,799
essentially define 99% of everything

723
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:40,389
we've ever tested and from understanding

724
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,819
more about the primary secondary

725
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:44,770
attributes and cannabis with regard to

726
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:46,839
terpenes we can really start to dive in

727
00:29:44,769 --> 00:29:49,000
to understand what cultivars actually

728
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:51,250
exists you know what we see from all the

729
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,710
the sorting of data is there's about

730
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,450
five primary smell groups and each

731
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:56,860
primary smell group then has two to

732
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,049
three subgroups you know you can kind of

733
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:01,659
think of it like wine system whites and

734
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:02,980
red wines and then you know the various

735
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,529
grapes that are in each of those

736
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:08,289
categories but essentially we see about

737
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:10,000
five primary sub primary groups you know

738
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:11,980
two to three sub groups is about ten to

739
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,539
twelve archetype profiles that

740
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,940
essentially define everything you've

741
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:18,009
ever tested and from there you can

742
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,830
really start to understand obscurity and

743
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:24,369
rarity and what what what types of

744
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:25,960
really really unique you know profiles

745
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:28,589
that the plant produces that you know

746
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,930
seem are seeming to be related to

747
00:30:28,589 --> 00:30:33,609
landrace your recessive traits that are

748
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:37,539
within various strains from around the

749
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:38,169
world and so so kind of taking it from

750
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:40,269
there

751
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:42,130
you know like we then see you know kind

752
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:43,660
of a you know on the back so much of the

753
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:46,540
work of you know kind of the great

754
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:49,360
laning soil food web and the really

755
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:52,269
advanced pursuit to understand how to

756
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:53,949
optimize organic farming practices in in

757
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:56,349
the teaming with microbes approach to

758
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,059
you know biomimicry you're helping to

759
00:30:56,349 --> 00:31:00,219
recreate you know perfect environmental

760
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:01,809
conditions means so much of the work of

761
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:03,819
the small food web is it really does

762
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:06,579
help to begin substantiating through

763
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:07,869
science and through testing on various

764
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:10,119
secondary metabolites

765
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:12,099
by the plant terpenes being in cannabis

766
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:14,199
secondary metabolite but seeing kind of

767
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:17,319
how advanced organic practices can

768
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,400
actually you know increase in double you

769
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:20,319
know secondary metabolite production

770
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,030
within the plant you know very much

771
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:25,480
based on region very much based on

772
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:27,849
organic practices and is is is not as

773
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,099
broad as a whole county but is this very

774
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:32,649
kind of myopic to an individual farming

775
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:34,959
practices level or the the surrounding

776
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:36,759
farmers in that region that have kind of

777
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,049
gained so much experience in serving

778
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:41,650
this plant over such a long period of

779
00:31:38,049 --> 00:31:43,599
time so kind of you know segue in that a

780
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,220
little bit you know kind of from

781
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:46,808
terpenes and kind of you know the

782
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,390
expression of what we see and how

783
00:31:46,808 --> 00:31:51,220
organic practices can enhance you know

784
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:53,080
these these secondary metabolites

785
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:55,029
produced by the plant grown in various

786
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,409
regions you know it kind of then kind of

787
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:58,750
goes into the conversation around

788
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,130
cannabis as a bio accumulating plant you

789
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,140
know this plant is the great bio

790
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:04,210
accumulator of the 21st century and we

791
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:07,000
are now testing it to a level that

792
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:08,799
nothing has ever been tested for Quality

793
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,960
Assurance around public health and

794
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,599
safety and for different chemometric

795
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,480
markers to you know help identify

796
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:20,230
quality and substantiate kind of you

797
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,819
know market value in various ways when

798
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:24,370
it comes to bioaccumulation and for the

799
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:26,769
QA concerns with contaminants you know

800
00:32:24,369 --> 00:32:28,479
we you know it's a really fascinating

801
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:30,069
kind of see from the testing level

802
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,190
because you know right now we're almost

803
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:34,720
beginning to start to see California

804
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:37,000
splitting up into you know red zones

805
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,679
yellow zones and green zones you know

806
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,529
which really start to define and

807
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:43,179
highlight the various difficulties

808
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:45,789
vulnerabilities and massive

809
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:47,950
opportunities that exist for farmers in

810
00:32:45,789 --> 00:32:52,750
various regions and when you start

811
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:55,808
talking about yeah I like I I just

812
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:58,269
wanted to add there because when we were

813
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:01,329
talking about even how to show this data

814
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:04,509
or this image you provided me with a

815
00:33:01,329 --> 00:33:06,759
slide of an area in the Central Valley

816
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:09,640
that are like we didn't include it here

817
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:11,500
but you can see you could describe it

818
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:16,210
may be you know areas where there's just

819
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:18,490
all sorts of EPA violations and the like

820
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:20,329
and then you know a whole mountain range

821
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:23,599
on the other side with nothing

822
00:33:20,329 --> 00:33:26,179
and so I wonder looking at this 90 106

823
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:28,759
geographical features one of the things

824
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:32,200
that petitioners will need to show is

825
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:36,230
that at least as that bring stand now

826
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,910
under be 90 106 be substantial evidence

827
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:39,860
that the geographical area is

828
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:42,890
distinctive when compared to areas

829
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:45,019
outside the proposed boundary and other

830
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:47,120
relevant areas which produce cannabis

831
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:48,920
for sale in the marketplace I know

832
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:50,059
you're from the Central Coast I've spent

833
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,759
some time there with different

834
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:55,490
stakeholders and we've had lots of

835
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:58,369
conversations about this even just in

836
00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:00,279
you know your region can you imagine you

837
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:02,389
know being able to establish that

838
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:05,779
geographical boundary where you can see

839
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:08,539
for example an isolated area a canyon

840
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:10,190
that's away from big AG that maybe

841
00:34:08,539 --> 00:34:11,869
doesn't have some of the things that

842
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,570
we're talking about pesticides and other

843
00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:16,759
contaminants and it's maybe more

844
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:18,230
pristine yeah in so many ways you know

845
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,330
now that cannabis is being tested at

846
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,800
this level for compliance testing with

847
00:34:20,329 --> 00:34:24,289
any product failing having to be

848
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:26,000
remediated destroyed you know over

849
00:34:24,289 --> 00:34:27,380
thousands of these kind of fails going

850
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,840
back at the beginning of 2018 we've

851
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:33,530
really begin to start to kind of create

852
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:36,370
a map overlay of regions that are you

853
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:39,050
know under incredible threat to you know

854
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:41,480
for cannabis farmers growing in these

855
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:43,400
regions because of the neighboring

856
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,380
because the history of land because of

857
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,450
the agriculture practices that that were

858
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,669
taking place long before they were

859
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:52,009
farming there or from the neighboring

860
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:54,469
regions from the way the farmers tell

861
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:57,110
their soil and kick-up metals that can

862
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:59,989
then completely fail an entire cannabis

863
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:01,840
crop just from that simple act and yeah

864
00:34:59,989 --> 00:35:05,000
and in so many ways what we're you know

865
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,400
the kind of a SAP elation conversation

866
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,019
to me is really fascinating because

867
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,700
through the lens of testing you know so

868
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:13,219
much of what we've seen is is really

869
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:15,859
kind of starting to show you know kind

870
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:18,289
of the the avenues and the pathways for

871
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:20,360
for people's success and small craft

872
00:35:18,289 --> 00:35:22,070
farmers artists and producers have been

873
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,750
doing this all their life with the rich

874
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:26,450
rich and vast experience to grow this

875
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:30,409
annual plant that is you know very

876
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:32,629
harvest specific and very and very very

877
00:35:30,409 --> 00:35:34,338
sensitive to to actually have an

878
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,079
opportunity to really shine

879
00:35:34,338 --> 00:35:39,588
this time where there's you know massive

880
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,778
you know kind of efforts to mono crop

881
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:44,630
this plant and to kind of commercialize

882
00:35:41,778 --> 00:35:47,478
it in such a way and so so in a lot of

883
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:48,588
ways yeah the the through the testing

884
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:51,379
kind of we're really beginning to see

885
00:35:48,588 --> 00:35:52,639
kind of how much is being affected how

886
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,200
much cannabis farmers are being affected

887
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:57,798
from being planted in these areas and

888
00:35:54,199 --> 00:36:01,548
and and in in so many ways it's not that

889
00:35:57,798 --> 00:36:03,829
all areas of AG land in Salinas or in in

890
00:36:01,548 --> 00:36:05,838
kind of you know kind of in Santa

891
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:07,849
Barbara or in Stanislaus County anywhere

892
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:10,909
where AG takes place you know presents

893
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:12,710
unique sets of challenges to any farmer

894
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:14,748
that's going to grow there and cannabis

895
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:16,159
in so many ways through being this bio

896
00:36:14,748 --> 00:36:18,018
accumulator and kind of helping to tell

897
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:20,028
the story it's really beginning to you

898
00:36:18,018 --> 00:36:21,738
know breathe uproot a lot of the history

899
00:36:20,028 --> 00:36:24,289
and legacy of the Green Revolution and

900
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:25,728
chemical induced approach to AG and in

901
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:27,950
the process I think it's also going to

902
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,679
be very much a beginning to help

903
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:31,639
accelerate the slow food movement

904
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,528
decentralized agricultural approach

905
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:36,259
understanding where your food comes from

906
00:36:33,528 --> 00:36:37,849
where your medicine comes from and and

907
00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:42,889
yet holding food and all other

908
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:45,079
industries to a new standard Wow thank

909
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:47,118
you so much Alec I'm getting thumbs up

910
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:49,130
from salami I feel like we've all had

911
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,930
these dialogues a couple different times

912
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:53,210
in different ways that's a great place

913
00:36:50,929 --> 00:36:56,868
to leave it do it can we have any last

914
00:36:53,210 --> 00:37:00,019
minute last notes Blake or that's it

915
00:36:56,869 --> 00:37:02,960
well the proof is in the nose and I

916
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:04,939
think Mac says the same thing and that's

917
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:11,630
what's telling you because the nose the

918
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:21,229
terpenes give you a precognition what's

919
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:25,009
going to be doing I cannot wait to learn

920
00:37:21,228 --> 00:37:28,399
more about the research Alec is doing

921
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:32,019
with SC labs in these terpene testing

922
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,519
and the culmination of the types because

923
00:37:32,018 --> 00:37:37,429
interpreting has discovered that there's

924
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:39,228
kind of five cannabis types as well and

925
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:41,210
it's chirping dependent and that the

926
00:37:39,228 --> 00:37:43,429
trigeminal nerve can detect where that

927
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:45,679
spectrum is so I just want to hang out

928
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:48,079
with you and compare data and knowledge

929
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:50,539
and Swami I can't wait

930
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,699
smoke one with you and Ellen no I want

931
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:54,199

thing to be a part of just gonna do a

939
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:25,369

and after that I'm going to share a

943
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:36,169
quote or two that I think will guide us

944
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:39,170
through this and then we'll let max

945
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:41,990
Montrose take it away so this panel

946

I know there's so much that we can share

970
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:45,430
there Swami chipton is also joining us

visiting his farm where he and his

977
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:03,249
partner Nicholas Trudeau

978
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:04,869
farm under the full Sun some in native

979
00:40:03,248 --> 00:40:06,548

00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:08,289
from Swami and if you want to learn more

981

I really enjoyed seeing him on the news

982
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:14,619
hour with his partner Nicky for their

983
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:18,129

987
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:30,189
co-founder and also the founder of

988
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:33,308
kinder herbarium which I understand is

989
00:40:30,188 --> 00:40:35,678
one of the world's cannabis or variants

990
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:37,119
which i think is going to serve these

991
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:38,439
are variants will serve a pivotal role

992
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,219
