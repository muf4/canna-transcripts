2
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:17,939
well the biggest piece is

3
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:19,379
54:16 d we've been working on that since

4
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:22,140
the beginning of the year at first

5
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:24,750
transpired as Senate bill 1302 which was

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,080
a bill that I sponsored along with my

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,778
co-sponsor Americans for safe access

8
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:32,310
that's that's monumental I think 85% of

9
00:00:30,778 --> 00:00:35,240
cities and counties currently do not

10
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:37,410
allow any retail sales so now we've just

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,859
effectively opened up the entire state

12
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:43,140
which is going to be insane beneficially

13
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,879
to help quell the black market I mean as

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,799
everyone knows the black market is

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,969
completely out of control right now and

16
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:52,769
with all the all the taxes regulatory

17
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,019
cost compliance costs everything that

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,140
comes into the barriers of entry to

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,670
become licensed and permitted

20
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,789
it's insane so we needed to get that

21
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,810
under control and now also consumers are

22
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,969
like that was that they have a safe

23
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:08,460
Avenue to buy licensed and tested

24
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:12,179
products so that was a big win yeah that

25
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:15,409
was that was huge and then that 54 or

26
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,570
15.1 which was the tech regulations for

27
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:21,119
ancillary companies that was I mean that

28
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:26,369
was obviously targeted at a few specific

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:28,189
entities so that was that was a big win

30
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,840
because now that levels of playing field

31
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:33,269
very specifically that the transfer of

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,000
cannabis Goods facilitated through an

33
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:38,158
ancillary company is no longer allowed

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,530
unless they have ownership in the

35
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,560
company through a percentage through

36
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,409
equity share through licensing we made

37
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,150
it made the process of dealing with

38
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,630
these ancillary companies completely

39
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:54,659
transparent and onerous so basically in

40
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:58,829
a scenario like Eazy E's has a fleet of

41
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:01,260
trucks correct so that's so that's what

42
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,120
the I should say quote-unquote employees

43
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,430
are under the guise of but technically

44
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,469
they're employees of their partner

45
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,200
dispensary so

46
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:12,960
that that just creates a diluted process

47
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,389
for in so many different ways so let's

48
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:17,879
say I'm hired on as a driver through

49
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:19,500
ease but really I'm the employee of a

50
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:21,810
dispensary that I've never stepped foot

51
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,909
in and let's say I'm injured on the job

52
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,150
who do I come after for workman's comp

53
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:28,650
or compensation or there's just so many

54
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,319
different ways to where that can be

55
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:35,129
convoluted and and consumers alike as

56
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:37,500
well so I buy an edible from ease and I

57
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:39,900
get sick that completely dilutes the

58
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,580
recall process who do I contact to say

59
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,620
where this product came from to

60
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,630
eliminate this from happening to so many

61
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,480
other consumers that could have this

62
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:50,039
similar problem right or who do I go

63
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,769
after financially through a little

64
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,959
litigated matter which statute of

65
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:57,360
limitations under some circumstances is

66
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,550
a very finite time to get your filing in

67
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,470
so who do I contact to have the

68
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,660
attorneys than that - it's just creates

69
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:05,370
a whole slew of problems are the

70
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,109
regulations basically telling the EES is

71
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,959
the world you need a delivery license

72
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,000
right yeah exactly so do you think that

73
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:16,110
ease is now going to get a delivery

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,439
license I don't see that I don't see

75
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,660
that happening just because I think that

76
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,769
the sole the one of the main brush and

77
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,239
say the sole Ferb's one of the main

78
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,469
purposes they've been operating the

79
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,480
manner that they have is because they

80
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:30,359
escape the 280 federal tax liability

81
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:33,810
they escape excise tax they escape local

82
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,160
government local government tax just so

83
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,349
many different layers of taxes they

84
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,209
escape on top of the compliance and

85
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:39,629
regulatory measures and costs associated

86
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,280
with that

87
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:43,739
I mean they've already been through

88
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,680
multiple rounds of investment and now to

89
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:49,530
switch gears and tell investors that

90
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,269
they're gonna have to be liable for

91
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,000
these tax responsibilities and these

92
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:55,709
oversights and these federal risks that

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,680
they now have to mitigate it's not going

94
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,239
to be as easy as been asked as it is to

95
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,640
say hey we're we're an amazing tech

96
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,939
platform invest into us so I I don't

97
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:07,018
know I I would think adjust myself for

98
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,340
being a business owner it would be the

99
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,200
smart move to pull back and become

100
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,849
solely a tech provider because that's

101
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,009
gonna be the easy ask for money from

102
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:17,540
investors and to continue moving forward

103
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:17,539
with that since they have that but

104
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:23,639
because they were big they are becoming

105
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:25,500
a very big player in the space and I

106
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,069
think their vision was to sort of

107
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,709
dominate up and down the coast so with

108
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:34,439
them sort of having seemingly having to

109
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:38,579
retreat a little bit how do you see the

110
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:40,529
delivery market playing out in 2019 and

111
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:43,740
Beyond you do you eventually see like

112
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:46,349
companies sort of do you know service in

113
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,500
the entire state or super hyper local

114
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,150
and regional I think we're gonna see a

115
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,949
little bit of both I think this provides

116
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:54,479
a better opportunity for small business

117
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:56,490
to thrive and we're gonna see some

118
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:59,550
bigger players start to emerge and and

119
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:02,040
and gain market share where ease is

120
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:04,350
having to retreat from so I think it's

121
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,870
gonna be the best of both worlds and I

122
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:09,570
know that a lot of trade associations

123
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,459
statewide within every every sector

124
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:13,649
whether cultivation manufacturing

125
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:15,689
distribution and retail are now coming

126
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:17,729
together and realizing that there's an

127
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:20,490
onslaught of Canadian investment money a

128
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,290
huge investor money coming in and threat

129
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,949
of big business coming in to consolidate

130
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,120
the industry as a whole so it seems like

131
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:29,879
delivery companies I mean you just

132
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,910
mentioned two big wins it seems like

133
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:36,449
you're one of the licensee categories

134
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:38,340
that's actually happy right now as a

135
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:42,360
generality versus like I think it's you

136
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:43,529
know from small delivery operations to

137
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,090
big whereas I see like in the

138
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:47,549
cultivation world if I were a small

139
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:49,199
cultivator and just hammered by

140
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,210
regulations it's almost like only the

141
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,699
big can play in the cultivation or

142
00:05:51,209 --> 00:05:55,949
certain areas of the industry but

143
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:59,819
delivery and tell me if I'm right or

144
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:04,729
wrong seems like a part of the market

145
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:07,459
where small players can thrive in 2019

146
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:11,069
yeah absolutely absolutely I think that

147
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:12,329
the bureau and otherwise recognizes the

148
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:14,909
threat from the black market and what

149
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:17,789
that's doing and in providing the retail

150
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:20,460
outlet and and also the equity issues

151
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,230
that delivery satisfies because it's the

152
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:24,089
lowest barrier of entry license type so

153
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,520
with equity rolling out on the state

154
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:29,729
level was Senator Bradford's equity bill

155
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,310
I think it was 1292 or so I can't

156
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,920
remember theirs

157
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:35,139
so many bills in my head but with the

158
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,720
equity issue that delivery satisfies low

159
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:40,230
barrier of entry being able to come in

160
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,610
and eliminate the black market through

161
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,500
services provided now into these ban

162
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,389
localities I think that was I was a huge

163
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,740
win overall for the industry but but

164
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,540
like you said the I mean the white label

165
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,509
issue I'm sure though you're aware of

166
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:55,210
the IP issue that was that was huge that

167
00:06:52,509 --> 00:06:57,418
was a big deal now everybody is freaking

168
00:06:55,209 --> 00:07:01,060
out because of that I mean there was a

169
00:06:57,418 --> 00:07:04,149
discrepancy but but your lane which is a

170
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,769
delivery company like that doesn't

171
00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:08,529
really affect you very much does it

172
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:14,049
no I know now delivery is you're like

173
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:15,909
sucks for you manufactured whoever ends

174
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,180
up meeting delivery I'll be there to do

175
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,820
it

176
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,709
right yeah so I mean we're we are moving

177
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:22,930
into vertical integration in Sacramento

178
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:24,279
we're looking to vertically integrate so

179
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,129
much some of these issues are gonna

180
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:28,779
impact us your company yeah so some of

181
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:31,209
these do you want to get in so what if

182
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:34,719
you're currently delivery words the next

183
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:36,310
first step vertical integration we're

184
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,810
just going for everything I want so

185
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,030
we're converting from delivery to

186
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:42,639
delivery manufacturing cultivation and

187
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:44,769
distribution and retail or now yeah oh

188
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,719
yeah all the elements so delivery retail

189
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:48,609
distribution and cultivation and

190
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,410
manufacturing so where are you gonna get

191
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,479
where do you where's the first retail

192
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:55,840
location gonna be Sacramento

193
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:58,060
okay so Sacramento retail and then right

194
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,978
next to that retail facility you'll have

195
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:02,050
a manufacturing for somewhere near it

196
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:04,209
you'll have your manufacturing I'm it's

197
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:06,360
a huge 30,000 square foot warehouse so

198
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:07,810
it meets the needs of all different

199
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,939
business types

200
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:12,550
oh so you can run everything out of that

201
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:15,100
single 30,000 square foot location yeah

202
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,228
yeah so its its 30,000 square feet but

203
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,180
it's it's it's segmented off into

204
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:21,310
separate buildings all isolated for

205
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,139
their different license types so we're

206
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,970
moving there Sacramento is gonna be our

207
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:27,099
first vertically integrated facility

208
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:30,490
we're working on finalizing the land

209
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:32,889
deal in San Joaquin County to move

210
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:35,259
forward as soon as their measure B rolls

211
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:37,899
out which is a tax initiative and then

212
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:40,689
forming a strategic partnership in the

213
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:42,579
in the city of Los Angeles currently to

214
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:45,070
be able to hopefully capitalize on the

215
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:47,440
statewide delivery regulation if it is

216
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,180
solidified so what would you have going

217
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,200
on down in LA like you wouldn't you

218
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:53,379
wouldn't have necessarily have

219
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,629
manufacturing I mean I cultivation so I

220
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:59,740
believe with that partnership it's going

221
00:08:55,629 --> 00:09:01,990
to be just distribution distribution and

222
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,529
cultivation and then when phase three

223
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:07,000
rolls out supposedly in January delivery

224
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:07,480
would be able to be included in that

225
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,620
model

226
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:16,300
okay so LA City yeah okay yeah and then

227
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:20,730
to fund all this I mean are you raising

228
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:23,109
capital are you strategic partnerships

229
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,220
yeah I mean quite quite honestly I don't

230
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:25,750
want it I don't want to do the

231
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,850
day-to-day operations of this anymore so

232
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,559
I've brought in strategic partners for

233
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:31,300
each aspect of it cultivation

234
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:33,369
manufacturing distribution and the

235
00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:35,229
delivery retail to do the day-to-day

236
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:37,659
management aspects of it and also

237
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:41,529
capitalize to do the build-out

238
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:43,029
well I so you acquired that 30,000

239
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:44,350
square foot space are you leasing it or

240
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:46,389
acquired it what's up

241
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:49,120
the 30,000 square foot space in

242
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:50,799
Sacramento oh yeah I'm leasing that okay

243
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,669
so you don't have a huge upfront capital

244
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:56,969
investment but you go you're we drop is

245
00:09:54,669 --> 00:10:00,370
funding the build out of that entire

246
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:02,560
yeah yeah so we did close down on July

247
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,970
28th we let our temporary license run

248
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,029
out in Oakland

249
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,620
because astronomical costs associated

250
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:10,379
with operating the Bay Area as I'm sure

251
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,209
you're aware just the land cost

252
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:15,789
employment wages are extremely higher 16

253
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:18,039
to 20 dollars an hour there versus 12 to

254
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:19,838
14 in Sacramento land cost was almost

255
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:23,439
three dollars a square foot there it's a

256
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,120
buck in Sacramento taxes are ten percent

257
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,959
at Oakland and therefore personal

258
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,429
effectively five percent with the the

259
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,889
one percent contribution so five percent

260
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:34,689
Sacramento so it was just so much

261
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:37,120
cheaper to operate we took our capital

262
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:40,000
that had accumulated from operating in

263
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,940
Oakland and and put that into every end

264
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,360
of operations in Sacramento

265
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:51,230
do you think speaking of Sacramento

266
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,700
do you know that guy joe chiodo vlinn

267
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,920
come on down

268
00:10:52,700 --> 00:11:03,200
rabbit see let's talk about delivery Joe

269
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:07,549
rat crap grab that seat well first of

270
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,440
all before Joe before Joe joins us do

271
00:11:07,549 --> 00:11:11,359
you think Oakland is getting the message

272
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,040
like what's happened because I seems

273
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,149
like everybody wants to get out at some

274
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,610
point Oakland to be like holy shit

275
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:18,980
nobody's doing business here yeah so

276
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:21,889
they're in the process of running a tax

277
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:25,490
measure to reduce taxes so they're aware

278
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:26,990
of the problem and I think that Oakland

279
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,820
is a real pioneer they've been involved

280
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,399
with the cannabis industry since 96 when

281
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:32,839
prop 215 came about and they just really

282
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,519
tried to push the envelope and be on the

283
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:37,010
forefront of what was happening here and

284
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,909
like everybody that did that there's

285
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:40,519
things that they're gonna have to

286
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:44,389
correct there's a ton of applications

287
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:45,620
and the markets gonna dictate itself

288
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:48,259
they're gonna see a lot of businesses

289
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,269
collapse until it levels off the taxes

290
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:52,309
were astronomical those are gonna have

291
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:55,088
to come down but we're seeing that in a

292
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:57,619
lot of localities I think Santa Cruz

293
00:11:55,089 --> 00:12:01,490
Santa Cruz is has a measure to reduce

294
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,990
their taxes and there's a there's a few

295
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,639
other localities that that are also

296
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,409
trying to reduce her taxes too because

297
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,480
they started a lot of them started at 8

298
00:12:06,409 --> 00:12:10,579
to 10% and it's just it's not

299
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,700
sustainable with an effective tax of

300
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,490
like 37 overall it's just it's

301
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:19,220
completely unreasonable

302
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:21,620
so what percentage of the companies that

303
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,450
two years ago we're operating in Oakland

304
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:27,580
do you think either have already moved

305
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:27,580
out or are desperately trying to get out

306
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:38,120
you know I can't like I can't say

307
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:39,379
honestly and I got like a lot a few what

308
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,169
what companies are trying to get out of

309
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:44,149
them like what percentage of like a lot

310
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:48,229
of companies have already left or some

311
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:51,350
have left but you know I have you left

312
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:56,029
yeah I did leave Sacramento has a lot

313
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:58,759
warmer waters trying to try to get

314
00:12:56,029 --> 00:13:00,439
better situated but I I hear all the

315
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:02,450
time companies getting ready to

316
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,600
Oakland are leaving Oakland or shutting

317
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:07,100
down so I would I would say that the

318
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,810
market is definitely gonna level out I

319
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,610
can't put a percentage on it but just

320
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:13,129
from the people I talked to I'd say in

321
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,899
the range of about 25% is it's getting

322
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:26,489
ready to leave or has already left

323
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:26,489
