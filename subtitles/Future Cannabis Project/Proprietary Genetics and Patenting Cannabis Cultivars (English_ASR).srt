[Music]

2
00:00:12,468 --> 00:00:17,608
see your grower yeah okay

3
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,368
so I'm actually really curious about

4
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:23,300
your thoughts what what are your

5
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:26,778
thoughts on proprietary genetics and

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:29,399
patenting things like cannabis cultivars

7
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:34,320
well I don't know very well how you go

8
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:36,689
about patenting a plant and naturally

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:42,149
the variance that we see in our crops

10
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:44,339
and even in fairly stable crops the the

11
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,460
speed in which we go through these

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,809
different varieties and and subsets of

13
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:55,410
these varieties that I don't I don't see

14
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:57,419
the viability of patenting a plant and

15
00:00:55,409 --> 00:00:59,099
what what do they mean when they say

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,609
patent to plant talking about patenting

17
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:07,049
a name patenting a strain a chemo type

18
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:09,210
what where where do you draw the line so

19
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:12,630
it's a good question and I can spend a

20
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:14,309
lot of time answering it I guess and I

21
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:16,649
will in a second but I think before I

22
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,420
get to like all the technical stuff I'm

23
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,189
curious as to your thoughts around

24
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,350
really because but there's really like a

25
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:25,169
higher level question on the table which

26
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:28,169
is like do you want like do you feel

27
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,759
like the things that you grow and that

28
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,109
you cultivate and more specifically that

29
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,519
you like that you breathe like let's say

30
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:34,469
do you breed something oh my god this is

31
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:36,478
like my very favorite this is like

32
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,030
Reynolds dream you know I mean it was my

33
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,640
Reynolds dream string and it's perfect

34
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:43,618
is that something that you would want to

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,870
get intellectual property protection for

36
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:47,030
is it something that

37
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:50,480
you know because you think it's new or

38
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:52,730
is it something that you want to just be

39
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,180
out and free and open and that kind of

40
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:55,430
thing

41
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:58,640
like what what are your if I definitely

42
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:01,010
think the latter I think of what uh what

43
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,019
I've been able to do because of the open

44
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,450
source nature of all the varieties that

45
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:08,000
I've grown that I've never had to

46
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,280
purchase intellectual property I've

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,560
never had maybe add there was a steep

48
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,919
entrance free fee at some point to get a

49
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,770
certain type of genetics but in general

50
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:22,419
it was it's historically been open

51
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:25,189
source we've given and and traded and

52
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:27,199
been fairly loose with our genetics and

53
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:29,000
that's how we've kind of proliferated it

54
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,089
and that's how we've gotten to where we

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,639
are and I see with people that are

56
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:38,900
coming in that they have great business

57
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:42,589
plans but they don't have a cultural

58
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,719
understanding they're not seeing the

59
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:49,939
what's happened in the last 40 or 45

60
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:52,489
years in the you know the undergrowth in

61
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:55,459
forests and in basements and closets

62
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:58,340
with people fearing the government while

63
00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:01,750
they pushed forward with this hybrid I

64
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:06,099
say the hybridization of this plant and

65
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:08,419
how we've come to a place with this

66
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:11,769
standard higher potency than we've seen

67
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:14,629
in the past potentially better taste and

68
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:17,450
we've done that out of a love for the

69
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:18,919
plant some of it higher yields and and

70
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:20,929
things of the nature of typically gone

71
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:22,429
with prohibition though there were

72
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,409
things that needed to be done for the

73
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,209
sake of prohibition but other than that

74
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:30,949
the majority of it was done for the love

75
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:33,709
of the plant and when we have people

76
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:37,339
coming in that want to monetize every

77
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:45,050
single aspect of it it's disheartening

78
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:47,150
and as far as what I want to protect not

79
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:50,270
much from people that share a similar

80
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:53,599
viewpoint but

81
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:56,180
from people that want to take my work

82
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,639
for free essentially and then turn

83
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,129
around and monetize it it's a hard pill

84
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,319
to swallow and I completely agree with

85
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:05,030
you like I should admit that I'm like

86
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:07,459
relatively new still to like the

87
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:10,159
cannabis industry I've been using

88
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:13,909
cannabis for 20 years and you know so

89
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,430
sure I'm well familiar and it seems like

90
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:19,639
I think that what's been the saddest

91
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:23,139
thing for me in the year of running open

92
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,849
cannabis project has been seeing this

93
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:28,129
influx of people that just like give no

94
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:31,879
about the community and about the

95
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:34,250
culture and the other thing that makes

96
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:35,839
me really sad and I don't this is maybe

97
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:38,300
more true in Oregon than it where you

98
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:40,609
base Humboldt you're on a humble okay

99
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,259
okay all right so then this will

100
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,790
probably hit close to home like it

101
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:46,000
really bums like I'm a rule follower

102
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:48,920
like I like fought like I like you know

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,930
dotting my eyes and crossing my T's and

104
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,259
making sure my is all lined up and

105
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:56,240
it really bums me out that because of

106
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:57,560
the way the like right but because of

107
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,730
the way that like the legislation and

108
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,740
all the regulations have rolled out

109
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:02,509
there are a lot of people who have

110
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,860
started to go jump through a bunch of

111
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:05,389
extra hoops because they believe in

112
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,189
legalization and they believe in like

113
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,500
getting this plant out there and they're

114
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:11,149
getting screwed financially you know

115
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,879
like that's something that like really

116
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:16,519
like gets my goat in a major way I'm

117
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:19,219
right there I'm very deep into this

118
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:22,069
process I spent a lot of money and I

119
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,570
mean forget invest investors or

120
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:26,089
investment capital I've never had a

121
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:30,259
credit card in my life I've done

122
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:34,099
everything from the the first flower to

123
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:37,730
the next to making it all work and when

124
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:39,379
you see 10 20 million dollar angel

125
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,480
investments come in to these companies

126
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:43,839
they can they can do things they can

127
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:47,330
make moves that your average person

128
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,579
can't totally and that's actually part

129
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:50,839
of my big issues with patents and - so

130
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:53,089
to get back to sort of your technical

131
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,549
question around like how do you even go

132
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:58,000
about patenting a patent you know like

133
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:01,840
you I mean

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,810
the the long and the short of it is you

135
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:07,029
need to prove you need to prove that you

136
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:08,530
invented something like just generally

137
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:10,869
speaking for kind of any invention of

138
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:12,429
which like new plants fall under it and

139
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,569
by the way I should always say like I'm

140
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,939
not a lawyer this is not legal advice

141
00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:17,500
you know always if you have legal

142
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:19,600
questions you should always consult your

143
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:23,290
lawyer sure working in your jurisdiction

144
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,629
of choice you know whatever but you know

145
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:28,240
there needs to be an invention and like

146
00:06:25,629 --> 00:06:30,339
proof of a mentorship and that invention

147
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,490
needs to be new enough and unique enough

148
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:36,310
and if it is then with the help of legal

149
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:38,860
counsel you can file for a patent and

150
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:41,649
get a patent and I think that what's

151
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,850
been and really ultimately there haven't

152
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:44,979
been very many patents have been issued

153
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:47,140
on plants like the vast majority of

154
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:51,060
patents that are out there are on like

155
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:53,769
like cannabinoids and uses and on

156
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,720
formulations and processing methods and

157
00:06:53,769 --> 00:06:56,918
some of them are really crazy like one

158
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,510
of the lawyers who we work with

159
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:01,180
Dale hunt just put out this thing called

160
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:03,099
MJ patents weekly dot-com and it shows

161
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,329
like all of the cannabis patents that

162
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,740
are being issued and all the

163
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:09,250
applications that are published in the

164
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,389
US and in Canada and internationally and

165
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,939
like the that people are patenting

166
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:13,839
it's crazy you know like but when it

167
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:16,089
come and that's like a whole other

168
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,649
tangent that we all should be looking at

169
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:19,329
and paying attention to because it has a

170
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:24,099
similar documentation problem as

171
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:25,478
cannabis but for patenting a plant like

172
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,280
you basically needs to like follow the

173
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:28,569
same rules of any other invention and I

174
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,149
think what's really problematic

175
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:33,659
especially for there's a family of

176
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:37,389
utility patents that have been issued on

177
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:39,220
plants with at least 3% CBD and a

178
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:41,829
certain terpene profile and it's not

179
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,050
just like this one cultivar it's like

180
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:46,300
any plant that fits this definition any

181
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:49,120
product made with us any new plants that

182
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,569
are bred with it and you know I have a

183
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,848
major problem with

184
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:54,139
patents in part because you know they

185
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,878
were issued at a time where there was

186
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:58,009
very little documentation about the

187
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,539
plants and of course there's very little

188
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:01,968
documentation about the plants because

189
00:07:59,538 --> 00:08:04,338
it's still federally illegal you know

190
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:06,618
naming and so and the way that you get

191
00:08:04,338 --> 00:08:09,499
that is you have to have money you have

192
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:10,339
to have capital and like farmers don't

193
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:12,528
have it

194
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:14,088
you wanna mean by and large you know and

195
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:16,550
like if we wanted to fight back against

196
00:08:14,088 --> 00:08:17,959
that we'd have to like work together and

197
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,848
come up with like some crazy awesome

198
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:21,499
legal strategy which you know I'm

199
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:24,618
interested in talking to people about

200
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:26,659
but yeah anyway so that's kind of the

201
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:30,020
deal with a lot of the patents that are

202
00:08:26,658 --> 00:08:32,958
out there so what was your initial

203
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:36,129
starting point or the catalyst for this

204
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:39,439
open cannabis project even working on so

205
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:42,259
the project was actually started in 2015

206
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,880
by mouth Lee Holmes if I was bioscience

207
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:47,149
okay yeah

208
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:50,208
and Jeremy plum and I was brought on

209
00:08:47,149 --> 00:08:53,419
just about just over a year ago to help

210
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:57,049
basically to make open cannabis project

211
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:59,149
its own nonprofit in part because the I

212
00:08:57,049 --> 00:09:01,159
think that like FiOS was getting some

213
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:03,110
flack from people about asking them for

214
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:04,429
data and they're like wait a second

215
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,600
you're Jetix lab like we'd want to share

216
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:06,620
data with you and they're like oh wait

217
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,389
it's nonprofit wait it should be

218
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,889
separate from us and so they hired me

219
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:11,539
initially to separate it

220
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:13,370
I believe in open information and I

221
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:15,980
believe in open data and I believe that

222
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:18,318
we should have transparency in this

223
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:22,220
space in particular because you know

224
00:09:18,318 --> 00:09:23,509
both both patent law and intellectual

225
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,000
property law and intellectual property

226
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:29,028
law around plants which are different by

227
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,740
country and you know like have different

228
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:33,980
governing bodies and all kinds of things

229
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,568
like that is one area of knowledge that

230
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:37,699
has been that is for the most part

231
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:39,049
pretty opaque to people you know didn't

232
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:40,669
mean it takes a lot of digging to really

233
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:42,469
get in there and I think for cannabis

234
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:44,028
because of the underground nature of it

235
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,939
it's also something that's been

236
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:48,139
completely like you know opaque to a lot

237
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:49,259
of people and so there's this

238
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:51,149
opportunity

239
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:54,299
like bringing information into the fold

240
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:56,220
and if nothing else helps to bring

241
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:58,709
clarity around like what is out there

242
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,029
and then for people to give people the

243
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:01,950
option to ask the questions like okay I

244
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:04,740
really want to develop something that is

245
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,420
new and unique like what is really new

246
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,000
and unique here and I mean like it's

247
00:10:06,419 --> 00:10:12,289
anyway I think it's really fascinating I

248
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
think when we look at these these

249
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:19,860
multi-generational hybrids of hybrids

250
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:23,340
where do we start drawing the line when

251
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:25,200
you are simply crossing and you the the

252
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,170
breeder may be doing their due diligence

253
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:32,210
as far as producing a stable genetic

254
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:35,389
line but still they they took two

255
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:37,680
varieties and cross them together and

256
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:40,500
typically at this point in the game

257
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,329
those two varieties were a cross of two

258
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,649
other varieties and so on and so on and

259
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:48,480
we go back to what people call land race

260
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:50,970
trains are really what inbred lines

261
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,190
because they were cultivated in these

262
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:57,600
regions of the world it's not wild

263
00:10:53,190 --> 00:11:00,060
product and at what point if people stop

264
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,670
getting credit is it like whoever cares

265
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:04,349
to get the credit gets the credit and

266
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:07,469
that's really interesting because that's

267
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:09,840
like a place where like plant biology

268
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:11,250
and open source like kind of diverged

269
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,470
right because in like open source

270
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,120
software and open and open source like

271
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,500
anything which really falls more under

272
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,450
typically really comes out of like

273
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,879
copyright law you know like there's an

274
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:23,490
automatic authorship like if you like

275
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,200
you know like make a postcard like you

276
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,750
know like you get to have copyright over

277
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,129
that postcard right sure so and like if

278
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,870
you want to open source it then you can

279
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:32,610
say like okay anybody can use this with

280
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,840
attribution as long as you know they say

281
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,430
like hey Reynold make this make this

282
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,440
postcard like you can use it for free

283
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:39,389
and you can't do that with plants like

284
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,090
you know what I mean like you can't like

285
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:44,399
have like so I don't know where they

286
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,780
tilt draw the line you know naming and I

287
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,879
feel like there's not really a great

288
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:50,250
answer to that question because the

289
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:55,100
lines have been blurred so many times to

290
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:57,470
me it seems like you know maybe

291
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,620
you shouldn't be able to patent these

292
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:02,029
plants but at the same time the law says

293
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:06,139
something different and so that's where

294
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:08,839
things get really tricky right and and I

295
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:11,539
think it goes down to for a lot of

296
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,160
people that I know that that do their

297
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:18,709
own breeding at whatever level they do

298
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:21,350
it for the most part it's not financial

299
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:26,389
in terms of what they want its

300
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:31,639
recognition that they they did something

301
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:33,649
that is popular now and I think a lot of

302
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:36,139
those same people it's it's more the

303
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:40,970
issue they take of somebody else making

304
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:44,330
money off of this work that they take

305
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:47,570
they take issue with and how much of

306
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,670
that comes down to the actual variety or

307
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,910
the cross involved how much of it comes

308
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:55,699
down to the naming of that product and I

309
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:57,409
mean I think that there's other there's

310
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,500
other businesses that we can look to

311
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:02,659
that that deal with this the difference

312
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,039
between the product itself and the name

313
00:13:02,659 --> 00:13:08,149
that's put on it

314
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:10,759
Oh totally yeah and so we're we're these

315
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:11,629
and what I think a lot of people coming

316
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:15,980
from the outside world

317
00:13:11,629 --> 00:13:19,149
think of must be nicknames because we

318
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:23,170
know some of the names are these flowers

319
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:26,509
that those are the actual name of that

320
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:28,729
variety and there isn't something you

321
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:33,819
know more scientific there's no Latin

322
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:37,940
version of it to go back to and

323
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:40,340
subsequently how tied is that name to

324
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,910
that variety and how truly unique is

325
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:45,139
that variety and could the majority of

326
00:13:42,909 --> 00:13:47,779
consumers of the product tell the

327
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:50,899
difference between that variety with

328
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:53,689
that name and a very similar parental

329
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:55,850
cross right that goes under a different

330
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:59,060
moniker totally and then what about like

331
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:02,090
growing so what about growing like the

332
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:02,839
same like a clone of the same variety

333
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,790
but

334
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,769
two different farms under two different

335
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:08,360
methods new what I mean is that the same

336
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:10,429
variety or is it something new now

337
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,629
because it's chemical outputs are

338
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:14,029
different because they've been grown

339
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:16,970
differently absolutely I mean I think

340
00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:20,149
even taking it further to to outdoor

341
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:24,879
versus indoor something like that that I

342
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:28,039
see greater differences in the same

343
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:31,820
clone grown under different

344
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:33,860
environmental conditions and maybe the

345
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,600
same basic type of growing indoor

346
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,330
greenhouse outdoor but in different

347
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,149
environments with the different

348
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:44,600
nutritional inputs then I do often

349
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:47,590
between two different varieties that are

350
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,810
similar but are produced in the same

351
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,340
environmental factor and great and I

352
00:14:50,809 --> 00:14:54,019
think that's interesting I think it's

353
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,610
really interesting too and part of what

354
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:59,210
I think is really interesting about that

355
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:01,279
is that the way that patents work and

356
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:04,850
even plant variety protection work is in

357
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:07,039
the u.s. specifically internationally

358
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,899
it's a whole different ballgame that I'm

359
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:12,379
only beginning to really wrap my head

360
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:14,120
around but we don't really take growing

361
00:15:12,379 --> 00:15:16,039
method into account like that's kind of

362
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,289
like brushed aside as a trade secret but

363
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:20,929
for cannabis that's like part of the

364
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:22,279
magic and I wonder like one of the

365
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:24,319
things I think about all the time is

366
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:26,000
like could we as a community create like

367
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,370
an alternative an alternative

368
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,500
intellectual property system that was

369
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,730
really based on that also had legal

370
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,730
teeth right because we can come up with

371
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,830
all kinds of but if like like the

372
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,570
USPTO and the feds don't look at it that

373
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:41,960
it's kind of like we were kind of

374
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:43,879
wasting our time so but what if we had a

375
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,830
system that was similar to you know like

376
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:47,360
Appalachians or something like that I

377
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:48,860
know that the Mendocino Appalachians

378
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,240
project is working on this and I cannot

379
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,800
wait to talk to them about it but like

380
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,759
what if we had a system that was really

381
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:57,589
like okay there is the the cultivator

382
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,450
and the cultivation method right like

383
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:02,450
the farm

384
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:05,600
the environment plus like the genetic

385
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,730
variety whatever equals the output and

386
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,399
that output and like that whole process

387
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:14,360
is taken into account as an intellectual

388
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,789
property thing absolutely right but then

389
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,850
like would that be up I mean I don't

390
00:16:16,789 --> 00:16:21,169
feel like because the community is so

391
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:22,670
like based on open source like it

392
00:16:21,169 --> 00:16:24,139
doesn't feel like a patent doesn't think

393
00:16:22,669 --> 00:16:25,759
it seemed like the right thing and a

394
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:27,740
plant variety protection isn't the right

395
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,850
thing so like I don't know I don't know

396
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,830
what the right answer is I don't know

397
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:35,450
what that thing is but it's something I

398
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:37,400
probably think about I see that and when

399
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:41,990
I look at some of my methodology and

400
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:44,559
some of the the the modifications I've

401
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:47,629
made over the years to make my product

402
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:50,659
superior at least to what I've done in

403
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:53,360
the past I'm not sure at what point

404
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:58,089
whether I really came up with that where

405
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:00,019
I got it from and to try and claim that

406
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:02,750
that's mine

407
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:04,849
it's a little bit of a stretch but I can

408
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:08,140
fairly safely say the way that I've

409
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:11,449
compiled these pieces of information

410
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:14,210
does make it to some degree mine and

411
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:17,150
I've not come across anyone that does it

412
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:19,370
exactly like I do just like any other

413
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:23,440
farmer that I come across we all follow

414
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:25,939
some basic with similar paths but

415
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,920
because we do have these different

416
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:31,850
approaches we come out with different

417
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:33,380
flowers in the end and like something I

418
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:35,719
kind of like to throw out to people is

419
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,510
that it's an easy plant to grow and it's

420
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,460
a difficult plant to grow well and the

421
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:45,049
difference I grow other things besides

422
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:46,910
cannabis and I've yet to see a terrible

423
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:49,129
amount of difference between zucchinis

424
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:54,410
that I grow from one season to the next

425
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:56,180
or sieved versus a start in different

426
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:58,460
locations that I've grown it or whatever

427
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:02,299
you want to throw in it seems to carry

428
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:06,200
more similarity and with this plant I

429
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:07,569
see such great differences with fairly

430
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,049
my new

431
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:13,089
weeks 2:02 a recipe totally and from

432
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:16,539
what I understand and I'm also not a

433
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:18,279
botanist like it seems like the the

434
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:21,309
heterozygous nature and then the

435
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:24,970
hybridization of cannabis is part of why

436
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:26,710
it is so like you know there's a stable

437
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,970
seed lines are possible you know I mean

438
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,360
it's not like you can't make a stable

439
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:34,000
seed line but most of them are buried

440
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:35,740
within their seat line sure that's

441
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,109
correct I mean and I think most of these

442
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:41,230
words that would be thrown thrown around

443
00:18:38,109 --> 00:18:43,240
are very subjective right and stable is

444
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,880
one that we throw around and what is

445
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:48,099
stable really what is stable mean to the

446
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:52,120
grower or what a stable mean to the

447
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:53,980
breeder and I think there's two big big

448
00:18:52,119 --> 00:19:00,159
points that I bring up as far as

449
00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:01,960
stability one is how similar is one seed

450
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,550
to another when they grow up to be a

451
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:09,420
plant and the almost at this point the

452
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:12,339
more important thing is what is its

453
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:14,830
tendency towards turning hermaphrodite

454
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:16,899
that's become a huge thing and that's a

455
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:19,509
lot of what the word stability is being

456
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:22,600
thrown around these days when we talk

457
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:26,980
about stability we ask it does it have a

458
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:28,929
propensity to be a hermaphrodite and so

459
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,789
those are kind of like two very

460
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,799
different things but we're using a word

461
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:34,869
like stability so then you could see how

462
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,369
you going down the line it becomes a

463
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:38,229
little bit confusing when somebody says

464
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:40,539
is this stable I never thought that I

465
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,460
would spend have any desire to like go

466
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:44,230
and look at the word stable in terms of

467
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,549
like legal documentation but now I

468
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,250
really am wondering I'm like okay like

469
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:49,569
like what is and I think I've actually

470
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,130
seen this written I can't remember what

471
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:53,919
it is but it would be interesting to

472
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:55,210
compare like the definitions of stable

473
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:58,690
like you're talking about with like the

474
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:01,240
definitions of stable that the that the

475
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,350
plant variety protection office uses you

476
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,720
know anything they're talking about

477
00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:08,799
stability there's so many words like

478
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:13,299
this and at least in in my in my world

479
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:15,309
in the cannabis world that have you know

480
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:16,990
kind of been maybe not hijacked but

481
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:18,220
certainly taken by the cannabis

482
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,589
community and

483
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:23,288
sometimes used correctly or aptly and

484
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:26,709
other times misappropriated I was

485
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:30,369
talking with with the geneticist and a

486
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:32,788
biologist a couple of weeks ago and we

487
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:36,038
got onto the topic of genetic drift and

488
00:20:32,788 --> 00:20:39,460
he said is that what is genetic drift

489
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:41,349
well if you were to talk to a biologist

490
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,269
they're gonna have one viewpoint on what

491
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:44,769
genetic drift means and then if you talk

492
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:48,400
to the majority of the cannabis

493
00:20:44,769 --> 00:20:50,859
community and what they have co-opted

494
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,860
that word or that phrase to mean it's

495
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:57,308
gonna be two different things in the

496
00:20:53,859 --> 00:21:01,509
growers cannabis growers world genetic

497
00:20:57,308 --> 00:21:03,399
drift seems to predominantly apply to

498
00:21:01,509 --> 00:21:05,679
people talking about their mother stock

499
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,650
and seeing that over time they take

500
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,530
clones off of this same mother stock and

501
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:13,630
they have a typically a degradation but

502
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:15,908
at least a shift that the plants aren't

503
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:20,919
coming out the same as they did in the

504
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:24,190
past and I was asking him is is that

505
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:25,960
possible and he said that he didn't see

506
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,279
how that would be possible especially in

507
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,019
the timeframe that most people are

508
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:32,319
talking about two years three years four

509
00:21:29,019 --> 00:21:35,019
years and that the reality would have

510
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:37,480
way more to do with my hypothesis to him

511
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:41,589
was the reality would have more to do

512
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,720
with the the mismanagement and not

513
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:46,599
properly taking care of that mother

514
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,450
stock and it getting sick and maybe it

515
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:52,899
rebounding but that it never been the

516
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:55,269
same and the important part of it was

517
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:58,480
him being so shocked by the way that we

518
00:21:55,269 --> 00:22:01,089
use the word genetic drift because he

519
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,880
said that's not accurate and so I see

520
00:22:01,089 --> 00:22:06,849
this over and over again in these words

521
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:09,940
in the way that we communicate here in

522
00:22:06,849 --> 00:22:12,609
the community that that doesn't always

523
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,019
line up I mean that has to do so much

524
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:15,879
with the underground nature and not

525
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:17,500
being able to like have access to decent

526
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,570
research for so long right and to like

527
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,679
really participate in it along those

528
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:22,509
lines like there's this like whole

529
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:24,340
debate around like

530
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:26,109
it's not really don't really feel like

531
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:28,389
it's a baby like the strong feelings

532
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:31,058
around like they used the word strain

533
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:34,240
versus the use of the word like cultivar

534
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:38,319
or every team of our yeah yeah exactly

535
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,880
and so like and I and I like you know as

536
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,409
somebody who likes to be technically

537
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,000
correct of course I mean I want to use

538
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:44,529
like cultivar whenever possible all

539
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,440
because like that's technically correct

540
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:51,339
and also I feel like there's like some

541
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,048
validity to the vernacular that has come

542
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:54,668
through the cannabis industry that kind

543
00:22:53,048 --> 00:22:56,440
of like needs to be addressed like I

544
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:59,110
don't like I think it feels shitty for

545
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,570
me to be like no I'm sorry you can't use

546
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:04,750
the word strain anymore hi I'm new and I

547
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:06,250
know science so you know like what's the

548
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,419
bet like how do you address that and

549
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:14,109
what do you think is the best way for us

550
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:16,330
to address that as a community I I'm not

551
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:19,839
a fan of people correcting correcting

552
00:23:16,329 --> 00:23:23,199
other people but at the same time that a

553
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:25,480
certain base level understanding of what

554
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,669
we're talking about is important so when

555
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,620
people go into a conversation that

556
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:31,419
they're able to convey themselves well

557
00:23:29,619 --> 00:23:37,839
enough that the other person understands

558
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:39,880
and I I find myself kind of going back

559
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:44,529
and forth between the two different

560
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:46,150
worlds and I don't know so I picked up

561
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:47,558
from somebody I forget where and they

562
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:50,169
were like strain is in reference to

563
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:52,210
bacteria and before that I had never

564
00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:55,480
cared and after that I was kind of like

565
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:59,048
oh that kind of put a distaste in my

566
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:03,690
mouth so I find that kind of funny what

567
00:23:59,048 --> 00:24:06,369
companies in the industry are looking

568
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:08,320
towards open source as as the way

569
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:13,178
forward versus people that are looking

570
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:16,509
towards more proprietary nature to their

571
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:18,550
business and patenting

572
00:24:16,509 --> 00:24:21,129
the various varieties with regards to

573
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:23,649
genetics yes that's a really good

574
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:28,000
question I actually don't know that many

575
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:29,650
companies that are like openly on board

576
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,480
with open-source but that's actually

577
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,340
something that we're hoping hoping to do

578
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,319
at open campus cannabis project next

579
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:37,269
year is to create a program that gets

580
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:39,939
people kind of like on board is like a

581
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:42,250
membership to be like we're about open

582
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:43,600
science and open data they have like

583
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,740
some similar things in the psychedelic

584
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:47,740
community that I think would be really

585
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:51,099
good fits for our community in terms of

586
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:54,789
the people who either have patents or

587
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:58,000
seeking patents there is one in the

588
00:24:54,789 --> 00:25:00,549
United States there is one man named I

589
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,140
think it's Steven Covey and he has a

590
00:25:00,549 --> 00:25:06,849
plant patent which is actually a very

591
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:09,580
narrow patent on a cannabis plant called

592
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:11,889
ecuadorian sativa that apparently

593
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:17,199
produces something like 45% limonene by

594
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:19,960
weight there is there is a patent family

595
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,680
issued to a company called the biotech

596
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,779
institute LLC and those are some of the

597
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:31,420
broader utility patents that i mentioned

598
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:33,220
earlier they have a narrow version of

599
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:35,980
their patent family that also just got

600
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:39,250
recently accepted in canada and biotech

601
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:43,240
institute LLC is associated with nei Pro

602
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:45,819
and I believe fight X but biotech

603
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:48,759
Institute is the name on the patent and

604
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:51,460
then the most recent thing I heard is

605
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:55,200
that there is apparently stem holdings

606
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:59,650
is looking to get a utility patent on

607
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:02,140
genetics for cannabis plants that do

608
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:04,730
something with treatment of epilepsy so

609
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:07,120
that's as far as I know

610
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:09,200
at least in the United States elsewhere

611
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:11,409
there was so much more research to be

612
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,410
done

613
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,849
