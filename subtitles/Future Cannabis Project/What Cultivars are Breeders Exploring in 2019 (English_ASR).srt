1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,779
you're all working on interesting stuff

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:05,849
and I know some of the work you're doing

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:08,580
all three you but you're always

4
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:10,230
constantly refining in switching process

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,210
with something you excited about this

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,888
year you know whether it whether it's

7
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,240
for the market or not but like what's

8
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,320
something you're into yourself that

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,660
you're working with you'd like to see

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:25,050
people access in any form gosh

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,509
so many things but I want to say on what

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:32,070
Jason had brought up and what me and

13
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:36,450
gene brought up Beth did you speak this

14
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:40,920
weekend Beth Schecter hi okay so the

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:44,030
open cannabis project looks to protect

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,070
the cultivar the strains that we're all

17
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,859
you know we've known and loved for a

18
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,198
long time and and hopefully combinations

19
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,198
of all of them so that we can all keep

20
00:00:52,198 --> 00:00:57,448
doing the work that we've been doing

21
00:00:54,198 --> 00:01:00,179
breeding and cultivating and it's a

22
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:03,599
nonprofit organization and there's

23
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:08,129
definitely gonna be some big bad Wolf's

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,019
come in to get genetics and it's really

25
00:01:08,129 --> 00:01:12,209
hard that what do you do you hide them

26
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,158
away like don't give them away

27
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:17,339
you know don't come to an event like

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,409
this and and say here have a few of this

29
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,728
and a few of that because you know maybe

30
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,790
there's somebody in the room or

31
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:29,069
something you it's almost impossible and

32
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:31,079
so we just got a kind of support and

33
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:36,508
organization like that is really the

34
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:41,008
best way that we can keep cannabis open

35
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:44,489
source and keep like the genetics of

36
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:47,670
cannabis accessible to everybody because

37
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:51,449
the Syngenta's and the Monsanto's would

38
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,920
like to you know just tie up all these

39
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,129
strains and of course there's this

40
00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:00,210
phenomena that's unusual where something

41
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:03,328
has been in under prohibition for you

42
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:06,929
know since in all of modern times that

43
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:10,618
has been basically illegal so you know

44
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,390
any innovation that has happened has not

45
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:15,960
been documented

46
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:17,309
because you know it's like at Humboldt C

47
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,140
company we keep

48
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,150
freaking notes during the breeding

49
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:23,609
season and then burn them in the fall

50
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,800
because it was like you know I'm not

51
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,870
trying to keep notes around about you

52
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,920
know how many goddamn plants I had and

53
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,430
you know so charge enhancement back in

54
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,289
the day

55
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,760
what's that charge enhancement you know

56
00:02:34,289 --> 00:02:37,560
it's although you were in the game

57
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,959
I caught an extra couple years on a case

58
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,090
I had to fight because I had

59
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,949
spreadsheets comparing operations and it

60
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,209
gave me a criminal mastermind charge and

61
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:47,208
we all laughed and I said if I was so

62
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,459
smart I wouldn't got fucking caught but

63
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:52,080
no nonetheless the enhancement was

64
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,390
really punishing because I was using

65
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,550
tools to document work those it was

66
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:58,349
impossible to keep this much data when

67
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:00,090
you're running this many operations and

68
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:02,639
I had my hand and a lot of cookie jaws

69
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:06,209
way back in the day yeah you know and so

70
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:09,389
you know those those folks that look to

71
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:13,080
capitalize so much could easily come in

72
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:14,699
and and try to you know to say that

73
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,480
they've created something that's new

74
00:03:14,699 --> 00:03:21,659
when really me and jeans been breeding

75
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,909
it for 20 goddamn years and you know so

76
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:25,849
on and so forth so that's a good

77
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:29,759
organization to support I really

78
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:34,769
appreciate what Beth's done and you know

79
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:37,079
as far as some exciting stuff that we're

80
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:40,289
doing I think you know really that big

81
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:46,320
phenotype on effort was exciting for me

82
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:51,899
and what else are you gonna release the

83
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:55,739
product this year dropping the sort of

84
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,810
selected cuts like Daniels farm we

85
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:01,170
picked one that we're calling magic

86
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:05,219
melon and that one just really smells

87
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:10,679
like melons and it's kind of gassy fuel

88
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:15,620
finish but yeah I don't know I just I

89
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:19,730
feel really just happy to be able to

90
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:23,680
work on in cannabis and share

91
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:27,800
share the the genetics and and

92
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,870
definitely like what it did I got an

93
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,840
email the other day and I looked at the

94
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:37,959
email and I thought it was kind of

95
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:40,879
weirded it said Burpee in the email and

96
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:43,039
so I replied to the email and did some

97
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:46,339
fishing and sure enough it was Burpee

98
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,379
and I don't really I don't know like are

99
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:50,329
they big bad wolf or not I mean I don't

100
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:53,149
I didn't follow the corporate ladder all

101
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:57,800
the way out but that's the kind of stuff

102
00:04:53,149 --> 00:05:00,560
that's happening so definitely be

103
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:05,629
careful but you just gotta we we got to

104
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:09,680
keep charging forward and so exciting

105
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:14,259
things just breeding more and more all

106
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,670
the time and and we're doing some

107
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:20,689
genotyping and putting it in the public

108
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:24,530
space so that's a way that you can once

109
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:29,990
you do that if you don't patent it in a

110
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:34,789
year then it becomes public public

111
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:39,560
domain and so that's what I would call

112
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:44,090
defensive IP versus offensive IP which

113
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:46,370
is getting a patent and you know sending

114
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:48,679
out cease and desist letters to

115
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:52,100
everybody in the room who doesn't pay

116
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,220
you a fee for for growing it or whatever

117
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,140
and I think that there's you know I'm

118
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:00,890
not saying I'm completely opposed to

119
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:08,289
patents but I think definitely that it's

120
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:10,550
it's a slippery slope and so you know

121
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:14,210
there's a lot of things out there that

122
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:15,889
just are that should just be public

123
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:19,489
domain I mean if I could just take a

124
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:22,339
snapshot of the whole cannabis space

125
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,439
right now and make sure that that could

126
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:26,239
continue to be the way it is and people

127
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:29,810
could continue to grow the plant I think

128
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,619
that would be a good thing to do but

129
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,918
it's cost

130
00:06:31,619 --> 00:06:36,929
cost a lot of money to genotype so you

131
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:38,908
know that and and that's not the only

132
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:39,568
solution - there's other ways to go

133
00:06:38,908 --> 00:06:46,668
about it

134
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:46,669
but yeah so that's that's exciting

135
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:53,489
I don't do min gloom you know no but

136
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:55,348
what the thing is though it's hard

137
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:58,378
they're all in the real everyone in the

138
00:06:55,348 --> 00:07:00,149
room is in the real yeah and and a lot

139
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:01,679
of it is the struggle because that's so

140
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:04,319
much the reality of what you're having

141
00:07:01,678 --> 00:07:06,838
to deal with and what I wanted what I

142
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,718
want to make sure though is that the

143
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:11,639
things that you see and that interests

144
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:14,069
you because see you guys are your the

145
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,038
painters that create the the ink that we

146
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:18,539
use to do our work and so you know you

147
00:07:17,038 --> 00:07:19,798
see you broke out the melon and so the

148
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:20,998
thing was he said hey know what we found

149
00:07:19,798 --> 00:07:23,098
was something that was unbelievably

150
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:24,899
Melanie with the beautiful fuel back and

151
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:26,848
we think it would be attractive and it

152
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:28,829
would be valuable for the market and and

153
00:07:26,848 --> 00:07:31,558
that's that's what I'm seeking from it

154
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:33,959
and and the part about us all struggling

155
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:35,338
is as real as it can be and and I try to

156
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:37,319
make light of it cuz otherwise you go

157
00:07:35,338 --> 00:07:42,468
i'ma cry and you know and tissue paper

158
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:44,968
is expensive so what about you big Jane

159
00:07:42,468 --> 00:07:46,558
what you messing around what direction

160
00:07:44,968 --> 00:07:48,449
do you go with your lines cuz you you

161
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:50,459
work some some lines that you've had for

162
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:52,259
a long time but you switch the direction

163
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:55,079
on them and it's kind of neat because it

164
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:57,749
lets you swing a picture yeah I mean

165
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:02,780
what I'd really like to do is do I'll do

166
00:07:57,749 --> 00:08:03,949
the I'll do those fresh hybrids and then

167
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:06,388
[Music]

168
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:08,639
try to go through and seed a lot of

169
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:10,379
plants every time I do anything so then

170
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,528
I think you can go in all these

171
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:15,749
different directions so when you make

172
00:08:13,528 --> 00:08:17,788
that that fresh hybrid you get you know

173
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:20,999
if stuff is if stuff is fairly

174
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:24,538
consistent you start with then you you

175
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:25,889
get a pretty you get a pretty it's

176
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:27,389
pretty predictable to know what you're

177
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:29,158
gonna get but then when you make that f2

178
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,329
you get all the weirdness and then when

179
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:32,278
you go when you get all the weirdness

180
00:08:30,329 --> 00:08:33,629
then that's where you can really you

181
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:38,038
know make one thing into a million

182
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:40,229
things you know so with with some of

183
00:08:38,038 --> 00:08:41,729
them I've tried to take them different

184
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,740
directions and then some of them is just

185
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:47,340
a real clear direction

186
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,680
like this year I'm really trying to work

187
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:52,379
on like the root beer stuff that's

188
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:56,129
really cool because it's it's a trip

189
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:57,840
like with doing seeds there's a whole

190
00:08:56,129 --> 00:08:59,669
lot of seeds that are really interesting

191
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,910
and they're and they're awesome and like

192
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:04,740
they all are you know really valid in

193
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:06,629
the space as far as going okay we need

194
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,340
to have all these things but it's really

195
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:10,889
a trip because when you go to actually

196
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:13,920
sell a lot of weed it kind of has to

197
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:16,319
look a certain way it has to have you

198
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,509
know there has to be something about it

199
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,730
where it's like okay that's shiny that

200
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:23,580
has people really like a little color to

201
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:26,190
it as to at least have a silver look if

202
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,110
not dark or purple or blue or red or

203
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,540
whatever you know regular green but

204
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,759
better be really tasty and really stinky

205
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:34,889
to be able to compete you know so like

206
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:37,710
the root beer is a cool one because of

207
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:38,970
the the way it smokes the way it grows

208
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,940
all that stuff so this year I'm trying

209
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:44,790
to do like a back cross to that clone

210
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:49,770
twice and the original male I started

211
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:51,569
with was almost the same thing so it was

212
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:53,220
already pretty consistent right away and

213
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,520
then going back to it a couple times

214
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:59,220
made it made it really nice and then

215
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,679
what I'm gonna try to do with that is um

216
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,090
I'll probably go back one more time to

217
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,729
the root beer clone to make it so that

218
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,230
it's like really root beer seed because

219
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,730
it has got more and more frequent when

220
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,310
you backcross not everything does that

221
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,930
if it's too inconsistent throws too much

222
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:14,939
weird stuff you know but it comes

223
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:17,339
through so it dominates in the crosses

224
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:18,840
and and then but I think what I'm gonna

225
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,910
do while it's still just a little more

226
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,950
open at the at the at the two back

227
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:26,100
crosses I'm probably gonna do a bunch of

228
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:28,170
out crosses of it this year and then do

229
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,279
the same thing with the cherry limeade

230
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:33,539
and the reason being that when you get

231
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:35,039
like if you go to get clones from

232
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:37,799
somebody you know how it is it's like

233
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,509
you have to everything's cool to have

234
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:40,859
some like okay I'm gonna have some of

235
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:42,899
this I'm gonna have some of that but

236
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,300
when people like want units and weight

237
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,980
of something you have to be able to have

238
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:48,889
something that people look at and even

239
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,000
if they don't know the name its

240
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:52,230
recognizably what they is in their

241
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,240
paradigm of what's

242
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,490
dank some of the best weed might look

243
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,110
like shoelaces and be all messed up and

244
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,779
look like dr. green spoon or something

245
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,639
you know but when you when you really

246
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:05,399
want something that you can have in your

247
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,559
bag to people go okay you you just want

248
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,709
that instant yep there it is

249
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:14,789
and so those are things that do that you

250
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:18,930
open the bag you I want that so like I'm

251
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:20,789
trying to do that because when you you

252
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:22,529
know you want to have plants that grow

253
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:23,909
well for you as a farmer and then you

254
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:26,399
need a product that's really gonna be

255
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:27,719
that thing and that's the whole thing I

256
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,939
was talking about with like with brand

257
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,000
recognitions like people go oh a type a

258
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,760
type of type it's like will hype hype

259
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,440
doesn't last so like I remember when

260
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,539
cookies came out it was like that's hype

261
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,580
it's not good it's like well maybe it's

262
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:45,269
not as good as it's not as strongest

263
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:48,540
headband or cam or whatever is your

264
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:51,329
thing but you're you know it's like if

265
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:53,879
if it was just hype it wouldn't be here

266
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:55,650
ten years after I got it it's still here

267
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,629
and all the crosses are still that and

268
00:11:55,649 --> 00:12:00,959
when you really get into it you go okay

269
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:02,820
this is cool stuff and but the reason

270
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:04,379
why it's valuable to grow it is because

271
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,780
you know when you finish it you can sell

272
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:08,399
it like if you're a tomato farmer you

273
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:10,709
know most people are gonna wind up like

274
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,990
okay this one has shelf life it's good

275
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:14,820
boom we're gonna grow these Roma's we

276
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:16,919
want to grow these really cool air loom

277
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,200
rainbow tomatoes but when you go in the

278
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:21,839
stores only a little bit of those the

279
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,310
over here you got this whole tier of

280
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,200
these Roma's over here what our

281
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:28,169
beefsteak so ever so we're gonna grow

282
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,910
those so you need things to fit in

283
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:32,189
people's paradigms so I'm trying to put

284
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:34,019
out some stuff that's really like people

285
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,060
go oh it's the hype stuff oh it's just

286
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,129
it's another gelato cross it's this or

287
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:39,959
it's that but it's a trip because if you

288
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:41,700
don't have something that people on a

289
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,350
knee-jerk reaction will look at and go

290
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,810
that's the stuff that's what everybody

291
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:48,450
wants then or do you really want to have

292
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:49,739
350 pounds of it and you you wanna you

293
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,960
want to have a quarter pound for your

294
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,730
head or whatever to share and you know

295
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,009
maybe you got somebody who wants this or

296
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,539
that but you know I'm just trying to

297
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:59,490
really make sure that like the stuff

298
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:01,949
that I'm putting out is stuff that when

299
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,690
you're done with it it's what people

300
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,700
come back that's like this last stuff I

301
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:08,160
released was like I had that peen

302
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:11,040
the pina a lot of times a CVD plant but

303
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:14,039
it's super Hardy its structures great it

304
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,689
does will not get p.m. it's like so easy

305
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:17,339
in such a great you know you could

306
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:19,470
probably dry farm and I haven't tried

307
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,780
but I have seen my buddy leave the Pina

308
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:24,389
across cherries that I made in some

309
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:27,419
three gallon pots basically in a in a

310
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:29,669
desert in a in a greenhouse that wasn't

311
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:31,620
being grown in so it was like a hundred

312
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:33,719
and thirty degree desert in there every

313
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,789
day and the plants he watered him when

314
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,259
they were starts they never grew but

315
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:38,759
then they butted and they finished and

316
00:13:37,259 --> 00:13:41,490
there was this killer weed in there that

317
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:44,490
we basically found going to his house

318
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,440
and I was like well that's got value to

319
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,389
you know but but it's weed that when

320
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,000
people you know it originally I was like

321
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:52,649
it's CBD people only want Kush I'd have

322
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,029
a little bit of it people would show up

323
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:56,220
and they'd be like no we want more of

324
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:58,409
those we want that one so that's you

325
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,509
know something try and trying to put

326
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:03,240
stuff out that's actually like can

327
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:04,799
really be practical for people that are

328
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,570
farming it's like the sky cuddler Kush

329
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,859
like that's in the conus favorite weed

330
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:10,200
you know it's like got the knee jerk

331
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:13,649
okay this is cool I understand that it

332
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:16,290
smells gas eats but as a grower - it's

333
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:18,179
really performing you know so that's

334
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:22,559
just the focus of like the stuff that

335
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:25,049
I'm working on in general is to be like

336
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,909
that like I love the lime and the lime

337
00:14:25,049 --> 00:14:29,189
is great but the lime is a little bit

338
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:31,469
more it's a little more leafy when you

339
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,120
grow it it's so I'm trying to work it

340
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,769
into a little bit more different stuff

341
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,139
so that's like cross it back with a og

342
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:38,759
keeps the nose gets a little meat on the

343
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,830
bones that's what the lime pop cush is

344
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:44,490
you get the huge plants of your own big

345
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:45,840
plants so I've been working on that but

346
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:49,039
then I made like I took like the cherry

347
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:51,060
limeade f5 and I put it on gelato herb

348
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,649
you know things that you're like oh

349
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:54,929
that's a stupid but it's like yeah but

350
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:57,449
that's what people want in their bag to

351
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:59,099
buy so you you got to have that you know

352
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,540
what I mean so that's kind of the this

353
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,019
stuff I've been I've been trying to work

354
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:05,549
on more stuff that's like that and then

355
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:09,449
at the same time I'm always doing my

356
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:11,639
regular stuff that's for me that I you

357
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:14,070
know that I that I vibe with even more

358
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,809
but I you know you can't help but but

359
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,550
also vibe with something that you look

360
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:20,909
at and you go whoa

361
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:23,069
it's incredible I mean I went to the ego

362
00:15:20,909 --> 00:15:25,019
clash in Holland down there and I saw

363
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:27,480
all the stuff and everybody I walked up

364
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:29,850
and they go which one which one you know

365
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,440
would you say would be good out of there

366
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,230
and I missed the part where you smoke

367
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,240
and all that and I just looked in the

368
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:39,089
case and I was all that number 14 that

369
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,440
looks like that's that's fire right

370
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:42,240
there I don't know what it is but it

371
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,720
looks good it's got that good old school

372
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,299
Gani

373
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,440
frost it up look and then they announce

374
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:49,349
the winner and they're like oh the

375
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,170
number 14 gelato 41 or something you

376
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:54,930
know and I was like oh alright well I

377
00:15:52,169 --> 00:15:57,240
mean you can't really argue with you

378
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:59,609
can't just like just hype pocky strain

379
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,139
whatever it's you can't you can't you

380
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:03,930
know yeah I learned that from a guy that

381
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:05,278
was in fashion and and I've not

382
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:07,799
historically been known as someone who's

383
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,360
been fashionable so I asked people who

384
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:12,299
are fashionable about you know fashion

385
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,159
yeah and they said you can't argue with

386
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:15,208
trends that people do because what

387
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:16,860
you're saying is that you're not

388
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,989
intelligent enough to recognize that

389
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,579
they made the choice to do it and so

390
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,470
what happens is you cut yourself right

391
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:23,458
out of the trend and I think that's the

392
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,100
same with what you're talking about the

393
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:27,899
plants at the bottom line is if if 41

394
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:30,839
cut wasn't hot then why is it moving at

395
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:32,879
a rate that's supernatural and it

396
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,579
doesn't mean you need to jump on it but

397
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,929
you need to understand why the white

398
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:38,278
what I learn from someone is tooth

399
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,929
there's two things in life those that

400
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:41,879
know how and those that know why and

401
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:44,519
those that know how work for those that

402
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:46,139
know why and for us it's the why that's

403
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,879
what's important for us otherwise we end

404
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:49,889
up just being how how do we make it and

405
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,360
we don't want to understand why are we

406
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:54,059
making it and what what is that

407
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,769
direction and and I agree man I see all

408
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:58,039
these modern cultivars that are red hot

409
00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:01,169
and I go I got you some of them are my

410
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:03,000
personal preference but I don't deny the

411
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:05,730
fact that it moves at an unbelievable

412
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,859
velocity and when you do objective

413
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:11,068
testing where I take I take things that

414
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:12,539
I think are hot and I give them to

415
00:17:11,068 --> 00:17:15,418
people who are in markets that are

416
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:18,599
unbelievably picky and they have money

417
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:21,509
which means they have access and I let

418
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:23,818
them run them to find out compared to

419
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:26,549
each other which one has the velocity

420
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:28,769
and then it lets me really understand of

421
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:30,710
these elites which one really is the

422
00:17:28,769 --> 00:17:33,048
attraction and why and it

423
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,149
so lost lets me understand which ones

424
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:38,359
didn't I think had the attraction and I

425
00:17:35,148 --> 00:17:40,369
go whoa the market still likes that but

426
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:43,668
so much of it is that that that visual

427
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:45,528
appearance and you've been trained to

428
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:47,570
choose those things because that's what

429
00:17:45,528 --> 00:17:49,730
we've got the last 30 years in cannabis

430
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:51,048
and I always tell people some of the

431
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,759
strong spot I have a smoke that it

432
00:17:51,048 --> 00:17:56,179
looked like it was a piece of cabbage

433
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:57,798
run over by a tractor and it got me so

434
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:59,330
high that I had to drive around the

435
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:00,619
island three times cuz I couldn't figure

436
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,569
out how to get off the highway on the

437
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:04,759
on-ramp and I was I was out in Hawaii

438
00:18:02,569 --> 00:18:06,470
and I got so lit that I couldn't really

439
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:07,940
get off the freeway and I was laughs and

440
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:10,700
I just said screw it I'll just drive it

441
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:12,110
out and at some point I'll come down and

442
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:16,278
I'll be able to figure out how do you

443
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:17,959
get off the freeway you know and what I

444
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:21,349
wasn't laughing at the moments I was

445
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,058
like whoa I am scorched but if I could

446
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:24,379
get my hands on that again I loved it

447
00:18:23,058 --> 00:18:27,109
but the thing was you know I challenge

448
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,179
you to sell it because it looked like it

449
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:31,398
was some cabbage run over by a tractor

450
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:34,130
yeah yeah yeah so that's why that's what

451
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:36,469
it's like you know like oh yeah gelato

452
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,570
just gelato cross you know what I mean

453
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,579
like yeah I made a gelato cross I made a

454
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:43,730
shirt cross like the mail I started with

455
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:46,099
those f5 and those generations to get to

456
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:48,620
add to get to f3 took a while out of the

457
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:50,719
twos to get to the four took a while out

458
00:18:48,619 --> 00:18:52,428
of the threes it's not like I just want

459
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,850
one two three four five boom a gelato

460
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:58,009
and even that is a lot of work but you

461
00:18:55,849 --> 00:19:00,019
know going along the way to go okay cool

462
00:18:58,009 --> 00:19:01,609
we got rid of this we got rid of that I

463
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:03,470
mean I think you probably grew some of

464
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:04,548
the early cherry generations that I had

465
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,069
that have all the weird

466
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:08,808
herckel recessives in it that pop out

467
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:10,519
with that still have little duck foot

468
00:19:08,808 --> 00:19:13,009
and they're teeny and they won't grow

469
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:14,898
and the weed is amazing incredible I

470
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:17,179
already think you've got to get both and

471
00:19:14,898 --> 00:19:19,459
then so now like I have cherry lime F

472
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:21,950
sixes and if you grow those they're all

473
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:24,319
big fast vegging plants they all have

474
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:29,120
the same bud structure they all have the

475
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:32,389
super high 5% terpenes at SC 18 22

476
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:35,028
percent THC real consistent all the same

477
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:37,399
doesn't mold doesn't break doesn't care

478
00:19:35,028 --> 00:19:39,950
if it's windy you know and then take

479
00:19:37,398 --> 00:19:42,489
that like what I use to make that and

480
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:46,299
then that was out crossed

481
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,859
to these you know height whatever and so

482
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:48,759
then you know with that then you at

483
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:51,729
least know you've got some

484
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:53,619
predictability there and at the same

485
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,539
time you have marketability so that you

486
00:19:53,619 --> 00:19:58,869
you you're bringing because you've got a

487
00:19:55,539 --> 00:20:00,730
there's only so many enthusiasts and all

488
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:03,429
of us enthusiasts can go ahead and go

489
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,829
okay cool yeah this is this really rare

490
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:08,560
weed thing you know like this is this

491
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:11,019
trippy like it's it's out there like um

492
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:14,079
like Caleb right now is working with

493
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:16,000
that Australian bastard cannabis and

494
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:17,679
people are like why would you want this

495
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,630
and I'm like if you really like plants

496
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,000
you want that because it's not the other

497
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:24,250
one you have but you're not gonna go

498
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,170
okay I'm gonna switch over my hoops to

499
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,819
this people are gonna go once it's

500
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,050
trimmed in the bag it probably isn't

501
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:30,429
even different because the leaves are

502
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:32,500
cut off and the leaves are what's cool

503
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,910
and it has valuable things and you want

504
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,859
to have it in your arsenal I looked

505
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:38,769
right out it and went if I can get a

506
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:41,229
plant that's like a bomb-ass Afghani to

507
00:20:38,769 --> 00:20:42,960
grow with this size leaves you're gonna

508
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:45,250
have yields that are gonna crush

509
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,590
everything because if you can get a fat

510
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:50,079
bud on something that veges faster than

511
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:52,000
that with a tiny little leaf it's just

512
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,220
gonna get Sun right to the bud the whole

513
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,200
way she can have these huge buds like

514
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,759
this but instead of being on the end

515
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,500
with these big fat leaves that block

516
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:02,529
everything out you're gonna have them

517
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,569
six feet long so that's where you get

518
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:06,369
like the cool stuff and those things are

519
00:21:04,569 --> 00:21:07,839
valuable for breeders but you buy a pack

520
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:10,509
of seeds you're like dude I want to grow

521
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,949
this and maybe I want to find a clone or

522
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:12,609
I just want to grow these and just have

523
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,259
good bud

524
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:16,329
like I try to make sure that my seed you

525
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:18,549
plant a row of it I have to be able to

526
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:20,710
plant a row of it and have 10 or 20 of

527
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:23,259
them and hundreds or three hundreds or

528
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:25,779
whatever and look at him and go okay

529
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:27,309
cool I'm glad I grew that in my garden

530
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:29,440
so that's what I tried to do that's what

531
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:31,839
I try to put out you know but with the

532
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,180
new the new stuff too was it's I'm

533
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,730
trying to like make sure it's you know

534
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,380
always cuz the cutting edge turps and

535
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:41,529
something that that fits into the

536
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,480
picture remarketed yeah j-just do a

537
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:44,649
smart business yeah and that's why

538
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,569
that's what I was saying about what

539
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,980
better to loop back that's what was cool

540
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:50,259
about the root beer is it almost looks

541
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:51,490
like a cookies or it looks like it's

542
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:54,118
something like that but it's cuz it has

543
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:56,308
black affi in it way back in it in Hindu

544
00:21:54,118 --> 00:21:58,828
and then it has the headband the la cush

545
00:21:56,308 --> 00:22:01,048
like Mandal had back in the day and so

546
00:21:58,828 --> 00:22:02,969
those it makes it like this ultra potent

547
00:22:01,048 --> 00:22:04,199
thing like if you're used to smoke and

548
00:22:02,969 --> 00:22:07,859
cookies and you smoke this you're like

549
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:09,479
okay this is super satisfying smoke you

550
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:11,938
know it breaks up a little better and

551
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:15,139
it's got you know just really killer so

552
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:17,278
those are those are ones that are that

553
00:22:15,138 --> 00:22:19,138
are going and that's the that's the

554
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:21,778
thing maintaining those cool that cool

555
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:23,998
all that meat stuff and then being able

556
00:22:21,778 --> 00:22:25,769
to go okay here's what we need to be

557
00:22:23,999 --> 00:22:27,989
competitive because we do have to be

558
00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:32,088
super competitive and all you really

559
00:22:27,989 --> 00:22:34,828
need is a plant that is that special and

560
00:22:32,088 --> 00:22:36,598
people will go oh okay I got it like

561
00:22:34,828 --> 00:22:38,158
it's good it's great for everyone to

562
00:22:36,598 --> 00:22:40,558
share everything it's great for everyone

563
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,528
to share especially these bulk these

564
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:45,598
these bulk gene pools you know what I

565
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:47,098
mean but like if you have your own clone

566
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:48,448
and everyone's like all you can't get

567
00:22:47,098 --> 00:22:49,948
like maybe you don't want to give that

568
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:51,479
clone away cuz maybe you want to have

569
00:22:49,949 --> 00:22:53,429
something that you're like no I know how

570
00:22:51,479 --> 00:22:55,078
to do this you might talk to someone's

571
00:22:53,429 --> 00:22:58,199
grandma she's like sorry you can't have

572
00:22:55,078 --> 00:23:00,058
my cookie recipe no because it's not

573
00:22:58,199 --> 00:23:02,099
want to have this I want to win the I

574
00:23:00,058 --> 00:23:03,989
want to win the contest at the whatever

575
00:23:02,098 --> 00:23:05,698
you know what I mean or whatever it's

576
00:23:03,989 --> 00:23:07,528
for like there's a there's a there's

577
00:23:05,699 --> 00:23:10,259
something to that you know so like

578
00:23:07,528 --> 00:23:12,028
definitely everyone's got a share but it

579
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:14,189
there's there's a huge edge to being

580
00:23:12,028 --> 00:23:16,378
able to go okay I have this thing and

581
00:23:14,189 --> 00:23:18,119
I'm the only one with it

582
00:23:16,378 --> 00:23:20,908
and it's something for everyone to think

583
00:23:18,118 --> 00:23:23,098
about that find that plant where you

584
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:26,579
know you you're you might not be able to

585
00:23:23,098 --> 00:23:28,918
sell sfv you're like I owe you I was

586
00:23:26,578 --> 00:23:31,318
getting you know three grand for this

587
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:33,749
sfv now people want to give me 600

588
00:23:31,318 --> 00:23:35,338
everything's crashed but then you go to

589
00:23:33,749 --> 00:23:37,909
talk to somebody in they're like dude I

590
00:23:35,338 --> 00:23:40,378
have this one and no matter what

591
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:43,459
everybody my buddies got this for a Mont

592
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:45,568
diesel it's like pre sour diesel diesel

593
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:47,219
you know like I don't know if it really

594
00:23:45,568 --> 00:23:49,199
is but that's how it is it's like just

595
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:51,659
straight like super skunk it smells like

596
00:23:49,199 --> 00:23:54,389
skunk and then underneath it's just like

597
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:58,079
clove and it's super super bomb and he

598
00:23:54,388 --> 00:24:00,958
just calls it diesel and anybody who

599
00:23:58,078 --> 00:24:02,969
looks at that and they tell you oh sorry

600
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:04,679
this is good indoor but I'm only gonna

601
00:24:02,969 --> 00:24:06,429
give you a thousand for it you're like

602
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,080
cool where's the next guy

603
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:10,659
because one out of three people who

604
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:13,178
smell this shit are gonna say dude what

605
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:15,580
do you want like if I have that I can

606
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:17,528
sell that to people for whatever I want

607
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,118
to ask for it and it's just because

608
00:24:17,528 --> 00:24:22,089
people don't all have it if everyone has

609
00:24:19,118 --> 00:24:24,069
it people see a bad version of it now

610
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:26,740
all of a sudden it's whatever it is it's

611
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:28,778
cool its cush but there's definitely

612
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:31,839
like a value and that of looking for

613
00:24:28,778 --> 00:24:34,778
your own thing having it and you know

614
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,548
being able to being able to run with

615
00:24:34,778 --> 00:24:39,009
something that's you know got a little

616
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:40,749
edge on it but so that that's what I'm

617
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:47,649
always doing trying to make stuff like

618
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:50,618
that I took all right G that's

619
00:24:47,648 --> 00:24:54,548
absolutely right and you know like when

620
00:24:50,618 --> 00:24:57,278
I look around this room I think what the

621
00:24:54,548 --> 00:24:59,798
reality is is that so many of us like if

622
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:02,679
you think of it's a race or whatever a

623
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:05,859
racetrack so many of us are actually

624
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:09,159
like lapping the whole industry that

625
00:25:05,859 --> 00:25:11,349
it's easy to look like you're behind but

626
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:13,720
we're really all just like so far ahead

627
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:15,969
and say what gene was saying is like

628
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,639
sometimes you gotta you know give them

629
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:20,649
what they want and so you know you do a

630
00:25:18,638 --> 00:25:23,319
few draw two crosses or make sure

631
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:26,469
everything is you know a certain THC

632
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:28,898
level for for the year but never ever

633
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:31,659
give up on those cultivars that like

634
00:25:28,898 --> 00:25:35,678
that mean everything to you I mean I

635
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:37,028
can't like back god eight nine years ago

636
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,940
people would give me such a hard time

637
00:25:37,028 --> 00:25:43,359
really why do you have seeds that make

638
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:45,580
purple cannabis everybody hates purple

639
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:48,758
they were like oh it's it's because it's

640
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:51,339
deficient your your weeds purple because

641
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:53,470
it's deficient in whatever something

642
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:57,069
they tell me and I'd be like no it's

643
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:59,079
it's not and this is like so the trends

644
00:25:57,069 --> 00:26:02,980
and I guess the whole lapping thing like

645
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:04,480
we're always like a one-lap ahead and

646
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,190
sometimes it can look like we're kind of

647
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,038
behind the pack but really we're just

648
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:12,960
like ahead of it and nobody knows it yet

649
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:12,960
so I think does for gene

650
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:22,980
so ya know same thing you got you got a

651
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:24,480
lot of killer stuff you you you work

652
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,298
some interesting directions since I've

653
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,558
met you and I like that you know you've

654
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:30,329
been you've been really putting together

655
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,788
some interesting combinations and the

656
00:26:30,329 --> 00:26:35,788
number of people that bring me material

657
00:26:32,788 --> 00:26:37,048
that you've done I got spend my job

658
00:26:35,788 --> 00:26:38,970
right now someone said man I got some

659
00:26:37,048 --> 00:26:39,658
kill equilibrium working I said oh nice

660
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:42,480
what is it

661
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:44,159
and I laugh because each one of those

662
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,349
samples was radically different than the

663
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,159
other because the lines were different

664
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:51,990
and I I like that when I see people have

665
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,629
separation and what they're doing and

666
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,190
and your desires to go these different

667
00:26:54,628 --> 00:26:57,359
trends and so you've been you put some

668
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:00,509
cool stuff what we've been what are you

669
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:02,878
doing going on I'm I think this young

670
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:04,169
and shy dig deeper into I've got so many

671
00:27:02,878 --> 00:27:07,079
seeds and so many things I've collected

672
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:09,000
over the years and I kind of want it I

673
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:11,339
like that branching out in a whole new

674
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,048
direction just like kind of outside way

675
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:14,548
somewhere where maybe it's something

676
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,319
that's been sitting on the Shelf that

677
00:27:14,548 --> 00:27:18,210
I've been meaning to get to forever and

678
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:19,859
I haven't decided anything I'm gonna

679
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:21,870
work with yet this year but there's

680
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:23,908
there's a few contenders the Malawi

681
00:27:21,869 --> 00:27:25,949
lines did really well you know over the

682
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:27,419
years there's been a lot of people

683
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,620
coming back saying the African Orange

684
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:30,960
was something that was really mold

685
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:32,518
resistant for them and I've seen some of

686
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,990
the flowers if somebody you know brought

687
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:36,240
me some of the flowers today from

688
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:38,460
Humboldt that was that was just probably

689
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,378
one of the most citrusy versions African

690
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:45,240
Orange I've ever seen and that's

691
00:27:42,378 --> 00:27:47,250
certainly a direction I want to go in as

692
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,720
things that do well on the coast because

693
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:51,419
I've been in you know I was in Santa

694
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,370
Cruz for so many years and it's it's

695
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:56,730
hard to grow almost anything in a lot of

696
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:59,128
the areas around that County that's

697
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:00,899
actually where I first saw some mean

698
00:27:59,128 --> 00:28:03,240
genes work as I had a friend out there

699
00:28:00,898 --> 00:28:06,689
that we kind of shared a little patch

700
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,250
one year and he I guess I guess he he

701
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:11,399
had gotten some seeds from you and he

702
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:12,849
grew the root beer and we grew the the

703
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:15,669
PK

704
00:28:12,849 --> 00:28:17,769
your cherry lines and it was like oh

705
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:19,840
cool I'm I forget some other and they

706
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:22,690
were just beautiful just the Oracle line

707
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,099
was insane especially in light of what

708
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,930
you were talking about with the the bag

709
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:28,509
appeal just like there were just these

710
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:30,820
bulbous buds that just just looked

711
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:33,069
amazing and probably the probably the

712
00:28:30,819 --> 00:28:34,389
cherry lime at everything was was the

713
00:28:33,069 --> 00:28:37,539
favorite at the end of the year just

714
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:39,759
just getting to smoke it and you know

715
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:41,680
the root beers were a little later but

716
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,170
they just when they when they filled in

717
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:48,160
they were like just so Turkey and and

718
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:50,500
and enjoyable and and last year your

719
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:52,810
Humboldt dream was my buddy's biggest

720
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,579
plants in the garden last year he's got

721
00:28:52,809 --> 00:28:56,639
a picture of him just in the Anderson

722
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:57,849
Valley with this plant that's just like

723
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,740
gigantic

724
00:28:57,849 --> 00:29:02,799
you know so he's like oh I'm doing this

725
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:04,779
one every year now so you guys kudos to

726
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,869
you guys for you know putting out the

727
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:09,250
quality work and I think yeah this year

728
00:29:07,869 --> 00:29:11,289
you know I'm gonna probably pull out

729
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,990
some of the other Malawi hybrids maybe

730
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:16,750
I've seen a lot a lot of buzz around the

731
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:18,430
chocolate Malawi which is one that I

732
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,619
haven't been working with as much in the

733
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:22,420
past and so maybe pull that one out I

734
00:29:20,619 --> 00:29:22,929
think that's probably one at the top of

735
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,789
the list

736
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:29,350
is the chocolate hash berry to the

737
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:31,809
heirloom malawi and you know the the

738
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:34,449
glue line is one I've been working for a

739
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:37,960
little while is trying to find a

740
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:40,210
reliable glue back cross and find a male

741
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,519
out of that that I can hit two things

742
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:45,880
and get that you know chocolatey gassy

743
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:51,670
aroma and taste out of the hybrids that

744
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:53,200
come through and you know maybe we're

745
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:55,180
gonna pull off some some crazy land

746
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,700
racism should I work with some you know

747
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:00,039
some wild some wild stuff and you know

748
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:03,279
try to try to see what you know what

749
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:06,039
else we could put out there that that is

750
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,500
gonna be unique this it's all about

751
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:10,119
setting yourself apart in this industry

752
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,880
and yeah like you're saying maybe you

753
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:14,739
find a cut that you don't want to share

754
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,210
with people and I would love to hear

755
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,829
that somebody found something out of my

756
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:20,019
work that that really worked well for

757
00:30:17,829 --> 00:30:22,839
them and they wanted to keep around for

758
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:23,859
years and years and and and maybe it

759
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:24,529
helped keep them afloat

760
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:28,939
in in

761
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:31,359
tough times and so so certainly we're

762
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:34,309
gonna keep working for mold resistance

763
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:36,919
which is you know even more of an issue

764
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:41,179
nowadays with you know the testing

765
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:44,960
requirements and you know some of the

766
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:48,980
other projects you know might might

767
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:52,059
include you know maybe maybe some of the

768
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:55,640
other Malawi's or you know I've kind of

769
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:57,679
got a rough sketch but but we haven't we

770
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:00,020
haven't nailed anything down yet you

771
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,730
know I think get back with the team and

772
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:05,650
see what everybody else wants to do too

773
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:07,880
and you know maybe go back and look at

774
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:09,740
because I try to I try catalog

775
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,840
everything all the all the seeds you

776
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:14,240
know everybody that gave me C's today we

777
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:17,319
traded I'm gonna go and try to catalog

778
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:20,569
and keep keep a list of everything and

779
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:23,029
you know you do that long enough and

780
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:26,779
you're gonna have a nice nice collection

781
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:30,649
you know I hope I hope everybody starts

782
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:32,420
getting into more of their own like Fino

783
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:36,710
hunts and and finding things that do

784
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:38,360
well in your local situation which you

785
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:40,670
know whatever property that you might

786
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:42,229
have might be even totally different

787
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,430
from your neighbors parcel because

788
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:46,430
they're on the other side of the ridge

789
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:48,289
you know or or maybe maybe the people

790
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:50,000
down the road or you know a little

791
00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:53,930
closer to a valley and they get more

792
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,410
wind or you know so so it's a it's great

793
00:31:53,930 --> 00:32:01,519
to be here and see oh you know all the

794
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:03,140
different success stories from different

795
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,160
strains because that definitely has a

796
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:08,300
big effect on my personal you know

797
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,710
decisions of what I'm gonna go and breed

798
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:11,299
with is when I go and talk to the

799
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:13,819
community or I go to you know the

800
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:16,460
Emerald cup or you know you know see

801
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:18,230
somebody out you know you know in town

802
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,269
or something and they'd be it so oh well

803
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:22,549
you know you're you're you know sour

804
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:24,859
orange or you know your your Grandaddy

805
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:26,779
orange or you know maybe one of these

806
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:28,549
you know dream queen blue or this or

807
