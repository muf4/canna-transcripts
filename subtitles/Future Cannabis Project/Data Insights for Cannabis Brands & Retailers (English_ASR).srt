2
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:22,198
data is king I guess after cash data is

3
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:24,839
king right so whether we're scaling or

4
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,090
our customers are scaling everybody

5
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:30,028
speaks about data to make the company

6
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:32,070
smarter and build how long has that

7
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:34,140
customer been in the store wandering

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,549
around for a product how old are they

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,929
what's their average spend did when's

10
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:41,399
the last time they came back to the

11
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:43,289
store are they coming back once a month

12
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,989
did they never come back are they a

13
00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:49,829
regular are they using your your loyalty

14
00:00:45,988 --> 00:00:52,948
program that in a nutshell is what I see

15
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:56,308
as a smart forward-thinking company that

16
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:59,039
wants to not only obtain customers but

17
00:00:56,308 --> 00:01:02,218
keep them given that leaf logixx is in

18
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,159
28 states what kind of trends are you

19
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,900
noticing not necessarily within the data

20
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,560
but actually in terms of retailer

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,790
behavior and adoption of your services

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,379
are you seeing any differences and you

23
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,689
know between let's say the West Coast

24
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:18,359
more commercially oriented States or the

25
00:01:15,688 --> 00:01:20,728
East Coast more medically oriented it's

26
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:21,989
definitely how it changes in the future

27
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:24,810
will be interesting how it evolves

28
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:26,908
because that it will become borderless

29
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,549
but it's not borderless now right so

30
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:32,219
there is a distinct difference between

31
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,350
an East Coast buyer which is similar to

32
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:36,658
maybe a Midwest buyer and then it all

33
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:39,449
changes when you hit the mountain

34
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,150
mountain time zone right Mountain

35
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:47,640
Standard time and the difference I see

36
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:50,130
brands brands brands much more evolved

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,960
on the west coast from Colorado West

38
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:54,349
I think the East Coast I don't know if I

39
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:57,750
call it ketchup but but because of that

40
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:59,879
medicinal area that they're not in that

41
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,560
consumerism market and the vertical

42
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,599
integration and the vertical integration

43
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,710
yeah

44
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:09,618
I did I in Colorado for example they

45
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:11,659
they used to make it seven if you were

46
00:02:09,618 --> 00:02:15,650
in medicinal I'm in dis selling

47
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:18,109
medicinal products you had to source

48
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,569
within your own vertical seventy percent

49
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,610
of the product now it's down to 50 or

50
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:24,409
about to be and it will be phased out

51
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:27,230
sometime next year is what I'm hearing

52
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:31,669
but all of that leads to back to data

53
00:02:27,229 --> 00:02:34,369
right so data will trend from brands to

54
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:35,599
what they come back to purchase the

55
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,959
results we're getting on our

56
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,239
point-of-sale one of the aspects is the

57
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:46,819
consumer whether they're a patient or

58
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:48,230
rec customer they leave feedback on what

59
00:02:46,818 --> 00:02:51,049
they liked and didn't like about the

60
00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:53,389
product oh nice yeah so you're saying

61
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:54,739
that consumers are able to leave

62
00:02:53,389 --> 00:02:56,899
feedback on the products they purchase

63
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:58,549
through your platform a how are you

64
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:00,260
actually engaging with a consumer that

65
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:03,500
way is there an application or do they

66
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:05,840
get texted so they can go online we have

67
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,439
an e-commerce platform for our clients

68
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,640
our b2b clients and they in turn will

69
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:15,319
open that up to their patients or or rec

70
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:19,909
customers and they will leave feedback

71
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:23,979
on everything from how it helped a

72
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:26,959
medical problem they had a condition or

73
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:29,689
simply for recreational the effects on

74
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,579
their body and they'll tie that together

75
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:33,229
with do they go back and purchase that

76
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:36,099
product do they try something else and

77
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:38,840
they can leave that on within that

78
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:41,659
point-of-sale facility so then next time

79
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,670
they go in that budtender will have a

80
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:45,680
running knowledge of what that person

81
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:47,839
likes which is pretty cool not just Bob

82
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,450
but what they like correct and the

83
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,090
effects so when you think about it yes

84
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:55,280
our industry's nascent compared to the

85
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,379
liquor industry for example but when's

86
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,379
the last time unless you knew Charlie

87
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:01,818
the bartender at your local haunt when's

88
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:03,979
the last time you could go into a bar

89
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:05,909
and that and the person serving you

90
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:08,849
knows what you

91
00:04:05,909 --> 00:04:12,419
like prepackaged is it perhaps before

92
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:14,280
you come in and you know the effects on

93
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,509
your body so I'm gonna cool absolutely

94
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,649
and I'm actually gonna follow that up

95
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:17,939
with some interesting insights that

96
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:19,979
we're seeing in the data right so we

97
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:21,480
collect both retail tracking data which

98
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,939
is the data that we partner with the

99
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,870
point-of-sale systems on well we

100
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:26,339
actually partnered directly with the

101
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,680
retailer the retailer is the one that

102
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:30,569
agrees to give the data but we partner

103
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,280
with the point-of-sale data we're the

104
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:33,930
point-of-sale to actually collect to

105
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,669
that data right and so what we're seeing

106
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:36,900
there is the purchasing behavior overall

107
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:39,120
in California and we're definitely

108
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:40,769
seeing everything move away from flower

109
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,870
towards you know as we've heard before

110
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:45,629
edibles and concentrates and more

111
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:49,939
consumer or new user consumer oriented

112
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:54,409
products right more easy ease of use and

113
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:56,219
entry level friendly products and

114
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:58,230
incidentally what we're seeing within

115
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,730
though we're seeing about 15% edibles

116
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,930
sales but in our consumer data so this

117
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,730
is what is actually being purchased at

118
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,800
retail right the the retail tracking

119
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,120
data in our consumer data which is the

120
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,949
survey based data we actually see

121
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,319
consumers reporting on preference a much

122
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:11,759
higher preference of edible edible

123
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,279
consumption then we see in the

124
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,250
purchasing right so while roughly 15% of

125
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:19,619
sales are edibles the consumers report I

126
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,730
think maybe 20 roughly twenty or twenty

127
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,189
something percent report that they

128
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,500
prefer edibles and so where's that

129
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:26,430
discrepancy right where wheezing that

130
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,709
difference between the purchasing and

131
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,389
the preference exactly and where is it

132
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:33,359
going right so a a lot of it is probably

133
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:35,129
you know at home baking you know we're

134
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,720
definitely seeing a lot more brownie

135
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:38,939
preferences in the consumer data than

136
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,650
actual purchases in the sales data right

137
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,240
and that's probably more regulatory

138
00:05:40,649 --> 00:05:44,279
based in California at this point since

139
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,460
making brownies has become a whole lot

140
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,289
harder but but I think it's what what it

141
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:50,849
what it shows and how it was ties back

142
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,230
into what you know the interesting

143
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:57,419
insights that you guys are collecting on

144
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:58,740
on consumers response or how they like

145
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:01,709
the product they're buying whatever the

146
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,360
word is for that preference how they

147
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:06,299
enjoy that specific product or how it

148
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,560
makes them feel well so so it's the

149
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,819
frequency right the frequency and

150
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,030
consumption is what is not being

151
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:13,680
recorded between the purchase and the

152
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:16,469
preference is the how often are they

153
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,459
consuming it right and so knowledge

154
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,350
exactly and so if you're getting that

155
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:22,539
data and you're seeing okay well look I

156
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,640
mean the reason only 15% of sales are

157
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,720
edibles but 20-something percent of

158
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,870
consumers report that they prefer

159
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,490
edibles is because maybe you know our

160
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:32,110
chalk or chocolate bars lasting too long

161
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:33,400
I mean you know if you're if you're a

162
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,780
chocolate manufacturer and you know that

163
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:38,049
people are that there's a strong

164
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:39,789
preference for your edible product and

165
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,840
you know the consumers are reporting

166
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,490
favorably on it but they're not

167
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:44,259
purchasing it as often as they should

168
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,939
well that is an opportunity for not just

169
00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:47,680
the retailer to make different decisions

170
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:49,089
around what types of products maybe they

171
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,290
want more high frequency products on

172
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:52,959
their shelves but also for the

173
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:55,360
manufacturers to produce more high

174
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:59,829
frequency purchasable products right and

175
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:02,379
I know BDS is is just went into Arizona

176
00:06:59,829 --> 00:07:05,169
recently yeah so you're gonna bring that

177
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:07,750
knowledge from other states into their

178
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:09,850
the the the stores in Arizona or do they

179
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,829
start from scratch there's any type of

180
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:13,090
comparison so they you give them a

181
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:14,649
little education on what's happening

182
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:17,739
outside of Arizona very interesting

183
00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:19,839
question yes so so initially absolutely

184
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,610
I mean generally how it works is a you

185
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:25,359
know you as a participating retailer you

186
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:31,330
receive access to the state in which you

187
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:32,680
participate exist but but yeah when we

188
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:35,409
launched a state right we obviously

189
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,449
don't have data on that state so we give

190
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,870
our retailers access to another state

191
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:42,639
perhaps as incentive to participate and

192
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,220
so they are able to learn from other

193
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,899
states behavior to see alright well you

194
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,980
know I mean Arizona hasn't launched an

195
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:50,579
adult user market yet I mean they

196
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:57,640
haven't legalized just quite yet but

197
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:58,000
expect it to 2020 right on and it sounds

198
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:00,729
about right

199
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,410
and and so yeah and so what's

200
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,700
interesting is you know adult use or not

201
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,050
yes of course there's a lot for them to

202
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:06,670
learn from other adult use markets such

203
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,590
as Colorado in Oregon that have been up

204
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,360
and running for many years you know

205
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:11,799
California is still young I don't not

206
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,160
that there's obviously tons to learn

207
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:19,360
from the California market but it's not

208
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:21,340
as mature yet but what's interesting is

209
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,319
no matter where we're at in the

210
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:25,719
legalization phase looking at the trends

211
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:27,430
and across all states is what we noticed

212
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,080
the consumers actually end up behaving

213
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,189
more similarly than they do differently

214
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:32,228
right I mean the terms are not that

215
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:33,729
drastically different state-by-state no

216
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:35,770
matter where they're at no matter where

217
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,690
they're at in their legalization there's

218
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:40,259
a border right really with people it's

219
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:43,150
you know consumers are consumers yeah

220
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:44,860
and so so that's that's what's you know

221
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:47,740
I think that overall I mean yes of

222
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:50,620
course you're gonna have your regulatory

223
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,990
variances as well as some personality

224
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,450
quirk differences between states but

225
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:59,759
yeah I mean you know the interaction to

226
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:02,860
get the data right it's it's still

227
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:06,610
unique that you have such interaction to

228
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:11,009
get gathered data so with our with some

229
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:13,269
of our with our set up at Point of Sales

230
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:15,819
customer will come in they can be

231
00:09:13,269 --> 00:09:18,159
greeted and the person will have an iPad

232
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,860
while their display whatever could be

233
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:23,860
any type of handheld mobile device let's

234
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,870
call it an iPad and they will get as

235
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,870
they're speaking but in that person's

236
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:31,179
profile what they're speaking about it's

237
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,879
very interactive and that's stored

238
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:35,799
they're going back to that data of and

239
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:38,320
then it follows up with their purchase

240
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:40,299
and your comment about X percent of

241
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,410
edibles and what people prefer and when

242
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:43,589
you put that together

243
00:09:41,409 --> 00:09:46,629
what whether it's artificial

244
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:48,879
intelligence from that route or just

245
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:51,309
someone analyzing me internally that

246
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:54,039
you're at that person's company you're

247
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:55,359
going to make get a copy or customer you

248
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:57,639
going to get a customer that comes back

249
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,740
right and I think that that's how you

250
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,509
expand your revenue for the customer

251
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:05,779
yeah yeah a getting the customer to come

252
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:07,129
back and more often exactly actually I

253
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:08,269
think where there's a lot of opportunity

254
00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:11,539
is how to get that customer to bring

255
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:13,159
their friends oh yeah try this this was

256
00:10:11,539 --> 00:10:15,049
the effect on me tell me what what it

257
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:16,850
was like on you especially with edibles

258
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:19,159
and that's that's a thing where people

259
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:22,100
are still you know getting used to

260
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:23,719
edibles because it's such a in in exact

261
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,879
science of what you're popping in your

262
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,649
mouth right there's still a trepidation

263
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:30,740
not for everybody but enough of the

264
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:33,470
parties and that feedback which is data

265
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,870
this is all data related right and so

266
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:38,180
that feedback of this is how I felt when

267
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,460
I did it and the high quality stores and

268
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:43,669
we have many throughout the country now

269
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:45,920
we'll have good standardizations of

270
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:47,059
product quality standards and you know a

271
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,549
lot of it is just consumer education

272
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:50,719
right I mean you know and and you can't

273
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,759
blame the end consumer

274
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,410
right because here's here's the analogy

275
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:56,439
I like to give I mean let's jump back to

276
00:10:54,409 --> 00:10:59,419
you know probic alcohol provision right

277
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,130
no I mean people had been drinking for

278
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:03,169
you know long before then right it's an

279
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:04,789
alcohol provision wasn't in effect that

280
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:06,620
long enough for people to forget how to

281
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:08,389
drink right um

282
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,000
cannabis prohibition has been in effect

283
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:12,379
for 70 plus years right catch-up time

284
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,429
for us a lot of catch-up time right I

285
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:15,500
mean where you've essentially are

286
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:18,799
cannabis culture if there even was one

287
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,990
to begin with before the 20s or 30s or

288
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:22,429
for you know what did it exist right

289
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,810
imagine imagine right now you know we

290
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:26,809
had had 70 years of alcohol prohibition

291
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:27,949
and I you had no idea how to drink right

292
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:29,089
like maybe you know there was obviously

293
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,470
the underground scene and you knew

294
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,540
exactly how to find your speakeasies and

295
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:33,379
how to get your medical card I don't

296
00:11:32,539 --> 00:11:36,709
know I went like this how to get your

297
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:38,059
medical card um but but yeah I imagine

298
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,860
that that was the alcohol world we lived

299
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:41,269
in now and I you know we just legalized

300
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,639
and I put a bottle of vodka in front of

301
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:46,039
you and said go no way I put a bottle of

302
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:48,409
vodka a bottle of wine and a beer right

303
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:50,329
and you're like enjoy drink this whole

304
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:55,730
bottle of vodka and a sip of that beer

305
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:57,379
or exactly so I mean it's just there's

306
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:58,769
been you know we haven't from my mom

307
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:01,590
right for

308
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:03,240
you know cousin from my grandma even all

309
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,560
these folks that are now thinking about

310
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,730
how to get into this industry I mean

311
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,569
they're walking into the dispensary and

312
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:08,820
they're trying to figure out what the

313
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:15,750
difference between wine and beer is you

314
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:18,960
know how to give it another moving part

315
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:21,419
we still have to remember our part the

316
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:24,509
industry we're in cannabis is also

317
00:12:21,419 --> 00:12:26,250
medicinal okay I mean there's the old

318
00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:28,439
joke I'll have a scotch and it's my

319
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,809
medicine but that's a little figurative

320
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:35,430
cliche right but in our industry that

321
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:39,319
we're proud of scientific addition oh

322
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:42,049
and can be fun yeah so so the more data

323
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:44,400
there the better the more comparative

324
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:46,979
word of mouth but word of mouth isn't

325
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,399
going to cut it it's gonna be it's gonna

326
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:52,230
be that you know socially mainstream

327
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,669
mainstream education I mean and that's

328
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,830
and right one of the big challenges is

329
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:57,529
the fact that all of our operators don't

330
00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:00,750
have access to traditional advertising

331
00:12:57,529 --> 00:13:02,189
mechanisms right so so I do think that

332
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,049
there's going and you know the celebrity

333
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:06,480
route right like that sort of that's

334
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:07,469
what people have been trying to take and

335
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,060
it'll be interesting to see how that

336
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,269
plays out but whoever can figure out how

337
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:13,739
to mass educate consumers on a what the

338
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:16,319
difference between wine and beer is and

339
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,940
why you take a sip of that wine and why

340
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,140
you would drink that whole beer and when

341
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:29,400
ya figure out how to educate us on that

342
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:30,990
not us you know but I know but my mom

343
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:32,100
doesn't right and you know she sheering

344
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,799
I was trying to figure out you know what

345
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,909
do I take for it you know I'm I woke up

346
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,149
today I'm feeling a little bit anxious

347
00:13:35,909 --> 00:13:41,069
right um what should I take now right

348
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:42,929
and then later on I'm gonna be feeling a

349
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,400
little bit sleepy and maybe later

350
00:13:42,929 --> 00:13:46,379
tonight I'm gonna want to feel sleepy

351
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,029
even have a hard time sleeping so you

352
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:49,379
know we're still we're still figuring

353
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:51,120
that out right exactly

354
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:55,980
so you're when you go into what's your

355
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:58,389
poster child customer on your that the

356
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,899
information your system will give them

357
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:03,819
surrounding data how will they take that

358
00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:05,559
and work with that to build both both

359
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:09,010
their brand cuz they're a business but

360
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:13,119
also the the loving education to their

361
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:15,009
customers absolutely so are most of the

362
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,409
well let's say our poster children

363
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:19,149
purchase both the retail tracking data

364
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:20,679
as well as the consumer survey data

365
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,299
right so the retail tracking data like I

366
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:24,489
said as the data we collect from the

367
00:14:22,299 --> 00:14:28,088
dispensaries where we went through the

368
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:29,110
point-of-sale and and what they

369
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:30,310
subscribe to that to obviously

370
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,200
understand what their market share is to

371
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:35,919
understand what types of products to

372
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,540
manufacture and how to adjust their

373
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,429
price points to adequately meet their

374
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:42,009
target consumer right so now the second

375
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:43,479
part of that or the next question is

376
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:45,490
well who is their target consumer right

377
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,019
and so that's where our consumer survey

378
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,100
data comes in all right which is just

379
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,899
your traditional consumer survey data

380
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,370
but that tells you you know I mean in

381
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:53,169
California for example I think the

382
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:55,060
average consumer is like 40 years old

383
00:14:53,169 --> 00:14:56,409
either male or female right so I mean

384
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:58,449
the assumption generally is generally

385
00:14:56,409 --> 00:15:00,338
that males consume more than females and

386
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,940
yet the average consumer it's pretty

387
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:03,670
much either

388
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,740
and so just a person in their 40s with

389
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:08,439
kids and children under the age of 10

390
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:12,159
right that is the average consumer and

391
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:13,480
so so of course meaning and of course

392
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:20,110
one of the fastest-growing demographics

393
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:21,789
is my grandma doesn't surprise me at all

394
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,649
right I mean the the number of

395
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:25,629
dispensaries I hear anecdotally telling

396
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:27,250
me that people coming I mean the number

397
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:29,528
of people that have come in for sleep

398
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:31,839
over the last since legalization you

399
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:33,970
know just just sleep just just leave I

400
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,649
mean they're there it's it's crazy right

401
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,220
arthritis and joints I would you know

402
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:41,509
there's certain

403
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:45,090
conditions that you we as humans get as

404
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:47,330
it's that with the data they will be

405
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:50,639
educated that this is not you know a

406
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:53,040
voodoo right I'm so brainwashed exactly

407
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,539
and so so and that is in fact what the

408
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,219
data has helped educate not just the

409
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:57,629
industry but folks outside of I mean

410
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,029
regulatory bodies within right I mean

411
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:02,340
look this is your average consumer this

412
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:03,929
isn't a in quotation marks stoner who's

413
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,519
like sitting in his basement and playing

414
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:07,559
video games all day I mean which is fine

415
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,259
too if that's if that's your mo awesome

416
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:12,269
but but you know it's it's so yeah we

417
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:14,159
how they use that data right is it as

418
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:16,110
their you know a lot of these a lot of

419
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,939
companies historically and still are

420
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,320
targeting that same in quotation marks

421
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,300
at stoner the person that's already

422
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,970
walking into the dispensary right what

423
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:26,370
the consumer data shows is okay here's

424
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,690
the percent of consumers right but

425
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:29,789
here's the percent of people who are not

426
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,380
yet consuming and are open to it and

427
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:34,289
that's currently in California 38

428
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:36,090
percent of adults over 21 so 38 percent

429
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:38,429
of adults over 21 in California are

430
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:41,040
currently don't consume but but are down

431
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:42,689
to consume really prove it but they're

432
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,459
not let's just say they're getting that

433
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:46,470
they're just about to take their leap in

434
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,000
because they've or they don't know right

435
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:50,370
they're like they're like do I drink the

436
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,080
wine or the beer you know like so so so

437
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,639
those so the question is right and if

438
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:57,030
you're a manufacturer right now and

439
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:59,909
you're trying to target a consumer

440
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:00,990
segment looking at that consumer segment

441
00:16:59,909 --> 00:17:02,549
and thinking alright and when you have

442
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:05,490
the opportunity to get creative and not

443
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:06,750
just educate them on here is what wine

444
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,980
will do for you and here's what beer

445
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,559
will do for you right here's what an

446
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,209
edible with high CBD will do and here's

447
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,809
what you know depending on your need

448
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:18,209
state and etc whoever figures out how to

449
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:19,198
adequately do that and reach that new

450
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:20,640
consumer not the one that's already

451
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,810
walking into the dispensary but the one

452
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,800
that's not yet walking into the

453
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:28,950
dispensary teach them how a to come in B

454
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:30,930
to buy that wine over that beer and C to

455
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,850
buy your wine over that one it's the

456
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:34,920
winner is the winner and and there'll be

457
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:37,259
multiple winners but you have to go in

458
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:39,390
that direction in my opinion to be one

459
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:42,240
of the winners that consumers or

460
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:44,730
consumerism they're smart they pick it

461
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,569
whether it's you know buying a mattress

462
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,839
or a car or a toaster they know from

463
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:52,178
price to quality

464
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:55,298
- I like that I don't like that so it's

465
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:58,210
really they need an education they will

466
00:17:55,298 --> 00:18:01,569
they will get the education they for us

467
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:04,090
it's lay out the information they will

468
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:06,339
seek it if it's there yeah because they

469
00:18:04,089 --> 00:18:09,009
will educate themselves fast you and I

470
00:18:06,339 --> 00:18:11,109
and you and I are in that ballpark as

471
00:18:09,009 --> 00:18:12,609
well oh yeah I think we've all educated

472
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:15,939
ourselves really quickly and it's funny

473
00:18:12,609 --> 00:18:17,769
you know I think that it's the consumers

474
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,840
have the luxury of taking their time on

475
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:22,210
educating themselves I personally think

476
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:25,298
that one of the areas we really need to

477
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:27,880
focus as an entire cannabis community is

478
00:18:25,298 --> 00:18:30,129
the physicians yeah and I have a lot of

479
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,140
friends I have a lot of friends that are

480
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,730
doctors right any other there you know

481
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:36,750
whether they work in a family practice

482
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:39,429
or in the ER and they get regular

483
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,648
regular regular questions around

484
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:44,580
cannabis and they have no idea how to

485
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:47,949
answer it they they go home and Google

486
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:51,220
and the funny part of that is going back

487
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:54,370
to that that prototypical stoner that

488
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:58,569
stoner knows more about this this

489
00:18:54,369 --> 00:19:01,058
medicine or rec product than the doctor

490
00:18:58,569 --> 00:19:04,710
with the degree yep you know and that I

491
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:04,710
mean you know we can get into why that's

492
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:11,169
so big farmers not going to educate us

493
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,620
we have to educate ourselves in this

494
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:13,000
industry

495
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:16,389
well these they're not gonna educate us

496
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,179
yes yes as soon as they have incentive

497
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:21,909
to okay you read they know just like the

498
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:24,190
liquor industry is joining now but yeah

499
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:25,960
I think I think consumers and will go a

500
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:30,220
long way especially with starting with

501
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:33,370
data and them educating and educating

502
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,288
ourselves we've been talking a lot about

503
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:36,459
this new consumer or the existing

504
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:38,230
consumer that's been walking into that

505
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,759
has previously walked into the

506
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,679
dispensary or trying to get this new

507
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,658
consumer to walk into the dispensary can

508
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,620
you talk a little bit about the actual

509
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:47,270
physical experience that could

510
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:51,919
humor has when they walk into the

511
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:56,329
dispensary and how your software makes

512
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,558
it easier or less intimidating yeah yeah

513
00:19:56,329 --> 00:20:00,439
let's do a question

514
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:02,808
so you whether you're an educated

515
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,519
consumer repeat customer they call you

516
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:09,160
by your first name when you walk in or

517
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:11,808
the first timer it's it's there's

518
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:15,470
differences but but that color of

519
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:16,730
experience is going to be one of coming

520
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:20,269
in walking through the door and being

521
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:24,410
greeted with someone in our case where

522
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:26,359
you can use an iPad or mobile device so

523
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:29,750
as soon as you welcome to the store that

524
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:33,069
that consumer will get an experience of

525
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:35,869
let us show you on a one-on-one talk

526
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:39,558
what products were offering and what you

527
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:42,619
may like and what may be fit that person

528
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:46,700
coming in they will also normally see a

529
00:20:42,619 --> 00:20:49,129
flat-screen live menu in in the area so

530
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,799
they're already getting an education do

531
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:54,410
you do any sort of at I mean is the menu

532
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:57,500
just a static menu or do you find ways

533
00:20:54,410 --> 00:21:01,640
to incorporate that there will be there

534
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:06,650
will be various underlying feedback from

535
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:09,110
other patients nutrient tracking the

536
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:11,170
testing results testing results will be

537
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:13,490
at a stage where you can look that up on

538
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,080
from the store level and on the

539
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:18,799
e-commerce level just like if you were

540
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:20,928
buying a milk and you're on online you

541
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,879
can see the calories in the milk and the

542
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:25,940
details are like the vitamins in the

543
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:29,900
milk yes that's their vivid pictures

544
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:33,740
night nice user friendly images and and

545
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:36,830
then it flows into what that particular

546
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:39,200
store wants to promote in terms of what

547
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:41,990
are you looking for very interactive you

548
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:46,330
find that that increases their speed of

549
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:49,308
sale potential of sale quantity of sale

550
00:21:46,329 --> 00:21:52,250
actually all of the above with the

551
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:56,089
software the that experience walking in

552
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:57,140
will promote a pre-order so it's a

553
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:59,629
faster transaction

554
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,870
for the store and that pre-order from

555
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:06,050
off that iPad of standing by somewhere

556
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:08,179
near the entrance or cases will be put

557
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:11,960
into the back office and that order will

558
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:13,820
will begin to be put together where by

559
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,049
the time you get up to the register it's

560
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:16,669
already ready you can ask more questions

561
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:18,799
and a lot of times

562
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:20,690
besides the questions you order more

563
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:23,930
product you already have your bag and

564
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:25,430
you put in a few more into your cart and

565
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,900
I think that's it I think that's a big

566
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:30,460
benefit in the experience for the

567
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,460
consumer and the store

568
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:44,980
