2
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:20,948
hello everyone thank you so much for

3
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:24,439
coming to hear our little discussion and

4
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:25,910
I'll let dr. Andreas start with telling

5
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:27,528
her a little bit our telling you a

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,118
little bit about her story then we'll

7
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:31,189
kind of tell here a little bit about

8
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,780
mine and didn't you'll be able to notice

9
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:35,509
the difference of where we're coming for

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:49,308
but also talking about one particular

11
00:00:35,509 --> 00:00:50,869
topic so incredibly different we agree

12
00:00:49,308 --> 00:00:52,820
in a lot of fundamental issues that are

13
00:00:50,869 --> 00:00:54,890
germane to the topic today which is

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,670
understanding sort of the cannabis

15
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,210
strain

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:01,129
fingerprint so even though I sort of

17
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,350
even the more bio medical background I

18
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:05,209
believe that truly understanding

19
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:08,420
cannabis as medicine starts with the

20
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:11,239
plant and so in my role at G B Sciences

21
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:14,030
we have been dedicated to creating

22
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:16,819
standardized raw materials that we

23
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,909
provide to customers we have operations

24
00:01:16,819 --> 00:01:22,578
in both Nevada and in Louisiana where we

25
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:24,469
hold licenses to cultivate produce oils

26
00:01:22,578 --> 00:01:28,368
and make finished products for sale in

27
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:30,649
those markets and so when I'm talking to

28
00:01:28,368 --> 00:01:32,599
you today I'm wearing two hats I'm

29
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:34,399
wearing the Hat of we're part of the

30
00:01:32,599 --> 00:01:37,069
industry we're part of the supply chain

31
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,049
of cannabis materials that go to the

32
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:41,089
patients in medical markets as well as

33
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:43,759
to the folks in adult use markets like

34
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:45,140
Nevada but at the same time at GB

35
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,659
Sciences we've also taken the position

36
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,180
that it's not enough to just create

37
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:53,329
standardized products that we also

38
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:56,000
wanted to verify safety and potential

39
00:01:53,328 --> 00:01:57,739
effectiveness through research and so to

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,118
that end we have sponsored research with

41
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:03,199
nine different universities where we're

42
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:05,239
trying to get at you the cannabis plant

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,100
is full of lots of different compounds

44
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:10,460
and anyone who tells you cannabis is one

45
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:13,099
thing is missing the point okay so we're

46
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,700
trying to get at this great mystery of

47
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:16,459
how

48
00:02:13,699 --> 00:02:18,889
you align strains with particular

49
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:20,628
diseases or particular symptoms that we

50
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:23,539
need to treat and the only way to do

51
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:25,609
that is in controlled trials but those

52
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:26,870
take many formats in different just

53
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,700
jurisdictions so that's kind of a

54
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,370
complicated thing but today what we're

55
00:02:28,699 --> 00:02:33,199
here to talk about is strains and the

56
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,719
chemical components of strains which

57
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:37,009
we're calling a fingerprint but - but do

58
00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:38,689
you know that we're coming at this both

59
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:42,500
from a place I'm coming at this from

60
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:44,810
both the place of we grow as well as we

61
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,639
do research so it has a little bit of a

62
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,318
different I have a different perspective

63
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,909
on it than pepper but I think we agree

64
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:53,179
on a lot of the essential things so

65
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:55,959
pepper very well said I'm coming from

66
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,640
the angle of I am a naturopathic

67
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:02,030
holistic practitioner in Humboldt County

68
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:04,458
so most of the patients I have or

69
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,229
clients that I have or students that I

70
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:08,780
have in the cannabis program for the

71
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:11,449
cannabis holistic Institute are coming

72
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:13,848
in with multiple different dis ease dis

73
00:03:11,449 --> 00:03:15,548
element discomfort and we are trying to

74
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:18,048
put them in the last eight years in

75
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:19,849
combination to a particular strain or

76
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:21,889
cultivar that's going to be helpful for

77
00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:23,539
that particular ailment I've been lucky

78
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:25,549
enough to be doing that for the last

79
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:27,590
eight years the thing that kind of

80
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:29,989
guided me in that direction was because

81
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:32,239
I had my own discomfort within my body

82
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:33,189
and just to name a few in the last seven

83
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,840
years that I've been working with

84
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:40,959
physically just my own personal stories

85
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:44,030
include PTSD anxiety cancer tumor

86
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,180
endometriosis reproductive issues I mean

87
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:49,269
it's a slew of them God chose the right

88
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,250
person cuz then I was in Humboldt County

89
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:54,709
running around on farms asking for

90
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,169
particular strains or cultivars from

91
00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:00,859
friends of mine that I knew grow organic

92
00:03:57,169 --> 00:04:03,768
or grew organic and I mostly focused on

93
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:06,200
doing non psychoactive CBD so that's

94
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:08,480
what kind of got me into what I'm doing

95
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:10,068
now and educating people around the

96
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,108
world and working with patients and

97
00:04:10,068 --> 00:04:14,418
clients and students around the world so

98
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:17,418
I'm coming from you know more of

99
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:20,418
Humboldt County organic farmer boutiques

100
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:23,329
trains growing that industry and

101
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:24,829
cannabis culture in that way because

102
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:26,658
most of those people I've been working

103
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:27,079
with for so very long and giving them a

104
00:04:26,658 --> 00:04:29,000
plan

105
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:31,969
form to speak on their particular

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,189
expertise that may have gotten lost in

107
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:37,280
the shuffle without some kind of program

108
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:39,949
to really have speakers allowed to talk

109
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:41,448
on there you know but they're best at so

110
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:43,819
anyways that's what we're gonna do it

111
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:47,300
now we're gonna talk about um what's in

112
00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:50,240
a strain the cannabis fingerprint in

113
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:53,718
Humboldt County and I'm sure many of you

114
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,788
have understood that it is about this

115
00:04:53,718 --> 00:04:58,069
it's not just particularly about the

116
00:04:55,788 --> 00:05:00,500
strain or the cultivar it's about the

117
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:02,270
whole cannabinoid system and which

118
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,430
particular ones do what with what

119
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:06,799
particular body systems so that's kind

120
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,259
of how I started working with different

121
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,750
cannabinoids I was working with CBD THC

122
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:13,908
a raw form plant for a book so and so on

123
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:17,000
and then it's about connecting those two

124
00:05:13,908 --> 00:05:18,550
with your body structures so today we're

125
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,839
going to be talking about the cannabis

126
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:24,680
active ingredients and do you want to

127
00:05:20,839 --> 00:05:27,739
take it for a second yeah I do add a

128
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,870
little bit to the idea of strains so I

129
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,199
know that stray names are very near and

130
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:35,718
dear to the breeders out there that have

131
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,180
work to perfect their favorite ones and

132
00:05:35,718 --> 00:05:39,949
the ones that are this is Sally fun but

133
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,800
one of the things that we're going to

134
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:45,468
advocate for as a part I'm a last part

135
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,360
of this industry is that strain names so

136
00:05:45,468 --> 00:05:50,269
there's a reliance on strain names from

137
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,550
regulators from our marketing campaigns

138
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:55,128
that I think does patients a disservice

139
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,960
because strain names do not always

140
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:58,759
capture the active ingredients that are

141
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,138
in the plant and ultimately it will be

142
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:02,360
the active ingredients and I don't mean

143
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:04,009
single active ingredients I mean the

144
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,229
whole collection out of the potential

145
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:09,949
480 active ingredients in a cannabis

146
00:06:06,228 --> 00:06:11,628
strain is that energy yeah so we need to

147
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:13,460
keep track of that and patients it

148
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:15,620
patient it's hard because humans want

149
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:18,528
things to be simple right it's like part

150
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:21,139
of human nature but cannabis has a plant

151
00:06:18,528 --> 00:06:23,899
part of its power is that it isn't

152
00:06:21,139 --> 00:06:26,418
simple so we have got to we've got to

153
00:06:23,899 --> 00:06:28,668
find a way to communicate the complexity

154
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:31,698
of active ingredients in plant based

155
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:33,049
products with our consumers with

156
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:36,588
patients in a way that they can

157
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,908
understand okay so and that is the big

158
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:39,740
divide we've got to get across because

159
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:40,689
right now what they're relying on when

160
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,790
they go into dispensed

161
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:45,819
is a well-meaning but tender who's gonna

162
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:49,030
tell them about into couch and sativa

163
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:52,959
right and you know and some other like

164
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:54,789
lore right but one of the things that we

165
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,159
that we try to do is we're data-driven

166
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,960
I'm a scientist right so we did two

167
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,170
studies one of the studies we did in

168
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,969
2014 in California in conjunction with a

169
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,740
third part at third-party testing lab

170
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:09,580
and what we were asking the question of

171
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:11,470
it we took over 20,000 strain profiles

172
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:17,229
that you know the potency analysis of

173
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:18,790
the cannabinoids and terpenoids that

174
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:21,490
will define something called a chemo bar

175
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:23,680
or a chemical variation okay so remember

176
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,410
cannabis isn't one thing there are

177
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,860
certain cannabis strains that fall into

178
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:31,720
these different chemical variations in

179
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,000
2014 in California when we did it there

180
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,210
were 25 chemo bars we did the same thing

181
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,569
in Nevada which is the state that our

182
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:42,339
primary location is in and we test it

183
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:44,529
we've also partnered with a third-party

184
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:46,060
independent testing lab there and there

185
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:48,669
were we're looking at I believe no quote

186
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:50,680
me on this something like 40,000 so I'm

187
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,810
sorry something like 4,000 strain

188
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,790
records and we published the second

189
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,560
study the one in Nevada in the journal

190
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:59,189
called cannabis and cannabinoid research

191
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,899
back in May and what it showed was

192
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:03,879
during the medical only period in Nevada

193
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:06,099
there were three hundred and ninety six

194
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,990
different strain names but when you did

195
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,960
the chemical variation analysis there

196
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:12,610
were three and 90% of all the samples

197
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,789
tested were in a single chemical

198
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:18,850
variation that was high THC and almost

199
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:22,810
and very little in the way of minor

200
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:24,430
cannabinoids and terpenoids we sent them

201
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:26,379
off to have genetic analysis done

202
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,939
because you know it's possible that

203
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:28,899
because in Nevada you have to grow in a

204
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:30,969
greenhouse and there's a lot of

205
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:32,199
convergence and how we grow we were

206
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:33,820
trying to give people the benefit of the

207
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,620
doubt that maybe the chemicals were

208
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,539
aligned because we were growing under

209
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,399
the same conditions but on the genetic

210
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:42,240
level there three hundred and ninety-six

211
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:46,600
strain names correlated with twelve

212
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:49,779
genetic variations and blue dream which

213
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,970
is an incredibly popular strain name was

214
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:56,120
present in all 12 genetics

215
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:58,580
so I think that if in a system where we

216
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,549
rely on strain names to sell things to

217
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,050
patients who are looking for the same

218
00:09:00,549 --> 00:09:05,120
results strain names are doing them a

219
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:06,769
disservice because if you're in Nevada

220
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,899
during that medical only period and you

221
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:10,610
picked up Blue Dream off the shelf

222
00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:11,840
somewhere you had a one in 12 chance

223
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:19,370
that it was the same thing as you've got

224
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:21,860
last time you bought it so anyway I'm

225
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,990
going to come from because where I'm at

226
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,840
in Humboldt County we are

227
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,100
I mean pridefully so you ask anyone

228
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,040
that's growing pot in the Humboldt

229
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,529
County we are organic we're biodynamic

230
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:36,259
or focused we are proud of our strains

231
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:38,809
we are proud of our cultivars or variety

232
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:40,460
of cannabis we know what we're doing or

233
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:42,559
they know what they're doing I don't

234
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,150
grow any longer but they know what

235
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:47,149
they're doing and they've been doing it

236
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:49,759
for generations and generations now as a

237
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:51,980
naturopath when a client comes to me

238
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,019
asking for something I love the idea of

239
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,970
saying ok you need this this this this

240
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:59,480
and this fingerprint this particular

241
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:01,370
cannabinoid system like combination but

242
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,800
you give that to the average client you

243
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,810
give that to the average person they're

244
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:07,819
not gonna know what to do with that so

245
00:10:05,809 --> 00:10:10,039
to break it down I get what you're

246
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:13,190
saying and I get where we're going but

247
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:15,169
for the average person not even in this

248
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,730
room they don't know what they're doing

249
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:18,559
and they're going to have to find a

250
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:21,259
direction strain name is the best thing

251
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,449
we can do right now now testing those

252
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:25,009
making sure that those plants are truly

253
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,290
that before the dispensary gets that

254
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:29,120
that's a whole nother topic right and

255
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:31,159
that's what we want to happen but we

256
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,259
have to trust our growers that's another

257
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:35,269
reason why we go organic and we know our

258
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:38,149
farmers that we're getting our cannabis

259
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:40,250
from and boutique's training is for me

260
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:41,840
being from Humboldt County that's the

261
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,340
way we're pushing it that's what we're

262
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,050
seeing and we're seeing it happen all

263
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,210
the time and it's phenomenal and I think

264
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:50,269
that's what really gives this pick no

265
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:52,700
the panel of the two of us a difference

266
00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:54,379
in perspective because I don't get we

267
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,520
disagreement for example you're coming

268
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:58,610
from in Nevada

269
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,519
data you know it's a commodity okay

270
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:04,610
we're fully into adult use

271
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,079
and you know I can't swear and we grow

272
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:13,399
ourselves and we're really proud of our

273
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:14,990
Jenny couch thank you very much there's

274
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:17,539
a point for it there's a valid reason

275
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,250
for it but that said I still can imagine

276
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:21,079
I can imagine something different than

277
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:24,320
what we have right now I can imagine a

278
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,330
way to break down the complexity of the

279
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,010
active ingredients into a way that

280
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,470
there's a simple pattern recognition

281
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:32,210
that patients can help yeah I definitely

282
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,160
agree with you on that for certain for

283
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,050
certain it's going to take a shift yeah

284
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:38,240
for people to recognize we need to talk

285
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:39,979
about the minor cannabic yes and that's

286
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,830
what we're starting to really educate at

287
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,600
least in my field particular clients who

288
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,610
are needing things say for their nervous

289
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,320
system which of those particular minor

290
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:50,120
cannabinoids work best from that and

291
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,950
then we can refer them off to strain

292
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,419
dosage use whether they're gonna be

293
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,370
juicing when they're gonna non

294
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:57,349
psychoactive tincture whether they're

295
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,759
gonna do a concentrate then we kind of

296
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,560
do that but right now it's just like

297
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,840
piecing that all together at least from

298
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,689
where I'm standing because I'm doing it

299
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,460
as a private practice yeah so so - so to

300
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,940
our first point about the cannabis

301
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:12,110
active ingredients I think right now

302
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:15,560
because there's been the most research

303
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:16,879
on THC and CBD that's where people feel

304
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:19,159
the most comfort and where I think

305
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:21,529
people is going to understand the

306
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:23,659
significance better so right now there

307
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:25,129
is a reliance on information about THC

308
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:27,469
and CBD and I think that's appropriate

309
00:12:25,129 --> 00:12:29,539
given where we are in our research but

310
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,129
this is where I see the future and the

311
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:34,329
future will include information about

312
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:34,330
minor cannabinoids and terpenoids

313
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:40,759
important okay so a study that I was not

314
00:12:38,059 --> 00:12:43,489
involved in but that I heard at Ken mad

315
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:46,539
two years ago there was a trial

316
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:49,519
happening in Israel where they had

317
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:53,629
patients they were all children who had

318
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,879
epilepsy and they were being given coal

319
00:12:53,629 --> 00:12:59,419
plant extract from a cannabis strain

320
00:12:55,879 --> 00:13:01,759
that naturally had a 22 1 CBD to THC

321
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:04,069
ratio and because they didn't want to be

322
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:07,129
reliant on a single farmer they gave to

323
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:09,170
farmers the original strain and they

324
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:12,679
told the farmers we're gonna test this

325
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:15,049
and if the THC to c8t zbd ratios aren't

326
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:15,328
the same when you hand over the products

327
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:16,769
we

328
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:19,498
accept it that'll be our quality control

329
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:22,169
staff so everything was going good the

330
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:24,389
first first part of the trial there the

331
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:27,149
children were having fewer episodes

332
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:29,100
there was no huge behavioral problems or

333
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:31,619
adverse events but then something

334
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,230
happened midway through and there was

335
00:13:31,619 --> 00:13:36,178
suddenly a huge amount like one part of

336
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,850
the patients were suddenly having an

337
00:13:36,178 --> 00:13:41,220
increased amount of behavioral events

338
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:44,699
like just really dramatic like punching

339
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,019
people and just really off the rails to

340
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:48,118
the point where they ended up shutting

341
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:50,938
this to trial down and when they did the

342
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:52,528
backwards analysis they found that all

343
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:55,828
of the samples that were provided to the

344
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:58,230
children had that right ratio of 228 to

345
00:13:55,828 --> 00:14:00,539
1 but when they did a deeper analysis

346
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:04,048
and they looked at the profiles of

347
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:07,048
ingredients beyond THC and CBD in one

348
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:10,289
farmers crop it was equal to what was in

349
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:12,419
the original strain and one there was a

350
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:17,009
completely different profile of minor

351
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:18,328
cannabinoids and terpenoids and clearly

352
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:20,399
I don't think this farmer was trying to

353
00:14:18,328 --> 00:14:21,719
hurt children right but it's much like

354
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,188
if you're babysitting for someone's

355
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,749
goldfish and they die you go to the

356
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:26,698
store and you look for the closest match

357
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:27,959
of goldfish that you can find unless

358
00:14:26,698 --> 00:14:31,078
you're a better human being than me and

359
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:33,238
you have children and they found

360
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:35,039
something that matched you know they

361
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:37,259
couldn't tell from it from looking at

362
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,730
the tea the CBD to THC ratio that it was

363
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:40,528
any different but you better believe

364
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:42,600
when they did the profiles beyond that

365
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:44,399
they were incredibly different so what

366
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,790
that shows is that while it's important

367
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,009
that we're monitoring the THC and CBD

368
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:51,328
down the road as our understanding

369
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:53,428
becomes more complete those other

370
00:14:51,328 --> 00:14:55,769
compounds are incredibly important in

371
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:57,088
whole plant extracts and I'm it is my

372
00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:00,209
belief and I think we share this that

373
00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:01,949
whole plant medicine has potentially

374
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:03,928
greater clinical value than these

375
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:05,628
individualized compounds but we got to

376
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:08,879
be careful it's a double-edged sword

377
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:11,579
more molecules can mean potentially

378
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,889
better effects or unexpected effects so

379
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:15,838
I think I think thank you for all that I

380
00:15:13,889 --> 00:15:16,918
think that cannabis itself what we need

381
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,259
to remember is that it creates

382
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:21,838
homeostasis in the body which then

383
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:24,089
allows the body's systems to regulate

384
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,220
and heal themselves so whether you're

385
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,800
getting it across the board I don't

386
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,920
think it's going to

387
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:32,109
I mean obviously and into where you're

388
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,389
at but I think that's the most important

389
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:37,089
part is to focus on cannabis as a whole

390
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:38,709
sure plant and getting it in that

391
00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:40,420
direction I think and I can go off on

392
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:42,758
tangents about that but that's not in

393
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:45,039
our topics today so let's get back on

394
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:47,169
we're going to talk about terpene and

395
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:51,698
why terpenes are so important and the

396
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:53,708
terpene can canopy which is so very

397
00:15:51,698 --> 00:15:55,988
important for patients and clients and

398
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:57,909
all of us to recognize it's not just

399
00:15:55,989 --> 00:16:00,009
about the cannabinoids it's also about

400
00:15:57,909 --> 00:16:02,828
the terpene that are in that particular

401
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:04,769
plant so for example you know if you

402
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:06,878
have particular terpenes in particular

403
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:08,528
cannabinoids those two together will

404
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,860
isolate and be best for a particular

405
00:16:08,528 --> 00:16:13,088
body systems that's direction I'm going

406
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,289
specifically and of course they're gonna

407
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:16,239
be good for everything but if you're

408
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:18,039
really dialing it in if you're really

409
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:19,989
neatly in a haystack like I've been

410
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:21,519
doing for the last eight years those are

411
00:16:19,989 --> 00:16:23,980
the kind of things that I'm looking for

412
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,709
in a cannabis strain or variety or

413
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,089
cultivar and so back to the what I was

414
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:30,758
talking about before where we did the

415
00:16:28,089 --> 00:16:33,279
the the data analysis to try to define

416
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:35,769
like the chemical variations for the

417
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:38,379
study that we did in California those 25

418
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:40,720
different chemo VARs that we identified

419
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:43,688
were all distinguished based on a major

420
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,160
and a minor terpene the CBD and THC

421
00:16:43,688 --> 00:16:47,110
levels were actually sort of

422
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:49,328
insignificant to the analysis and that

423
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,938
even holds true in the in the nevada

424
00:16:49,328 --> 00:16:54,039
analysis we did that the differences

425
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:55,719
that we're gonna see in between the

426
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:58,298
different strains are really in the

427
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,999
terpenes and i believe that's also true

428
00:16:58,298 --> 00:17:03,188
from a clinical side and it also is what

429
00:17:00,999 --> 00:17:05,709
naturally so for people who love whole

430
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:07,509
plant in the raw form those terpenes are

431
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:10,328
also what adds to your enjoyment right

432
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:13,298
so I think terpenes are an under valued

433
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:15,250
resource that we have in cannabis and

434
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,959
it's something that we are also looking

435
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,459
at on the research side so one of the

436
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,860
things that was known for a long time is

437
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:22,480
that cannabinoids have interactions in

438
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:24,638
your body with receptors well in our

439
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,380
research we found that it sends true for

440
00:17:24,638 --> 00:17:27,938
terpenes we've identified specific

441
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:30,100
terpenes and the specific receptors in

442
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:31,840
our bodies where they're interacting so

443
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:36,158
they have just as much greater potential

444
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:38,230
for being real effective medicines as as

445
00:17:36,159 --> 00:17:39,340
the other components in the plant that

446
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,950
we that we're have been

447
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:43,449
studying more extensively over time yeah

448
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,250
in cannabis farmers in Humboldt County

449
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,259
and around the world I'm sure but like

450
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,029
we eke out on that right there

451
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:50,859
we've been doing it for generations and

452
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:53,470
generations of finding this particular

453
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:55,059
plant as this particular you know minor

454
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,799
cannabinoid with this particular

455
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:58,599
champion and this works fit this I mean

456
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,669
they are like intense up there oh it's

457
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:03,369
really really great to be a part of that

458
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:05,289
community okay so let's talk we had this

459
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:08,079
discussion about sativa and indica and

460
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:09,940
how to you know currently this has been

461
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,279
like the hot button thing for for a

462
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:16,090
while now most people think either

463
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:18,279
sativa or indica now about five years or

464
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:20,589
more there was so much hybrid in

465
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:23,829
happening that it didn't really make

466
00:18:20,589 --> 00:18:25,240
that much sense and so a big huge like a

467
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:27,759
huge group of people are staying away

468
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,740
from sativa and indica but those people

469
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,240
who are coming you know from the very

470
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,620
ground up those consumers that have

471
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,809
never used cannabis or have been afraid

472
00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:36,399
to use cannabis this is the terminology

473
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:38,079
this is the language that they're using

474
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,660
even though we're trying to stay away

475
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:42,789
from that and explain to them it is more

476
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:46,210
about the cannabis fingerprint than

477
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:47,829
anything else the the main consumer this

478
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,539
is what they're looking for they're

479
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:51,089
going into the Spencer E and saying I

480
00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:54,069
want something that's indica dominant

481
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:56,829
well where where are we going from that

482
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:58,960
now that's an issue so it's more about

483
00:18:56,829 --> 00:19:01,119
really educating people I'm you're

484
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:05,049
shaking your head what do you got so and

485
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:07,469
so so adding to that so I've had the

486
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:09,430
opportunity to go to these conferences

487
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:11,650
including one by the International

488
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:14,170
cannabinoid Research Society which is

489
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,820
the longest-running cannabis research

490
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:18,220
you know geek fest that you could think

491
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:20,799
of and and but the cool thing about

492
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,569
going is that these are these I got to

493
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,639
hear botanists who've been studying

494
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:26,589
cannabis for like 45 years talk about

495
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,110
indica and sativa and they've done a lot

496
00:19:26,589 --> 00:19:31,029
of genetic analysis and so because

497
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:32,829
they're hearing feedback like you know

498
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:34,029
patients get told indica in the couch

499
00:19:32,829 --> 00:19:36,009
and things like that they know that

500
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:37,690
that's out there they decided to go

501
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:40,329
ahead and try to address that using

502
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:43,900
science so I just saw a talk recently

503
00:19:40,329 --> 00:19:45,819
where they they were looking at samples

504
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,880
from the United States Canada and across

505
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:51,769
the world and they were trying to say is

506
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,420
indica sativa a real phenotype can

507
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:55,970
you actually use that as a way to

508
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,529
recommend to patients and unfortunately

509
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,970
what they found that from genetic level

510
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,200
most of the things for session

511
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,140
specifically in the United States are

512
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:06,200
mostly hybrid so it's really hard to

513
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:08,450
lean on those those old paradigms about

514
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,860
indica and sativa but I think that there

515
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:12,710
is something that we can take away from

516
00:20:09,859 --> 00:20:14,869
the indica sativa myth which is I think

517
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:18,110
that indica and sativa are sort of

518
00:20:14,869 --> 00:20:19,509
correlating with profiles of terpenes so

519
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:22,009
I think that if we can certainly just

520
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:23,480
reimagine that there's still some truth

521
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:25,759
to it it's just that rather than

522
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,039
ascribing it to the word sativa or

523
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,180
indica it's really about the profile of

524
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:30,649
terpenes because I think that there's

525
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:32,269
almost a one-to-one correlation there

526
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:34,700
yeah I definitely agree with you on that

527
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:37,309
absolutely now it's about educating the

528
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,990
student as a client yeah the community

529
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:40,669
that you're in on looking for a

530
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:42,230
particular terpene that works with your

531
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:44,450
body system right

532
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,160
Linna Lowell being in lavender which is

533
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:49,190
calming and relaxing you're gonna look

534
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,560
for a fruity purpley yummy cannabis the

535
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:54,230
smell that has that same entire like

536
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:56,629
terpene profile it's gonna do the same

537
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:59,809
thing for you so it's about educating

538
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:01,970
people on a much much deeper level than

539
00:20:59,809 --> 00:21:04,609
just like hey let me grab that one jar

540
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:08,569
that says indica which from what you're

541
00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:10,009
saying might not be so let's move on I

542
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:13,789
there is something that I want to talk

543
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:15,650
with you about about hemp and cannabis

544
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:17,599
this is happening a lot in our

545
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:20,840
communities it's been happening for a

546
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,579
very long time with the explosion of CBD

547
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:24,829
that we started to see a few years ago

548
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:26,029
it's really interesting whenever I

549
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:27,649
talked to patients

550
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:29,149
I talked to clients and I talked to

551
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:32,360
students I talked to people around the

552
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:34,759
world on what they believe that is can

553
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:37,399
you from your perspective of being a

554
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:39,890
grower and focusing in that direction in

555
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:42,290
science more clinical I want that

556
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:45,350
described very clearly for our audience

557
00:21:42,289 --> 00:21:46,519
okay so I'm sure that for a lot of

558
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:47,750
people I'm gonna say it's not new but

559
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:50,119
we'll just get it out there so we have a

560
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,819
platform a common sort of place to start

561
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:56,209
talking from so hemp and cannabis are

562
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:57,980
the same plant scientifically it was the

563
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,019
government who's creating a few buckets

564
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,509
for them right and it's it's based on

565
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:05,869
artificial designation

566
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:07,669
of the level of THC makes one hemp and

567
00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:09,259
one cannabis but they're the same thing

568
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:11,150
but that's it that doesn't mean there's

569
00:22:09,259 --> 00:22:13,519
not phenotypic differences much like

570
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:15,080
among dogs some varieties of dogs you

571
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,990
have your large dogs your small dogs

572
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:20,089
working dogs and lap dogs and you know

573
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:22,400
all everything in between cannabis is

574
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:25,819
the same so breeders of industrial have

575
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,559
have over time move the properties of

576
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:29,418
industrial hemp so that they have long

577
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:30,529
fibers and so that they are good at what

578
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:32,179
they're supposed to do which is be

579
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:33,529
building materials and such right but

580
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:35,570
and that's why I'm at because the

581
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:37,428
consumers are looking at CBD based

582
00:22:35,569 --> 00:22:41,720
products and from that type of heavy

583
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:43,790
industry exactly exactly whereas that

584
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,250
make schema in general cannabis has been

585
00:22:43,789 --> 00:22:48,200
used more medically will say and reckon

586
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:50,750
and as a product for consumption

587
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,160
so therefore the properties that the

588
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,179
breeders were looking for were different

589
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,890
they were looking for higher production

590
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:57,590
of oil and things that you know higher

591
00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:00,590
THC levels let's just be real and so

592
00:22:57,589 --> 00:23:02,389
there's been a drift between what is

593
00:23:00,589 --> 00:23:05,058
classically called industrial hemp and

594
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,440
classically called cannabis but they're

595
00:23:05,058 --> 00:23:09,649
still the same print and they will still

596
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,570
breed right so that that shows you that

597
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,309
they're the same but that said what

598
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:16,369
we're finding is that in the world there

599
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:20,418
are pockets of germ plasm or people who

600
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:22,668
still have in plant repositories ancient

601
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:25,700
strains of cannabis and that are sort of

602
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:27,740
it not as differentiated and there are

603
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,830
people in the world like the colorado

604
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:33,230
hemp project that people who are trying

605
00:23:30,829 --> 00:23:36,168
to really nurture

606
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:39,410
cannabis strains that have THC below

607
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:41,450
that limit that makes them makes them

608
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:44,480
happen but that are still good producers

609
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:46,610
of oil and but these are really isolated

610
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,140
people in the world in general if you're

611
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:50,000
talking about stuff you order off the

612
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,710
internet it could be industrial hemp

613
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,410
from China or it could be you know and

614
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,090
so what I think most of the people who

615
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:59,500
order these products don't understand is

616
00:23:56,089 --> 00:24:02,209
that CBD within the industry is more

617
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:04,220
controlled than out there in the

618
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:06,819
marketplace so but absolutely and I see

619
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,319
people come to me all the time with

620
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:11,599
convenience store or CBD and it drives

621
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:13,099
me absolutely nuts as I travel around

622
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:14,480
the country yeah

623
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:16,668
thing is they're getting the best they

624
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,380
can get and I kind of say what's like a

625
00:24:16,669 --> 00:24:20,240
raw food desert if you're in the middle

626
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,419
of the country and all you can have is a

627
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,660
salad from fast food restaurant at least

628
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:28,370
it's a salad but let me educate you let

629
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,750
me sit with you for 20 minutes and tell

630
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:32,000
you why that's not the right thing for

631
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,859
your body system and so that's where I

632
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
get super passionate you guys want to

633
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:36,979
threw it in there real quick

634
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,690
yeah okay so let's talk about the

635
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,150
entourage effect we had this discussion

636
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:43,519
the other day and we were on this topic

637
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:46,100
for a very long period of time this is

638
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,839
the hot button word a lot of people as

639
00:24:46,099 --> 00:24:49,519
I'm interviewing them or speaking with

640
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,519
them I also do a podcast and so I

641
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:54,048
interview people this is the word that

642
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:56,900
they're using and we had this great

643
00:24:54,048 --> 00:25:00,379
conversation about it's not just about

644
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:02,840
THC it's like the entourage effect makes

645
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,940
you think that there's one shiny star

646
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:09,109
and everything else is just surrounding

647
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:11,210
it right Oh show yeah yeah okay but do

648
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:12,408
you had a great story that I'd love for

649
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,269
you to share with me again if you'd like

650
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:16,370
sure yeah so one of the things that

651
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:18,740
we've done in our basic research is

652
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:20,658
we've been trying to take the complexity

653
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:22,609
of whole plants and then through the use

654
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:23,690
of things that are more common to the

655
00:25:22,609 --> 00:25:25,009
pharmaceutical industry because they're

656
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,048
called high-throughput screening and

657
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:28,579
medical model is an animal testing and

658
00:25:27,048 --> 00:25:32,240
such like that we've been trying to

659
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:34,099
determine what what assortment of

660
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,019
ingredients from a from a whole plant

661
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:38,089
extract do you absolutely need to be

662
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:39,650
able to have high clinical value and

663
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:42,048
what we're finding is that single

664
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:43,700
ingredients barely move the needle when

665
00:25:42,048 --> 00:25:45,589
it comes to clinical effectiveness the

666
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,960
power of whole plant medicine comes in

667
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:49,699
the combinations of compounds that are

668
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,679
in those plants when when we start our

669
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,210
analysis and when we start to look at

670
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,860
the readouts of if we measure the

671
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:56,090
ingredients separately most of them

672
00:25:54,859 --> 00:25:57,769
don't have any signal at all so we

673
00:25:56,089 --> 00:26:00,230
realized that if we didn't have access

674
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:04,250
to the whole plants we never would have

675
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:06,529
found the right mixtures and so but what

676
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:08,119
we're finding is in most of the pet so

677
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:09,038
we've also filed patents on these and

678
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:11,298
that we're doing them for specific

679
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,569
conditions like pet Parkinson's disease

680
00:26:11,298 --> 00:26:16,009
Alzheimer's disease neuropathic pain

681
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:17,569
cardiovascular diseases but one of the

682
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:22,490
common themes that our research seems to

683
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:24,529
be that THC isn't always the star and in

684
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,559
fact in all of those conditions that I

685
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:27,269
just mentioned

686
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:30,450
isn't a part of the formulation that we

687
00:26:27,269 --> 00:26:32,730
ended up with when we did a screen CBD

688
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:35,460
is important in South about 25 percent

689
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:38,069
so what we're seeing and this is really

690
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,630
early research is that the next wave of

691
00:26:38,069 --> 00:26:41,399
cannabis medicines is really going to

692
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:43,320
leverage minor cameras and terpenes a

693
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,660
whole lot more and specifically in

694
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:46,799
mixtures and nobody haven't many big

695
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,600
pharma companies that have stepped up

696
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,430
and say you know what I'm gonna go to

697
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,619
the FDA with something that has nine

698
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:54,570
ingredients but we are we've got a

699
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:56,309
pharmaceutical composition that we're

700
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:58,019
going to try to take the FDA next year

701
00:26:56,309 --> 00:27:00,750
he's got nine and group active

702
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:02,639
ingredients and so but what we can what

703
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,710
we're trying to show is that the power

704
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,090
of this kind of medicine is in the

705
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,950
combinations and we've done a lot of

706
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:09,899
like the geeky science stuff to show you

707
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:10,890
need all of those ingredients and that's

708
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,540
what you should take away from whole

709
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:14,640
plant medicine it's not just that it has

710
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:17,430
THC or CBD it's that it has the whole

711
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,830
assortment and that for molecular

712
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:21,210
synergy Molecular synergy so we've tried

713
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:22,500
it stucks not call it entourage effect

714
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,000
and try to call it molecular synergy

715
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:25,980
these molecules work better together

716
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,900
than they do apart and that's the

717
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:31,920
powerful plant medicine yeah it's fair

718
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:34,259
yeah okay I think that we are about

719
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,330
wrapped up and you had a couple okay

720
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:40,440
well we can continue go if there's any

721
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:46,379
questions that you may have we'll take a

722
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:51,360
few for Q&amp;A can we go right into Q&amp;A all

723
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:53,910
right going again yep go ahead is that

724
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:56,219
if we could if we could encourage people

725
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:59,100
to do one thing is try to find ways to

726
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:00,600
label beyond CBD and THC I know it's

727
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:01,829
gonna be hard but I've there are in

728
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:03,509
different states I've been talking with

729
00:28:01,829 --> 00:28:05,309
people who are either using color coding

730
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:06,990
or there's lots of different tricks that

731
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:09,869
we can use to help break down the

732
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:11,069
complexity so that when patients go to a

733
00:28:09,869 --> 00:28:13,199
dispensary they can get the same thing

734
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:17,009
every time right that's super important

735
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,630
for maintaining their health and so but

736
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:20,730
none of this is going to happen without

737
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:23,160
patient education and money has to come

738
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:25,740
from somewhere so we need to we need to

739
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:27,750
as an industry be putting rolling back

740
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,109
into patient education and basic

741
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:30,109
research

742
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:40,699
[Laughter]

743
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:40,699
[Applause]

744
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:47,659
does it affect so does the delivery

745
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:50,509
method of a turn hundred percent of okay

746
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:55,549
so what what would you talk to me tell

747
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:58,069
me what well that was it chirping is the

748
00:28:55,548 --> 00:29:01,249
delivery system Atlanta stand a Charpy

749
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:03,618
fact the the effect on the body of the

750
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:07,639
terpene absolutely what would be in your

751
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:10,368
opinion like three of the best delivery

752
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:11,928
methods for turkeys to get you by system

753
00:29:10,368 --> 00:29:13,488
it would depend on to make an effect

754
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:15,379
okay it would depend on the particular

755
00:29:13,489 --> 00:29:17,358
body system that you were wanting work

756
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:19,308
with so let's narrow that down saying

757
00:29:17,358 --> 00:29:20,928
like the nervous system for example if

758
00:29:19,308 --> 00:29:24,739
you're doing it for the nervous system

759
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:26,479
the best delivery method would possibly

760
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:27,528
be depending on the person the age I

761
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:29,538
mean there's a lot of things that go

762
00:29:27,528 --> 00:29:31,190
into that you have to dial it in but

763
00:29:29,538 --> 00:29:33,408
once you do that then you look at

764
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:35,179
possible tinctures tinctures are going

765
00:29:33,409 --> 00:29:37,879
to be the easiest way to get that into

766
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:40,070
the body system the digestive system

767
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:41,898
works completely different though if

768
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:43,489
you're doing an edible and it breaks

769
00:29:41,898 --> 00:29:45,199
down in your intestines that's a

770
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:47,088
completely different thing we've all had

771
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,278
that happen we've had the brownie and

772
00:29:47,088 --> 00:29:52,460
then you know three hours later and then

773
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:55,278
four hours later sibling was great

774
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:57,739
sibling was great I work mostly with non

775
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:59,808
psychoactive cannabis and so getting

776
00:29:57,739 --> 00:30:01,639
those particular the body system or the

777
00:29:59,808 --> 00:30:04,098
the way that the dosage method that I

778
00:30:01,638 --> 00:30:07,608
suggest for most people are sublinguals

779
00:30:04,098 --> 00:30:10,038
tinctures and topicals but it depends on

780
00:30:07,608 --> 00:30:14,269
what particular body system is needing

781
00:30:10,038 --> 00:30:15,348
that medicine right so from the producer

782
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:17,929
side there's some challenges with

783
00:30:15,348 --> 00:30:21,019
terpenes terpenes as chemicals are

784
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:23,629
lighter and so when you're trying to

785
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:26,329
prepare cannabis based product so they

786
00:30:23,628 --> 00:30:29,478
just naturally go into the air right so

787
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:32,418
no co there is a no so there is a real

788
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:34,308
challenge to so if you have a whole

789
00:30:32,419 --> 00:30:35,899
plant if you're talking about flour then

790
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:37,398
this is less of a problem right like

791
00:30:35,898 --> 00:30:38,808
what will matter there is how it was

792
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:41,478
cured because you can use a lot of

793
00:30:38,808 --> 00:30:43,069
terpenes depending upon how that that

794
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:44,660
raw plant material is cured

795
00:30:43,069 --> 00:30:47,779
and process before it gets into the bag

796
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:50,269
or jar right but for terpenes when it

797
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:52,039
comes to extraction different extraction

798
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:53,299
methods usually the terpenes to end up

799
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:56,299
in a different fraction or different

800
00:30:53,299 --> 00:30:59,180
part of the equation from the

801
00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:00,799
cannabinoids so it's yeah so that's

802
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,299
where some people are getting creative

803
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,069
with like the juicing and stuff so that

804
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:05,240
so you're taking a raw plant and juicing

805
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:07,789
probably is going to give you the most

806
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,859
natural blend of the terpenes that were

807
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:11,180
in the original plant however you know

808
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:13,339
if you want a more convenience of some

809
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:15,080
of these other methods what producers

810
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:17,059
have to do is you have to then add them

811
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:18,949
back usually because in an attraction

812
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:20,750
method usually likes at the end up in

813
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,819
different places so in the final product

814
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,589
you have to add them back and then with

815
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:26,480
respect to their absorption into the

816
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:29,089
body that's challenging too because like

817
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,849
I said nursing one of the most common

818
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:33,169
terpenes out there is the smallest and

819
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:36,079
the most likely to end up in the air

820
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:38,029
great so yeah in some of the trials that

821
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:39,409
we're doing we're showing that has and

822
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,450
other people know this too is that it

823
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:43,580
has a high potential for pain relief but

824
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:44,930
how do you actually get it into the

825
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:46,759
product that you're trying to take and

826
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:50,720
how do you you how do you not lose that

827
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:51,650
the terpenes yes yeah so one of the

828
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,180
things that we're doing but this is

829
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,950
still experimental is we're doing

830
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:57,380
something called creating nanoparticles

831
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:59,690
nanoparticles make them heavier and

832
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,070
compatible and they increase the

833
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,289
bioavailability but like I said these

834
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:05,089
are sort of next-gen type stuff but one

835
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:06,889
of the things to be careful of right now

836
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,209
with the stuff you're consuming if you

837
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,040
want to make sure there's terpenes in

838
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,990
there as figure out how they processed

839
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:13,430
it the thing that's closest to fresh and

840
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:17,599
raw is going to be the closest to the

841
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:20,509
real terpene profile yeah and read

842
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,679
labels I think we touched on it a little

843
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:24,769
bit but I think that we're really

844
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:27,680
pushing getting everything tested know

845
00:32:24,769 --> 00:32:29,960
what is in your product know what's in

846
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,759
your product there's so many times I go

847
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,100
and I ask someone to go into dispensary

848
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:35,839
or I go in myself and I look at the

849
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:38,539
label and it just says this percentage

850
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:39,949
Tse this percentage CBD and I said what

851
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:42,139
plant did this come from

852
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:43,970
what is the terpene profile what's the

853
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,070
cannabis fingerprint it's not on there

854
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:48,200
yeah so how can this be good for this

855
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:51,500
particular ailment that I'm trying to

856
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:53,240
you know get down to the and one of the

857
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,259
things that's true so make sure we're

858
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,299
advocates and as

859
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:57,799
producers in producing single strain

860
00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:01,730
whole plant extracts but those are super

861
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:04,730
rare okay and so you know so there's got

862
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:06,200
to be also feedback to the people who

863
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,519
are creating the products and to the

864
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,319
only the whole system has to understand

865
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,059
that there is a demand for that because

866
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:12,919
right now the kinds of things that

867
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:15,559
people ask for in dispensaries are

868
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,910
usually pretty straightforward but if

869
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:18,740
we're ever going to get beyond where we

870
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,779
are today in sort of the next gen of

871
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:22,519
what cannabis medicine can be it's not

872
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:24,440
just on our side we can make these

873
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:26,000
products but if nobody buys them and if

874
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,440
we haven't educated people to understand

875
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,089
why they need to buy them we'll never

876
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,890
get out of this phase well to the next

877
00:33:29,089 --> 00:33:32,329
phase where cannabis medicines are

878
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:33,710
considered of course we're using

879
00:33:32,329 --> 00:33:36,079
cannabis for this that's where we need

880
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:37,700
to be it's coming we're just educating

881
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:41,059
at which in the education I have a

882
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:44,660
question of alkaline water and cannabis

883
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:46,639
a combination of how applying water can

884
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:49,190
open up and give more oxygen to the

885
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,050
plant to consume I want to know if you

886
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:56,029
guys have any studies or heard anything

887
00:33:51,049 --> 00:33:58,909
about that I have been approached by a

888
00:33:56,029 --> 00:34:01,069
vendor who provides out the water but I

889
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:03,740
have not seen studies that support

890
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:05,210
claims just from Agassi I'm just saying

891
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,799
I don't have any evidence to evaluate

892
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:08,840
alright if I would tell you from a

893
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,918
logical perspective I would imagine it

894
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,260
would be really healing because it's

895
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:15,049
very healing to the human body yes right

896
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:22,730
but there is no studies that I know of

897
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:26,389
yeah thank you for that question just

898
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:27,980
I've been hearing about flavonoids is

899
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:29,899
that a different term is that something

900
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:31,878
else I just read it that's better than

901
00:34:29,898 --> 00:34:34,069
aspirin or something cuz we read that

902
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:36,440
too and very exciting yeah so we're big

903
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:38,000
we're being advocates of learning all

904
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,490
the compounds of the plant that are

905
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,750
potentially active so like when I quoted

906
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:44,329
this there's a study that showed that

907
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:46,250
there's over 480 compounds in the

908
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:47,960
cannabis plant that could be potential

909
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,628
drugs because they have bio activity and

910
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,190
so there's the cannabinoids there's the

911
00:34:50,628 --> 00:34:53,960
terpenes but there's also the flavonoids

912
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,849
and there's other compounds too that are

913
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,470
that are in that commission so but

914
00:34:55,849 --> 00:34:59,360
here's the thing the studies are so

915
00:34:57,469 --> 00:35:00,919
early yet but I think that's gonna be

916
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:04,099
one of them are active areas of research

917
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,840
and to that GB is actually sponsored

918
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:06,710
trial what we're doing in with the

919
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,088
University of Athens

920
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,740
Greece where we're doing something

921
00:35:08,088 --> 00:35:11,659
called metabolomic analysis where we're

922
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:13,489
looking where we've defined that these

923
00:35:11,659 --> 00:35:15,469
plant strains seem to be good at this

924
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:16,519
and we're looking at not just the can of

925
00:35:15,469 --> 00:35:18,348
- and terpenes that are in there but

926
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:19,699
what are the other compounds that we

927
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:21,410
don't normally measure that could

928
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:23,449
potentially have clinical value so I

929
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:25,069
think you're right that is gonna be some

930
00:35:23,449 --> 00:35:30,348
brand new drug categories which will be

931
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:33,559
pretty awesome dr. small Howard did you

932
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:35,599
say that Mersin as a as a as a terpene

933
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:37,250
is good for pain relief today that is

934
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,010
what we've our work is still in

935
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:41,570
preclinical meaning we've done salivates

936
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,550
and we're doing animal trials right now

937
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:45,830
but the other thing that we've found is

938
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:47,690
that we were able to demonstrate that

939
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:50,358
mercy and a couple of the other terpenes

940
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:53,358
binds directly to receptors in the human

941
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:55,489
body that regulate pain so it's not just

942
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:57,019
we put some stuff in there and it seems

943
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:59,299
to work we were looking at the molecular

944
00:35:57,019 --> 00:36:01,519
mechanism and then we've also used

945
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,769
nanoparticles to help because mercy was

946
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:05,509
so hard to deal with we put we put these

947
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:08,179
compounds into nanoparticles so it's

948
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:10,190
easier to orally dose them without them

949
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:11,210
floating into the air so my question was

950
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,920
I just wanted to make sure if you

951
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:15,949
correctly cuz you know it's on the prop

952
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,740
65 list right know that it is yeah there

953
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:20,719
are two marijuana smoke and mersin are

954
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:22,879
the two things in cannabis that that's

955
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:24,289
why we have to put the prop 65 warnings

956
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,059
and so I was just wondering if you knew

957
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:27,380
why I don't with that but that's

958
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:34,009
something I want to look into and write

959
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:37,760
a letter okay right so that's

960
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:40,990
interesting yeah we have time for one

961
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,990
more question yeah

962
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:52,338
a great talk dr. Nathan Schramm Here I

963
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:55,970
am in the sunscreen business as one of

964
00:36:52,338 --> 00:36:58,039
my businesses and we we make a sunscreen

965
00:36:55,969 --> 00:37:02,269
that's mineral based but um nano is a

966
00:36:58,039 --> 00:37:05,599
big no-no in sunscreen and the European

967
00:37:02,269 --> 00:37:08,119
Union is is regulating it heavily

968
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,070
because nano you know it passes through

969
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:13,190
cell membranes we don't know where it

970
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:14,630
ends up even in the environment for in

971
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:18,079
terms of like zinc oxide and titanium

972
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:19,820
dioxide which are in sunscreens it can

973
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,060
deposit into the coral reefs and be

974
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:26,210
damaging I'm wondering if if any of you

975
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:28,909
have concerns about nano and cannabis

976
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,230
and terpenes so let me address that so

977
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:32,118
certainly something we've considered

978
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:34,699
because at the end of the day we want to

979
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:37,820
be helping people right but like many

980
00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:41,449
fields nano means that nano technology

981
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:43,010
covers a huge variety of technology it

982
00:37:41,449 --> 00:37:43,879
there's nano and medicine there's nano

983
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,490
in paint

984
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,680
there's nano and building materials

985
00:37:46,489 --> 00:37:50,629
there so nano is touches a lot of our

986
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:53,750
lives that we don't even know and so

987
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:55,940
there are both responsible molecules

988
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:57,309
that you can use in building nano that

989
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,659
have already been tested like

990
00:37:57,309 --> 00:38:01,009
extensively and then there's ones where

991
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:03,379
they're showing either bioaccumulation

992
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:05,150
or potential toxicity so we are very

993
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,829
cognizant of that and we're trying to

994
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,599
steer away from things that don't

995
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:11,030
already have a safety profile that's

996
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:13,670
established but but you're right that

997
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:15,859
the nano because people don't understand

998
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:18,530
the whole breadth of the field is a hot

999
00:38:15,858 --> 00:38:19,818
button but on the other hand what was

1000
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:22,849
the thing that made me a believer in

1001
00:38:19,818 --> 00:38:24,170
nano is that at the University of

1002
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:26,230
Sevilla they published a study where

1003
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:29,150
they had taken a derivative of THC

1004
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:31,159
called CB 13 and put it in a

1005
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:33,559
time-release nanoparticle and they

1006
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:36,618
orally dosed with a single oral dose to

1007
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:39,710
a rodent in a neuropathic pain model one

1008
00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:41,809
dose gave 11 days worth of relief to in

1009
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:44,150
that mouse model whereas the same

1010
00:38:41,809 --> 00:38:45,858
compound without the nano gave 8 hours

1011
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:48,829
I'm not saying out eight hours his son

1012
00:38:45,858 --> 00:38:50,598
is horrible but what if we could extend

1013
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:52,609
the therapeutic window of cannabinoids

1014
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:54,740
in a way that was controlled like that's

1015
00:38:52,608 --> 00:38:58,098
just for me that was the future so but I

1016
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:59,019
see every advance also has potential

1017
00:38:58,099 --> 00:39:08,680
pitfalls so it's good

1018
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:11,139
the people keep on that no thank you

1019
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,549
guys so much have a wonderful time at

1020
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:16,138
your ab and a great weekend

1021
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:16,139
