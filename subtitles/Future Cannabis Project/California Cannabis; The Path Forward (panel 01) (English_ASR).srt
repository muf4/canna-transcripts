3
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:33,780
when Peter suggested the idea of doing a

4
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:36,420
panel and letting me moderate I was like

5
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,760
I like jumped out I'm like oh gosh for

6
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,579
once I can ask the questions and sort of

7
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:44,539
sit back and relax so I'm really excited

8
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:47,849
about it a little bit nervous too but

9
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:49,530
anyway just to let you know as Peter

10
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,870
said the three licensing authorities

11
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:54,480
have just finished their 45-day comment

12
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:56,789
period I know for the bureau we're

13
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,199
looking at thousands of comments that

14
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:00,780
have come through so that's pretty

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:02,219
incredible that we're getting that many

16
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,829
comments and we're going through them

17
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,868
but I think tonight is a perfect now

18
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:09,209
that we are done with that comment

19
00:01:06,868 --> 00:01:11,640
period and looking through those regs

20
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:15,239
it's a perfect I did a perfect time to

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,159
get the industry's perspective on what

22
00:01:15,239 --> 00:01:18,719
we should be looking at what we should

23
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:20,969
be changing and just get their

24
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,618
perspective so even tonight I'm gonna be

25
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:23,969
doing a lot of listening because I want

26
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:25,859
to hear from them and how things are

27
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:28,439
going for them but before we get started

28
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:30,239
I'm gonna let them each introduce

29
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,719
themselves and then we'll get started

30
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:35,489
with the questions hi everybody I'm

distributor can imagine it's very

38
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:54,390
interesting to be a lab right now I'm

62
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:51,080
finest brand okay well thank you so I

63
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,090
you know I have us the first ones maybe

64
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:55,610
a softball but now that we're looking at

65
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,950
eight months into the legalized

66
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,290
regulated market and I know from the

67
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:01,969
bureau's perspective for each part of

68
00:03:00,289 --> 00:03:04,789
the supply chain we've had our own

69
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:07,639
challenges in regulating so I wanted to

70
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:09,739
get your perspective on how it has been

71
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:12,139
for you the last eight months and being

72
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:14,480
in this regulated market and especially

73
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:16,099
how have you continued to deal with the

74
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,929
changes that come down because we always

75
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:19,699
talk about the regulator's you know we

76
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:23,450
keep changing things on you and so I'm

77
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:26,750
curious how you've dealt with that you

78
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:28,339
know you have to stay nimble and you

79
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,810
have to be on top of it I think the

80
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,180
worst thing you can do is refer to

81
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,680
lawyers to interpret the regulations for

82
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,810
you instead of as a business operator

83
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,180
being engaged in them in a line-by-line

84
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,620
fashion and I think that's where some

85
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:42,079
people have been caught unawares at

86
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,670
times where they're relying on others to

87
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:45,140
interpret for them rather than as I say

88
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:47,298
as operators actually being fully

89
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:48,858
engaged in the text of the regulations

90
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:51,560
but I think some of the biggest

91
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:53,239
challenges have been to on the lab side

92
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,060
is the the marketing right over the

93
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,219
regulations is is to help guide people

94
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,780
through things they feel are

95
00:03:58,219 --> 00:04:01,219
unreasonable are things they don't feel

96
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,109
like they should have to do and help

97
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:05,090
explain and understand to them that this

98
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,680
path forward represents one where we're

99
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,810
taking some extraordinary measures

100
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,000
around the protection of consumer safety

101
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,979
because we lack a certain body of data

102
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,318
so I think one of the biggest challenges

103
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:17,000
has been really been to communicate to

104
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:19,038
the people who are the users of lab

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,199
testing in this current market maybe why

106
00:04:19,038 --> 00:04:24,288
some of the things that are in place are

107
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:28,189
there in terms of being able to react to

108
00:04:24,288 --> 00:04:30,288
the changing regulations mostly you have

109
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:31,819
to anticipate when you get an initial

110
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:33,620
draft of regulations you need to take

111
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:35,990
them almost as if that's what's going to

112
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,579
be because if you wait until the end of

113
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,840
a comment period implementation then

114
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:39,589
you'll find yourself probably too far

115
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:41,179
behind

116
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:42,949
so I think one of the struggles that

117
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,720
people have had is well I don't want to

118
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,810
spend money I don't have to write in

119
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,580
case this thing changes

120
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,230
let's say there's no heavy metals

121
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,300
requirement for example right I don't

122
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:53,580
want to buy an icp-ms if I don't have to

123
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,918
so I think making those decisions in

124
00:04:53,579 --> 00:04:58,168
anticipation of what could be while

125
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,299
trying to manage cash flow and and and

126
00:04:58,168 --> 00:05:04,469
capital is it's been challenging as a

127
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:10,350
business owner yeah absolutely all those

128
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:14,250
points so the I think probably the top

129
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:16,080
level thing I would say is the ultimate

130
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,478
goal was to transition people from the

131
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,120
black market to the regulated market and

132
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:23,430
for as a whole supply chain Enterprise

133
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,620
such as group of floor it's frustrating

134
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,720
talking for example to dispensary owners

135
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,310
explaining to them that the packaging we

136
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,389
have actually does comply with the law

137
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,240
and then getting into fights with them

138
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:34,978
about why it does or does not that gets

139
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,540
very tiresome so there's a lot of

140
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:38,370
unknown

141
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,020
I was actually mentioning to you Laurie

142
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,750
before the event there's a lot of

143
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:44,579
distrust politically there's also a lot

144
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,470
of distrust in our industry towards

145
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:49,680
politicians and I think that the more we

146
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:51,780
can you know connect and demystify a lot

147
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,668
of both ends of that be really useful

148
00:05:51,779 --> 00:06:01,409
for us I think the to see a larger

149
00:05:56,668 --> 00:06:03,029
rollout I think this has been less you

150
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,560
know explosive rollout than we had

151
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,478
anticipated so a lot of people spend a

152
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,530
lot of money and a lot of energy to gear

153
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:14,599
up for not a lot and so that's been very

154
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:14,599
frustrating I hope to see that evolve

155
00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:19,099
well interesting you mentioned the

156
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:21,329
packaging relationship with retailers

157
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,539
but before I get to that I would say a

158
00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:27,509
sort of on an overall 30,000 foot view

159
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:29,490
of this has been the educating and

160
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:32,459
talking to both the vendors and the

161
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,750
public because we have both basically to

162
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:36,750
deal with and the public has been very

163
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,699
frustrated with the rising prices and

164
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,970
the taxes and a lot of that sort of the

165
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:44,129
education around that component and then

166
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,600
also talking to the vendors and and like

167
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:47,399
some of us we're talking about before

168
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,129
everybody sort of has their own

169
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:51,419
interpretation on what's compliant and

170
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:54,389
what's not and

171
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:57,689
it kind of comes down to you know sort

172
00:06:54,389 --> 00:07:00,389
of making a determination of within the

173
00:06:57,689 --> 00:07:02,009
business of where you know where you're

174
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:04,439
gonna draw the line and what you believe

175
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:07,230
is going to be the right thing because

176
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:09,509
ultimately I think if if the intent is

177
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,160
there and you're trying your best to be

178
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:14,610
as compliant as you can in your own

179
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:18,150
capacity then you're doing as well as

180
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:20,430
you can but yeah so it's sort of just

181
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:22,849
been a balancing act and making sure I

182
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:32,730
think the July first transition was

183
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:36,150
fascinating it was it was yeah you know

184
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,620
it was it was inevitable and I think

185
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:39,089
that it were really we're in a really

186
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,340
interesting place in California being

187
00:07:39,089 --> 00:07:45,229
the largest cannabis market in the world

188
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:47,639
and you know having just one chief

189
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:50,879
overseeing the the largest cannabis

190
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,709
market and trying to fit all the supply

191
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,329
chains and together and and having

192
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:57,149
everybody talk to each other and making

193
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:59,519
sure that that it's working and that we

194
00:07:57,149 --> 00:08:02,009
all are on the basically the same page

195
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,049
so it is a heavy lift but I'm really

196
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:05,699
glad that it's happening and I think if

197
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:08,129
it's done right if people stay diligent

198
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:09,659
then it can be done oh it's not entirely

199
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:11,250
impossible but there's always going to

200
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,990
be challenges and always going to be

201
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,699
issues and then there's also the working

202
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,009
with the local jurisdiction I think has

203
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:18,269
also been a challenge and that seemed to

204
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:20,399
bring out a lot of players that had

205
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:22,199
never traditionally come out to

206
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,299
challenge anything regarding cannabis

207
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,659
BPG has been around for almost 20 years

208
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,220
and most of the community members seemed

209
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,600
fine with it and then all of a sudden

210
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,170
January 1st

211
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:36,210
there was this outpour of interest

212
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:38,610
groups that were completely opposed and

213
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:40,320
it was shocking because I nothing really

214
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,350
changed other than who we let in the

215
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,860
door and tweaking security measures so

216
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:48,750
that was kind of a challenge I agree

217
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:53,340
with much as much that has been said

218
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:54,419
already and you know to not repeat any

219
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,060
of that I would say that it really does

220
00:08:54,419 --> 00:09:01,039
feel like we are all you know we've all

221
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:04,259
got our map on how to try to succeed and

222
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,639
were each interpreting those words

223
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:08,039
slightly differently

224
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:10,649
as we make our way through this dark

225
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:14,069
forest because it's not there's no path

226
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:16,919
it's follow the map and that's been the

227
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,500
challenge is my impression or my

228
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:20,639
understanding of what these words say is

229
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,519
a little bit different than maybe

230
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:26,069
somebody else's and we've got to do

231
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,480
business together and and that creates

232
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:32,100
complexities and at the same time to

233
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,930
make a separate different point I think

234
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:39,990
that we're all able to understand and

235
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:42,750
measure the success of this growing

236
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:46,500
regulated market but we're not able to

237
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:48,480
measure the health and wellness of the

238
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,440
illicit market that we're trying to

239
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,810
deconstruct

240
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,480
and that presents a challenge to me

241
00:09:51,809 --> 00:09:57,389
because I can only understand whether

242
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,610
we're making progress as a regulated

243
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:04,230
market but not whether or not we are

244
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:06,000
gaining ground on the illicit market and

245
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,550
so I think that's a lot of really good

246
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,070
lead into what cultivators are facing

247
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:13,500
especially existing cultivators right we

248
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:16,590
have a cultivation system that breaks

249
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:19,320
cultivators in two sizes and scales them

250
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:22,379
right so you're 2,500 square feet or

251
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,050
you're below 5,000 or you're below 10 or

252
00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:29,129
22 or if you're outdoor you can have up

253
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:30,899
to an anchor and so California has a 20

254
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:33,870
year old cannabis industry that's trying

255
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:36,720
to wrap regulations around a very robust

256
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:40,740
existing industry this has not been done

257
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,350
before right in most states statute has

258
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,930
passed regulations happen in an industry

259
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:49,830
is burst right so here in California we

260
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:51,870
have a whole new paradigm where these

261
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:54,930
regulators are trying to figure out how

262
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:59,480
to fit a multi-billion dollar industry

263
00:10:54,929 --> 00:11:03,689
into a linear regulated box so to say so

264
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:06,240
for existing cultivators were were

265
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:09,510
having a lot of struggles we didn't we

266
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,789
didn't build our cultivation based on

267
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:13,559
you know five hundred square foot

268
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:15,870
increments or 5,000 square foot

269
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:18,659
increments we built them a lot of times

270
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:22,350
where they fit in the landscape

271
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:27,679
and so what we're really struggling with

272
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:31,949
are these challenges around how to have

273
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:33,870
12,000 square feet when the licenses are

274
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:37,078
ten thousand or twenty two right

275
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:39,328
economically you don't fit into 22,000

276
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:40,708
square foot license and you don't really

277
00:11:39,328 --> 00:11:43,859
fit into ten thousand because you have

278
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:46,169
12 thousand so a lot of our members and

279
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,050
the existing cultivators especially the

280
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:51,479
seasonal cultivators I find are really

281
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:56,068
struggling with how to fit their

282
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:59,610
existing operations into a regulated

283
00:11:56,068 --> 00:12:03,149
model that doesn't have flexibility

284
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:05,459
right it's really linear and the issues

285
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:08,309
around shared facilities if I have to

286
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:09,750
have two licenses because I'm 12,000

287
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:14,099
square feet I now can't share a

288
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:16,889
processing or a propagation area so we

289
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,649
have lots of providers that have been

290
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:22,399
working diligently to provide medicine

291
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:25,639
for patients over the last 20 years that

292
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,078
don't necessarily have the funding to

293
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,269
build new facilities nor do they have

294
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,129
the space or necessarily the land use

295
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:35,610
opportunities because of being located

296
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:38,789
rural E and they're on a glans and not

297
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:41,759
on commercial lands or industrial lands

298
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:43,469
so you know work we're kind of

299
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,740
constantly trying to figure out how to

300
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:49,949
fit into a system after years and years

301
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:54,379
of engaging and being involved in

302
00:12:49,948 --> 00:12:56,969
proposition 215 and SB 420 and feeling

303
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:59,100
kind of really pulled in a multitude of

304
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:02,278
ways so it's a little bit of a kind of

305
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:06,180
quicksand scenario for a lot of our

306
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:08,879
stakeholders and members so Sabrina

307
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:13,229
brought up an excellent point the July

308
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:15,269
1st transition so the Bureau took a lot

309
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,670
of heat when we did not extend the

310
00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:19,980
transition period there was a tremendous

311
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:22,528
amount of pressure on us to extend it we

312
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,699
did not we did not change our

313
00:13:22,528 --> 00:13:28,860
regulations and we did not extend it I'm

314
00:13:25,698 --> 00:13:30,959
one question two questions for the panel

315
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,669
how did you feel about that decision

316
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:37,410
and how did it affect your business

317
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:40,139
operations you know my personal feelings

318
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:42,569
about the decision were that I had been

319
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:45,269
approached by some retail operators and

320
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:47,580
other operators in the industry to to

321
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:50,819
put my name with those who were so we're

322
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:53,790
asking for an extension and for

323
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:55,680
ourselves as the laboratory an extension

324
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:57,389
wasn't really going to be material one

325
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,859
way or another in terms of readiness or

326
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:00,720
our execution because we were already

327
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,289
doing what we needed to do for July

328
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,500
first

329
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:06,240
but what I was seeing was that having to

330
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,340
do with the inventory that was being

331
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,440
held an evaluation of inventory that was

332
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:12,540
either owned by yourself or by another

333
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,940
party that you're in contract with that

334
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:16,379
the particulars around the ownerships of

335
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:20,630
those inventories and the date of its

336
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:22,980
production in some cases because the

337
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:24,990
deadlines either weren't understood or

338
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,610
anticipated with respect to when things

339
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,440
were manufactured or harvested and when

340
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:30,419
they could continue to be sold that I

341
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,760
became aware of certain people who I

342
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:34,409
personally cared about a lot that we're

343
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:35,819
going to take enormous losses that could

344
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:38,100
potentially put them out of business as

345
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:40,080
small business owners and so as a small

346
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:44,100
business owner entrepreneur I have a lot

347
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,440
of compassion for those people and I was

348
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,029
I was dismayed that they were having

349
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,270
such a negative impact because I've

350
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:53,100
known them since my company was founded

351
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:54,360
eight and a half years ago and to be in

352
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,310
business for eight and a half years or

353
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,360
ten years and suffer that kind of blow

354
00:14:56,309 --> 00:15:02,219
in one that you really can't affect and

355
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,269
maybe it's their own responsibility in

356
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,560
their own fault because they weren't

357
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:06,269
prepared or they weren't engaged and

358
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,250
that may have been what happened but it

359
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:10,079
was unfortunate just as from a

360
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,059
humanistic perspective it was

361
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:18,000
unfortunate to watch that happen for

362
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:20,609
people you know I personally I would

363
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,379
have liked to see an extension for all

364
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:27,180
the reasons that you said the I do

365
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:28,769
wonder though if we had extended I'm

366
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:30,269
sure this is part of what inform the

367
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:32,220
decision not to us would it have been

368
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:35,069
any different another six months hence

369
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,870
right so personally I would have liked

370
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:38,370
to see extension an extension because I

371
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:41,480
think that it needs to be a smoother

372
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:43,519
transition from the

373
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,249
the unregulated to the regulated market

374
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,509
from a business perspective though

375
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:49,999
anticipated that it would be held hard

376
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:53,688
and so to that July date

377
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:55,519
so we amped up for it and there was a

378
00:15:53,688 --> 00:15:58,368
lot of market share to be got during

379
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,220
that period of salt and then lastly just

380
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:02,899
you know kind of embarrassed by the

381
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,850
Instagram and social media posts of just

382
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:07,278
all these empty shelves throughout our

383
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,889
state one of the biggest you know

384
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:12,350
concerns I have is the the lack of

385
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:16,428
dispensaries in our in our market being

386
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:18,589
a supply chain company so I hope to see

387
00:16:16,428 --> 00:16:20,600
those shelves filled again and that's

388
00:16:18,589 --> 00:16:25,279
robust market so it's a little scary how

389
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,928
much of a reset it was yeah I agree I

390
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:30,109
think it would have been delaying the

391
00:16:26,928 --> 00:16:32,208
inevitable if you had just moved it and

392
00:16:30,109 --> 00:16:36,949
there the reactions would have been the

393
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:39,048
same it I made sure that you know that

394
00:16:36,948 --> 00:16:41,269
the buyers at BPG were in communication

395
00:16:39,048 --> 00:16:43,249
with their vendors to make sure that

396
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:45,109
they were as prepared as they can be and

397
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:47,720
and you know how that communication gets

398
00:16:45,109 --> 00:16:50,239
through and whether it's received on

399
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,239
that and I I don't know but I I I think

400
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:55,129
that it definitely helped to provide a

401
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:56,869
sort of a process for them because a lot

402
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:58,639
of them didn't really know what to do or

403
00:16:56,869 --> 00:17:02,028
what was even going on or that there was

404
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,829
even a July first deadline and you know

405
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:06,380
just and to ensure that we did have

406
00:17:03,828 --> 00:17:08,148
enough products and and you know didn't

407
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,610
lose out on any of that and all of the

408
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:12,979
testing and Berklee's testing standards

409
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:14,298
have always been extremely high than the

410
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,558
highest in the state so most of the

411
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:18,199
vendors that we worked with we're pretty

412
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:20,838
used to you know meeting those rules

413
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:23,360
anyways so the testing wasn't as much of

414
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:25,158
an issue as the packaging and labeling

415
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,078
which also kicked off a lot of

416
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:29,720
discussions and arguments but I think

417
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:31,548
that yeah I mean it better to happen now

418
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,278
and to have everybody adjust right now

419
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:36,349
if this is all it's inevitable and you

420
00:17:34,278 --> 00:17:38,960
know we've been fighting for this for a

421
00:17:36,349 --> 00:17:40,730
really long time and here we are so this

422
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,159
is what it looks like and I just look at

423
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:46,429
it as growing pains and you know it's

424
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:48,679
it's really hard to see you know like

425
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:51,559
you said some of the these own smaller

426
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:53,600
business owners that just don't have the

427
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:55,160
resources or the bandwidth to really

428
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:56,990
keep up with all of

429
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:59,690
things and find themselves in a

430
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:02,420
situation where they're not completely

431
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:04,820
able to comply to the extent that they

432
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:08,000
can get their stuff online right away I

433
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:10,669
think a lot of this is a very flexible

434
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,200
creative industry that has managed to

435
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:15,259
survive through many challenges in the

436
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:18,170
past and I think that that spirit will

437
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:21,859
continue on and people can be innovative

438
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:25,360
and and find a way so I think it was it

439
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:28,939
was good yeah I would say that despite

440
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:31,490
preparation beginning in June for the

441
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:35,299
July 1st changes the end of that grace

442
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:40,130
period you know flow Cana suffered

443
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:43,069
significantly in early July as we didn't

444
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:46,280
agree with our retail clients on what

445
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:48,919
were the packaging requirements and that

446
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:51,200
was that was really challenging to not

447
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,000
see eye to eye have us all trying to

448
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,350
comply but disagree about what the rules

449
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,390
said that was very challenging and at

450
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:02,359
the same time despite the pain that we

451
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:04,520
felt and what I assume many many

452
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:07,399
companies felt I would say that I still

453
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:10,069
salute the BCC for not flexing on that

454
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,310
because this is the beginning of the

455
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:14,869
relationship of there's an open period

456
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:16,940
where we all get to talk about what the

457
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:19,009
rules should be and then we will enforce

458
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,990
the rules and so I salute you for

459
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:23,529
enforcing the rules when it was time to

460
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:27,559
enforce the rules and we learned that

461
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:30,410
this is this is a sort of a weak link

462
00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:32,089
situation a weakest link situation in

463
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:33,680
the industry where those who and we're

464
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:36,039
gonna confront it again in the near

465
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:39,230
future probably when these regs go final

466
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:43,730
we will have those who didn't prepare

467
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:45,740
enough and businesses will choose oh

468
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,610
you're not prepared I'm not going to do

469
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,440
business with you right now

470
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:51,049
and that may be a make-or-break moment

471
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,509
for those who didn't prepare and yet

472
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:54,379
that is the way this industry and any

473
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:56,629
industry works

474
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,700
you know it's competition and we can

475
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:02,290
seek to out-compete each other on

476
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:04,600
compliance to the state's benefit

477
00:20:02,289 --> 00:20:06,670
and I think a lot of farmers were kind

478
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:08,500
of caught off guard I mean granted the

479
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,660
transition period was published but

480
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,019
we're transitioning away from kind of a

481
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:15,580
bulk flour market so traditionally

482
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:17,980
cultivators have provided bulk flour

483
00:20:15,579 --> 00:20:19,960
into the retail sector and that's how

484
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,360
it's gone into vending departments so a

485
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,210
lot of cultivators weren't prepared for

486
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:28,269
packaging they didn't have a brand they

487
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:30,370
didn't have containers they're used to

488
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:32,589
bringing whole pound units and then

489
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:36,579
having the dispensary packaged and so

490
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:40,589
when you're in a position to try to or

491
00:20:36,579 --> 00:20:43,359
have to start figuring out packaging

492
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:46,750
first of all the timeframe on that is

493
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:49,179
you know six to six months to a year to

494
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,950
just try to figure out how to source and

495
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:54,460
how to put together compliant packaging

496
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:57,130
so as humble its finest we started our

497
00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:01,660
rebrand for compliant packaging in

498
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:04,270
January and what we what came what we

499
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:06,160
came up against was that as early as

500
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:08,139
April the distributors we were working

501
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,330
with were like oh no no we're not taking

502
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:12,460
anymore product unless it's prepped for

503
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:14,529
July and we're like oh my gosh this is

504
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:18,100
kind of crushing because here we have

505
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:19,539
packaged product that you know should

506
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:22,299
have been able to be on the shelves

507
00:21:19,539 --> 00:21:24,430
until July and then our our distributors

508
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:26,200
were kicking it back because they didn't

509
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:28,690
want to have anything in their stock

510
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,090
right come July 1st that wasn't

511
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,920
compliant so we'd already been doing the

512
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:35,109
testing and for us it was dealing with

513
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,120
the child resistant packaging component

514
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:39,459
especially when we looked at pre rolls

515
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:41,349
we do a lot of pre roll cigarette or

516
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,930
cannabis cigarettes so trying to figure

517
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:46,929
out how to especially in single serving

518
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:49,259
sizes manage that CRP component was

519
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:52,570
really challenging and it was expensive

520
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:55,119
but we're there and I think if people

521
00:21:52,569 --> 00:21:56,980
didn't plan you know six nine months in

522
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:00,219
advance they really got caught off guard

523
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:02,079
with it and so it's it's a yeah

524
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,759
basically have a point person that you

525
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,149
could put on that and the resources to

526
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,440
do it to be prepared as what we found

527
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,940
you know one point to add on I think

528
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,640
that was actually really important about

529
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,830
the July transition that's very focused

530
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,090
on the lab sector was the increase in

531
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:17,740
testing requirements

532
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:19,808
they increase in the compound lists

533
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,339
because the phase one pesticide list

534
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:23,168
really didn't encompass what's normally

535
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:24,220
used on cannabis and the things that

536
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:27,820
were usually the most concerned about

537
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,980
finding and so I think that delaying the

538
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:31,210
implementation of the face to pesticide

539
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:36,490
list especially would have definitely

540
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:38,380
been an error yeah that's really it's

541
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:40,599
really helpful to from your perspective

542
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,659
one of the things as regulators we're

543
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:45,308
constantly looking at is how we can how

544
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:47,700
we can make the supply chain more

545
00:22:45,308 --> 00:22:51,908
efficient because it is a cannabis

546
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:54,038
product is a very difficult commodity to

547
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:56,200
get to market in an efficient timeframe

548
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:59,528
so we're always looking at we're also

549
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,899
balancing between retail and supplier

550
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:04,359
and manufacturer because we feel like

551
00:23:01,898 --> 00:23:07,479
you can't what's good for one isn't

552
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:11,229
always good for all so I would love to

553
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:13,778
hear from your perspective on the things

554
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:17,829
that we can control in regulations can

555
00:23:13,778 --> 00:23:21,009
you point to one single change that

556
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:25,269
would make the supply more efficient

557
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:26,140
from your point of view I know that's a

558
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:30,970
tough one huh

559
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:33,220
I can go out of order yes so I would say

560
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,048
we're we're on the path to this right

561
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:39,250
now but it's it has everything to do

562
00:23:35,048 --> 00:23:42,009
with allowing Khoa testing as high up in

563
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:44,169
the supply chain as possible and then

564
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:47,679
letting that bulk material that's been

565
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:49,950
tested and have that Khoa test move

566
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:54,100
through to other distributors to

567
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:57,509
co-packers to others who will handle it

568
00:23:54,099 --> 00:24:00,178
and put it into packages or pre-rolls or

569
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:03,308
you know go through that supply chain

570
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:06,370
and and that itself would make things

571
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:08,829
much more efficient and that is much

572
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:11,109
better than the alternative of the

573
00:24:08,829 --> 00:24:13,449
illicit market where nothing is tested

574
00:24:11,109 --> 00:24:15,939
so I totally appreciate that we want to

575
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:18,130
make sure that nothing there's no jars

576
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:22,028
of flour or pre rolls or manufactured

577
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:25,419
products that are tainted with chemicals

578
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:28,148
and filth and that kind of thing but no

579
00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:29,420
matter what if it passes a Khoa test at

580
00:24:28,148 --> 00:24:32,000
the

581
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:33,920
bulk level it is definitely better than

582
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,289
what is being sourced on the illicit

583
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,570
market and so I would love to see that

584
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:42,649
Co attests for both product be able to

585
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:45,079
travel with with that with those I'm

586
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:47,570
going to use a metric term with the

587
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:51,949
package tag that is assigned to it and

588
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:52,970
be and be good to go you know what I

589
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,220
think would actually do something

590
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:56,779
amazing in the supply chain right now is

591
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:58,700
something that gets used in supply

592
00:24:56,779 --> 00:25:00,289
chains and manufacturing and many many

593
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,509
other industries whether regulated or

594
00:25:00,289 --> 00:25:05,480
not and it's often referred to as skip

595
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:09,379
lot testing and it's the concept of when

596
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:12,289
a producer or an actor in the industry

597
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:14,750
who's responsible for the quality of a

598
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:16,879
product has demonstrated that over a

599
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,349
period of time that's specified by a

600
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,420
regulatory body that they're doing

601
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:22,069
things correctly there's been an on-site

602
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:26,000
inspection there's been an audit of

603
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:27,589
their SOPs and from a regulatory testing

604
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,990
perspective they're passing and not

605
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:33,230
having issues that are systemic and that

606
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:35,779
are related to their their processes and

607
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:38,360
so in many situations like that in other

608
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:42,139
industries those good actors will be

609
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:44,449
allowed to not test every lot if that

610
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,790
was a place based on data that we could

611
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:49,309
get to from a comfort level to say that

612
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:52,069
we can verify a producer to the extent

613
00:25:49,309 --> 00:25:55,220
that we can feel comfortable taking that

614
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:57,379
approach to testing and and approval of

615
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,150
products would be amazing but I think

616
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:00,620
we're probably a bit far out from that

617
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:05,600
in terms of having the data to be able

618
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:07,069
to base those decisions on I would kind

619
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,529
of going back to the dispensaries piece

620
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:13,039
I can't get into a specific regulation

621
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:15,859
but just generally I would like to see

622
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,899
some efforts to encourage a lot more

623
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:19,729
transition from the black market or what

624
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:23,150
all you can say is the prop 215 crowd

625
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:25,549
that are sort of waiting in the wings I

626
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:27,259
I I'd really like I think that our

627
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:29,059
success is going to depend on how many

628
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:32,059
outlets and dispensaries there are and

629
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:33,919
so I would encourage as unfavourable as

630
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:36,490
this might be to some people a much

631
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,060
lower bar of entry for dispensaries

632
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:40,039
understanding that there's going to be

633
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:42,349
problems there but we need to have

634
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:43,279
access for the public to start trusting

635
00:26:42,349 --> 00:26:47,149
and whining apart

636
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:50,329
they it it's as a term I use where they

637
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:53,530
had you before we need more carrots and

638
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:57,169
less cannons to encourage transition I

639
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:59,809
know I'll say you know further this is

640
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:02,900
an industry that we're not concerned

641
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:04,730
about getting arrested so cannons aren't

642
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,040
that effective they haven't been for

643
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:10,180
generations so why we think that would

644
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:13,159
be effective now I think that really

645
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,810
some creativity and how we could

646
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:17,570
encourage people to participate in the

647
00:27:14,809 --> 00:27:19,879
regulated market at that retail end is

648
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:22,599
going to do an awful lot to stimulate

649
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,980
growth in the supply chain throughout

650
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:27,500
yeah I would I would agree with that I

651
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:29,960
think on the retail end is really about

652
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,240
we're the public facing side of the

653
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,579
supply chain so anything that goes wrong

654
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:40,730
anywhere it's always the retailer's

655
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:42,199
faults and we're the lab making but

656
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,420
nobody knows who the love is for the

657
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:50,029
public ones where the store fronts so

658
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:53,480
where some of us are and so I think that

659
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:56,240
public health component and child safety

660
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:58,519
component is really important to the

661
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,130
retailers and making sure there's the

662
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:02,269
story I have told a couple times about

663
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,940
I'm sure some people know what happened

664
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:06,710
with Maureen Dowd in Colorado and she

665
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,090
ate too much of an edible and then wrote

666
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:10,960
an op-ed in The New York Times about it

667
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:12,980
and it almost completely destroyed the

668
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,900
manufacturer in cannabis manufacturing

669
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:17,120
industry in Colorado and they're still

670
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:21,890
recovering today this happened in 2014

671
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:24,319
and so things like that happen and so we

672
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:26,480
need to make sure that we're we're doing

673
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,609
the best of both like protect you know

674
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,460
touching on the the child-resistant

675
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:33,859
packaging needing to be closest to the

676
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,269
actual product for certain products I

677
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:38,209
think it's something that's a very

678
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:41,319
important um which you've heard me say

679
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:44,150
couple times now different hearings and

680
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:47,359
also I think some sort of a just

681
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:49,519
consumer education outreach to take down

682
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:50,809
take down the illicit market encourage

683
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,710
more people to come into the legal

684
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:56,789
regulated market and have some sort of

685
00:28:54,710 --> 00:29:00,090
easily accessible map I have

686
00:28:56,789 --> 00:29:02,039
just a quick story my mother decided she

687
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:04,069
wanted to go buy some cannabis she lives

688
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:08,789
in San Diego County in North County and

689
00:29:04,069 --> 00:29:13,250
didn't tell me but whatever and looked

690
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:16,440
it up did a google search and found a

691
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:21,509
website that lists lots of dispensaries

692
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:23,610
some licensed some not licensed and she

693
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:26,490
she told me that she went to a licensed

694
00:29:23,609 --> 00:29:28,319
dispensary in Vista California and I was

695
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:30,809
like mom no I don't

696
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,579
this does not licensing I don't think

697
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:34,289
you did and she's went to some place

698
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:38,189
called the Sugar Shack where they sold

699
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:40,170
her a 300 milligram chocalate bar that

700
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:42,299
was I mean the whole thing luckily she

701
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:44,370
knows enough to not eat the whole thing

702
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:45,839
and break it up and she said it actually

703
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:48,659
didn't do anything which goes to the

704
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:51,539
testing but that whole story I was just

705
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:53,759
like if my mother who actually you know

706
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:55,049
has a daughter in the industry and it

707
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,299
kind of knows a little bit about this

708
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:58,769
and she's 71 year old grandmother now

709
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:01,649
there must be lots of people out there

710
00:29:58,769 --> 00:30:02,970
that are doing this and and I couldn't

711
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:05,640
even I was trying to I sent her the

712
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:07,350
spreadsheet that was on the BCC site

713
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:10,140
because there there isn't really a place

714
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:12,629
that I could point to that's directly

715
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,880
like here this is a map of all of the

716
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:16,650
licensed dispensaries that you can go to

717
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,110
and you know it's tested and you know

718
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:22,050
this and and all of that and it's safe

719
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:25,349
so I think yeah just some sort of

720
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:27,839
consumer information so that the the

721
00:30:25,349 --> 00:30:29,490
people that do want to go to the legal

722
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:33,000
market know where to go and and can

723
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:34,200
trust it and then I think I'm just all

724
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,289
of these are really great points but

725
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,420
coming back to Michael's point about how

726
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:41,970
the batches are configured with testing

727
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:45,150
from a cultivator perspective you know

728
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:48,360
we might harvest one batch from one farm

729
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:51,990
of say og cush and then that og cush

730
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:54,539
turns into one grand-prix rolls and then

731
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:58,109
pack of seven pre-rolls and then eights

732
00:30:54,539 --> 00:31:01,740
and then quarters and so those all new

733
00:30:58,109 --> 00:31:03,899
have they all have new SKUs to them when

734
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:06,210
they go in new track and trace batch

735
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:09,240
numbers when they go to the distributor

736
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:10,390
but it's literally one batch of cannabis

737
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,680
flowers so for

738
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:18,820
to now have to test the single pre-rolls

739
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:21,250
as one batch the five to a pack as one

740
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:23,529
batch the eight as one batch as a cost

741
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,500
that we can't necessarily afford to

742
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:28,000
sustain as cultivators putting non

743
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,160
manufactured products into the

744
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,589
marketplace so if that could be looked

745
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:34,870
at as one batch because it came from one

746
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:39,639
farm was harvested at the same time was

747
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:42,309
one crop that would actually create such

748
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:45,280
a tremendous amount of ease in moving

749
00:31:42,309 --> 00:31:47,649
these products safely from the farm

750
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,859
through the testing and distribution

751
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,940
model and into the retail so that's one

752
00:31:50,859 --> 00:31:54,250
of the places where we're really

753
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:57,130
struggling with timing hang-ups and

754
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:59,559
costs of trying to get a broad spectrum

755
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:02,320
say of non manufactured products into

756
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:04,089
the marketplace that's a sticky spot for

757
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,039
cultivators right I actually think that

758
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:08,049
highlights one of the biggest issues

759
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:09,759
that we've all talked about along the

760
00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:12,700
way which is the different

761
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:15,609
interpretations of the regulation text

762
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:18,390
by different parties and so Chris and I

763
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:22,659
had an aha moment a few months back

764
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:25,330
where one of the members of the BCC team

765
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:29,050
helped us understand that as a lab that

766
00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:32,109
we can actually sample as one batch pre

767
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:34,269
unpacked flour eighths and quarters all

768
00:32:32,109 --> 00:32:37,719
together as one batch and apply the coa

769
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:39,519
to all those different SKUs and so in in

770
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,710
certain readings of the regulations it

771
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,740
was interpreted by some people as if

772
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,299
every SKU had to have a specific coa but

773
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,339
in the case of flour which is kind of a

774
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:49,930
special case with the exception of pre

775
00:32:48,339 --> 00:32:51,849
rolls which is handled differently in

776
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:53,769
the new draft at least as its as it

777
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:56,319
stands at the moment we actually have

778
00:32:53,769 --> 00:32:58,889
the ability now to to tighten that up a

779
00:32:56,319 --> 00:33:01,720
little bit into to apply one coa to

780
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:03,280
unpacked flour eighths and quarters say

781
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,410
that were from the same harvest batch

782
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:08,920
can we get a memo over to our testing

783
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:16,810
facility that'd be great 100% i got the

784
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:19,300
nod well i think what's interesting and

785
00:33:16,809 --> 00:33:20,950
concerning to me at the same time is on

786
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:22,899
each question I'm finding that

787
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,850
throughout the supply chain you are

788
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:27,480
interpret

789
00:33:23,849 --> 00:33:30,149
the regs differently and so if you're

790
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:34,980
gonna reflect back what are what could

791
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:36,300
we do to make sure and I know you're

792
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,250
gonna tell me I know we got to get

793
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:40,529
information out but with all of our

794
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:43,680
other responsibilities do you have any

795
00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:46,289
good ideas for us where we could do a

796
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,870
better job of explaining the regs I mean

797
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:52,799
maybe it starts with the regs themselves

798
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:55,139
but you know I think there's better ways

799
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,359
to get the information out and and one

800
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:00,600
thing that I worry about as we come to

801
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:02,490
the final leg of our rulemaking how do

802
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:04,799
we make sure we're continuing to

803
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:07,529
communicate and collaborate we've done

804
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,719
it a lot getting these regs out but how

805
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:11,880
do we going forward make sure we keep

806
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:15,119
that momentum so I'd love your thoughts

807
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:17,910
on that you know I think there's an

808
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,089
agency to agency component right so a

809
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:23,940
lot of the operators are are kind of

810
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:25,170
wrangling multiple sets of regulations

811
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,050
that they have to comply with

812
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:30,450
cultivators have California Department

813
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:33,269
of Food and Agriculture open air

814
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:34,619
cultivators have the water board the

815
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:36,480
water resource control board they have

816
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:39,349
Department of Fish and Wildlife and then

817
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,429
depending on how they choose to

818
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:43,349
transport their product if they have say

819
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:47,129
a self distribution transportation

820
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:52,230
license now they have BCC right and and

821
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:54,780
so how how like as a cultivator we

822
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:57,119
digest that body of material is really

823
00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:01,380
challenging and then I find that there's

824
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,789
not always the same I don't know if

825
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:05,369
definition is the right word but maybe

826
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:07,949
interpretation of specific definitions

827
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:10,859
from statutes so like we're really

828
00:35:07,949 --> 00:35:12,809
suffering with the contiguous premise

829
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:14,490
component especially as existing

830
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:17,759
cultivators that already built out right

831
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:19,229
how do we fit into that box but BCC

832
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,420
seems to have a little different way of

833
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:26,429
dealing with contiguous premise and say

834
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:28,440
CD FA or CD pH so those pieces make it

835
00:35:26,429 --> 00:35:32,099
really kind of a quicksand feeling

836
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,740
because you're not sure who to look to

837
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:37,619
for answers in some of those cases so I

838
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:44,279
think kind of more in

839
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:46,079
agency communication and sort of joint

840
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,750
educational opportunities would be

841
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,759
really fabulous you know what I was

842
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:53,340
yearning for in this in this last round

843
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:56,070
of these of the draft regulations and

844
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:58,350
also actually with July one in lab

845
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:59,670
there's not a lot of us who are

846
00:35:58,349 --> 00:36:01,769
currently offering I think there's maybe

847
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:03,389
30 or maybe more licensees now as they

848
00:36:01,769 --> 00:36:05,460
keep adding on but in terms of operators

849
00:36:03,389 --> 00:36:09,449
it's I think it's less than 15 probably

850
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:12,030
right now and what we're doing is fairly

851
00:36:09,449 --> 00:36:14,369
complicated there's a lot of details and

852
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:16,680
if we get it wrong we can have a serious

853
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:18,779
economic impact on a party completely

854
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:20,159
unintentionally by making by

855
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,900
misinterpreting something to miss

856
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:24,899
applying it on a CoA that then can't be

857
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,070
amended and so when those transitions

858
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,389
happen I said you know I it would have

859
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:29,910
been really great from a collaboration

860
00:36:27,389 --> 00:36:32,129
perspective if we could have gotten the

861
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:34,230
lab operators on the phone with the

862
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:36,630
regulator's to really walk through what

863
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:38,760
what to ask from us was in terms of

864
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:40,289
changes to help us understand the label

865
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,890
claim thing has been a little over the

866
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:46,590
top to understand what it means what has

867
00:36:43,889 --> 00:36:48,569
to be what doesn't have to be where's

868
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:50,220
the where's the area of permissions

869
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:52,350
where's the area of no permissions and

870
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:54,689
so I think I guess literally a simple

871
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:56,400
conference call with the lab operators

872
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:58,139
because we're a small number would have

873
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,610
been amazing and it would have cleared

874
00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:01,400
up a lot of kind of disparate things

875
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,180
between us which affected the

876
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,039
manufacturers and ineffective

877
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:07,769
distributors because our interpretations

878
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:08,849
affect everybody in a big way now I

879
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:10,230
don't I don't think that's totally

880
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:11,610
doable for everybody because there's a

881
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,070
lot more manufacturers and a lot more

882
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:16,410
distributors than there are labs so that

883
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:18,990
may not be applicable for each group but

884
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:20,339
that approach which may mean maybe there

885
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:22,109
needs to be more funding for outreach

886
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:24,900
personnel that are specifically just

887
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:26,910
about outreach and about giving voice to

888
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,470
that interpretation because there's

889
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:30,329
there's a difference in having a

890
00:37:28,469 --> 00:37:32,009
discussion like with Elena who's been

891
00:37:30,329 --> 00:37:34,980
who's an amazing resource on your team

892
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:36,330
to help understand the regulations but I

893
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,800
think there's people who don't feel like

894
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:40,949
they have that personal connection to

895
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,810
the BCC team or a go-to person and so

896
00:37:40,949 --> 00:37:44,460
somehow we need to create that sense of

897
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:46,139
everybody knows who to go to and that

898
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,179
person has the bandwidth to answer them

899
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:51,268
because there there's a lot of us yeah

900
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:54,958
yeah oh you know California is the

901
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:57,178
only state that has multiple agencies

902
00:37:54,958 --> 00:38:01,828
regulating one supply chain in cannabis

903
00:37:57,179 --> 00:38:04,369
so that's very unique and you know

904
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:06,419
obviously causes lots of problems with

905
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:09,449
interpretation and who is authority over

906
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:12,028
what and I would say you know something

907
00:38:09,449 --> 00:38:13,679
the CDT FA does that they started a

908
00:38:12,028 --> 00:38:15,889
couple of months ago and they've only

909
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:19,679
had a couple but they've invited a

910
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:22,798
couple of operators from distributors

911
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:25,588
and retailers to discuss the just the

912
00:38:22,798 --> 00:38:27,838
excise tax and and how the tax structure

913
00:38:25,588 --> 00:38:30,208
is paid and what's going on and and we

914
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,828
asked them questions and they asked us

915
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:33,989
questions and we kind of just have this

916
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:36,479
sort of informal back-and-forth

917
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:37,858
conversation so that's been pretty

918
00:38:36,478 --> 00:38:41,489
helpful because that's been an

919
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:43,348
unbelievably confusing on its own and so

920
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:46,528
that might be an idea I know there's the

921
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:49,739
Advisory Committee which is very formal

922
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:53,579
and and sort of there by law but some

923
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:56,969
sort of more informal stakeholder

924
00:38:53,579 --> 00:39:01,769
licensee conversation and right now

925
00:38:56,969 --> 00:39:03,539
since there aren't a ton of licensees if

926
00:39:01,768 --> 00:39:06,118
it probably would be easier to do at

927
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:08,609
this point then you know six months or a

928
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:10,709
year later when if there's more coming

929
00:39:08,608 --> 00:39:14,759
out as more places and people get online

930
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:16,318
and I think the other thing is you know

931
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:18,509
going back to this packaging and

932
00:39:16,318 --> 00:39:22,108
labeling which has just been a you know

933
00:39:18,509 --> 00:39:24,958
interesting transition and our different

934
00:39:22,108 --> 00:39:29,188
interpretations of you know what is

935
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:31,379
required I think having a general

936
00:39:29,188 --> 00:39:35,548
understanding of because we were in the

937
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:38,249
position I you know the retailer BPG was

938
00:39:35,548 --> 00:39:39,958
saying that we are we're licensed and

939
00:39:38,248 --> 00:39:42,448
inspected by the Bureau so we're going

940
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:45,688
to go with what the bureau says and what

941
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:48,358
statute says and then there's CD pH that

942
00:39:45,688 --> 00:39:50,009
has what they have and then that's with

943
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:53,268
them I think this also comes down to why

944
00:39:50,009 --> 00:40:00,539
there may have been some difference

945
00:39:53,268 --> 00:40:02,788
interpretation and yeah so I you know

946
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:03,099
one of the sort of more specific nuance

947
00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:04,660
they

948
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:06,249
we come down to sort of the you know

949
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:07,778
statute says everything has to be in a

950
00:40:06,248 --> 00:40:08,679
resealable child-resistant

951
00:40:07,778 --> 00:40:10,599
tamper-evident

952
00:40:08,679 --> 00:40:12,338
it's in one sentence and it says

953
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:15,160
cannabis and cannabis products and so

954
00:40:12,338 --> 00:40:16,989
that means everything from seeds to

955
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:19,179
clones and and the seeds and clones I

956
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:20,739
would say was a very interesting

957
00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:26,048
question because that's what statute

958
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:29,228
says CDP H doesn't address it you

959
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:31,690
California to DFA doesn't address it and

960
00:40:29,228 --> 00:40:34,449
so you know we are erring on the side of

961
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:36,849
caution because we're like well I the

962
00:40:34,449 --> 00:40:39,328
bureau is the one inspecting us not DPH

963
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:41,680
so we're just going to go as far

964
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:43,989
conservative as we possibly can and then

965
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:45,338
and that's what I mean the staff kind of

966
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:46,749
they're frustrated with me too because

967
00:40:45,338 --> 00:40:48,578
that's sort of how I go I'm like we're

968
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:50,108
gonna ease up as we realize that we can

969
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:52,900
but we're just gonna start with the

970
00:40:50,108 --> 00:40:55,179
strictest interpretation but yeah so

971
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:58,389
sort of the the crossover areas and

972
00:40:55,179 --> 00:41:00,248
addressing those and and who has you

973
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:01,538
know what are you guys looking for when

974
00:41:00,248 --> 00:41:03,159
you're coming in to inspect the

975
00:41:01,539 --> 00:41:07,690
dispensary when it comes to packaging

976
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:09,909
and labeling stuff like that I would as

977
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:12,278
a lawyer kind of shift towards you know

978
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:13,478
when statutes are interpreted greatly

979
00:41:12,278 --> 00:41:15,579
for the business community by case law

980
00:41:13,478 --> 00:41:17,588
and in case law and forms and different

981
00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:21,489
fact in our scenarios how one would

982
00:41:17,588 --> 00:41:23,528
behave the IRS uses decisional memos I

983
00:41:21,489 --> 00:41:25,150
think that it might not be a bad idea to

984
00:41:23,528 --> 00:41:27,400
do something like decisional memos that

985
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:30,190
have an expiry date on them so that the

986
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,710
statute says they change those decisions

987
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:34,599
kind of become but it really helped us

988
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:36,519
out a lot while we're really the

989
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:39,640
frontline I mean if we fail state fails

990
00:41:36,518 --> 00:41:41,649
right so it helps us out in defining how

991
00:41:39,639 --> 00:41:45,129
we should go and and I would absolutely

992
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:46,298
agree one body to making those decision

993
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:50,920
itself

994
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:53,440
working with CD pH or working with the

995
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,239
other departments to come up with a

996
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,338
decisional memo that is consonant across

997
00:41:55,239 --> 00:42:01,269
the board so that we can make a decision

998
00:41:57,338 --> 00:42:04,568
for example if I have a cultivation

999
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:06,159
license can I can i package for somebody

1000
00:42:04,568 --> 00:42:08,079
kind of package somebody else's flour or

1001
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:10,568
just off of my farm like it's really not

1002
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,499
clear right so and it doesn't have to be

1003
00:42:10,568 --> 00:42:13,088
clear and we don't have to wait for

1004
00:42:11,498 --> 00:42:14,858
regulators to make that decision but I

1005
00:42:13,088 --> 00:42:16,808
think in the interim if the bureau could

1006
00:42:14,858 --> 00:42:17,358
just make a decision for right now for

1007
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:19,609
the rest of the

1008
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:27,199
here our interpretation is that would be

1009
00:42:19,608 --> 00:42:29,058
acceptable that allows us to mount this

1010
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,710
effort without the constant fear that

1011
00:42:29,059 --> 00:42:33,739
we're gonna get you know Thor's hammer

1012
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:37,608
on our back and so there's a lot of that

1013
00:42:33,739 --> 00:42:38,960
fear of how to move and and if we could

1014
00:42:37,608 --> 00:42:40,460
have some clearance on that it's kind of

1015
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:45,019
like an FAQ but it's a little bit more

1016
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:48,199
formal right so so just an idea to throw

1017
00:42:45,018 --> 00:42:50,238
out there I think it's been great the

1018
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:52,338
way that the agencies are willing to

1019
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:55,849
travel around the state to listen to all

1020
00:42:52,338 --> 00:42:57,920
of us during the public comments and I

1021
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:59,359
think it would be you know there's out

1022
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,470
there's a huge cross-section of

1023
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:06,798
companies some which have staffed up to

1024
00:43:03,469 --> 00:43:09,588
have policy professionals focusing on

1025
00:43:06,798 --> 00:43:11,298
the regs on a daily basis and then

1026
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:13,940
there's companies that don't have that

1027
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:16,579
resource and and they utilize their

1028
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:19,909
industry associations or word of mouth

1029
00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:21,140
or you know call the bureau up but it

1030
00:43:19,909 --> 00:43:24,199
would I think it'd be great if there

1031
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:26,298
could be ongoing opportunities for the

1032
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:30,199
agencies to in different parts of the

1033
00:43:26,298 --> 00:43:33,858
state have workshops that are designed

1034
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:35,989
to focus on their regs and clarify and

1035
00:43:33,858 --> 00:43:37,308
educate and I think that probably you

1036
00:43:35,989 --> 00:43:38,720
would get a lot of participation there's

1037
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:40,609
a lot of hungry minds

1038
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:45,558
I know it's it might open a new can of

1039
00:43:40,608 --> 00:43:47,028
worms if one answer at one venue is

1040
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:48,890
different than another answer at another

1041
00:43:47,028 --> 00:43:50,150
venue so obviously not a perfect

1042
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:51,949
solution but I think there's a lot of

1043
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:55,009
people that be interested to come in

1044
00:43:51,949 --> 00:43:59,509
here and learn this is what we mean when

1045
00:43:55,009 --> 00:44:02,179
we say this so I completely agree with

1046
00:43:59,509 --> 00:44:04,608
you it can be frustrating for us just

1047
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:06,889
asked our communication guys on when

1048
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:10,190
people don't when they call and say what

1049
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:12,170
agency do we go to or for us it does get

1050
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,999
frustrating because it does even even

1051
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:16,940
internally it's difficult to work with

1052
00:44:13,998 --> 00:44:20,659
two other agencies and come to decisions

1053
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:23,028
and and being consistent also it's you

1054
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:26,149
know like you noted we do want to do

1055
00:44:23,028 --> 00:44:28,518
more outreach but we're also dealing

1056
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:30,490
with new staff coming on every day and

1057
00:44:28,518 --> 00:44:32,229
it's hard to keep them

1058
00:44:30,489 --> 00:44:33,729
prized okay these are the these are the

1059
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:37,269
regulations that are in place right now

1060
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:41,289
and and so we struggle with making sure

1061
00:44:37,269 --> 00:44:43,000
that we're giving consistent answers and

1062
00:44:41,289 --> 00:44:45,699
you're not getting different answers and

1063
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,050
I think you'll see once we get our final

1064
00:44:45,699 --> 00:44:48,819
regulations it's going to make a lot

1065
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:51,280
easier we don't have the emergency

1066
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:54,010
regulations the proposed and all that so

1067
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:58,150
this is all really very helpful you know

1068
00:44:54,010 --> 00:45:01,180
I I could I could keep interrogating

1069
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:03,639
these guys more but I think you guys

1070
00:45:01,179 --> 00:45:05,949
want to answer some question questions

1071
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:08,259
of them but I do want to point out that

1072
00:45:05,949 --> 00:45:09,879
we did get approval our budget got

1073
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:13,359
approved to have a public awareness

1074
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:15,849
campaign we are going out to bid so we

1075
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:18,759
are gonna get out there and start having

1076
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:20,800
a campaign to inform consumers of who's

1077
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,250
licensed the importance of going to a

1078
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,500
licensed retailer and also trying to

1079
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:28,059
bring more people from the unlicensed

1080
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:29,530
market into the regulated market so

1081
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:31,210
that'll be something exciting you're

1082
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:32,760
gonna see from our communications team

1083
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:36,220
so we're looking forward to that but

1084
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:38,800
this has been extremely helpful to me

1085
00:45:36,219 --> 00:45:41,588
and I really appreciate you guys being

1086
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:45,070
so candid with your answers so I'm gonna

1087
00:45:41,588 --> 00:45:47,799
leave it to Peter - all right so we have

1088
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:50,588
a question from the back row yeah Doug

1089
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:52,720
Ryerson small business owner this might

1090
00:45:50,588 --> 00:45:55,210
be a three-part question and anybody can

1091
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:59,949
answer it up there but Lori you might

1092
00:45:55,210 --> 00:46:01,929
have the best answer we'll see so ppm

1093
00:45:59,949 --> 00:46:04,809
levels acceptable at this time of

1094
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:07,389
concentrations the labs at this point

1095
00:46:04,809 --> 00:46:10,210
they figure they're safe but are they

1096
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:11,670
really up to FDA standards to federal

1097
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:15,358
standards and pharmacists

1098
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:19,269
pharmacological balance and safety

1099
00:46:15,358 --> 00:46:22,269
that's the first one second one is

1100
00:46:19,269 --> 00:46:24,849
labeling and packaging wisent Walgreens

1101
00:46:22,269 --> 00:46:27,219
and CVS and Safeway gonna take this over

1102
00:46:24,849 --> 00:46:28,809
once the feds get a hold of it and it's

1103
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:30,368
going to be in the right packaging it's

1104
00:46:28,809 --> 00:46:31,599
going to be you know they're gonna tell

1105
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:34,200
you how to take it you have any

1106
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:37,119
questions when you come up to the store

1107
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:39,250
so constellation and canner grow in

1108
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,260
Canada just known like 30% of the market

1109
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,849
in Canada they're on the stock market

1110
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:45,329
now

1111
00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:47,940
so a lot of these small businesses are

1112
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:51,749
gonna be struggling I'll take a crack at

1113
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:54,659
the FDA component so the FDA has two

1114
00:46:51,748 --> 00:46:56,578
pathways to approval right there is the

1115
00:46:54,659 --> 00:46:58,649
new drug application and then there's a

1116
00:46:56,579 --> 00:47:00,809
botanical drug application pathways

1117
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:02,969
they're both hugely expensive and the

1118
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:05,940
variances that those products can hold

1119
00:47:02,969 --> 00:47:10,079
through those approvals are are very low

1120
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:12,749
right so when dealing with a botanical

1121
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:15,298
material which cannabis is the variance

1122
00:47:12,748 --> 00:47:18,259
from crop to crop which makes a variance

1123
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:20,608
from product to product tends to be

1124
00:47:18,259 --> 00:47:23,608
generally well outside of the range of

1125
00:47:20,608 --> 00:47:28,048
what the FDA is going to approve so as

1126
00:47:23,608 --> 00:47:30,690
the FDA has drugs or botanical products

1127
00:47:28,048 --> 00:47:32,458
that come through their pathway those

1128
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:34,108
products will be FDA approved but what

1129
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:37,288
we have right now is a botanical

1130
00:47:34,108 --> 00:47:41,009
cannabis program which is similar more

1131
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:44,729
similar to say our traditional botanical

1132
00:47:41,009 --> 00:47:46,650
program for nutriceuticals and single

1133
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:49,588
herbal products on the marketplace and

1134
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:52,789
so I would expect in the long run to see

1135
00:47:49,588 --> 00:47:56,278
kind of a similar unfolding right as as

1136
00:47:52,789 --> 00:48:00,299
the FDA changes in federal regulations

1137
00:47:56,278 --> 00:48:04,798
change and we move into prescribed

1138
00:48:00,298 --> 00:48:08,639
cannabis marketplace right CBD will

1139
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:11,699
probably still also have a botanical

1140
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:14,958
whole plant product available even after

1141
00:48:11,699 --> 00:48:19,528
FDA products are approved I mean this is

1142
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:21,568
well look at green tea there are there

1143
00:48:19,528 --> 00:48:23,068
are very few botanical products that

1144
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:25,139
have come through the pathway there's I

1145
00:48:23,068 --> 00:48:26,969
think three today one of them is a green

1146
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:28,259
tea product and I think there's there's

1147
00:48:26,969 --> 00:48:31,108
two more that have come through that

1148
00:48:28,259 --> 00:48:34,498
botanical product pathway it's a very

1149
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:36,900
rigorous and expensive pathway a lot of

1150
00:48:34,498 --> 00:48:39,118
botanical products choose not to utilize

1151
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:41,969
that pathway so I think what we'll still

1152
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,890
remember will remain to see is cannabis

1153
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:46,858
as a botanical product and then cannabis

1154
00:48:43,889 --> 00:48:49,978
probably move into also an FDA regulated

1155
00:48:46,858 --> 00:48:51,298
product so when it comes to safety of

1156
00:48:49,978 --> 00:48:53,308
the products and we talk about things

1157
00:48:51,298 --> 00:48:54,530
like contaminants like residual solvent

1158
00:48:53,309 --> 00:48:56,390
and pesticides

1159
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:58,580
when you see the action limits that are

1160
00:48:56,389 --> 00:49:01,569
in the regulations that that we're

1161
00:48:58,579 --> 00:49:05,420
currently adhering to they're based on

1162
00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:06,830
other other standards that exist so

1163
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,780
there's the international harmonized

1164
00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:11,000
standards around pharmaceuticals that

1165
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:14,030
have action levels for residual solvents

1166
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,340
what California has specified is is in

1167
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:18,380
line with those things in some cases it

1168
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,120
may be more stringent in some cases a

1169
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:22,010
little bit less but they're in the same

1170
00:49:20,119 --> 00:49:23,599
neighborhood so to speak and when you

1171
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:25,580
look at things like action limits on

1172
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,949
residual solvents you know they were

1173
00:49:25,579 --> 00:49:29,869
based on the data that's available in

1174
00:49:27,949 --> 00:49:31,069
terms of the exposure that workers who

1175
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:32,359
work in environments where those

1176
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:34,250
solvents exist in their working

1177
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,780
environment what they can be exposed to

1178
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:37,869
on a sustained basis say in a part per

1179
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:42,200
million level so they want to actually

1180
00:49:37,869 --> 00:49:44,179
fact-based standards to say what should

1181
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:46,689
we pull from to make actual limits and

1182
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:48,829
I'd say if you if you read the initial

1183
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:50,829
text around the regulations the

1184
00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:53,599
explanation of the regulations and the

1185
00:49:50,829 --> 00:49:55,639
justification for how the action limits

1186
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,949
were set there was quite a bit of work

1187
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:59,480
and thought and care put into what those

1188
00:49:57,949 --> 00:50:02,589
action limits should be on based on

1189
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:05,510
other regulated industries and standards

1190
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:09,890
thank you yeah I'll respond you're good

1191
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:13,820
your cannabis growth can't comment so I

1192
00:50:09,889 --> 00:50:15,710
kind of look at that in two ways one one

1193
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:17,920
thing I know for sure about this country

1194
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:20,300
is while there's social justice issues

1195
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:21,710
compassion care issues nothing moves the

1196
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:25,730
needle more than missing out on the

1197
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:29,210
global market opportunity so I expect

1198
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:31,699
that investment to be a big needle mover

1199
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:34,429
in the federal government's position and

1200
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:36,079
that may be a bad thing considering your

1201
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:37,429
packaging question right now are we

1202
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,090
going to be suddenly is it going to be

1203
00:50:37,429 --> 00:50:40,399
Walgreens

1204
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:42,320
so I'll say this and this is not my idea

1205
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,809
that's an idea that I just subscribed to

1206
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:50,360
and that is that cannabis its core is a

1207
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:52,940
connoisseur product aspirin is not you

1208
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:54,559
know beer wasn't until craft beer came

1209
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:58,070
around and now there's this very healthy

1210
00:50:54,559 --> 00:51:00,320
craft beer market same with wines and

1211
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:02,480
there's a lot of young upstarts you know

1212
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:04,400
ballast point at one time was just you

1213
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,440
know a couple of folks that just had the

1214
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,480
motto go get

1215
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,820
yeah and they had they have built the

1216
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:12,519
lionheart that that we all love so much

1217
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:15,039
about cannabis people is that we're

1218
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:18,039
entrepreneurs and we're aggressive

1219
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:20,529
lone-wolf go-getters you know and so as

1220
00:51:18,039 --> 00:51:22,300
that lone wolf piece starts to fall off

1221
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:24,730
that that go-getter something and this

1222
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:26,260
is gonna stay there and I expect that if

1223
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:29,800
we can do a good job of educating

1224
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:32,020
consumers at the retail level and doing

1225
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:36,150
things like allowing consumers to try

1226
00:51:32,019 --> 00:51:38,170
topicals at the retail stand right

1227
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:41,500
something like that that's kind of an

1228
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:43,389
ambassadorship into some normality I

1229
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:44,860
think we can really encourage people to

1230
00:51:43,389 --> 00:51:46,239
start to participate and buy into that

1231
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,650
connoisseurship I think it's always

1232
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:49,169
going to be something as long as we

1233
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:51,880
celebrate it and don't fall into

1234
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:53,110
marketing just Walgreens style products

1235
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:55,510
I think we can have a very healthy

1236
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:57,160
market and at the same time to Kristin's

1237
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,690
point there's always get up at the other

1238
00:51:57,159 --> 00:52:00,179
side of it there's nothing we can do

1239
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:02,710
about that

1240
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:05,769
since the industry is mirroring

1241
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:09,400
different industry that we're all aware

1242
00:52:05,769 --> 00:52:11,050
of I eat tobacco alcohol I would love to

1243
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:13,680
see one thing as a new person in the

1244
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:16,180
reduction of manufacturing business now

1245
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:19,149
give us a license and if we're bad

1246
00:52:16,179 --> 00:52:20,529
characters penalize us but like every

1247
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:23,619
other licensing within those structures

1248
00:52:20,530 --> 00:52:25,390
let us get it and have it I don't like

1249
00:52:23,619 --> 00:52:27,099
the one-year mark I don't want to see a

1250
00:52:25,389 --> 00:52:29,789
five year mark I'd like to see an

1251
00:52:27,099 --> 00:52:32,710
infinitum licensing that we're receiving

1252
00:52:29,789 --> 00:52:34,090
until we prove otherwise and I don't

1253
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:36,039
know it's it's not been done in any

1254
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:37,360
other states but we should be taking the

1255
00:52:36,039 --> 00:52:39,099
Presidents on that because it is a

1256
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,680
medicine and it certainly has a very

1257
00:52:39,099 --> 00:52:43,480
important place so the one-year mark is

1258
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:45,460
just not satisfactory for some of us

1259
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:46,420
that are looking at this long term and

1260
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:48,970
we should really have that opportunity

1261
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:51,610
as well the second position that we are

1262
00:52:48,969 --> 00:52:53,409
wanting to take is the plastic industry

1263
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:54,940
I mean it is a medicine first and

1264
00:52:53,409 --> 00:52:57,699
foremost so here we are all drinking our

1265
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:59,019
water out of our plastic right now we're

1266
00:52:57,699 --> 00:53:01,689
putting our medicine in plastic which

1267
00:52:59,019 --> 00:53:03,009
has been done a lot of contributors to

1268
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:05,349
cancer and other illnesses and

1269
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:06,850
conditions but we are not only creating

1270
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:09,309
an unknown factor by putting our

1271
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:11,230
medicine in that packaging but now we're

1272
00:53:09,309 --> 00:53:13,090
adding to an environmental concern with

1273
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:15,210
all the waste factors are the level of

1274
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:17,838
the plastics so it just keeps

1275
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:20,389
compounding and we'd like to see

1276
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:22,460
this industry taken a position in being

1277
00:53:20,389 --> 00:53:24,259
environmentally sound in reducing all

1278
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:26,269
the amount of environmental waste that

1279
00:53:24,259 --> 00:53:27,380
we're contributing to and again we just

1280
00:53:26,268 --> 00:53:29,689
don't know what the long-term effects

1281
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:31,818
are of those packaging principles and

1282
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:36,380
I'd like to see some consideration of

1283
00:53:31,818 --> 00:53:37,728
wastes long term and not provoking

1284
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:45,440
anything that could be conditional down

1285
00:53:37,728 --> 00:53:48,048
the road okay anyone else all right

1286
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,869
actually you can just use that mic yeah

1287
00:53:48,048 --> 00:53:52,909
I have a question and a comment

1288
00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:55,548
I very much appreciate everyone that's

1289
00:53:52,909 --> 00:53:57,710
been here Laurie I've been following you

1290
00:53:55,548 --> 00:53:58,400
from day one and appreciate everything

1291
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:01,039
you've done

1292
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:04,548
I traveled from Long Beach today to be

1293
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:07,430
here to actually have some concrete

1294
00:54:04,548 --> 00:54:10,068
answers to some of the questions about

1295
00:54:07,429 --> 00:54:13,098
I'm a manufacturer about packaging about

1296
00:54:10,068 --> 00:54:17,778
child resistant about this and I feel

1297
00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:20,318
like I attended another political City

1298
00:54:17,778 --> 00:54:20,318
Council

1299
00:54:20,829 --> 00:54:26,719
conversation about no concrete answers

1300
00:54:23,809 --> 00:54:29,150
when are we gonna get concrete answers

1301
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:31,549
about this is what packaging needs to be

1302
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:33,740
this is what compliance needs to be this

1303
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:36,110
is what lab testing needs to be this is

1304
00:54:33,739 --> 00:54:38,329
what happens inside a box this is what

1305
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:40,849
happens at the retail level this is our

1306
00:54:38,329 --> 00:54:43,759
lab testing at micro dosing we need

1307
00:54:40,849 --> 00:54:46,579
concrete answers or business owners that

1308
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:49,970
are suffering significantly because

1309
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:52,190
these decisions are not being made so

1310
00:54:49,969 --> 00:54:54,559
our are the bureau's public comment

1311
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:56,900
period ended on Monday and we're still

1312
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:59,420
going I think we're up over 3,000

1313
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:01,369
comments so there is no concrete answers

1314
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:03,740
other than the current regulations that

1315
00:55:01,369 --> 00:55:06,829
are in place those are your that is what

1316
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:10,459
you have to abide by right now so over

1317
00:55:06,829 --> 00:55:12,679
the next probably few weeks we have to

1318
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:14,659
respond to each and every public comment

1319
00:55:12,679 --> 00:55:17,690
that came in that has to be part of our

1320
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:21,619
final rulemaking package we are then

1321
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:23,450
gonna probably I'm I'm I'm positive the

1322
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:26,089
Bureau is going to be making changes

1323
00:55:23,449 --> 00:55:28,159
their regs I can't I can't speak for CD

1324
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:29,600
pH and see DFA but I believe all three

1325
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:32,599
of us are going to be making changes

1326
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,880
based on those comments and then we have

1327
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:37,460
to go out we have to draft new

1328
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,619
regulations for those changes and we go

1329
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:42,260
out for another comment period that is

1330
00:55:39,619 --> 00:55:45,139
the California rulemaking process that

1331
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:47,870
comment period could be 15 days or 45

1332
00:55:45,139 --> 00:55:48,500
days and guess what it starts all over

1333
00:55:47,869 --> 00:55:51,650
again

1334
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:54,440
we get that comment and then at that

1335
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:56,900
point we have to meet our deadline of I

1336
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:59,780
believe it's December 6 to get the final

1337
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:02,720
regulations in place so the rulemaking

1338
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:04,100
process is a very arduous process I

1339
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:06,109
think it can be frustrating because

1340
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:07,579
people want answers right now and the

1341
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:09,440
only thing we can tell them is what's

1342
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:11,779
currently in the emergency regulation

1343
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:14,860
package but it's also a very transparent

1344
00:56:11,780 --> 00:56:18,290
process and it has a lot of public

1345
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:20,900
feedback which is good because we're not

1346
00:56:18,289 --> 00:56:22,909
doing anything you know behind closed

1347
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:24,889
doors if we make changes we have to go

1348
00:56:22,909 --> 00:56:27,289
out for another comment and and we can't

1349
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:29,569
make those final decisions until we do

1350
00:56:27,289 --> 00:56:32,000
that an additional comment period and

1351
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:34,039
then change again so I think it is

1352
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,840
frustrating believe me as

1353
00:56:34,039 --> 00:56:38,329
regulator we want this process to be

1354
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:41,809
over as much as you do I mean we're just

1355
00:56:38,329 --> 00:56:43,750
constantly doing this I were tired of it

1356
00:56:41,809 --> 00:56:48,259
we want to just have the answers to

1357
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:50,090
every time we do fa Q's it changes every

1358
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:51,620
time we put out some fact sheet it

1359
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:54,140
changes a couple months later because

1360
00:56:51,619 --> 00:56:56,029
we've changed it again but I'll tell you

1361
00:56:54,139 --> 00:56:58,039
this as regulators the reason we keep

1362
00:56:56,030 --> 00:57:00,350
changing is because we keep getting more

1363
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:02,389
data more information and we're trying

1364
00:57:00,349 --> 00:57:04,009
to do things better not trying to make

1365
00:57:02,389 --> 00:57:06,949
it worse for you we're trying to make it

1366
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:11,600
better so that's the process we have

1367
00:57:06,949 --> 00:57:14,299
right now and so again it's it's I want

1368
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,389
to add something to this is we are all

1369
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:19,730
learning right now literally the

1370
00:57:16,389 --> 00:57:22,489
industry the regulators I mean the cart

1371
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:24,980
is way ahead of the horse in terms of

1372
00:57:22,489 --> 00:57:28,939
California cannabis industry and moving

1373
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:31,550
it into the regulations and you that I

1374
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:33,800
think the businesses and the operators

1375
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:35,480
that are that have been around for a

1376
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,650
while and that will you know the new

1377
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:40,099
ones that will continue to stay around

1378
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:43,490
have to realize that adaptability and

1379
00:57:40,099 --> 00:57:45,789
flexibility is critical to survival in

1380
00:57:43,489 --> 00:57:48,199
this industry in this day and age and

1381
00:57:45,789 --> 00:57:50,150
just making sure that you're always on

1382
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:52,099
your toes and and that there aren't I

1383
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:53,900
mean they're literally as you said where

1384
00:57:52,099 --> 00:57:56,179
we're following a map but we kind of

1385
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:58,220
have blinders on because we don't really

1386
00:57:56,179 --> 00:58:00,529
know what the end is going to look like

1387
00:57:58,219 --> 00:58:02,059
but we we know what our overall ultimate

1388
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:06,230
goal is and we know that we're gonna get

1389
00:58:02,059 --> 00:58:08,299
there but there I I think there there

1390
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:10,250
should be a little bit of room for for

1391
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:12,019
understanding for everybody for for all

1392
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:13,909
of the the supply chain and for the

1393
00:58:12,019 --> 00:58:15,440
regulators and just we're all kind of

1394
00:58:13,909 --> 00:58:17,659
moving this horse together

1395
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:20,960
it is a multi-billion dollar industry

1396
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:23,359
and and we're trying to plug this in

1397
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,920
backwards so it's not gonna be and I'd

1398
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,750
love to jump in here too just because I

1399
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:30,200
absolutely feel your pain

1400
00:58:26,750 --> 00:58:32,869
you know I trying to educate my company

1401
00:58:30,199 --> 00:58:36,559
to the same points that yes you remember

1402
00:58:32,869 --> 00:58:37,880
emergency rigs 1.0 we rolled those up

1403
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:40,009
and threw those away then we had

1404
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:42,680
emergency regs 2.0 and that's what we're

1405
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:45,710
living by right now even though all the

1406
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:47,250
attention is on the proposed regs which

1407
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:48,480
were going through

1408
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:52,079
just wrapped up our public comment

1409
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:53,250
period but that aside it's also an

1410
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,559
important lesson I think for us to

1411
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:57,900
realize and we learn this on July 1st

1412
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:58,949
which is that depending on your position

1413
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:01,590
in the supply chain

1414
00:58:58,949 --> 00:59:07,049
there's state regs and those matter a

1415
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:08,670
lot but how your business partner next

1416
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:11,160
in the supply chain interprets those

1417
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:13,800
regs those are the real rags that's

1418
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:16,920
right because whatever Sabrina says is

1419
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:18,570
what they require for packaging it

1420
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:21,690
doesn't matter what I think

1421
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:23,160
you know the BCC says about packaging

1422
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:24,179
it's what she says about packaging

1423
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:26,250
because otherwise she's not taking my

1424
00:59:24,179 --> 00:59:28,199
product and I think that's that's that

1425
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:30,300
is the most challenging part of all

1426
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:34,109
because that shifts all over the place

1427
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:36,810
well respect our issue is all of those

1428
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:39,450
things you've said but also BCC says

1429
00:59:36,809 --> 00:59:41,190
something different than CD pH and this

1430
00:59:39,449 --> 00:59:42,839
one wants it inside the box this one

1431
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:45,240
wants it inside the box and outside the

1432
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:50,130
box and they're conflicting and they're

1433
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:52,679
all state regulatory agencies it's not

1434
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:55,079
fair to us as small businesses or even

1435
00:59:52,679 --> 00:59:57,000
big businesses to we've seen it in

1436
00:59:55,079 --> 00:59:58,739
Colorado where they have to retool and

1437
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,650
they have to redo this because the

1438
00:59:58,739 --> 01:00:03,299
agencies can't play together this is

1439
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:03,960
what I expected from this meeting

1440
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,360
tonight

1441
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:08,730
I expected the public comment to all

1442
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:11,460
come together and this is what we're

1443
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:13,500
gonna do we need this percent variance

1444
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:16,380
on testing we need this on the inside of

1445
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,400
the packaging we now can have CBD but we

1446
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:19,820
have to put it on the front of our

1447
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:22,650
packaging what's the resolution to that

1448
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:24,780
we'll take one more question for this

1449
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:28,289
panel and then we have an entire new

1450
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:29,880
panel after this so good evening Sean

1451
01:00:28,289 --> 01:00:31,529
Kelly rice oh look in Valley cannabis

1452

1453
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:36,960
attendance here a question for Lori

1454
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:38,610

1455
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:42,050
calling your office and interacting with

1456
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:44,160

1457
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:47,490
anyone that who who has who has

1458
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:49,649
questions call the BCC it you you will

1459
01:00:47,489 --> 01:00:51,269

1460
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:52,740
you an answer and you can actually move

1461
01:00:51,269 --> 01:00:55,500
forward so we've not had that problem

1462
01:00:52,739 --> 01:00:57,059
I'm on the front line the Silicon Valley

1463
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:59,679
cannabis lines is on the front line

1464
01:00:57,059 --> 01:01:02,799
without what we do

1465
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:04,509
none of these suppliers matter we're

1466
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:06,490
trying to get more and more retail in

1467
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:09,670
these cities right now Silicon Valley

1468
01:01:06,489 --> 01:01:12,549
only has San Jose it's 105 million

1469
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:14,440

1473
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:26,020
of other cities there looking at it I'm

1474
01:01:23,170 --> 01:01:30,159
the only person going out there

1475
01:01:26,019 --> 01:01:32,039
advocating talking to lobbying these

1476
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:33,849
folks and and and they're great

1477
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:36,639
politicians and elected officials to

1478
01:01:33,849 --> 01:01:39,909
talk to can you provide someone that can

1479
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:41,139
go and give a counterpoint to what I say

1480
01:01:39,909 --> 01:01:42,969
because when I go in there they're like

1481
01:01:41,139 --> 01:01:45,519
oh great this is wonderful Sean you get

1482
01:01:42,969 --> 01:01:48,879
paid by the industry who else can we

1483
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:51,099
talk to that from the BCC sometimes I'm

1484
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,619

affairs he's a one-man show going to all

1487
01:01:56,739 --> 01:02:01,899
the cities and counties across the state

1488
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:04,150
that's what we need you do honestly I

1489
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:06,309
mean that that would be so so helpful

1490
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:08,950
I'm going to San Carlos and gonna talk

1491
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:10,869
to the rotary and they hear my side of

1492
01:02:08,949 --> 01:02:12,429
it and they know what I'm gonna say but

1493
01:02:10,869 --> 01:02:13,809
they would love to have someone like

1494
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:15,819
this I would love to have a resource to

1495
01:02:13,809 --> 01:02:17,949
grab to go to all these cities and say

1496
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:20,200
here talk to the other side talk to the

1497
01:02:17,949 --> 01:02:22,179
state talk to someone that's other than

1498
01:02:20,199 --> 01:02:24,669
someone who's getting paid and get the

1499
01:02:22,179 --> 01:02:26,769
counterpoint see how well retailers are

1500
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:29,650
actually really doing that there it's

1501
01:02:26,769 --> 01:02:33,570
not chaos it's not mayhem you know it's

1502
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:36,910
not alcohol it's it's going pretty well

1503
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:39,160
well in another thing too we also are

1504
01:02:36,909 --> 01:02:41,170
developing we know there's needs to be a

1505
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:42,759
lot more education at the local level

1506
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:44,440
it's just not consumer it's just not our

1507
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:46,540
licensee it's also at the local level

1508
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:49,630
we're at establishing a unit a local

1509
01:02:46,539 --> 01:02:51,730
liaison unit so we're gonna hire 10

1510
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:53,619
analysts that that's their jobs to talk

1511
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:56,829
to the cities and be that resource

1512
01:02:53,619 --> 01:02:59,409
because they also want a single point of

1513
01:02:56,829 --> 01:03:02,049
contact now of course we got to hire the

1514
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:04,629
people first and train them so

1515
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:06,820
it's not coming next week but that's

1516
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:09,099
also going to assist you so you can

1517
01:03:06,820 --> 01:03:11,260
direct them to a certain person in that

1518
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:13,118
region from the VCC that can help them

1519
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:15,550
out and even forms like this that are

1520
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:18,640
designed specifically for politicians

1521
01:03:15,550 --> 01:03:20,410
we had one July 11th at the San Jose

1522
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:22,359
rotunda we ended up getting council

1523
01:03:20,409 --> 01:03:24,399
members from Santa Clara Council members

1524
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:26,230
from Milpitas other council members that

1525
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,820
actually showed up and we're they're

1526
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:29,079
interested because they want to hear

1527
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:31,420
from all the politicians that we had

1528
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:33,579
politicians come down from Antioch and

1529
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:35,590
it was fantastic so even forums like

1530
01:03:33,579 --> 01:03:36,969
this that are maybe not designed for the

1531
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:38,980
industry but designed for the

1532
01:03:36,969 --> 01:03:40,629
politicians so they feel in that safe

1533
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:42,550
environment that they can get some of

1534
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:45,039
that feedback because it really helps us

1535
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:46,570
get more retail because that's really

1536
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:49,929
you know it storefront and delivery

1537
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:52,210
because we're woefully you know lacking

1538
01:03:49,929 --> 01:03:53,980
in delivery also so can I thank you I

1539
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:55,300
would love to respond to your question

1540
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:59,920
as well real quick because I feel like

1541
01:03:55,300 --> 01:04:03,369
this is you know take a an average 50

1542
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:07,030
year old adult that things that they're

1543
01:04:03,369 --> 01:04:09,100
healthy and until they go to the doctor

1544
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:11,830
and get a diagnosis that says we

1545
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:15,250
measured your you know your LDLs in your

1546
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:17,139
blood and you have really high chance of

1547
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:19,210
of a heart attack you need to change

1548
01:04:17,139 --> 01:04:20,889
your behavior until you can do that

1549
01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:22,539
they're thinking they're healthy and I

1550
01:04:20,889 --> 01:04:25,659
feel like the same thing is going on in

1551
01:04:22,539 --> 01:04:27,279
these communities that think you know

1552
01:04:25,659 --> 01:04:28,659
we're not gonna deal with the regulated

1553
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:31,690
market we don't want to touch that right

1554
01:04:28,659 --> 01:04:33,759
now but we're also not gonna admit to

1555
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:35,889
ourselves that we have an illicit market

1556
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,619
that's going on as well there needs to

1557
01:04:35,889 --> 01:04:41,920
be a way to measure what's going on in

1558
01:04:38,619 --> 01:04:43,780
communities so that we can point at that

1559
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,059
and say here's your illicit market it's

1560
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:48,580
this big it's this valuable and you're

1561
01:04:46,059 --> 01:04:51,400
missing out on this much job creation

1562
01:04:48,579 --> 01:04:52,989
tax revenue this is this is the amount

1563
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:55,030
of product that is moving through your

1564
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:57,939
illicit market that is untested and and

1565
01:04:55,030 --> 01:05:00,430
who knows where it goes to if we can

1566
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:02,530
measure that and begin to have that

1567
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:05,379
information to present to communities

1568
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:08,830
and say this is your this is your status

1569
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:11,140
we would encourage you to move to the

1570
01:05:08,829 --> 01:05:12,519
regulated market and improve the health

1571
01:05:11,139 --> 01:05:14,559
of your community I think it would be

1572
01:05:12,519 --> 01:05:17,139
hugely helpful to

1573
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,519
work that you do and and let me just say

1574
01:05:17,139 --> 01:05:20,409
that I salute the work that you do

1575
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:22,360
because you're absolutely right without

1576
01:05:20,409 --> 01:05:23,649
more retail throughout the state and the

1577
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,660
two thirds of the state that has no

1578
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:27,579
retail what we have is we have an

1579
01:05:25,659 --> 01:05:29,679
illicit market that we don't know how

1580
01:05:27,579 --> 01:05:31,239
big it is but it's pretty healthy I can

1581
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:34,000
tell you that it's a it's a big healthy

1582
01:05:31,239 --> 01:05:37,000
