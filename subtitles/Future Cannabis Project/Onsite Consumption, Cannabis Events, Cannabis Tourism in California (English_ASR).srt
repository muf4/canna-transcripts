1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:13,049
[Music]

2
00:00:16,489 --> 00:00:22,198
on-site consumption cannabis events and

3
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:25,559
cannabis tourism we're going to start

4
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,150
off discussing on-site consumption and a

5
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,948
man this kind of give us kind of like an

6
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:30,598
overview of the different approaches in

7
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,570
different jurisdictions across

8
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:35,730
California yeah absolutely and we also

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,859
first want to start by explaining in

10
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:40,738
California there's on-site consumption

11
00:00:37,859 --> 00:00:43,170
and there's events these are two

12
00:00:40,738 --> 00:00:45,179
different things and we're going to talk

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,100
about on-site consumption and then

14
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:50,700
there's two variations of on-site

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,570
consumption so you've got places that

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,390
are dispensaries that have a consumption

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,770
venue attached thereto and then there's

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,500
such a thing that separate those are

19
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,750
standalone lounges that our place is

20
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,829
just to go consume cannabis and those

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,469
are the two different concepts were

22
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:09,688
looking at so San Francisco is one of

23
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:12,719
the earliest what San Francisco has

24
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:15,389
three dispensaries that have on-site

25
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,239
consumption lounges attached to them now

26
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,909
these were in existence well before all

27
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:23,429
the state regulations came into play and

28
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,560
San Francisco wanted to do more work and

29
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,868
look at this more carefully down the

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,689
line but they decided to grandfather in

31
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:32,879
those three so those are the only three

32
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:36,000
in San Francisco today that are allowed

33
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:38,039
to have these that said San Francisco is

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,920
looking at a much more robust set of

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,759
regulations for that right now they are

36
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,680
very concerned about clean air and and

37
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,328
worker protection in that environment so

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,130
we're gonna expect some probably a

39
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:52,739
really robust regulation there in the

40
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:55,649
coming months and they're probably gonna

41
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:58,789
set the stage for for many more now in

42
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:02,969
Coachella Cathedral City Palm Springs

43
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:06,830
they also are on site consumption

44
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:10,710
and it's been a pretty recent

45
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:13,949
developments in those places down in the

46
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,750
valley West Hollywood is interesting

47
00:02:13,949 --> 00:02:19,949
they have both they're looking at

48
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:21,750
lounges and they're looking at places

49
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:24,810
that have on-site consumption and their

50
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,219
different licenses and that's

51
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,020
interesting because it's a combo play

52
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:28,949
but the thing about West Hollywood is

53
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,990
they've always kind of looked at

54
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:33,569
themselves as you know adult Disneyland

55
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:37,340
and they're like yeah bring it on you

56
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:39,419
want condom billboards cool you you want

57
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,500
strip clubs cool they're open to

58
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:42,119
everything down there and they're like

59
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,180
this you know this fits West Hollywood

60
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,250
its adult Disneyland so they've been

61
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,629
very aggressive about that but they're

62
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,250
still working on actually issuing

63
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:53,579
permits so they haven't issued any of

64
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,919
these on-site consumptions or separate

65
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:57,719
lounge licenses yet but I'm gonna pass

66
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:58,979
the mic to these two ladies if they want

67
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,509
to add some insight because I think

68
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:03,329
they've both worked on applications in

69
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:05,429
West Hollywood yeah the interesting part

70
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,590
for me about West Hollywood is they

71
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,830
they're more willing as a city I think

72
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,920
to push the envelope versus what the

73
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:16,170
state will allow they also looked

74
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,809
specifically at edible consumption and

75
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:21,419
the desire to have restaurants and

76
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,120
ready-made food that's going to be

77
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:26,729
interesting also the idea of smoking and

78
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,890
having the ability to do so at a

79
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:31,439
consumption lounge that ties into OSHA

80
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:34,048
and how if you're not a manager can you

81
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:37,109
be in a facility and exposed to smoke

82
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:39,780
and your workers exposed to smoke how

83
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,370
that consumption lounge they I think at

84
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,099
one point West Hollywood was discussing

85
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,039
staying open until 2:00 a.m. for a

86
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,930
consumption lounge what is that going to

87
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,659
do to the dynamics and how do you have

88
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,120
to be a good actor within that facility

89
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:58,859
so we're gonna see West Hollywood

90
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:02,099
continue to push the envelope work with

91
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,320
the state to fold in where they need to

92
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,780
be my favorite comment during the we

93
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,979
whole process was when they said we have

94
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,080
no children

95
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:11,609
when discussing step back the city

96
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,120
manager is like don't worry we don't

97
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,120
have

98
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:17,160
children my god son goes to school in

99
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,269
West Hollywood so that was interesting

100
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:24,780
but it gives you any indication about

101
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:27,000
where that city is those are cities that

102
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:29,159
I think are gonna come on with Avensis

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,168
we'll talk about later but if you were

104
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,639
to ask me a crystal ball question I

105
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:35,819
don't think they're the first one that's

106
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,699
going to do an event outside of their

107
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:41,579
existing would-be allowance for on-site

108
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:43,259
consumption in retail and so one of the

109
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:44,909
things Pam was just talking about was

110
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:47,819
OSHA right you heard her talk about OSHA

111
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,810
the concerns that San Francisco raised

112
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:50,550
and the reason why they're getting

113
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,350
robust are actually the same things that

114
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,829
were raised in a recent report from Cal

115
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:57,570
OSHA so Cal OSHA was first tasked with

116
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:59,430
looking at whether or not they needed to

117
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,110
create regulations specific for the

118
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,870
cannabis industry and so they created a

119
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,270
workgroup internally on this and they

120
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:09,060
put out a report I believe September I

121
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:11,668
don't know 38 sometime in September and

122
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,649
what this report did is it looked at a

123
00:05:11,668 --> 00:05:15,209
lot of risk so you know two workers in

124
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:16,888
the canvas space you know it looked at

125
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:18,538
things like people working in

126
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:20,460
cultivation facilities and protection

127
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:22,469
from pesticide exposure and this and

128
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:24,750
that and most everything they came up

129
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,669
with they said well that already is

130
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,310
covered like farmworkers have rules that

131
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:30,629
they need to follow in general and end

132
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,819
the agriculture and those would apply

133
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:35,129
and protect the workers here but one of

134
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:38,060
the big things that got hung up on was

135
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:41,219
this on-site social consumption and

136
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,259
exposure to secondhand smoke and so

137
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,610
that's the same thing San Francisco is

138
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:47,819
worried about and that we're probably

139
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,990
likely to see more on Cal OSHA from and

140
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:52,259
how does that come in with like the

141
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:54,710
clean air laws etc so definitely keep an

142
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:58,680
eye on Cal OSHA that's it's the

143
00:05:54,709 --> 00:06:01,589
Industrial Relations Board basically

144
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:05,879
it's what it's properly called so before

145
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:08,489
we really go down the road of telling

146
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,050
you where it's where things are evolving

147
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:13,889
how things work

148
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:16,139
you know what towns are starting to see

149
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:18,060
some progress in this direction I would

150
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,639
just tell all of you in the audience

151
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:24,620
that you really have to just adopt this

152
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,899
mindset that this is a starting point

153
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,879
and really the way you get things going

154
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:30,799
is to start having conversations with

155
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,379
the people and the municipalities where

156
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,050
you want to work you have a much better

157
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:38,689
chance of developing a program that

158
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:41,300
really works in your real life situation

159
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:44,540
than to sit back and wait for them to

160
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:47,180
come up with the ideas come to the table

161
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,250
with a business plan let them know what

162
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,100
you're thinking about doing let them

163
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,079
know that you're well capitalized let

164
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:56,410
them know about your ties to the

165
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,430
community it's all of those

166
00:06:56,410 --> 00:07:01,340
conversations that will give them the

167
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,560
comfort level to take the next step and

168
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:06,679
there will be many municipalities that

169
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,959
will wait for other cities to do it

170
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,180
first and they'll wait to see how things

171
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,099
happen before they do something but you

172
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,168
can start having those conversations now

173
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,020
and it's better to be armed with

174
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:20,299
information that helps educate them you

175
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:21,859
should not assume that they know as much

176
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:25,310
as you do about the cannabis industry

177
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,050
you're really taking on the

178
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,959
responsibility of educating the people

179
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:34,069
that you meet with so one thing to add

180
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:35,870
to that too is diana's so right it's

181
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:37,610
it's not just that you can it's you know

182
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,620
people and on our software right you

183
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,360
could see every city council meeting and

184
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,918
so there'll be an informational item on

185
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,229
perhaps sixty four and I tell people

186
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:48,019
those don't just happen it's because a

187
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:51,079
stakeholder went to that city and push

188
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:52,490
them to have that conversation and if

189
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:54,889
you're not the stakeholder that's

190
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,120
initiating that conversation another one

191
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:58,759
is and you're not a part of that

192
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,800
conversation these conversations are all

193
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:03,529
happening because somebody is doing it

194
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,990
it is rarely the city going huh wait I

195
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:08,899
need to do that so remember if you're

196
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,550
not someone else is and it's we agree

197
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:12,948
and wise like to call out a solutions

198
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:15,949
driven approach right have the

199
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:17,840
conversation and know what that city

200
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:20,478
does in same or similar circumstances

201
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,489
that you want to do if you're talking

202
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,589
about consumption if you're talking

203
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,319
about an event they have rhetoric

204
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:30,649
already built in to their zoning code

205
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:32,809
they have processes in place permits and

206
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:35,179
so if you make it comfortable if you

207
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:37,239
make it comfortable and familiar you're

208
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:40,538
gonna get more traction in that

209
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:43,450
conversation and let this be a good

210
00:08:40,538 --> 00:08:45,669
steward of the industry if a city is

211
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,278
toying with the idea as to whether or

212
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:50,679
not they want to regulate showing them

213
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:53,769
an educational event that's well

214
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:57,370
organized that they're gonna get an ROI

215
00:08:53,769 --> 00:09:00,579
on that may push them into regulation so

216
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:03,669
this is really a way or a mechanism that

217
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:06,910
we've been gifted to be able to have an

218
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:09,159
honest communication with the local

219
00:09:06,909 --> 00:09:11,889
jurisdictions where they can see the

220
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:16,059
activity before they have to go and

221
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:18,069
develop an entire program for the supply

222
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:21,039
chain of cannabis this gives them a

223
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:24,070
flavor of that and so hopefully we can

224
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:27,809
use it to spark more regulation

225
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:31,379
throughout the state thank you for that

226
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:34,419
we're getting a lot of questions about

227
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:36,129
use in homes so I guess a lot of

228
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:38,199
questions from people who want to think

229
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:41,799
you know what are the boundaries and

230
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,959
parameters for sales and consumption in

231
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:46,169
private residences and how is that

232
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:50,229
different than what we're talking about

233
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:52,120
can you quickly go over that you can

234
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:56,470
consume cannabis in your private

235
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:58,450
residence that's you know rule one you

236
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,740
cannot sell to your friends unless you

237
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,980
are a licensed business and your friends

238
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:04,419
or at your licensed business you can

239
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,370
give to your friends you can consume

240
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:08,740
with your friends and your in your own

241
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,179
home if you are in your backyard you've

242
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,669
got to be a little careful sometimes

243
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:15,069
because where is that in regard to

244
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:16,360
what's public you know are you visible

245
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:18,040
to your neighbors are you visible to the

246
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,570
street be a good neighbor they're

247
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:22,360
probably not going to come after you

248
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:24,120
no I always like to Astrix that if

249
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,950
you're living in an apartment building

250
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,950
look at your lease and what you're

251
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:31,660
allowed to do or your commercial

252
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:35,079
business and you want to throw an event

253
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:38,199
we are still unfortunately a Schedule

254
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:41,379
one federally illegal substance it is

255
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,540
very commonplace to see in a lease that

256
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:45,070
you shouldn't be conducting commercial

257
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:47,208
or you shouldn't be conducting federally

258
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:49,639
illegal activity that is

259
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:51,799
it seems logical right you wouldn't want

260
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:55,159
your business being used for a crack

261
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:56,990
house but in California to but in

262
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:59,118
California we have a call out for

263
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:01,278
cannabis it's something when we work on

264
00:10:59,119 --> 00:11:04,428
cannabis leases within the supply chain

265
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:06,198
verticals that you have to address so

266
00:11:04,428 --> 00:11:08,558
what does that mean that means we need

267
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:12,948
as Diane I'll talk about more places for

268
00:11:08,558 --> 00:11:15,740
Responsible consumption so what we're

269
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:17,838
seeing in Colorado which kind of is a

270
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,928
little bit of a view into the future of

271
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:24,649
this I just attended an event a few

272
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:26,058
weeks ago and the person that has been

273
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:29,208
holding these events they are private

274
00:11:26,058 --> 00:11:33,588
events they are held usually on farms

275
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:35,268
that are close to the more metropolitan

276
00:11:33,589 --> 00:11:37,490
area but there people are fine with

277
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:41,539
having consumption on their private

278
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:43,698
residences but she has gone methodically

279
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:47,208
through every step of the process to

280
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:49,338
make sure that even the businesses that

281
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:51,198
she's working with the dispensary the

282
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:53,869
brands that she's working with for these

283
00:11:51,198 --> 00:11:57,258
events are following all the regulations

284
00:11:53,869 --> 00:12:00,319
along the way so for example in Boulder

285
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:02,449
where I live Boulder has created an

286
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:05,028
another layer on top of the state

287
00:12:02,448 --> 00:12:07,278
regulations that requires that you can't

288
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:09,828
sell product below what your wholesale

289
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:13,338
prices is so she has had to go through

290
00:12:09,828 --> 00:12:15,769
the effort of putting together goodie

291
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:18,319
bags with the brands that are sponsoring

292
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:21,019
these events they have to work up a

293
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:24,578
price structure they have to ensure that

294
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:28,669
the total quantity of the goodie bag

295
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:31,068
items don't go over the state limits of

296
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:32,539
what an individual can purchase and then

297
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:34,099
those people then the people that are

298
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:37,399
attending these events actually have to

299
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:39,079
go to the dispensary to purchase the

300
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:41,089
goodie bag and then they bring that

301
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:44,298
goodie bag with them to the event

302
00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:47,240
so my recommendation to all of you is

303
00:12:44,298 --> 00:12:49,519
you know find out all along the supply

304
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,548
chain if you're wanting to put in on it

305
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,350
on an event find out what you know the

306
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:56,448
dispensaries are going to have to do to

307
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,490
stay in compliance find out what the

308
00:12:56,448 --> 00:13:00,169
events going to have to do just to

309
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:03,889
remain and comply

310
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:05,990
there might be little nuances that you

311
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:09,860
have to use when you're sending out your

312
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:12,528
invitations they might have to be vetted

313
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,329
for making sure that the person's 21 or

314
00:13:12,528 --> 00:13:18,049
over there's all these little details

315
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:20,028
that add on to what you're going to have

316
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:22,729
to research to make sure that what

317
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:24,828
you're doing covers all of the check

318
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:31,970
boxes you know that nothing gets left

319
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:35,088
unchecked so it's you know as we have

320
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,490
learned from experience complete

321
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:40,070
compliance with the local regulations

322
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:42,740
and local directives is critical to make

323
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:45,709
these events successful California is so

324
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,539
individualized there's 58 counties 482

325
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:49,099
different cities they're each going to

326
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:51,078
have their own way of regulating

327
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,740
cannabis events and so now we're going

328
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:58,309
to start discussing cannabis events and

329
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:01,009
I guess we'll start off with assembly

330
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:04,909
built 2020 which is a major legislative

331
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:08,299
development and I'll pass it off to Pam

332
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:11,198
who's the lawyer AV 2020 allows for

333
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:13,549
events to not solely take place on

334
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:16,909
fairgrounds or district agricultural

335
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:21,289
associations this has been an extremely

336
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:24,860
limiting aspect of cannabis event

337
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:26,389
regulation because the DA is whereas you

338
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,980
would think if you were limited to a

339
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:30,019
County fairground or a district

340
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,509
agricultural Association that that state

341
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:36,139
agency would have control over their

342
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:38,569
borders or what happens within those

343
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:42,100
jurisdictions they do not so you had to

344
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:46,040
go to the local jurisdiction in which a

345
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:48,560
DAA or a County Fairgrounds sat and get

346
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:50,838
their approval that doesn't necessarily

347
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,448
seem difficult but in the instances in

348
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:57,410
Southern California specifically you had

349
00:14:53,448 --> 00:15:00,078
the 28th DAA who wanted to throw

350
00:14:57,409 --> 00:15:01,549
a chalice event they had to go to the

351
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,128
city of Victorville the city in

352
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:06,289
Victorville had banned all cannabis so

353
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:08,149
while you had a willing district

354
00:15:06,289 --> 00:15:10,149
agricultural Association in that

355
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:13,789
instance you didn't have a willing

356
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:16,370
jurisdiction so with a be 2020 you opens

357
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:19,309
up to other venues so let's say a

358
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:22,278
neighboring city of Hesperia who now

359
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:24,919
currently has delivery allowances wanted

360
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:29,360
to throw an event they now could

361
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:32,149
identify a location within that city the

362
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,100
event organizer could come in and ask

363
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:36,828
for local approval and it doesn't need

364
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,470
to be on the fairground that is located

365
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:43,578
over in Victorville so it opens us up to

366
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:45,110
being able to have events not at da Ace

367
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:47,328
or County Fairgrounds what does that

368
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:49,490
mean and how to local jurisdictions

369
00:15:47,328 --> 00:15:52,188
grapple with that they're going to have

370
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,198
to have some amount of a process and

371
00:15:52,188 --> 00:15:56,469
what is that going to look like we're

372
00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:58,818
gonna see a significant uptick in

373
00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:01,069
regulation in this area and as we've

374
00:15:58,818 --> 00:16:05,269
discussed if you go to them in a

375
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:06,139
solutions driven way and say how do I go

376
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:08,149
about doing this

377
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:11,839
how do we work through it together do

378
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:14,259
you have an existing temporary events or

379
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,720
an event structure that we can just add

380
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:19,370
cannabis to as an additional element and

381
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,509
we would go through and you can get your

382
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:25,938
state events licensee and that shows

383
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:27,829
that you've already committed that

384
00:16:25,938 --> 00:16:29,568
you're already understanding the

385
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:32,269
cannabis process and we'll make that

386
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:34,789
conversation easier so before you go to

387
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:36,379
get your event license or your temporary

388
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:39,799
event allowance from the local

389
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:43,250
authorization get your events organiser

390
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:45,708
licensee to show credibility proof of

391
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:47,360
concept that you understand the cannabis

392
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:51,198
rules in the discussion that you want to

393
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,449
have yes I guess to elaborate on the

394
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:56,179
process the step number one is to get a

395
00:16:53,448 --> 00:16:58,549
cannabis event organiser license from

396
00:16:56,179 --> 00:16:59,989
the Bureau of cannabis control and right

397
00:16:58,549 --> 00:17:03,889
now they're handing out temporary

398
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:06,859
cannabis event organiser licenses until

399
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:09,890
the permanent regs are released and

400
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:12,619
they're handing those out for free

401
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:14,720
step two is obtained local authorization

402
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:17,869
Express local approval from the local

403
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,480
jurisdiction step number three is get a

404
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:22,369
temporary cannabis event license for a

405
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,610
temporary cannabis event lasting up to

406
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:27,558
four days at that location so this

407
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:28,819
allows for short-term events four days

408
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:32,210
is pretty generous that's like a

409
00:17:28,819 --> 00:17:34,548
three-day weekend and so it really

410
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,529
unlocks cannabis events that we have

411
00:17:34,548 --> 00:17:38,119
seen so far six in the state of

412
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:40,490
California they have all bayonette

413
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:43,369
County Fairgrounds now we will start

414
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:45,380
seeing cannabis events all sorts of

415
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:47,539
places so I would like to hear from the

416
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,040
panel panelists what kind of cannabis

417
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:50,750
events do you want to see that you

418
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,230
haven't seen before because like

419
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:56,240
California has almost like a you know

420
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:59,179
blank canvas when it comes to cannabis

421
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,370
events I mean I've seen like bacon and

422
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:03,470
beer so like cannabis and beer I mean

423
00:18:01,369 --> 00:18:06,409
cannabis and bacon event sounds kind of

424
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,789
fun the Munchie festival who knows but I

425
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:13,640
mean some cool pairing events would be

426
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:16,668
pretty fun okay next I like to see where

427
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:19,929
we showcase responsible consumption and

428
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:22,070
change that image where we're really

429
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:24,259
interacting together having an

430
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:28,519
experience being able to understand what

431
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:30,349
that's like and and invite novice people

432
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:32,900
in and do an event that's really about

433
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:35,808
micro dosing and what does that mean I'd

434
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,370
like to see that ooh Pam that's alright

435
00:18:35,808 --> 00:18:39,678
now she's got my brain going I would

436
00:18:37,369 --> 00:18:43,339
love to do I'm with changing mine I want

437
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,530
to do an event for her like baby boomers

438
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:47,599
we're over a couple days they could

439
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:48,918
actually try a bunch of different

440
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,839
products in a controlled environment

441
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,429
where they felt safe and learned because

442
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:54,649
a lot of people go buy something and

443
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:55,759
that doesn't work but I'd love just and

444
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,048
this isn't there like over and they'll

445
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,390
go back to their pharmacy but I would

446
00:18:57,048 --> 00:19:00,740
love to see a multi-day event where you

447
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:02,030
know every few hours they could try a

448
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,130
little bit of this and that and figure

449
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:06,230
out what heals them and make it like

450
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:10,960
really you know geriatric friendly like

451
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:15,048
a cannabis wellness weekend yes

452
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:18,009
something something that as oh jeez

453
00:19:15,048 --> 00:19:22,058
could go too right Amanda

454
00:19:18,009 --> 00:19:24,569
get away so I get away I mean I think

455
00:19:22,058 --> 00:19:26,888
something that's really interesting is

456
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:29,200
California is the size of other

457
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:34,209
countries you know world economies it's

458
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:36,880
it's its own you know giant ecosystem

459
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:40,058
and we're already comfortable with how

460
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,600
much tourism happens in California we

461
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:45,398
have I have some data here twenty three

462
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:48,250
point six million tourists come to

463
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:51,069
wineries so just apply the same

464
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:54,099
principles to cannabis I think it'd be

465
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:56,048
great to be able to go out to a farm and

466
00:19:54,099 --> 00:20:00,099
see the canvas growing and then maybe

467
00:19:56,048 --> 00:20:01,869
follow them to the manufacturing

468
00:20:00,099 --> 00:20:04,480
location more that's turned into other

469
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:07,479
products and you know then you get your

470
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,569
goodie bag when you leave maybe and and

471
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,308
maybe you even are able to sample some

472
00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:14,200
cannabis while you're there but they're

473
00:20:12,308 --> 00:20:17,190
you know there's going to be so many

474
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:22,080
people coming from other countries for

475
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:26,288
the experience places like China and

476
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:29,138
South Korea where they are not going to

477
00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:32,589
legalize anytime soon and they want to

478
00:20:29,138 --> 00:20:34,959
come here to experience that and there

479
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:38,168
are so many great events that are

480
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:42,278
already being done like have you been to

481
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:44,500
any of those those businesses that offer

482
00:20:42,278 --> 00:20:47,429
like you bring some wine and then you

483
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:52,028
can paint a picture and things like well

484
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:54,788
yeah we have that in Oakland so a friend

485
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:57,788
of mine started her business called puff

486
00:20:54,788 --> 00:21:00,339
pass and paint and they also have puff

487
00:20:57,788 --> 00:21:02,558
pass and pamper where they make bath

488
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:06,668
salts that are infused and things like

489
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:08,798
that and all those great ideas are are

490
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:10,809
coming here to California as well I have

491
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:14,079
a client waiting on a license in West

492
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:18,220
Hollywood they've teamed up with a chef

493
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:21,339
a 420 chef and they're working with labs

494
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:24,220
to figure out how can we have him

495
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:27,668
demonstrate making some infused food

496
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:30,890
products to his audience quickly go have

497
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:32,900
that tested once it's become infused

498
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,429
and then get the test results back in

499
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:37,100
time for these people to actually

500
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:39,170
consume on site would that be cool right

501
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:42,109
I mean we'll see things like that

502
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:45,230
evolving as time goes on and as people

503
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:47,149
take the leap to not only be the first

504
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:49,058
but to kind of weather the storm and

505
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:51,740
work out all the kinks of those things

506
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:53,928
where California we're coming back with

507
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:56,529
the resurgence of an events culture I

508
00:21:53,929 --> 00:22:00,170
guess it's really gonna be interesting

509
00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:03,048
cannabis is notorious and has a legacy

510
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:05,150
for creativity and innovation and I'm

511
00:22:03,048 --> 00:22:08,119
excited to see what's to come I'd like a

512
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:10,190
cannabis demo weekend all right like

513
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:13,699
putting everyone's ideas together and

514
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:15,890
and see what that's like I'm excited for

515
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:20,630
what 2019 has to offer

516
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:22,790
personally very much so so you know I

517
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,650
guess we already have a very thriving

518
00:22:22,789 --> 00:22:27,109
ecosystem of cannabis events in

519
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:29,660
California what does this mean for all

520
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:34,129
the pop-up events that we're seeing how

521
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:35,298
are they gonna adapt I think this is

522
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:38,929
where you talk about track and trace

523
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:41,990
right um pop-up events have been very

524
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:44,870
concerning specifically to me when we

525
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:47,599
talk again about in private residences

526
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:49,369
what do you do if you have a vendor

527
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:52,219
that's showcasing they're in California

528
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:55,308
how does that product get to that event

529
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,620
it cannot come from a manufacturer to

530
00:22:55,308 --> 00:23:00,289
your private residence for them to give

531
00:22:57,619 --> 00:23:02,750
that product away and consume on site it

532
00:23:00,289 --> 00:23:04,879
has to go through the proper channels

533
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:07,039
which here in California means it goes

534
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,970
to a distributor that distributor or

535
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,889
undertakes qa/qc procedures it goes to a

536
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:15,230
third-party lab it's tested it's cleared

537
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:18,080
it has cleared coa and then it goes to a

538
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:20,240
retailer a retailer sells it and whether

539
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:24,349
or not that's an event license that you

540
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,490
can get i to sell at the private

541
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:29,418
residence because you are not a

542
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:32,000
dispensary in your house as Amanda said

543
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:34,790
so these sort of pop-up events that have

544
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,548
been occurring that are either on

545
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:39,440
private property and again I always go

546
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:42,200
back to what's in the lease are you

547
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,000
jeopardizing somebody's building by

548
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,210
doing so or I heard from the audience

549
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,339
what about liquor licenses if you're

550
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,710
having it at a restaurant and you just

551
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:54,019
did a pop-up event what is the liquor

552
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,779
what does the ABC gonna say about that

553
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:59,750
do you have to not sell alcohol if

554
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:02,058
you're doing a cannabis consumption

555
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:03,440
event we've seen the governor oh my

556
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:05,720
remind me of the bill number if you have

557
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,279
it off the top of your head is that

558
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:10,579
signed the bill that you can't have

559
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:12,889
alcohol and cannabis which was then teed

560
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:15,439
up in the draft permanent regulations

561
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,840
that we saw where you can't confuse a

562
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,419
consumer and have D alkalized beer or

563
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,909
wine with cannabis in it there's a lot

564
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:27,110
of concerns where those just can collide

565
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:29,390
wine don't call it wine or confuse the

566
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:31,779
consumer so if it's in a wine bottle I

567
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:34,820
think there's gonna make those arguments

568
00:24:31,779 --> 00:24:36,889
that it may not survive so we're still

569
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:38,808
gonna see what that looks like and tread

570
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,820
very cautiously any time you're gonna

571
00:24:38,808 --> 00:24:43,460
have an event and I think the the

572
00:24:40,819 --> 00:24:46,428
plaguing legacy of pop-up events is they

573
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:49,190
are constantly combined with alcohol

574
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:52,250
consumption yes and the Bureau of

575
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:56,090
cannabis control the cheese Laurie Ajax

576
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:58,460
is a former deputy chief of ABC and so

577
00:24:56,089 --> 00:25:00,500
she has a very strong regulatory

578
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,690
enforcement background in alcohol

579
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,000
enforcement and it seems pretty clear

580
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:07,789
that both agencies want there to be a

581
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:11,210
clear bright line of division their

582
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:13,099
concern in my view is the naive consumer

583
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,409
people cross-fading who are not

584
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:18,379
experienced in using both cannabis and

585
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:20,450
alcohol they basically want to avoid the

586
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,309
horror stories of somebody who gets

587
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:24,440
completely wasted because they're using

588
00:25:22,308 --> 00:25:28,190
both substances and they find that's a

589
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:30,710
way to mitigate the public risk now

590
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,269
we're gonna get down to events in

591
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:33,919
California cities and we're gonna get

592
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:37,849
some of the very latest updates on

593
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:39,190
cannabis event ordinances from Amanda

594
00:25:37,849 --> 00:25:41,500
Stewart yeah absolutely

595
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,640
so what's interesting is I actually made

596
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,099
some phone calls because I wanted to

597
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,650
talk to some cities because there was as

598
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:49,539
much San Francisco was using our

599
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,280
platform recently and they they called

600
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:52,899
me and they said hey all I found was

601
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,079
this that and that am I using the

602
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:58,030
software wrong I said no it's just AP

603
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,829
2020 hadn't been signed yet and people

604
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:02,079
weren't dealing with it and so there

605
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:05,169
wasn't a lot but now Oakland is one who

606
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:07,779
they just did a cleanup I believe it was

607
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:10,120
October 2nd they passed this new

608
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:12,549
ordinance and what it did was it

609
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:14,229
referenced their pre-existing event laws

610
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:17,079
they just said here are our laws for

611
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:18,880
events and that's what are gonna be the

612
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:21,730
laws for events for cannabis but we're

613
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,220
gonna limit you to 12 a year because we

614
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:25,839
don't want you using this events license

615
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,850
as a workaround to actually having a

616
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,230
dispensary they'd want people to

617
00:26:27,849 --> 00:26:30,699
basically just have a new event permit

618
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:33,490
for each day the next day the next day

619
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,350
and be playing their system San

620
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:42,400
Francisco is working on something more

621
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:44,949
robust expect to see more and within

622
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,620
what the last couple of weeks let's see

623
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:49,029
we saw Harika just recently passed some

624
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:53,409
ordinances around events

625
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:54,759
I talked to Humboldt County because I

626
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:57,670
thought you know that's a great place

627
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:59,710
for our events and basically he said our

628
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:01,480
ordinance basically just says follow the

629
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:03,340
state rules and get approval from us so

630
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,200
basically the exact process Omar

631
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:06,759
outlined so some cities I think we're

632
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,900
gonna see a trend of a bunch that are

633
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:10,779
just gonna say here are our regular

634
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:12,519
event rules follow the states cannabis

635
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:15,009
event rules and then something is gonna

636
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:16,480
get messed up someone's gonna you know

637
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,680
do something stupid and then the locals

638
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,210
are gonna start making some more rules

639
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,360
around it but if you guys act

640
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:23,350
responsibly and and you know don't push

641
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:26,229
them to where they have to we'll

642
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:28,539
probably stick with less lenient laws I

643
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:30,039
talked to Joe who's sitting back there

644
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:32,889
it sounds like this is something gonna

645
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:35,019
to take up next year in Sacramento yeah

646
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:36,580
take a deeper look in here they got

647
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:38,289
enough on their plate but give it up for

648
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:43,419
Joe being really like progressive and

649
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:45,399
getting a lot of law down there I like

650
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,500
making him blush Amanda can you

651
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,080
elaborate a little bit on Sacramento's

652
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,250
unique event ordinance which I think

653
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:51,649
could be a model for the rest of the

654
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,990
state

655
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:55,880
it just delegates the authority to

656
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,829
approve events to the city managers my

657
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:00,050
understanding oh well that was an

658
00:27:57,829 --> 00:28:01,490
administrative rule basically I think it

659
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:03,049
to make it was the goal to make it so

660
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:05,329
you don't have to have a hearing at a

661
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:06,470
City Council meeting every time much the

662
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:08,389
way that if you were gonna do a normal

663
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:10,250
permit for certain things in a city you

664
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,140
go and you submit and the person in the

665
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:13,910
city manager's office can approve or

666
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,000
deny it and basically what they're doing

667
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:18,920
is making less City Council hearing type

668
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,349
of situation and and delegating that

669
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:24,170
authority to make it smoother and

670
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:27,319
simpler and I think streamlining that

671
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:29,090
approval process can really allow more

672
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:30,649
events to happen in California so I

673
00:28:29,089 --> 00:28:32,480
think I think we're gonna see more of

674
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:34,130
this but I think initially we're just

675
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,990
gonna see people saying hey you have to

676
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:38,240
get your permit from a state law he says

677
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:40,670
that and then look at their events laws

678
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,380
and again this is one where if you want

679
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:44,900
to influence your city to allow these

680
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,270
events go and look at their event laws

681
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,490
as they are and show them how to

682
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:52,250
incorporate that by reference they might

683
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:53,509
not know how it's really simple work but

684
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:55,460
if you hand them the draft that just

685
00:28:53,509 --> 00:28:56,690
says hey you've got these if there's two

686
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,450
three things you want to add that are

687
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:01,430
specific to cannabis you know that's

688
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,470
simple enough here's how Oakland did it

689
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:05,390
here's how someone else did it show them

690
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:08,299
the cities that they generally look to

691
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:10,340
when making policy that have examples of

692
00:29:08,299 --> 00:29:12,980
how it's been done they never want to be

693
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:15,289
the first unless you know you're one of

694
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:17,390
the big renegades like you know Oakland

695
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:21,559
West Hollywood Sacramento San Francisco

696
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:23,900
who are setting the stage so looking at

697
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:27,049
the crystal ball Pam where do you think

698
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,820
in Southern California we will see these

699
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:30,799
temporary cannabis events not at a

700
00:29:28,819 --> 00:29:33,289
fairground or district agricultural

701
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,779
Association I think they're gonna be in

702
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:38,599
more unexpected places I wouldn't say

703
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:42,139
that come January you're gonna see an

704
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:44,089
event in Los Angeles Santa Monica or

705
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:46,790
West Hollywood I think you're more

706
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:50,509
likely to see it transpire potentially

707
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:54,740
somewhere like Malibu or more likely in

708
00:29:50,509 --> 00:29:56,779
Coachella or Palm Springs or Desert Hot

709
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,700
Springs where they're used to doing

710
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:02,779
events where they've already taken

711
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:04,460
proactive steps towards consumption and

712
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:07,339
there are not in

713
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,620
like the city of La with processing the

714
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:12,889
supply chain so I think if you look

715
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:15,319
outside of those you're gonna see some

716
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:17,750
interesting heavy hitters come in and

717
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:19,490
set up the events rhetoric here in

718
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:21,500
Southern California and I would

719
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:25,548
encourage you to go like I said before

720
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:28,400
to smaller cities or even Long Beach and

721
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:31,490
ask them to engage in that conversation

722
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:34,100
and provide as as Amanda said that

723
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:37,490
pathway if you take the guesswork out of

724
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:40,099
it and you provide a potential Avenue

725
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:43,460
and solution you can get to a point to

726
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:45,678
throw a well-conceived and please route

727
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:47,210
it in education and compliance at first

728
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,160
and then I think you're gonna start to

729
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:52,579
see those barriers come down and like a

730
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:54,740
snowball we'll have more of robust

731
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:55,849
defense culture and one thing to add

732
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:58,609
what Pam is saying it's not just

733
00:30:55,849 --> 00:31:00,829
bringing some you're gonna see a lot of

734
00:30:58,609 --> 00:31:03,619
I think or what I think is gonna be a

735
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:05,210
successful approach are people who have

736
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:07,849
an event and are looking for a location

737
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:10,220
and they're gonna go to cities that need

738
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:11,719
money and they're gonna tell them this

739
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,919
story and say look we have you have all

740
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:16,429
these hotels and you have an average

741
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:18,650
vacancy rate of what percentage here is

742
00:31:16,429 --> 00:31:21,230
the economic stimulus we can bring to

743
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:23,298
your city over the course of a two-day

744
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:24,380
period and they are gonna present what

745
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,460
does it look like on the number of

746
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:28,429
people that are eating in their

747
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:30,440
restaurants the hotel's etc and if you

748
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:32,330
find a city that is looking for revenue

749
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:34,400
they're going to hear this story

750
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:36,529
and they're gonna like it like I mean

751
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,160
let's look at San Francisco do you think

752
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:42,019
they enjoyed doing outside lands no but

753
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,700
they make a ton of money for the

754
00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:45,500
businesses and they stimulate the

755
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,660
economy in such a way during those

756
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,519
events like Dreamforce and oracle world

757
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:53,360
even though it puts a strap you know

758
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:56,750
it's it's painful but you talk money and

759
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:59,889
what it's going to do for job creation

760
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:03,079
and revenue and that it's gonna go away

761
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:05,540
after two days so this is a good way to

762
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:07,789
endeavor into potentially regulating

763
00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:09,019
more if the city's in no city that

764
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:11,058
doesn't mean it isn't one that you

765
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:13,579
should approach because this is a way to

766
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:15,428
show them how this might look and what

767
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:17,418
it can do in a controlled environment

768
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:20,389
that's a shorter

769
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:23,299
and strategic partnerships if there is

770
00:32:20,388 --> 00:32:25,368
some other event that is taking place if

771
00:32:23,298 --> 00:32:27,499
there are businesses like amanda says or

772
00:32:25,368 --> 00:32:30,259
hotels that are gonna come and support

773
00:32:27,499 --> 00:32:32,989
you and say this is a strategic alliance

774
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:35,538
we are coming together we are business

775
00:32:32,989 --> 00:32:35,929
owners in your city and we want to do

776
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:38,479
this

777
00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:40,459
that is what's gonna get you over the

778
00:32:38,479 --> 00:32:42,588
threshold or cross over that line is

779
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:45,139
these are other business owners that are

780
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:47,778
constantly giving ROI to the city and

781
00:32:45,138 --> 00:32:50,058
that they already trust and vet your

782
00:32:47,778 --> 00:32:52,009
strategic partners but these should be

783
00:32:50,058 --> 00:32:54,288
businesses that the city's already have

784
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:56,239
a trusted relationship with and they'll

785
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:59,328
help usher in and Stuart that

786
00:32:56,239 --> 00:33:03,278
conversation and give you an overarching

787
00:32:59,328 --> 00:33:07,398
sense of credibility Diane any thoughts

788
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:09,019
well the other thing that I wanted to

789
00:33:07,398 --> 00:33:13,538
add I guess to what's already been said

790
00:33:09,019 --> 00:33:15,828
is that in again in Colorado we have a

791
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:19,788
significant amount of tourism as well

792
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:21,979
and it's gone up they it's gone up

793
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:23,778
incrementally since legalization

794
00:33:21,979 --> 00:33:25,489
happened there and so when you're

795
00:33:23,778 --> 00:33:28,459
talking to these local municipalities

796
00:33:25,489 --> 00:33:30,558
let them know that tourism by itself

797
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:32,298
might increase between two and five

798
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:34,489
percent over the next few years but if

799
00:33:32,298 --> 00:33:36,858
you incorporate cannabis tourism into

800
00:33:34,489 --> 00:33:38,989
that it's more likely to go up to 15

801
00:33:36,858 --> 00:33:41,838
percent like what we've seen in Colorado

802
00:33:38,989 --> 00:33:43,909
so again tying it back to revenue and

803
00:33:41,838 --> 00:33:45,798
job creations and communities that's

804
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:49,570
always a good starting point so they can

805
00:33:45,798 --> 00:33:49,569
see the benefits that will come of it

806
00:33:49,598 --> 00:33:56,028
perfect transition to cannabis tourism

807
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:58,909
and so let's discuss what is cannabis

808
00:33:56,028 --> 00:34:02,358
tourism and maybe Dianne you can store

809
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:05,329
make who wants to field it I mean

810
00:34:02,358 --> 00:34:08,929
cannabis tourism can be a number of

811
00:34:05,328 --> 00:34:11,750
things it can be signing up for a bus

812
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:14,259
tour where you can consume on the bus

813
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:17,989
and visit different dispensaries and

814
00:34:14,259 --> 00:34:21,679
maybe you know there's a musical event

815
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:23,508
tied to the end of it you know but it

816
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,720
could be more specific - we mentioned

817
00:34:23,509 --> 00:34:29,240
the puff pass and paint events that

818
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,878
we're going on from my experience when

819
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:33,028
people are coming from a state

820
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:35,348
don't have any kind of legalization

821
00:34:33,028 --> 00:34:36,579
people want to see what it looks like in

822
00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:38,289
a dispensary but they're very

823
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:40,000
intimidated how do you pick the right

824
00:34:38,289 --> 00:34:43,539
one you know they want to have a good

825
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,929
experience and so they rely on other

826
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:48,429
people to put together a whole package

827
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:51,338
for them so they don't it takes the

828
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:52,778
worry out of their hands am i picking

829
00:34:51,338 --> 00:34:56,608
the right place am I going to have a

830
00:34:52,778 --> 00:34:59,380
good time and it's all done for them and

831
00:34:56,608 --> 00:35:01,358
you know and then you can tap into the

832
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,970
other tourist events that are already

833
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:08,588
happening and just make cannabis another

834
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:14,949
part of it and let's talk about kind of

835
00:35:08,588 --> 00:35:17,739
legal considerations for operators a lot

836
00:35:14,949 --> 00:35:20,500
of contracts and also disclaimers that

837
00:35:17,739 --> 00:35:23,739
go into this if you're gonna bring

838
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:25,630
cannabis in to another business make

839
00:35:23,739 --> 00:35:29,288
sure that that business isn't

840
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:31,240
jeopardized by the cannabis overlay I

841
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:35,069
think it goes back to what we talked

842
00:35:31,239 --> 00:35:37,419
about earlier ensuring that there's no

843
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:39,969
provisions that would prevent this type

844
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:41,849
of activity in Elise dealing with the

845
00:35:39,969 --> 00:35:44,199
ABC dealing with the liquor board

846
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:46,420
dealing with when you're bringing people

847
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:49,659
into an event with cannabis that they

848
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:53,710
are responsible consumers that you are

849
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:56,949
not advancing any opinions that the

850
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:58,869
dispensary may have making sure that

851
00:35:56,949 --> 00:36:01,358
they are lawful if you are bringing

852
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:05,619
Outsiders that don't know cannabis into

853
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:07,719
a tourism situation that you are vetting

854
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:10,390
the operators that you are working with

855
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:12,308
making sure that they have an active and

856
00:36:10,389 --> 00:36:15,038
approved license

857
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:17,440
because you're a conduit for bringing

858
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:21,278
people in I'd see these business

859
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,769
situations so the ABCs of good business

860
00:36:21,278 --> 00:36:26,018
transactions they apply in this instance

861
00:36:23,768 --> 00:36:28,929
especially if you are a can of ism

862
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:32,258
tourism conduit where you don't

863
00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:33,578
specifically touch the plant that's a

864
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:36,190
really good point there's a cannabis

865
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:38,650
tourism operator in Sonoma County who

866
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:40,298
was recently sued and a temporary

867
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:42,700
restraining order was imposed on that

868
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:44,530
cannabis tourism operator because the

869
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:47,710
tourism operator

870
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:51,760
some tourists to an unlicensed

871
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:53,380
cultivation site that got sued and they

872
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,750
looked at the Instagram photos of the

873
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:58,059
tourism operator at the unlicensed

874
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:00,099
cultivation site and they got roped into

875
00:36:58,059 --> 00:37:09,519
this litigation so I think what you're

876
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:11,170
saying makes perfect sense now maybe a

877
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,909
man that you already talked about this

878
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:15,190
earlier about cannabis events being

879
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:20,078
magnets for a cannabis tourism and the

880
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:22,480
economic synergies that can result you

881
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,810
know can you elaborate on that or yeah

882
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,880
absolutely I mean we're we're looking at

883
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:29,769
this you know how do you get government

884
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,119
comfortable right that's key to this and

885
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:33,250
there's a lot of places that are wait

886
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,588
and see but there's very few things that

887
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:38,320
you can try on right you can't say I'm

888
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:40,750
gonna maybe experiment with allowing

889
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,010
cultivation and take it away because

890
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:43,989
you're gonna end up in a Calaveras

891
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:47,079
County situation and nobody wants

892
00:37:43,989 --> 00:37:49,179
Calaveras to happen to them so if a city

893
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:52,839
whether do something like this as a way

894
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:55,210
to test out what this might look like

895
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:57,429
feel like what the people are that are

896
00:37:55,210 --> 00:38:00,639
gonna show up you know that's really a

897
00:37:57,429 --> 00:38:03,219
good way for them to test this out and

898
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:08,170
it's it's so easy for them to feel the

899
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:10,358
economic impact I mean it's quantifiable

900
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,220
they can see it it's easy stuff we're

901
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:14,318
talking about sales tax revenue

902
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:16,750
generated during that event in the city

903
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:19,568
across all businesses this is data they

904
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:21,099
can quantify and then you can also when

905
00:38:19,568 --> 00:38:23,170
you're going to a city you can bring

906
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:25,568
that quantifiable data from other cities

907
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:27,490
to show them what that had no you also

908
00:38:25,568 --> 00:38:29,588
have to look at a place that makes sense

909
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:31,449
like don't go throw this in a city with

910
00:38:29,588 --> 00:38:33,460
no hotels unless you're looking to do a

911
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:36,519
camping event that has camping grounds

912
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:38,619
um you know you want to do it in a place

913
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:40,179
that has this need so you don't wanna

914
00:38:38,619 --> 00:38:41,410
also do it in a place that's super

915
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:43,868
wealthy because they don't necessarily

916
00:38:41,409 --> 00:38:45,909
need that revenue and want it you have

917
00:38:43,869 --> 00:38:47,740
to be mindful of the who but they can

918
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:50,199
see in the very short period what this

919
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:52,209
can do and and then you tell them okay

920
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:53,949
now imagine you can even put one percent

921
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:56,019
sales tax on top of it specific to

922
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:56,469
cannabis you could start talking to them

923
00:38:56,019 --> 00:38:59,170
about

924
00:38:56,469 --> 00:39:01,029
reasonable tax rates because they're

925
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,858
gonna see it first without taxation

926
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:04,540
they're just gonna see what general

927
00:39:02,858 --> 00:39:06,639
sales tax is generated they're based on

928
00:39:04,539 --> 00:39:08,559
regular pricing regular hotel pricing

929
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,779
all of this and it's also a conduit to

930
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:13,869
talk to them about a more responsible

931
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:15,609
tax rate from the start because a lot of

932
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:17,530
these cities got told these stories from

933
00:39:15,608 --> 00:39:20,710
some consulting firms not to be named

934
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:25,119
who gave them very lofty ideas of what

935
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:27,909
they could generate in taxes with a 5 6

936
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,579
7 % rate well when you combine that on

937
00:39:27,909 --> 00:39:32,500
top of regular sales tax on top of state

938
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:34,929
taxes it's becoming prohibitively

939
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:36,608
expensive but by using something like

940
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:38,769
this event as a conduit to just show

941
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:41,440
what the economic stimulus can be on an

942
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:43,960
economy now we talked about a way now

943
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,700
with an actual license and a business

944
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,309
that's got their foot there we're

945
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:50,529
talking about new jobs we're talking

946
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:51,789
about ongoing revenues we're talking

947
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,920
about people that are gonna live there

948
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:56,050
and shop at the grocery stores not just

949
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,150
eat at your restaurants for two days and

950
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:59,410
so on and so forth so you can really use

951
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:02,079
this as a conduit to make them

952
00:39:59,409 --> 00:40:04,899
understand the overall economic stimulus

953
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:06,219
on a city and then lean into that the

954
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,530
next conversation that they're gonna say

955
00:40:06,219 --> 00:40:09,939
but let's add some taxes too and that

956
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:13,900
will help you start a more reasonable

957
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:16,630
taxation conversation thank you now

958
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:18,940
let's discuss quickly how operators can

959
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:20,710
ensure that local governments have a

960
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:22,929
positive experience so that they will

961
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:24,309
incentivize these events and we'll just

962
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:28,000
start with ayan and work our way back

963
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:30,250
here well I would definitely invite them

964
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:35,800
to the event that you're planning right

965
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:38,980
I mean we know just in advocating that

966
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:41,349
when you can make it personal either by

967
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:43,809
telling your own story or the story of

968
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:47,230
someone that you know people will buy

969
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:49,750
into it much better so invite them into

970
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:52,889
your dispensaries invite them to tour

971
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:55,838
your facilities let them know how

972
00:40:52,889 --> 00:40:58,000
responsible you are that you've got the

973
00:40:55,838 --> 00:41:00,820
standard operating procedures you've got

974
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,119
tight security you're following all

975
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:06,160
these inventory control massive measures

976
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,670
but really making them comfortable with

977
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:12,949
who you are and how you're running your

978
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:17,849
is the way to open the door have a plan

979
00:41:12,949 --> 00:41:19,798
have a business plan it sounds basic but

980
00:41:17,849 --> 00:41:22,200
if you're gonna go in and have a

981
00:41:19,798 --> 00:41:24,329
conversation know the theme of your

982
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:27,509
event know who's going to attend your

983
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:30,150
event as Amanda said know what numbers

984
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:32,250
you may be able to generate are you

985
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:34,588
gonna put people in restaurants are you

986
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:37,260
gonna put people in hotels are you gonna

987
00:41:34,588 --> 00:41:40,108
have strategic partnerships and use this

988
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:42,569
as an opportunity to change the

989
00:41:40,108 --> 00:41:45,029
perception we are all cannabis

990
00:41:42,568 --> 00:41:48,029
ambassadors we are all cannabis stewards

991
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:51,990
and if you set the bar for your event

992
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:55,490
and say that you will not tolerate your

993
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:59,399
responsible consumption that you will be

994
00:41:55,489 --> 00:42:03,058
evicted from the event immediately upon

995
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:05,970
those plans have a plan for security at

996
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:08,519
every point that is a concern or that

997
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:10,980
would be a concern for the city go in

998
00:42:08,519 --> 00:42:13,349
armed with an answer this is how we're

999
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:16,289
gonna deal with odor the first event may

1000
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:18,660
be we don't allow flowers smoking right

1001
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:21,269
maybe we limit it does the city that you

1002
00:42:18,659 --> 00:42:25,469
want to have an event in have an anti

1003
00:42:21,269 --> 00:42:27,989
smoking no smoking ban right no the who

1004
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:30,719
know what questions you are likely to be

1005
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:33,298
asked and have the answers because the

1006
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,608
worst thing is to say I have a solution

1007
00:42:33,298 --> 00:42:38,730
I have an event I want to do in your

1008
00:42:35,608 --> 00:42:40,920
city and then the first thing that the

1009
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:43,199
city manager or somebody you encounter

1010
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,579
asses well what's your plan for security

1011
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:50,098
and what's your plan for odor and

1012
00:42:46,579 --> 00:42:52,650
there's crickets that's not gonna get

1013
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:55,829
far so if we're talking about how you

1014
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:58,889
have a culture of responsibility how you

1015
00:42:55,829 --> 00:43:00,839
change the cannabis stigma these are the

1016
00:42:58,889 --> 00:43:02,519
things that are gonna change it more

1017
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:05,190
than the dispensaries it's how you

1018
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:07,318
interact with the product that's gonna

1019
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:09,869
change the conversation and change the

1020
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:13,019
perception and we've got such an amazing

1021
00:43:09,869 --> 00:43:15,599
gift with 2020 the one thing that

1022
00:43:13,019 --> 00:43:18,210
plagues the cannabis industry is one bad

1023
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:21,990
actor ruins it for everybody

1024
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:23,280
and you say I say it a lot you can't you

1025
00:43:21,989 --> 00:43:25,949
can't have nice things

1026
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:29,070
if you don't respect them this is a real

1027
00:43:25,949 --> 00:43:32,009
nice gift the best thing that we can do

1028
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:34,740
is respect it and demand that respect of

1029
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:36,810
your attendees so from a more practical

1030
00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:39,569
point of view to like yes don't be a

1031
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:41,190
jerk like that that's I know we have to

1032
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:44,750
say it a few times it's shocking but

1033
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:47,940
let's talk about the community okay by

1034
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:49,889
local I don't care that the cost go down

1035
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,750
the streets gonna save you $2 a pound on

1036
00:43:49,889 --> 00:43:54,389
your steak that you're gonna be serving

1037
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:56,969
buy it at the local grocery store I

1038
00:43:54,389 --> 00:43:59,309
don't care that the chairs cost 50 cents

1039
00:43:56,969 --> 00:44:01,259
more from the local supply company buy

1040
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:04,139
from the local chair company your

1041
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,910
rentals put as much of the spending that

1042
00:44:04,139 --> 00:44:09,960
can be done for preparing this event

1043
00:44:05,909 --> 00:44:12,269
into the local economy moreover if you

1044
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,760
are making I Boone make a charitable

1045
00:44:12,269 --> 00:44:16,920
donation to the organization's to the

1046
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,630
Little League like not only are we going

1047
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,159
to not let kids into this event we're

1048
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:23,099
gonna make sure that this adult event

1049
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:25,799
benefited kids too by by helping repair

1050
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:28,769
the baseball field figure out what the

1051
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,500
community cares about there and do your

1052
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:35,610
job and giving back it will pay

1053
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:39,269
dividends who in the local jurisdiction

1054
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:43,050
approves cannabis events Amanda it

1055
00:44:39,269 --> 00:44:44,909
depends the city can set that they can

1056
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:47,400
delegate that how they choose so in

1057
00:44:44,909 --> 00:44:51,869
Sacramento city manager a lot of places

1058
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:54,990
it's going to be council second question

1059
00:44:51,869 --> 00:44:57,750
what kind of license or permit does one

1060
00:44:54,989 --> 00:45:00,379
need to organize cannabis tours as an

1061
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,380
operator

1062
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:09,130
well the tour itself isn't gonna be a

1063
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:12,400
licensed activity an event has to take

1064
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:14,230
place at a location so the person that's

1065
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:19,650
operating our tour bus is gonna need a

1066
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:19,650
tour bus license not a cannabis license

1067
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:27,660
can you have a delivery service deliver

1068
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,659
to an unlicensed cannabis event

1069
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:34,270
cannabis events is the problem in that

1070
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:38,949
question yeah the answer was already

1071
00:45:34,269 --> 00:45:43,599
there so that's a no that was a trick

1072
00:45:38,949 --> 00:45:45,639
question very well draft can you speak

1073
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,789
on what you know about preparing your

1074
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:51,429
own products to sell in an on-site

1075
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:54,099
consumption setting how does this align

1076
00:45:51,429 --> 00:45:57,129
with state testing requirements that's a

1077
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:59,860
complicated question and I think the

1078
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:03,610
quick answer is you know on-site

1079
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:06,130
consumption needs some sort of local

1080
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:08,680
approval for it to be legal the state

1081
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:10,380
doesn't really rect regulate on-site

1082
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:12,699
consumption that's why we have some

1083
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:15,280
consumption lounges at the local level

1084
00:46:12,699 --> 00:46:17,289
and if they get a local permit

1085
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,960
there's no corresponding state license

1086
00:46:17,289 --> 00:46:22,989
for consumption lounge yes

1087
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:26,079
is there a workaround for a be 20/20 not

1088
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:29,079
allowing alcohol sales and consumption

1089
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:31,529
on the premises of a temporary cannabis

1090
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:31,529
event

1091
00:46:32,909 --> 00:46:38,559
it depends right when you're when you're

1092
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,329
working with the locality if the

1093
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:43,960
locality is gonna say we don't want

1094
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:45,849
alcohol where there is cannabis they can

1095
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,050
put that condition if they're gonna

1096
00:46:45,849 --> 00:46:49,000
issue an event

1097
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:52,570
I mean first and foremost you're gonna

1098
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:56,230
want to separate those two uses out and

1099
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:58,240
not combine them by we're gonna see this

1100
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:00,610
as an evolution and I personally would

1101
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:03,809
like to ask the ABC what their

1102
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:06,700
perspective on this is they've been

1103
00:47:03,809 --> 00:47:08,889
noticeably silent we've seen OSHA step

1104
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:11,379
out in front of this we haven't seen the

1105
00:47:08,889 --> 00:47:14,480
ABC so what are they going to look at

1106
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:16,519
with regard to their liquor license

1107
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:18,769
and their liquor license 'yes i know

1108
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:21,289
specifically with hotels they are

1109
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:22,969
concerned about this issue and they're

1110
00:47:21,289 --> 00:47:24,619
gonna have to go to their insurance so i

1111
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:26,959
like to take it all the way back when we

1112
00:47:24,619 --> 00:47:28,880
talked about contracts to know what your

1113
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,500
insurance limits are right if you're

1114
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,470
entering into a contract and you're

1115
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:35,900
indemnifying the location that you're

1116
00:47:33,469 --> 00:47:37,969
gonna have this event so that you can

1117
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,769
get them on board know what their

1118
00:47:37,969 --> 00:47:41,779
insurance limitations are and what your

1119
00:47:39,769 --> 00:47:43,460
insurance limitations are because if

1120
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:46,730
there's alcohol sales there and that

1121
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:49,490
invalidates either your insurance or the

1122
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:51,559
locations insurance somebody consumes

1123
00:47:49,489 --> 00:47:53,179
both alcohol and cannabis and then

1124
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:55,460
that's the story that splashed across

1125
00:47:53,179 --> 00:47:57,379
every headline in California and beyond

1126
00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:01,220
this is why you don't get nice things

1127
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:04,130
right so I think we all come it's funny

1128
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:08,480
but we come back to that and until you

1129
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:10,880
have trust between operators localities

1130
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:15,608
and the state you may not be able to

1131
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:17,869
combine two psychoactive ly enhancing

1132
00:48:15,608 --> 00:48:20,420
activities right you may not be able to

1133
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:24,230
have alcohol where you have cannabis at

1134
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:26,030
the beginning so I died you got to be

1135
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:30,740
responsible respectful and earn some

1136
00:48:26,030 --> 00:48:34,430
trust where cannabis industry we get a

1137
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:37,759
lot of flack from alcohol beer beverage

1138
00:48:34,429 --> 00:48:40,219
tobacco companies so if we can focus in

1139
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,500
earn that trust and start to see what

1140
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:44,539
that looks like you're gonna have a more

1141
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:47,358
meaningful conversation it may be hard

1142
00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:49,730
to do both and the work around I've seen

1143
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:51,980
for some cannabis advances outside the

1144
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:55,579
premises of the cannabis event there is

1145
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:56,809
a separate I call it the a camp from the

1146
00:48:55,579 --> 00:48:58,970
Rainbow Gathering days it's the

1147
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:00,859
alcoholics camp on the outskirts of the

1148
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:03,078
Rainbow Gathering and that's where the

1149
00:49:00,858 --> 00:49:05,239
cannabis beard I'm sorry that's where

1150
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:09,730
the alcoholic beverages gets held get

1151
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:09,729
served Jackie

1152
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:17,290
they were not selling cannabis

1153
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:35,659
absolutely so what they did was they had

1154
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:37,940
separate buses that were outside of the

1155
00:49:35,659 --> 00:49:39,679
premises and so people were not the

1156
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:41,230
alcohol was being served inside the

1157
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:45,710
premises it was a regular alcohol

1158
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:48,139
serving facility but then people could

1159
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:50,240
leave their alcohol inside leave the

1160
00:49:48,139 --> 00:49:53,529
licensed premises and go get on a bus

1161
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:56,299
and that bus was private property

1162
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:58,420
non-public dark windows so you can't see

1163
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:04,190
out and they were able to consume their

1164
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:07,820
legally side-by-side but without the to

1165
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:11,929
mixing alcohol is an inside you know and

1166
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:14,320
that is cool I mean maybe if it was on

1167
00:50:11,929 --> 00:50:17,269
blocks and the reason for that is that

1168
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:27,170
California law prohibits smoking inside

1169
00:50:17,269 --> 00:50:29,059
vehicles and a bus is a vehicle it's on

1170
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,860
blocks and it's not mobile it's no

1171
00:50:29,059 --> 00:50:34,519
longer motor via trap and Anchor

1172
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:36,590
yeah private property would be a place

1173
00:50:34,519 --> 00:50:40,570
where you are concealed from the public

1174
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:43,730
and we're not visible and that is not a

1175
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:47,150
government land like a park or a school

1176
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:49,360
or the street this was a private parking

1177
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:52,670
lot inside of a vehicle that was not

1178
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:54,019
detectable from outside of it those were

1179
00:50:52,670 --> 00:50:56,720
all the arguments that would be making

1180
00:50:54,019 --> 00:50:59,380
in court right the point is is you may

1181
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:59,379
get to court

1182
00:51:05,568 --> 00:51:10,048
you can give your friends cannabis like

1183
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:15,150
you can have it you can have a dinner

1184
00:51:10,048 --> 00:51:16,818
party at your home just don't sell

1185
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:21,000
cannabis at that

1186
00:51:16,818 --> 00:51:22,380
that's called a dinner party giving away

1187
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,690
less than an ounce is legal for adults

1188
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:26,490
21 and over when you're selling to

1189
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:28,980
adults 21 and over it's a misdemeanor

1190
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:31,798
selling to under 18 could be a felony

1191
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:34,798
but remember if you're inviting a brand

1192
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:37,108
to sponsor and they bring cannabis to

1193
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:39,480
give away that's a different scenario

1194
00:51:37,108 --> 00:51:42,358
how did that brand get the cannabis to

1195
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,250
your dinner party question back there

1196
00:51:42,358 --> 00:51:45,449

1197
