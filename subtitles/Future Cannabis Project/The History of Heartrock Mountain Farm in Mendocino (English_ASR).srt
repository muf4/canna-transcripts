00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
again was

93
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,519
a grass

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,400
really a grassroots organization

95
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,200
aimed at legalizing

96
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,039
non-conforming

97
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,319
building methods

98
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,439
the the law said you had to have uh

99
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,159
outlets

100
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,519
specified how many outlets how far off

101
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,400
the floor

102
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,720
and

103
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,719
it doesn't matter or it didn't matter

104
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,360
if you were gonna have kerosene lights

105
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,600
and no electricity in your house

106
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,600
you still had to wire it

107
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,560
like you were going to have electricity

108
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,840
and for people who are low-income people

109
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,839
trying to uh

110
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,400
trying to build shelter and raise a

111
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:53,279
family that was an unnecessary expense

112
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,959
and so we fought it and uh actually the

113
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,879
yeah the backs of the landers got people

114
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,560
elected to like the board of supervisors

115
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,159
in mendocino county to pass like the

116
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,120
class gay

117
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,560
uh

118
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,120
yeah

119
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,600
non-bearish and well yeah she was one of

120
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,639
the spearheads in that she was the

121
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,879
founder of united stand again her united

122
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,720
stand and the united stand again

123
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,279
she was on

124
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,280
a board or commission in sacramento

125
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,160
basically the reason the county got

126
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,720
involved was they

127
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,600
needed to prove to the state that there

128
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,639
were

129
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,160
uh

130
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,160
5 000 low-income houses in the hills if

131
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,960
they could prove that there was already

132
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,720
low-income housing then the developers

133
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,959
wouldn't have to provide as much

134
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,280
low-income housing to go with their

135
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,719
upper income housing developments all

136
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,959
right well let's get back to the yeah

139
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,639
yeah to let's let's take it so you uh

140
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,800
you uh came up to minnesota county to

141
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,199

oh it's uneventful it was uh

144
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,918
realtors knew what we were up to

145
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,079
uh

146
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,318
i remember one i

147
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:17,198
i think it was in booneville and he

148
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,240
pointed to a soils map that he had on

149
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,639
the wall

150
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,720
and he pointed out uh

151
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,240
this land is good for grass and this

152
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,240
land isn't

153
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,240
yeah because this this was before um

154
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,000

you know not as illegal to or it was

158
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,000
still easy but it wasn't enforced the

159
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,240
yeah the problem hadn't gotten out of

160
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,318

161
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,079

for the growth season for sure

174
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,400
and at this point in time you were still

175
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,240
oh yeah um yeah

176
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,560
walk us through your first crop and and

177
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,879
then the next generations and and how

178
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,000
you climatize the the sativas to the

179
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,719
area

180
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,399
okay well the bulk of the seeds we got

181
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,440
came from mexico

182
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,000
of

183
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:38,319
what was called consamia they were

184
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,959
attempting sensomia but they had some

185
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,598
they had a few problems and so

186
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:47,279
my friend that was selling

187
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:49,439
uh this consumia out of a bag

188
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,559
it's the end of brickweed

189
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,719
uh

190
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,680
let me take a few handfuls of shake out

191
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,599
of the bottom and and i got hundreds or

192
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,360
thousands of seeds i don't know there

193
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:01,199
were a lot of seeds

194
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,560
and that was the

195
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,639
bulk of what i

196
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,639
grew it was the mexican and

197
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:14,639
my mentors had said to water the drip

198
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:17,680
line compost on the drip line and water

199
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,400
the drip line and you'll grow good

200
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,478
plants and they said

201
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,638
take your first male and pollinate the

202
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:27,680
primary pistols on your

203
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,759
females as they come out to

204
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,680
signal to the plant that there are

205
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,759
plenty of males around and they can go

206
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,599
ahead and be females

207
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,799
and that's what we did and then we took

208
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,360
those seeds which was

209
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,759
had the genetics for early

210
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,320
and we planted those and that ran

211
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,600
contrary to the wisdom

212
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,959
of the dave

213
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,759
which uh said that

214
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,919
breed for the traits that you want

215
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,360
because early is easy

216
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:59,360
but if you never get

217
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,919
a cultivar that makes it through then

218
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,959
you don't know what you're getting so

219
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:11,360
i i don't believe that now looking back

220
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:15,439
i think that it was wise to get the

221
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,759
early and then pick among all those

222
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,959
the traits that we wanted

223
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,838
and

224
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,439
we did that

225
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,839
until the early 80s

226
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,839
when

227
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:33,838
we were gifted colorado number two skunk

228
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,080
one and skunk two and a gem called a11

229
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,200
which was a sativa

230
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,560
hybrid

231
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,680
and

232
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:42,159
the same

233
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:45,599
buyer that took that first half pound

234
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:49,278
from me took samples of the colorado

235
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:53,120
number two and the a11 that we grew

236
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:55,759
took those back to uh the midwest

237
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,360
came back and told us if

238
00:09:55,759 --> 00:10:01,360
this is killer colorado then the a11 is

239
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,159
killer elite

240
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,159
and i i agree you know it was three to

241
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:10,639
five pound plants

242
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:12,399
skinny leaves small flowers and sweet

243
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:17,199
yeah yeah

244
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:20,000
and the uh the killer colorado was um

245
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,440
was second generation from afghanistan

246
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,078
it was

247
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,959
i don't know if it was afghanistan it

248
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:30,078
was from the hindu kush region yeah and

249
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:32,000
they grew the first stateside crop in

250
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:35,439
colorado

251
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,799
and then we got seeds from the second

252
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,800
hence

253
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,799
and that was the the the neighbor who

254
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,399
was doing the freelance

255
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,958
uh high times photography that brought

256
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,440
him back from colorado is that that's

257
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,439
yeah that's the one we won't we he's so

258
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,000
paranoid we won't mention his name no

259
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,000
please don't

260
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,920
yeah and so that then that's the early

261
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:01,679
80s and then i come into the scene also

262
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,958
early 80s 1984 where i'm born at home

263
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,799
uh up on the mountain

264
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,879
guys i think did you come across the

265
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,838
pictures yet with like uh mom trimming

266
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:15,759
with one of the kids on on her lap

267
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,120
no you know and that's pre-digital so

268
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,319
uh

269
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,720
you know i remember seeing that

270
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,640
photograph but yeah yeah it

271
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,720
must have been taken by someone else

272
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,480
because i was just a poor dirt farmer i

273
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,759
couldn't afford film

274
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,800
and very few uh photographs of the day

275
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,319
because

276
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,319
it was an expensive hobby

277
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,359
and then yeah walk us walk us through

278
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,479
the

279
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,839
the

280
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,879
i guess then when did camp start

281
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,320
that was

282
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:47,759
82 83 something like that so that's when

283
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,160
when the uh

284
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:52,240
the price of cannabis went up like four

285
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:55,199
or five six times

286
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,959
when the when they started eradicating

287
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,160
yeah i don't know price is always a

288
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,319
a

289
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,159
a fluid thing and

290
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,839
you know there was always somebody that

291
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,000
was gonna get four or five thousand

292
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,720
dollars for a pound and then there were

293
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,639
people who were getting a thousand for

294
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,560
something just as good

295
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,839
it's just who you know

296
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,479
you know yeah

297
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,399
when did you see your first clone

298
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,920
was that not tell it was that tell agent

299
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,078
my older brother

300
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,078
you know probably then because i just

301
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,559
didn't care i saw some

302
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,719
seed starts and coke cans and things

303
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,919
like that that people were doing indoors

304
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,320
under lights but it had this

305
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,799
odd taste to it that just you know

306
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,440
didn't appeal to me

307
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:43,039
yeah because when even when i first came

308
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,200
into the garden which was the early

309
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,120
2000s we were growing all from seeds and

310
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,720
there was like you know my older brother

311
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,759
had a handful of clones you know there

312
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,920
was like a maui wowie clone there was a

313
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:57,679
you know i think

314
00:12:53,919 --> 00:13:01,199
uh jack carrere a bubba kush

315
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,879
and then the blueberry northern lights

316
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,160
and you know so we didn't grow we have

317
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:07,679
never grown

318
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:10,000
a lot of clones but it was definitely

319
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:12,319
became um a breeding tool at least for

320
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,919
my my older brother and you know my dad

321
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,000
kind of did his own breeding projects

322
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,278
and agent did his own breeding projects

323
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,559
and

324
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:22,480
yeah then when i came into the garden um

325
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,838
i i started you know it was like just

326
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,600
the thing to do was like monkey sea

327
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,920
monkey do like okay this is how we say

328
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,959
pollen this is how we make seeds you

329
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,120
know

330
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,119
and

331
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:37,039
and it's still kind of that way where we

332
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,278
grow mostly from seeds and but you know

333
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,759
we'll bring in a few clones for breeding

334
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:44,159
purposes

335
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,319
i remember like

336
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,198
maybe 2008

337
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,680
and

338
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,039
one of my friends was like oh i can't

339
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,359
sell my seed stock anymore i'm just

340
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:57,439
going to grow clowns and i remember like

341
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,440
that what a mistake that sounded like

342
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,278
um

343
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,559
so yeah so then from the in the early

344
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:04,820
80s

345
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:06,239
to

346
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,000
[Music]

347
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,639
i guess the late 90s was when agents

348
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,639
started helping

349
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:13,599
you know

350
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:21,040
i don't know yes if you say so

351
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:26,719
uh he was you know he did start helping

352
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:28,639
before you did and you took over in 2012

353
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,519
so yeah

354
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,159
yeah

355
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,198
my dad wanted me to go to school to be

356
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,198
more than just an outlaw

357
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,919
i wanted you to get a

358
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,720
degree in business or jurisprudence and

359
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:45,039
then come back and work for the company

360
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,839
and then this is working out and then

361
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,679
agent he he he collected seeds from the

362
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,360
neighbors and shared seeds with the you

363
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,919
know like the ex

364
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,639
with um a woman on greenfield ranch

365
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,399
where mendocino generations was started

366
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,720
and then something happened and then the

367
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,958
seeds came back they came back a little

368
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,120
bit better and then

369
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,359
uh you know that's what we call the jade

370
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,399
which which was her name

371
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,839
and then we

372
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,399
you know most of our genetics have

373
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:17,519
that in the um

374
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,159
in the lineage and now as i'm starting

375
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,440
to get more into like uh line breathing

376
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,000
and breathing them in some sex of

377
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,760
generation i'm starting to see like

378
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,759
oh my gosh this smells just like what my

379
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,879
dad and brother were growing

380
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,679
uh

381
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,679
20 years ago

382
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,079
um

383
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,518
and then there's stuff that doesn't

384
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:39,278
smell like like the blue thunder which

385
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,519
was the the blueberry northern lights

386
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:45,198
with the jade that has you know

387
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,198
that's one of our favorites still

388
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,399
um yes

389
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:53,278
the blue thunder i don't know if it's uh

390
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,879
because i know it's roots that it makes

391
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,720
it special

392
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,000
i think every time i smoke it i think

393
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,399
it's special

394
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
but it might not be next year

395
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,559
you know something else is going to

396
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,759
replace it and

397
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,679
just like

398
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,159
this blue thunder that i'm smoking this

399
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,758
year replaces

400
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:14,319
i can't even remember what was my

401
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,800
favorite last year or the year before

402
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,199
because i have this year's favorite

403
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,879
that's what i've always done is you know

404
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:24,319
the

405
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:26,639
i didn't worry too much about what i was

406
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,959
doing i was just crossing different

407
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,720
things and looking for

408
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:34,159
something good in in the cross and

409
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,320
i didn't really

410
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,399
know any more about breeding than i knew

411
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,759
about growing when i started well and

412
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,839
that's a great way to do breeding grow

413
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,079
what you can smoke

414
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,600
and make seeds a branch of seeds on each

415
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,198
one and then keep the seeds from your

416
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,680
you know your that's just how a lot of

417
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,919
breeding's been done for a long time you

418
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,359
can't go wrong there with

419
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,958
with that

420
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,360
oh yeah and what year was it that the

421
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,198
sheriff came on the radio and and said

422
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,839
we won't bust anybody who's grown less

423
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:07,119
than 50 plants i don't know it was the

424
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:10,160
early 80s early 80s yeah i know i went

425
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,958
out and counted and i had 55 plants so i

426
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,360
uh pulled six of them

427
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,240
which is different than what's tradition

428
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,639
were those six of the early finisher the

429
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,318
august finisher sorry i didn't have

430
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,600
that that was a different time

431
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:25,599
that was uh

432
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,440
those hadn't uh

433
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,520
popped out because that wasn't something

434
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,840
i i

435
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:35,918
those two foot tall plants

436
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:38,720
weren't something i was breeding for i

437
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:41,120
was i was more looking at the 15 to 20

438
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,759
foot plants yeah

439
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:43,759
and uh

440
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:49,440
and then uh what medical passed in

441
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,720
california in 96

442
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,400
and that's when that's when a lot of

443
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,000
people came out of the shade and into

444
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,679
the full sun

445
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,160
but minnesota county like you know that

446
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,600
story was from the you know the 80s when

447
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,720
the sheriff came on the radio and said

448
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:02,879
we're not

449
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,960
busting anybody with less than 50 plants

450
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,799
you know so they're mendocino county has

451
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:11,038
always been

452
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:14,480
a safer place to to grow cannabis

453
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:17,679
and until now

454
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,319
we have a different uh yeah

455
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,880
power structure you know the

456
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:25,759
shenanigans with electing a sheriff and

457
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,960
having him resign and appointing

458
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:30,720
his choice to replace him you know it

459
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,240
just smacks of

460
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,160
cronyism

461
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,720
and

462
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,440
interests that are far beyond the the

463
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,440
pot patch

464
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,960
yeah and

465
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,519
you know so it

466
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,279
it's definitely been

467
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,440
nice to have the you know i remember

468
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,079
when i first came into the garden i

469
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,320
graduated from high school

470
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,079
um and

471
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,319
my older brother told me to go get my

472
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:00,000
medical card and then ask

473
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,798
you know dad

474
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,720
if i could help grow and so i had

475
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:06,240
migraines of course and went and got my

476
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,679
medical card and

477
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,038
i was like dad i got my medical can i

478
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:13,280
help you an agent out because i gotta

479
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:14,879
talk to your brother and i knew i was in

480
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,639
yeah and it was yeah we were you know

481
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,360
back then you could have you know yeah

482
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,640
your medical plans we had you know

483
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,359
my brother and i had our own little

484
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,200
plots and

485
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,639
you know we

486
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,000
it was

487
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,240
i think that was the first time my dad

488
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,079
and i actually smoked when together and

489
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,880
i was

490
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:36,159
i remember he packed it was g13 which

491
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,320
adrian had source which was like the

492
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,240
strongest pot back then and my dad packs

493
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:43,119
up a bull pass and he says be careful

494
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,120
it's g13

495
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,440
yeah it's a

496
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:52,319
little bit more potent than yeah three

497
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,519
and a half percent mexican stuff they

498
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:58,798
got me up to maybe four or five percent

499
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,079
thc with the uh

500
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:03,119
uh

501
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,879
the hindu kush genetics

502
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,839
and and then i guess we'll just we fast

503
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,440
forward to 2016 when california passed

504
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:12,079
um

505
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,679
recreational cannabis and

506
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,798
i saw

507
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,960
um

508
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,240
what you could do with a nursery license

509
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,679
and

510
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,038
i called my dad up i'm like dad we

511
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,640
should go legal

512
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:23,759
uh we should get a nursery license

513
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,080
because they're going to let us flower

514
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:28,000
out 5 000 square foot of canopy for seed

515
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,000
production

516
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,798
and it's been a silver lining and what's

517
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,558
been a total uh shit show of roll out of

518
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,319
you know you'd think california would

519
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:39,839
learn from the mistakes of the other

520
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,399
states but

521
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,798
you know i i see this more

522
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,880
as an exit strategy on the war on drugs

523
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,798
and actual legalization you know that's

524
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,039
what you're seeing like the

525
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:55,200
corporate taker over of another industry

526
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,480
but that hasn't taken the joy out of

527
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,679
making seeds

528
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:02,319
and the passion of of that and and of

529
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,440
growing the plant you know like we're

530
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:05,038
not going to

531
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,640
be like the vineyard

532
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,079
and the great people when the pears

533
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,600
aren't making money to rip them out but

534
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:12,639
the vineyards when chardonnay is not

535
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:14,480
producing the roof amount put pinot but

536
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,640
we might be growing a lot more food but

537
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:20,159
we're going to keep making seeds and

538
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,159
keep growing craft cannabis

539
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,798
sorry i'm no no i'm uh

540
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,839
that's good i think i'm speechless here

541
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,000
yeah

542
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,199
i think i think that was a good sesh

543
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,200
yeah

544
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,919
i've got i got a question

545
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,880
so

546
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:39,120
so this jade i wanna i wanna hear more

547
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,520
of like the background of

548
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,719
you you had the mexican

549
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,079
and then

550
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,798
where did it where did it go from there

551
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:50,960
well

552
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:55,279
adrian went to each of the neighbors so

553
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,600
right right now we're the only farm left

554
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,879
i believe so yeah we're the only legal

555
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,038
farm left

556
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,760
the illegal farms are dropping out but

557
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:04,960
at one time every parcel on that

558
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:09,119
mountain

559
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:11,679
had an illegal patch growing and adrian

560
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:15,839
knew a lot of them and he gathered

561
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,200
their genetics so that mexican

562
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,119
i grew it

563
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,600
my partner grew it

564
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:24,158
the neighbors grew it everybody got some

565
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:26,399
of that plus everybody you know i had

566
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,440
some thai and colombia and some of the

567
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,600
exotic stuff a few seeds that

568
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,200
that those were long-term projects in

569
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,918
the day because

570
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,400
they weren't acclimated the colombian

571
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,360
stuff was expecting an 11-month growing

572
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,798
season and we didn't have that

573
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,759
so

574
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:48,558
everybody worked with their own

575
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:51,359
programs and adrian went around and

576
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:54,079
collected seeds from everybody he worked

577
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:57,839
with it he took seeds over to greenfield

578
00:22:54,079 --> 00:23:00,480
and traded seeds with jade

579
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:02,798
and so he brought some of her seeds home

580
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,880
he left her seeds then

581
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:07,519
he brought some of

582
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,840
the work that she did with our genetics

583
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:12,158
and her genetics and he got a sample of

584
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:12,879
that and he brought that back

585
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,320
and

586
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:19,760
so we just kept hybrid vigorizing

587
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:22,639
our line and adding new genetics and

588
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,640
that vigorizes it again and

589
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,600
we're yeah we're we're still doing that

590
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,480
and

591
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,798
you know

592
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,798
when dan got his own plot in the garden

593
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:35,440
it wasn't just helping me

594
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:38,079
adrian had his own little plot or he had

595
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,960
a row i think that five or six jack

596
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,480
herreras yeah yeah and

597
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,120
dan got the plot in front of the

598
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,319
greenhouse and he dug it out double dug

599
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:48,639
it

600
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:52,000
dug all the dirt out and he filled it up

601
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,679
with good shit put the dirt back

602
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,038
and one day

603
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,360
we uh

604
00:23:55,038 --> 00:24:00,400
i wasn't there a lot he's running the

605
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,278
show and we walked out of the greenhouse

606
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,080
and we're

607
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:08,240
looking in front and we see this huge

608
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:09,918
red sweet beautiful thing and that's

609
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,839
big red thunder

610
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,559
or what the big that's the big red part

611
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:18,959
of what would yeah but that has that was

612
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,960
the heirloom um line that

613
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,159
so it was it was huge yeah it was like

614
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:39,038
14 feet like 30 feet around

615
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,919
yeah but it had a lot of good stuff now

616
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:41,359
yeah

617
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,480
i remember one of the neighbors came up

618
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,798
and saw my little patch and said

619
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,720
beginner's luck

620
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:48,798
but it wasn't luck it was i was under

621
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,000
the wing of people like my dad and older

622
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:52,480
brother that you know i just followed

623
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,839
directions and

624
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,240
you know

625
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:58,240
you know by the time the boys were

626
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,798
working in the garden i pretty much knew

627
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,720
what i was doing it you know

628
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,480
it didn't in the beginning i'll admit

629
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,798
that you know there were a lot of people

630
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,720
trying to grow weed that didn't know

631
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:11,278
you know before i moved up here a friend

632
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,079
of mine called and he said i think i've

633
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:16,480
got since samia

634
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:19,599
would you come over and check it out he

635
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,159
had one marijuana plant in his garden

636
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:24,079
and it was a beautiful little female and

637
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,960
he did have samia

638
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:29,519
but he didn't know we didn't know

639
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,720
you know at that point we're

640
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:35,200
we're 10 years from 1966. you know

641
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,480
people ask well how old were you when

642
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,960
you

643
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:43,200
first smoked marijuana and i said it's

644
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,440
not how old were you it was when

645
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:48,080
it was 1966

646
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,880
that's when it became available

647
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,558
and by 72 they were spraying paraquad on

648
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,520
it in mexico

649
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:58,240
they forced this to grow it

650
00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:00,639
because no you know

651
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,240
i remember waiting for a friend to get

652
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,080
his shipment

653
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,440
and uh

654
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:10,158
it came packed in dog shit

655
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,400
so they could get it across the border

656
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,799
they're spraying paraquad on it in the

657
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,200
fields and packing it in dog shit and

658
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,158
they want us to smoke it

659
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,919
no

660
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,679
and a paraquad is like an odorless

661
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,440
pesticide right i don't know if it's

662
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,000
odorless

663
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,798
from the united states air force was

664
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,640
spraying pesticides on uh no it wasn't

665
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:31,519
it was the air force i don't think so

666
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,919
yeah

667
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:36,000
yeah it was the gov our government was

668

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,000
yeah so yeah that's like that's

679
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:07,038
that's the history of uh our the

680
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,880
kind of little backstory and genetics of

681
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:14,158
well i can i can do a little uh step

682
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,120
backwards before that bag

683
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,440
came across the border

684
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,038
the same guy that let me pick the seeds

685
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,360
out of his bag

686
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:26,798
along with his brother were

687
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:30,479
running loads of mexican

688
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:32,960
up to santa cruz for for some time

689
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,960
and before the war on drugs started and

690
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,600
so when the war on drugs started they

691
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,360
started spraying the fields and the the

692
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:42,158
federalists would go

693
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:44,719
over hill and dale with machetes arm

694
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,440
lengths apart or within sight hacking

695
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,600
the marijuana down as they go

696
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,798
they ran out of seeds

697
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,719
so these guys gathered up seeds like i

698
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:55,918
had seeds but i didn't know them then

699
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,079
but they

700
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,000
everybody collect here a lot of people

701
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:02,798
collected seeds

702
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,480
and so they gathered up all these seeds

703
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:09,200
the mexican panamanian holy weed from

704
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,519
big sur wherever the seeds came from

705
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,360
they took them all down to mexico so

706
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,960
they could plant the crop

707
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:17,759
and they were teaching them about san

708
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,919
semiya and that's how they ended up with

709
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,599
the consumer

710
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,919
what what what year do you think that

711
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:26,879
was that the seeds from went back to

712
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,960
mexico because they had eradicated

713
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,559
so much

714
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,440
well

715
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:37,519
mid 70s 70s yeah yeah

716
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,519

that were sending seeds to mexico then

720
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,278

721
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,000
