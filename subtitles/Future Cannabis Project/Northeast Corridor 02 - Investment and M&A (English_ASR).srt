[Music]

2
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:15,959
the other thing to say about those

3
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,329
management teams that Deborah referenced

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,778
is that I've seen a lot more of them now

5
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:22,979
being people with a lot of consumer

6
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:24,300
packaged goods experience they come out

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,730
of Procter &amp; Gamble they come out of

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,960
molson they come out of other Wrigley so

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,260
we're starting to see you know the

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,340
management coming in from these other

11
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,590
traditional big company industries and

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:40,530
really start to take some of the senior

13
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,329
roles in in these big brands right I

14
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,670
mean I think the one that bugs me the

15
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,590
most is green growth brands those guys

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:54,480
were all like laid off Victoria's Secret

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:55,680
folks out of Columbus Ohio so they come

18
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,159
into the industry and they're like ah

19
00:00:55,679 --> 00:01:01,229
man all these cannabis dispensaries they

20
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:04,618
don't know how to sell we know retail

21
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:08,310
because we sold bras and we're going to

22
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:11,549
show them how to do it and they buy a

23
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,379
dispensary in Las Vegas the source which

24
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,150
is already doing 17 million dollars a

25
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:16,379
year so thinking well apparently they

26
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,270
know how to do it because they're doing

27
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:19,679
17 million dollars a year which is not

28
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:23,789
too shabby

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,290
but yeah their their claim to fame is

30
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,950
that they're all from Victoria's Secret

31
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,549
which in my opinion was a bunch of men

32
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,719
selling bras to women and over

33
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:36,329
objectifying the women and hyper

34
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,879
sexualizing them and it was awful and

35
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:40,798
they lost sight of the fact that there

36
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,599
was a whole hashtag me too and college

37
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,009
rape and they were not paying attention

38
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:49,289
to that and to me they were not really

39
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:52,560
good retailers and to come into the

40
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,719
connect cannabis industry a little late

41
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,060
to the party and to say that they knew

42
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,670
how to do it and no one else did really

43
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,909
bugged me but what's interesting is that

44
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,500
they just made a bid to buy another

45
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,090
company and that kind of brings us to

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,280
our next topic which is consolidation

47
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,560
we're seeing a ton of consolidation

48
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,180
happening in the market right now I feel

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,030
like every week I'm talking about

50
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,480
another

51
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,250
acquisition that happen is happening

52
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:20,049
let's let's talk about that cuz Matt up

53
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,939
obviously your you pay a lot of

54
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,160
attention to all these acquisitions as

55
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:25,930
you're following these companies yeah I

56
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,549
and I think we're gonna continue to see

57
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,700
that because if you think about it you

58
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,910
know

59
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:32,500
the way it is right now early on it was

60
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:34,299
the mom and pops and some of these well

61
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,550
capitalized companies came in and then

62
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,200
they got bigger bigger bigger and they

63
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,819
went to Canada and they listened they

64
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:42,429
got additional capital and now they're

65
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:44,708
just scooping up all these licenses but

66
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:47,500
the smaller guys really don't have a

67
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:49,090
chance in my opinion of sustaining so to

68
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,459
your point yeah would you rather just

69
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,680
get the license off the cut out of the

70
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:55,509
gate and then get tapped on the shoulder

71
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,069
and be cashed out of twenty million

72
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:59,709
dollars yeah exactly that's exactly

73
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:01,599
what's happening we just saw in

74
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:03,400
Connecticut there was GTI's in

75
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,719
Connecticut now thirty something billion

76
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,430
not a million dollars there's all kinds

77
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:11,199
of those plays going on and this is to

78
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,849
the point I made earlier is that that

79
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,879
thirty billion or thirty million

80
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:19,120
valuation that could be cut in half

81
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:21,489
tomorrow if the state decided to you

82
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,650
know issue additional licenses and I

83
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:26,920
think you're gonna see a continued wave

84
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:29,650
green wave of these type of you know

85
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:33,219
plays do you think it makes sense that

86
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:35,620
these states start to limit that Crisco

87
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:39,189
labs or an acreage Holdings can only

88
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,799
have X amount of licenses per state so

89
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:44,439
that so that we don't end up with you

90
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,390
know America coming in and buying twenty

91
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,189
of the licenses because they got some

92
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:49,750
money the thing is - right so you have

93
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:52,209
to be mindful of the future of the

94
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,979
industry right so we're sort of kind of

95
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:57,849
near the end zone sort of maybe when

96
00:03:53,979 --> 00:04:00,518
prohibition ends so you know whatever

97
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:03,159
happens now like it's gonna change when

98
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,359
when federal laws change and the federal

99
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,340
government could have a completely

100
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:09,430
different view on how this whole entire

101
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,250
markets regulated so it's really hard to

102
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,780
call how you know what any state's gonna

103
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,120
do and if it's favorable or unfavorable

104
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,918
because it could change it could only

105
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:23,949
have a limited life

106
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:26,089
and mergers and consolidation is

107
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:28,189
happening like it's huge what's

108
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:31,068
happening and and if they tried to limit

109
00:04:28,189 --> 00:04:32,810
the number of licenses that one you know

110
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:34,580
one entity could hold them they're gonna

111
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,829
move to a management model or a

112
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:38,478
franchising model they're gonna hire you

113
00:04:36,829 --> 00:04:41,028
know high-priced lawyers to figure out a

114
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:43,728
way around it you know if these states

115
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:45,709
you know want regular people to get into

116
00:04:43,728 --> 00:04:47,748
the industry I'm gonna harp on this

117
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:50,329
point hoping some state regulator sees

118
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:52,580
it you need to lower the barrier to

119
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:55,519
entry because the timeline to get a

120
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:58,818
cannabis business off the ground is is

121
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:02,120
18 months to 24 months and to the vast

122
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:04,669
majority of people to hold on to a piece

123
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,889
of real estate pay rent on an empty

124
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:09,668
building go through the costs of putting

125
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:12,588
together plants architecture drawings

126
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:14,959
operational plans whatever you need to

127
00:05:12,588 --> 00:05:17,209
submit to your state all of these

128
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:18,799
thousands of dollars add up to a quarter

129
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:21,318
million dollars or a half million

130
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,110
dollars which is completely unattainable

131
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,120
to these regular folks and and the

132
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,098
states that pay lip-service saying you

133
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,949
know we want to prioritize social equity

134
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:32,360
we want to give opportunities for folks

135
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:35,569
who have been harmed by the war on drugs

136
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,088
then do something meaningful because you

137
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:39,620
know telling folks without money that

138
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:42,079
they're first in line is completely

139
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,819
illusory unless you're actually

140
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:45,500
providing meaningful funding or

141
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:47,990
assistance to help those folks get

142
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,509
through the program and and that you

143
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,550
provide a real way for them to qualify

144
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:53,658
to get licenses that's part of the

145
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,908
problem what happened in Massachusetts

146
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:58,699
they were the first state to champion

147
00:05:55,908 --> 00:06:01,038
social equity but very few applicants

148
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:03,408
were able to make it through due to the

149
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:06,259
capital cost involved to go through the

150
00:06:03,408 --> 00:06:09,050
licensing process and until that happens

151
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:11,389
you know it's just going to be big money

152
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,939
big capital who are either going to play

153
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:15,978
a predatory role and and you know set up

154
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:18,259
really bad deals for the social equity

155
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:20,408
applicant in order for the company to

156
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:22,538
get priority or we're just gonna see

157
00:06:20,408 --> 00:06:25,819
consolidation will continue to seek

158
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:27,829
consolidation rather than new folks you

159
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,959
know entering the marketplace and that's

160
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:31,968
that's the biggest challenge that we're

161
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:34,309
seeing because more

162
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:36,978
more of the cities and states are doing

163
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:39,860
competitive licensing they want to they

164
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:42,678
want to find the best operators who who

165
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,360
have tons and tons of experience and and

166
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:46,008
who are going to be you know low risk

167
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:48,439
for the city you know low risk for the

168
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:50,869
city and setting up shop if you've never

169
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:53,239
run a cannabis business before you're

170
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:55,279
just automatically disqualified because

171
00:06:53,238 --> 00:06:57,438
you know you don't have the ability to

172
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:59,689
be in California first or you haven't

173
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,789
been in Massachusetts before now you

174
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:04,639
know the the states need to think about

175
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:06,649
you know you you did actually following

176
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,509
through and not just just talking about

177
00:07:06,649 --> 00:07:10,848
raising people up and providing

178
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:14,059
opportunities for people it needs to be

179
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:16,548
broad low-cost entry into the regulated

180
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:18,349
market otherwise the unlicensed market

181
00:07:16,548 --> 00:07:21,678
the unregulated market it's just going

182
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:23,899
to continue to thrive building on Erin's

183
00:07:21,678 --> 00:07:26,149
point as we watch licenses build in

184
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:27,829
Massachusetts the state would actually

185
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:30,228
tell people how long it might take and

186
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:32,269
some of the timelines were 300 to 500

187
00:07:30,228 --> 00:07:35,360
days to get through the medical license

188
00:07:32,269 --> 00:07:37,098
process and you know I know this isn't

189
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,569
in this region but one of the biggest

190
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:40,218
stories in the fourth quarter last year

191
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:43,369
was Oklahoma which started issuing

192
00:07:40,218 --> 00:07:45,498
licenses kind of like crazy I think I

193
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:47,839
took today they issued about 2,500

194
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:51,199
licenses in the course of 45 days and

195
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:53,178
the cost per license is $2,500 I think

196
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,499
the state raised six million dollars

197
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:57,109
just in licensing fees so they were

198
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:58,879
pretty happy and now they've got you

199
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:02,149
know hopefully a licensed infrastructure

200
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,309
there now with only four million people

201
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:07,129
living in that state and close to 700

202
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:10,909
dispensaries do the math it's like 5,000

203
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:12,919
people to a dispensary but at least it

204
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:15,949
lets the market decide who are the best

205
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:17,658
operators who are the best retailers who

206
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:20,598
can make a go of this from cultivation

207
00:08:17,658 --> 00:08:22,759
to manufacturing to running retail so

208
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:24,199
that's you know sort of a study in

209
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:25,519
contrast but you know we'll see how it

210
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,989
goes a lot of people are looking at that

211
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:29,179
state and a lot of my customers are

212
00:08:26,988 --> 00:08:30,768
selling into that state you know they're

213
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:33,408
selling insurance and other products so

214
00:08:30,769 --> 00:08:35,299
it it appears to be a market that may

215
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:38,088
have some vibrancy you know what's

216
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:40,818
interesting though like Vegas or Nevada

217
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:43,729
like they were six months boom they were

218
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:44,379
ready rocking and rolling they talked

219
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:46,180
about how

220
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:49,259
taxes I went to that planet 13

221
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:52,469
dispensary the world's largest yes and

222
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:55,450
yes it was expensive yeah it was crazy

223
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:58,420
expensive I went I I you know picked up

224
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:00,070
some flower go to the ring it up and I

225
00:08:58,419 --> 00:09:02,409
think it was like 40 bucks or something

226
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:06,040
dumb like that I was just bringing home

227
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:08,110
to my husband and that the guy ring

228
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:11,049
stopped he's like okay well that's $55

229
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:14,200
I'm like but no no it was no it's like

230
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:18,879
40 bucks and he's like that's the tax oh

231
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,890
my god it's killer Wow

232
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,649
yeah no wonder the black market does so

233
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:25,090
well you know I think it's you know I

234
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:28,439
don't know I got it kind of feel like

235
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:31,030
the mom-and-pop ideas gonna is not

236
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,670
workable anymore I mean I think that

237
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:35,559
that was quaint and nice at the early

238
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:37,149
days of Colorado but I just don't think

239
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:40,119
it's well what's interesting is in New

240
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:41,889
Jersey the last the last round it mean

241
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,360
most of them were multi-state operators

242
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:45,189
I mean I I think that's going to be the

243
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,019
trick you're not gonna see like the

244
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,540
small guys winning these licenses so

245
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:52,740
it's the big guys are here and they're

246
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:52,740
gonna continue to grow

247
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:58,240
yeah I would say in California we still

248
00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:02,560
have a large number of mom-and-pop

249
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,509
businesses and the trouble you know at

250
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,729
least with California we love California

251
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:08,590
but they've overly complicated it I

252
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:11,139
think a lot of those mom-and-pop

253
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:13,360
businesses though won't be around two

254
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:16,000
years from now because the the cost of

255
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,399
compliance is so high the amount of

256
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,610
unlicensed competition is so high and

257
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,470
many of those folks who are here today

258
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,480
you know they're they're probably not

259
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,430
going to be here because somebody's

260
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,399
gonna come in and say look it it's it's

261
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:32,289
easier for me just to buy you then go

262
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,659
through this process myself because it's

263
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:37,809
so long and cumbersome and and there's

264
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:39,879
just you know dozens of high net worth

265
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:42,399
individuals and and public companies

266
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:44,200
from Canada who are just going on a

267
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,659
shopping spree in California right now

268
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,430
because this historically has been a mom

269
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:50,889
and pop industry like that like the

270
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:54,189
cannabis industry up until now has been

271
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:56,289
a mom and pop industry and and and the

272
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,440
implementation in California has been so

273
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:59,269
slow

274
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,519
that you know it's easier for people to

275
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:04,669
buy businesses now then go through the

276
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,009
process but at least in California there

277
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:08,838
there's a strong push to keep it a

278
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:11,089
mom-and-pop industry we'll see how it

279
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:13,279
plays out but all of the multi-state

280
00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:14,959
operators are there or they're coming in

281
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:18,019
right now as part of that shopping spree

282
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,458
well you made a good point with some of

283
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:20,810
those regulations I mean some of the

284
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:24,198
regulations make sense if you're

285
00:11:20,809 --> 00:11:26,179
creating an edible product you need to

286
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:28,068
have some kind of food standards and

287
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:31,698
certain standards within your kitchen so

288
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:34,578
that you are not selling an edible

289
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:36,139
product to you know people that it might

290
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:38,448
go bad on the shelf or something like

291
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:41,120
that but I know that when the July 1st

292
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:42,679
regulations kicked in a lot of the you

293
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,149
know established companies they just

294
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:46,638
went out of business they just said we

295
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:49,730
can't afford to do that I think was it

296
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,339
Mary's medicinals was that there were

297
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:54,769
some that were really really popular

298
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:57,829
that that just said yeah we're not gonna

299
00:11:54,769 --> 00:12:00,318
do it but the ones who were ready and

300
00:11:57,828 --> 00:12:02,870
who were remaining on the shelf in that

301
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:05,539
month after July 1st they're killing it

302
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:08,600
right now and like canned Essen is one

303
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:10,879
of those companies where they were way

304
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,709
ahead of the curve and took compliance

305
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,750
seriously and we're ready for that July

306
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:19,278
1st transition and you know well every

307
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,350
every retailer was like you know

308
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:24,379
destroying old products or having fire

309
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,540
sales you know on July 2nd canned essent

310
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:29,088
was there in every store Popham berkeley

311
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:30,769
is there in every store and and I'm not

312
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:32,709
doing it to plug those brands but but

313
00:12:30,769 --> 00:12:35,720
they were the companies that like

314
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:37,758
understood compliance and actually like

315
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,829
read the regulations ahead of time and

316
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,350
built their business strategy around

317
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:46,008
these dates so they were ready to go

318
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:47,990
where whereas a you know I would say 85%

319
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:50,419
of the license cultivators and

320
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,549
manufacturers they just woke up one day

321
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:54,139
and we're like you know gee whiz we got

322
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:56,508
to change our packaging in two weeks

323
00:12:54,139 --> 00:13:00,049
otherwise no one's going to buy it at

324
00:12:56,509 --> 00:13:02,028
the retail level so the lesson from

325
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:06,769
those those really good mom-and-pop

326
00:13:02,028 --> 00:13:08,990
operators is is that look at if you read

327
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:10,039
the rules you follow them you implement

328
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,940
them in a meaningful way

329
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,279
the

330
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,290
the rest of the industry is going to

331
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,419
provide opportunities for you to rise to

332
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:20,169
the top because most folks don't take

333
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:22,729
those compliance deadlines seriously

334
00:13:20,169 --> 00:13:24,769
from the regulatory compliance

335
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,899
standpoint when California started

336
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:28,189
issuing licenses last year they wanted

337
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:30,740
to do it by year-end and they started

338
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:32,150
like middle of December so my partner

339
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,310
and I got off a plane and like we got

340
00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:35,899
the emailing oh my goodness they started

341
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:37,189
doing it already so we had our research

342
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,409
and start getting the information

343
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,490
together there was one company perhaps a

344
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:42,829
client appears because they were

345
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:44,870
impressive that they managed to get

346
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:49,340
eight licenses from three regulators

347
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:52,129
within like two weeks so I would see a

348
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,680
systematized was the the name of the the

349
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:56,330
company so they got a med and a rec

350
00:13:54,679 --> 00:14:00,319
cultivation med and a rec distribution

351
00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:02,480
med in a rec dispensary in a retailer

352
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,940
and maybe delivery I mean but they were

353
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,889
able to line up eight licenses across

354
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,110
three regulators in a short amount of

355
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:11,750
time so they obviously had a very good

356
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,830
you know set of professionals helping

357
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,059
them and they took the compliant

358
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,500
seriously I mean that they were

359
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:17,209
certainly an outlier but they really

360
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,610
jumped out at us because they had to

361
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,830
navigate a lot of really hard compliance

362
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,379
work I would imagine I think over time

363
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,450
they like this whole concept of in a

364
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:28,309
bifurcated market of a medical and a rec

365
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,890
license it's just gonna go away it's

366
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:32,059
we're already starting to see that

367
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:34,250
Colorado is really the only state that

368
00:14:32,059 --> 00:14:38,139
continues to track it separately makes

369
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:40,519
no sense because you have two agents to

370
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:42,350
authorities within the state regulating

371
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:44,210
basically the same market right in

372
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:47,269
California or I'm sorry Massachusetts

373
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:50,450
that's starting to yes settle out and in

374
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:52,279
an Oregon the dispensary lists you stab

375
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:55,550
like five hundred stores on it now it's

376
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:57,529
down to four that our dispensary only

377
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:59,329
and in most cases it's a retailer that

378
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,949
has sort of a checkbox on their license

379
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,060
it says yep your permission to do it and

380
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,850
at that point it just becomes like an

381
00:15:02,059 --> 00:15:07,009
SKU at the cash register yeah yeah and

382
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:09,710
and in every state where a rec market

383
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:12,080
comes in patient counts go down pretty

384
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:15,170
steep well they go down but then I've

385
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:17,000
seen the data that about six months to a

386
00:15:15,169 --> 00:15:19,879
year after the fact they start to come

387
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,710
back they start to haven't seen yeah I

388
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:22,259
mean they're still down like from the

389
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,240
there

390
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:27,689
MJ freeway had that data that I don't

391
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,279
know yeah I I see from the states I mean

392
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,590
I'd know what you're talking about I

393
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,360
would disagree with that because it

394
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:36,060
doesn't it doesn't reconcile with what

395
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:41,550
the states are reporting and I'm gonna

396
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:43,429
count well you know that I think we'll

397
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:45,929
shift gears and start to talk about the

398
00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:47,939
actual investment of these companies

399
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:50,669
that's something that we really haven't

400
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,680
touched on is some of you know the

401
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:56,579
valuations on a lot of these companies

402
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:57,599
most of them are publicly traded it's

403
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,430
getting to the point where there's very

404
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,960
few that aren't publicly traded right

405
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:02,609
now they've all gone into the public

406
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,360
markets in order to raise money to get

407
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:09,419
capital and they're either on the CSC or

408
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,580
the OTC there are a handful that have

409
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:15,209
Canadian companies that have gone on to

410
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:17,580
the Nicene the Nasdaq the valuations

411
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:20,940
have been all over the place wildly

412
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:23,690
volatile right now it seems like we're

413
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:26,970
in a real down cycle we ended the year

414
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:31,320
2018 the stocks were way off like down

415
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:36,029
30% some down 40% and then 2019 we

416
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:40,500
started to kind of really you know

417
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:41,970
rebound rebound thank you what do we

418
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,409
think that we're gonna see this year

419
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,800
what do you think I think there's gonna

420
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:48,449
be continued volatility and I think you

421
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:50,669
know maybe toward the back of the end of

422
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:54,180
the year we'll see some rationalization

423
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:55,829
as more countries make announcements in

424
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,799
the and the world becomes more on board

425
00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:00,389
with with marijuana but like Canada the

426
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,459
big hype was like they were gonna export

427
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:05,160
to the whole world and there's a huge

428
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,950
oversupply in Canada or there will be

429
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,540
and so you know I think when the market

430
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:11,460
realizes that that's not they're not

431
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:13,649
gonna be supplying the whole world the

432
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:15,660
stocks will contract accordingly there

433
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,670
are starting to come out do you think

434
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,150
that that the prices are really more

435
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:24,600
getting more in line with what the

436
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:27,090
companies are doing ie revenue and such

437
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:29,099
that they were just wildly inflated well

438
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:31,319
I think it's still too early to tell

439
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:33,480
because we don't have a lot of history

440
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:35,429
you know under our belts to really look

441
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,990
at Plus you also have to remember

442
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,150
we don't really have real audited

443
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:42,210
financial statements yet I mean we have

444
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:48,870
these I don't want to say subpar firms

445
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:51,660
but subpar no I don't mean that no I

446
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:54,599
mean no I don't know I don't I don't I

447
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,240
mean I mean like I mean like mom-and-pop

448
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:59,159
I don't mean there's a lot of OTC names

449
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,200
that don't I don't mean that against

450
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,850
anything you know they have accountants

451
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,360
that are doing their bookstores not

452
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:08,879
really yeah securities law accountants

453
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:11,159
you know audited financials yeah and I

454
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,890
think also like there's still a lot of

455
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,590
like uncertainty in terms of accounting

456
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:20,790
standards and there's there's no

457
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:24,299
consistency in the reporting that is

458
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:27,980
true I mean I have seen various earnings

459
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:30,930
reports coming out with issues about

460
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:33,450
valuing the biological assets and that's

461
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,820
become a real issue is how do you value

462
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:39,120
these biological assets and if you've

463
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:41,369
had to destroy a crop or throw out a

464
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,049
harvest how do you recognize that on the

465
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:47,459
books because they haven't dealt with

466
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:49,889
that before and I know we've seen a lot

467
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:53,730
of situations come up with med men who

468
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:57,390
have had accounting issues and you know

469
00:18:53,730 --> 00:19:00,150
they're like we're trying to figure out

470
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:02,790
if we've got a Canadian stock that we're

471
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:06,420
trying to then give to our employees who

472
00:19:02,789 --> 00:19:08,549
are American how do we calculate that

473
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,759
and it's something that's not

474
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:14,460
necessarily been done before and so it's

475
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,349
all new stuff and they're right I mean

476
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,329
there's not that many American companies

477
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:20,159
who have gone public in Canada who are

478
00:19:18,329 --> 00:19:23,879
now trying to give their American

479
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,970
employees Canadian stock and that's not

480
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,920
a simple process and so they you know

481
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:31,769
come under fire for things like that but

482
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:34,140
then to be fair it's it's new territory

483
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:36,119
it's not easy to figure out how do you

484
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,860
actually calculate all that and they're

485
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:40,459
certain metrics that investors

486
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:42,959
especially when the institutions step in

487
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,910
that will be relevant that will move the

488
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,559
stocks you know the yields and and

489
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,028
certain things that are really going to

490
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,058
be more important for

491
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:53,128
UPS then the revenue or the Ibarra price

492
00:19:51,058 --> 00:19:54,928
well like the cash cost per gram yeah

493
00:19:53,128 --> 00:19:56,638
all that kind the efficiency and how

494
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:59,669
efficient the operational efficiency any

495
00:19:56,638 --> 00:20:02,368
metrics related to that may move stocks

496
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:04,169
and I think we're gonna see a lot of you

497
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:06,388
know this year it's all gonna be record

498
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,859
revenue every quarter is gonna be record

499
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:09,808
revenue and that's all we're gonna hear

500
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:11,460
for a year is record well we did hope so

501
00:20:09,808 --> 00:20:14,098
cuz they're making all these at but yeah

502
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,348
it's brand new exactly Spencer ease it's

503
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:18,388
new markets and so it's gonna be a while

504
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:20,878
before we get an apples to apples

505
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:24,778
quarter to where we can tell are they

506
00:20:20,878 --> 00:20:26,848
really operating well exactly and then

507
00:20:24,778 --> 00:20:29,338
one thing to look at I can't remember

508
00:20:26,848 --> 00:20:31,229
which company but that a pretty sizable

509
00:20:29,338 --> 00:20:33,178
accounts receivable balance so how do

510
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:35,009
you have an AR balance is that

511
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:40,159
supporting your sales number I mean I

512
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:42,808
there's a lot of things yeah I think

513
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,999
canopy growth had a harvest that they

514
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:47,219
had to destroy but it they were

515
00:20:44,999 --> 00:20:51,719
criticized on how they recognize that

516
00:20:47,219 --> 00:20:56,099
and their earnings and so exciting

517
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:58,588
accounting talk let's talk about the

518
00:20:56,098 --> 00:21:00,418
international market because we you kind

519
00:20:58,588 --> 00:21:03,838
of touched base on that a little bit and

520
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:07,139
that's really been discussed quite a bit

521
00:21:03,838 --> 00:21:09,118
I think mostly was a Fria I don't know

522
00:21:07,138 --> 00:21:10,468
if you guys have followed that drama its

523
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:14,128
cannabis industry so there's always

524
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:17,489
drama but there was a lot of controversy

525
00:21:14,128 --> 00:21:21,388
with that company over its international

526
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:24,538
acquisitions and you know a lot of these

527
00:21:21,388 --> 00:21:26,158
acquisitions I mean who knows what's

528
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:28,588
gonna happen in these countries I mean

529
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,119
that's still a real crapshoot still the

530
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:32,118
Wild West the Wild West

531
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:36,089
we've started to look at the

532
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,100
international licenses just to see

533
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:40,369
what's out there and in a lot of

534
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:42,719
countries we're actually seeing a

535
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:45,539
structure set up in places like Denmark

536
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:50,430
and whatnot Colombia has quite a few

537
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:52,170
licenses for cultivation and Australia

538
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:53,640
New Zealand so it's definitely starting

539
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,350
to happen but what's interesting we're

540
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,630
talking about this earlier is you know

541
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:59,339
how each country decides to do things

542
00:21:57,630 --> 00:22:00,930
like delivery and sales like here in the

543
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:02,279
United States you need to dispenser your

544
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,170
retail you need a store you need a

545
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,240
business you need a license for that you

546
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:09,090
go up to Canada we're the population

547
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,950
density is a lot less you can just go

548
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:13,679
through the mail just you get it in the

549
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,390
mail and whereas in Europe you can often

550
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,610
buy it in pharmacies in some cases

551
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,530
insurance will cover it as well health

552
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:21,329
insurance so very different models so

553
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:23,660
we're very intrigued to see how this

554
00:22:21,329 --> 00:22:26,429
plays out but we think it's gonna be

555
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:29,009
about wild wild west but definitely WOW

556
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:30,930
wild continents there well there's a lot

557
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:33,029
of expectation that you're going to be

558
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:36,360
able to set up cultivation shops in

559
00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:37,710
Colombia and export here to the States

560
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:41,219
and it's oh it's going to be so much

561
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:45,690
cheaper but I think that's a long way

562
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:47,309
down if it ever even happens we and and

563
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:49,620
that's part of it goes back to the

564
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:52,139
federal prohibition you know where we're

565
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:54,059
talking about you know maybe companies

566
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:56,460
having an operation in one state two

567
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:58,500
states five states the rest of the world

568
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,390
is like looking at this global market

569
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,710
that as of right now and we're not going

570
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:03,480
to be a part of and we're not going to

571
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,279
be a part of anytime soon

572
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,529
I mean in that whole a free deal that

573
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,990
really surprised me they sold their

574
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:12,690
florida operation to get the money to

575
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:16,140
buy the international caribbean stuff

576
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:17,940
and then the florida people they the

577
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,950
money that that they got they just

578
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,360
flipped those properties and turn around

579
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:25,019
and sold them and made a ton of money

580
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:28,439
and i just and now a free has come under

581
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:30,059
a short attack you know that's kind of

582
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,410
an interesting thing too that we've seen

583
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:33,240
in the cannabis industry

584
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,590
I feel like more in the cannabis

585
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,480
industry that I've seen in other

586
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:39,659
industries with the whole short attack

587
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,380
where you got short sellers that find

588
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,808
the company

589
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:47,230
and they start writing tons of negative

590
00:23:43,808 --> 00:23:50,250
reports about them even if it's true or

591
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:53,230
not you know the negative reports

592
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:55,000
central stop down it goes spiraling down

593
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:58,089
whether it's true or not it's hard to

594
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,099
say but we've seen a lot of that happen

595
00:23:58,089 --> 00:24:01,538
in this in this industry yeah and I

596
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:03,788
think we'll probably continue to see

597
00:24:01,538 --> 00:24:07,029
more of that as well because I still

598
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:09,490
think there's plenty of characters still

599
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:12,069
bad actors that are still remaining and

600
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:17,279
I think that there's going to be a

601
00:24:12,069 --> 00:24:21,450
plethora of just irregularities

602
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:23,319
litigation all kinds of things

603
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,788
licensing happened even in the states

604
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:26,769
where they restrict the licenses it sort

605
00:24:24,788 --> 00:24:29,890
of goes through this phase of just like

606
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:31,569
groups it's forming storming performing

607
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,030
and norming and you see all those laws

608
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:35,259
will be yeah exactly exactly so you see

609
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:36,668
that where there's always a lawsuits

610
00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:39,849
from the people who lost the licenses

611
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:41,350
and then people wind up not doing the

612
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:44,918
thing not putting one seed in the ground

613
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:46,418
but they find a willing buyer Erin got

614
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:48,880
the license I'm gonna buy it from him

615
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:49,780
and the transaction happened so I think

616
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,150
we're still gonna see more of this

617
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:53,918
especially as more states come on but I

618
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:56,080
think a lot of regulators are learning

619
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,850
from other states and and have tried to

620
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:59,500
course-correct and make sure that they

621
00:24:57,849 --> 00:25:01,750
come up with a better set of regulation

622
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,849
so that they don't get necessarily you

623
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,380
know tagged with some of the same

624
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:07,029
problems that the last state that went

625
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,169
through licensure did so maybe just

626
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:12,369
shorten the storming part hopefully

627
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:14,650
we're certainly starting to pardon the

628
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:16,389
pun weed out a lot of the bad players I

629
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,130
know like five or six years ago when I

630
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,710
was writing about these companies there

631
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:23,620
were so many dodgy people they were so

632
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:26,380
sketchy and so shady I mean it was it

633
00:25:23,619 --> 00:25:28,119
was easy it was low-hanging fruit for me

634
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:31,539
as a journalist because all I had to do

635
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:34,839
was go to a filing and see that you know

636
00:25:31,538 --> 00:25:38,829
the husband sold the wife all the stock

637
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:41,769
and they're housed in their

638
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:43,509
brother-in-law's office park that

639
00:25:41,769 --> 00:25:46,779
there's giving five thousand dollars a

640
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:49,419
month for rent and it was all so easy to

641
00:25:46,779 --> 00:25:52,269
just look at and go this is so shady and

642
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:54,820
I feel like now that because we've have

643
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:55,299
some of these MSOs that are polished and

644
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:57,460
Corp

645
00:25:55,299 --> 00:26:00,970
that it's shaken those people down to

646
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:03,519
the bottom and they're not just winning

647
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:05,680
off of having the word cannabis in the

648
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,210
company title anymore they they're

649
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,650
having to really prove themselves and a

650
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:12,730
lot of them can't do it and they're on

651
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:14,440
they're truly a penny stock so I think

652
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:16,930
that that's you know certainly we're

653
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,210
starting to see that maturation of the

654
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:21,789
market where we're getting rid of those

655
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,200
some of those shady pay and wouldn't

656
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:26,019
look like the big guys come in like big

657
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,940
pharma big alcohol whatever like it's

658
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:29,170
just gonna be totally cleaned up well

659
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,299
and I think with the multi-state

660
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,590
operators you know as they go into

661
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:34,359
different states it's a lot like other

662
00:26:32,589 --> 00:26:36,159
companies decades ago when they go

663
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:37,659
international and what international

664
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,730
international men or in this case

665
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:44,230
crossing state lines is you may be

666
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:46,210
exporting people brands expertise that's

667
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,099
really what's allowing Columbia care to

668
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,900
move from let's say New York into other

669
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:51,819
states like New Jersey or Virginia

670
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,500
because they've got a track record

671
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,730
they've got people that they can then

672
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,099
move around and say we're gonna put you

673
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:59,349
in charge of Texas and I think we're

674
00:26:57,099 --> 00:27:00,609
gonna see more of that as they just get

675
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:02,529
better and better what they do and I

676
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:05,949
think their metrics in terms of you know

677
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:07,420
cost program etc is is just gonna be way

678
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:11,670
better and from a financial standpoint

679
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,670
that'll be a better bet or investment

680
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:17,109
multi-state is good but at the same time

681
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,960
we're also seeing a little pushback

682
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:23,079
against it and in the world of

683
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,720
competitive applications you know in in

684
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:28,569
some of these like sexy cities around

685
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:30,279
Los Angeles Mad Men wasn't selected in

686
00:27:28,569 --> 00:27:32,200
West Hollywood that they have to close

687
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:34,569
down their West Hollywood location at

688
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,190
the end of March Mad Men wasn't selected

689
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:40,439
in Santa Monica for their little

690
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:43,990
beachfront location a lot of these its

691
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,330
but an out-of-state operator that was

692
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:50,500
Hollywood things a very weird situation

693
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:53,109
because I I was given a lot of the City

694
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,970
Council's discussions about that and so

695
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:57,519
now West Hollywood is going to have no

696
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:59,890
dispensaries because the existing

697
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,569
players were all all they exit now and

698
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:03,310
wasn't just been men all the existing

699
00:28:01,569 --> 00:28:08,139
dispensaries in West Hollywood

700
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:08,980
were rejected for dispensaries that they

701
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,110
might not

702
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:14,410
be able to open right away because they

703
00:28:11,109 --> 00:28:16,329
had no experience and so West Holly West

704
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:18,250
Hollywood may have no dispensaries for

705
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:21,909
several months because the City Council

706
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:24,490
made that choice it was very strange

707
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:27,250
I I loved West Hollywood we scored

708
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:30,808
number one in West Hollywood so I think

709
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:33,308
West Hollywood got that one right and

710
00:28:30,808 --> 00:28:35,589
but but but that's the pushback and and

711
00:28:33,308 --> 00:28:38,079
it's it's a question for these like

712
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:40,269
multi estate operators right now they're

713
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:42,789
just barging into people's community

714
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:45,730
saying we make billions of dollars we're

715
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:47,440
publicly funded in Canada you need us

716
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,360
and they're getting a little blowback

717
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,789
from cities and cities are saying you

718
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:54,490
know what we're in the driver's seat

719
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:56,950
here what are you going to do for us and

720
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:59,259
so you know my message to the big guys

721
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:00,880
the multi-state operators is what are

722
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:03,429
you doing to be a good corporate citizen

723
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,620
you know you're you're you write these

724
00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:07,480
applications like you're writing to your

725
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:09,519
investors on how much money you're going

726
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,230
to make your rate of returns how great

727
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:13,629
you are at making hundreds of millions

728
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:15,519
of dollars cities don't care about that

729
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:17,020
they want to know what are you going to

730
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,450
do for that neighborhood what are you

731
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:20,650
going to do about local hiring and

732
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:22,390
that's where I think the big guys are

733
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:25,059
kind of tone-deaf and they're running

734
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:27,400
into roadblocks getting into these new

735
00:29:25,058 --> 00:29:30,190
sexy markets where the local regulators

736
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,929
are in the driver's seat underscore that

737
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:34,419
where that really happened was in

738
00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:37,419
Arkansas of all places where none of the

739
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:40,750
multi-state operators got a license and

740
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:43,000
as we looked at all the scores the

741
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:44,619
big-name companies were way at the

742
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,029
bottom and you could see you could see

743
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:47,319
the scores where they lost out on and

744
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:48,308
sometimes it was sort of what are you

745
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:50,589
doing for the community there's usually

746
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:53,109
a community or you know how are you

747
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:55,359
gonna help you know the local state or

748
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:57,909
town and I think that's often where they

749
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,159
were probably scored down so but there's

750
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:02,400
a whole state jumping in there and

751
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,400
saying

752
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:07,590
like in New York when five licenses are

753
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,190
issued and then immediately they're

754
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:10,619
flipped

755
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:13,529
are there any states that write clauses

756
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:17,819
that say you can't flip if you went you

757
00:30:13,529 --> 00:30:19,529
can't flip well I well this is your area

758
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:22,169
but the one thing I can think of in some

759
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:23,789
states is that you actually can't sell

760
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,680
the license right away I know like even

761
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:27,539
in New York when that one that men men

762
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,370
got they weren't able to actually buy it

763
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:31,079
there was like a step that had to happen

764
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:33,869
intermittently or something like that so

765
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:36,449
some places really do seem to restrict

766
00:30:33,869 --> 00:30:37,739
that but I seem to my colleague here so

767
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,360
I think is unless there's like a

768
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,660
financial distress because wasn't

769
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:44,429
Bloomfield about that deal but most of

770
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:47,190
these states you know they they require

771
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:49,200
a new application or they specifically

772
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,970
change the rules to allow for changes of

773
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,490
ownership for the longest time in Nevada

774
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:55,350
they wouldn't allow like changes of

775
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:57,259
ownership until the legislature stepped

776
00:30:55,349 --> 00:30:59,189
in and created a pathway to it in

777
00:30:57,259 --> 00:31:01,500
California you know if you had a change

778
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:03,150
of ownership of your business you you

779
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,119
had to do like a brand new application

780
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:08,490
there they've loosened those rules up a

781
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:10,469
little bit but you know at the local

782
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:12,450
level is where they're really like

783
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:14,519
tightening it up there's a number of

784
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:16,680
small cities around Los Angeles that

785
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,900
have said you know the folks who apply

786
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,000
on paper those are the folks who get the

787
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,310
license and if you're changing I'm

788
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,500
ownership structure then you forfeit the

789
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:27,480
license the the problem is you know

790
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,220
there's creative lawyers out there if it

791
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,200
says no change of ownership they'll put

792
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,750
a management company there and run it

793
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,000
like the hotels do and so one way or

794
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:37,349
another you know the the folks who want

795
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,690
to buy their way in there they're gonna

796
00:31:37,349 --> 00:31:42,059
find some way to do it they're they're

797
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:43,920
doing that in in Toronto and Ontario

798
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:46,649
right now like the folks who were

799
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:49,140
selected in that lottery out of 2,500

800
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:51,509
applicants you know they can't sell

801
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:53,670
their license to somebody so I imagine

802
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:55,500
you know all of the lawyers at Denton's

803
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:57,630
or whatever law firm they're using

804
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,420
they're coming up with whatever creative

805
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:02,130
solution to let the big-money guys

806
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:04,740
multi-state operators multi province

807
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:06,120
operators multi country operators figure

808
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,910
out a way to get control of those

809
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:11,969
licenses or they keep some of that old

810
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:14,730
company within the new company in the

811
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,690
board or in the c-suite so that it looks

812
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:18,360
like

813
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:21,899
we still have the residents in the

814
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:27,808
company and know that early days New

815
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:32,008
Jersey the what was it the Green Green

816
00:32:27,808 --> 00:32:36,089
dispensary not purely that they're one

817
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:40,378
of the original three that was faith

818
00:32:36,089 --> 00:32:44,369
they were from Colorado and it was the

819
00:32:40,378 --> 00:32:46,378
father in the son team and they you know

820
00:32:44,369 --> 00:32:51,298
one of them had to move to New Jersey in

821
00:32:46,378 --> 00:32:53,339
order to make it work but they they're

822
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:55,408
still in business but they yeah it was

823
00:32:53,339 --> 00:32:57,619
kind of an odd situation that I remember

824
00:32:55,409 --> 00:33:00,360
and I went to the dispensary is a

825
00:32:57,619 --> 00:33:02,128
wonderful wonderful operation really

826
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:04,558
nice but because they had the experience

827
00:33:02,128 --> 00:33:06,089
from Colorado they had already been

828
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:07,589
doing it for a couple years in Colorado

829
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:10,259
they were able to really easily

830
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:11,928
transition to New Jersey but one of them

831
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:15,569
had to live in New Jersey and that was

832
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:16,860
apparently an issue I can't imagine why

833
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:19,519
you wouldn't want to live in Jersey and

834
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:19,519
not Colorado

835
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:29,058
you

836
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:29,059
