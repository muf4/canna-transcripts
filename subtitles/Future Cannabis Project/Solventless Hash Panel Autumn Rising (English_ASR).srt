00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,519
perspective

19
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,680
hi I'm Flynn and uh I do walk sauce

southern hub

22
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:53,699
hello okay all right I'm Todd resin

23
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:56,339
Ranch extraction uh obviously like these

24
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,500
guys I do non-solvent uh I'm out of

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,980
Nevada County these days

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,979
welcome

27
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:08,519
so I think we'll start out and ask

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,618
our panelists here about how they go

29
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:11,879
about selecting their plants for

30
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:15,118
solventless

31
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:17,099
and how they go about in the garden

32
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,599
choosing the right plants like when

33
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:21,780
they're Fino hunting

34
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:24,140
and uh so Flynn once you start us up

35
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,140
okay

36
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,939
um for me I guess like the first box

37
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,100
that always needs to be checked with

38
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:34,559
like anything that I personally am

39
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:36,478
looking for Fino hunting and stuff is

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,879
like Terps like I'm looking for

41
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,219
something that has like at the end of

42
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,019
the day is amazing when it's growing but

43
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:44,879
we all know sometimes when you are

44
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:46,438
smelling a plant growing and then you go

45
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,658
to Hash it you get a very different

46
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:50,879
version of things and maybe not what you

47
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,040
expected and sometimes you don't but uh

48
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,739
for me it's about Terps first and

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,840
foremost and then at the end of the day

50
00:01:55,739 --> 00:02:00,239
like resin per square foot because you

51
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,939
got to make things work from uh you know

52
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,199
I guess commercial perspective from a

53
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:06,000
business point of view and things like

54
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,618
this so when you're doing that at that

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,239
level that's definitely a perspective

56
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:11,159
you kind of always need to take into

57
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:13,200
account so that's kind of the next thing

58
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:14,818
but the first thing is something unique

59
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:17,459
and something that I haven't seen before

60
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:19,560
and something that I'm you know stoked

61
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,479
on myself I guess is someone that you

62
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,780
know sees a decent amount of hash so

63
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,780
yeah

64
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,780
how about we have Marley introduce

65
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:34,700

81
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:16,018
and you know keep it rolling and

82
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:18,419

00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,158
we collab and uh yeah just all about

84
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:23,958
putting out some good products for

85
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,959
people to uh smoke on

86
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:30,420
go ahead Tom yeah about your selection

87
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:33,300
on the garden how you start out oh boy

88
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:36,919
that's a tricky question for me uh grow

89
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,480
it and fucking send it pardon my French

90
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:41,518
send it through the wash and see what we

91
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:43,798
get on the other end no uh

92
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,099
I mean Flynn Flynn covered a lot of it

93
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,980
there the these days specifically more

94
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:53,518
than anything it's the Terps everything

95
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:55,859
it's all about the flavor so the first

96
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,379
thing we're looking for is something yes

97
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,379
that is unique that pops out flavor-wise

98
00:03:58,378 --> 00:04:03,359
we're not looking for you know the same

99
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:05,639
run-of-the-mill stuff that everybody

100
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,159
else has for me particularly I'm kind of

101
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:10,259
on a a little bit different trip these

102
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,840
days to kind of go back and find

103
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:14,639
older flavors that I remember from when

104
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,560
I was younger that I smoked in high

105
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,839
school that I loved like you know sour

106
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,298
D's making this comeback that was one of

107
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,500
my favorite favorites cushes stuff like

108
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:26,459
that but

109
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,620
on the selection note yes Terps first

110
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:32,099
um another thing that I've started to

111
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,019
focus more on personally is the plant

112
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,919
structure itself too

113
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:40,099
and uh things that are Hardy because in

114
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:43,620
the past I have selected things

115
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,960
basically just off the turfs and how it

116
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,720
washed and not the plant structure or

117
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:50,219
the hardiness of the plant and after a

118
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,800
few years of growing those things and

119
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:55,380
having them in the mix with other plants

120
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,840
it tends to just sometimes bring

121
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:00,360
problems that I just don't need like

122
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,019
some plants will be way more susceptible

123
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,020
to pests

124
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,560
and it might make great hash but the hat

125
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:09,839
that the structure on the plant sucks it

126
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,240
needs a shit ton of support it just kind

127
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,758
of grows like crap it likes to get past

128
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,560
so it's like after a few years working

129
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,300
with that kind of stuff I'm kind of

130
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,280
moving on from that and focusing a

131
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:22,199
little bit more towards the Terps and

132
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,478
the plant structure and the hardiness of

133
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,379
the plant itself versus just is this

134
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,659
good

135
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:29,579
because I also want to be able to have

136
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,139
be able to give that possibly give those

137
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,959
genetics to other people and them have

138
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,759
success with it and it not be a finicky

139
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,620
pain in the ass that

140
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,000
everybody just ends up having problems

141
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,560
with

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,199
um

143
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,379
yeah I mean I could probably go on for

144
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,379
days

145
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:51,478
Marley we were asking the panelists to

146
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,819
talk about how they go about first

147
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:55,620
selecting plants uh where they even want

148
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,360
to go about making starting to make the

149
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,720
hash like where do you start out in the

150
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,580
garden for looking at plants

151
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,639
um I guess we're starting out

152
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:08,219
um I go basically for stuff that I want

153
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:10,439
to smoke personally you know I like to

154
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,240
uh bring the flavors that I see out

155
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:14,100
there and bring them to people who might

156
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,560
not have access

157
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,900
um so I just kind of go for seeds mostly

158
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,600
uh I'll run some clones you know if I

159
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:23,879
find a nice cut of something but I feel

160
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,360
like uh there's just a lot of diversity

161
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:29,639
in the seeds and a lot of vigor and so

162
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,280
that's usually how I like to start out

163
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,550
you know start with the seeds and make

164
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,799
some good selections

165
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,900
[Music]

166
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,418
yeah you know the structure is a huge

167
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:41,579
thing for me too you know like you said

168
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:45,180
um you know it's popping a pack you know

169
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:46,620
I don't want to have a some plants that

170
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,139
are just kind of weak you know I kind of

171
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,660
try to call those off the bat

172
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,978
um but then also like for potency and

173
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:56,400
Terps

174
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:58,800
um I love the Terps you know but um

175
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,019
I gotta have that potencies too

176
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,240
um smoking a lot of chirp heavy stuff

177
00:07:01,019 --> 00:07:05,818
lately has definitely made me like okay

178
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,800
I need to run something that's high high

179
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:10,560
potency that's just gonna like hit me

180
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,978
nice so um so I like to select for that

181
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,978
type of stuff

182
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,759
and now what about a resin structure so

183
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:22,198
after you guys have obviously most of

184
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,780
you are selecting for terpenes at first

185
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,759
structure those sort of things so after

186
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,318
you find the plant that has the terpenes

187
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,660
it has the structure

188
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,520
how are you going about

189
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,919
selecting the plant that you even want

190
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,240
to test wash like what signifies to you

191
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:38,758
something

192
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,379
that you can observe and you're like oh

193
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,639
okay I actually want to test wash this

194
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:44,219
plant compared to something you're like

195
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:48,439
yeah I don't even have to test wash this

196
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,440
I mean oh shit I'll go first

197
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,959
um yeah that's what I was just thinking

198
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,020
to myself because we didn't even get

199
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,859
into the resin and When selecting these

200
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:57,659
plants

201
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,800
um I'm gonna be totally honest and say

202
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,439
that

203
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,598
these days the things I used to think

204
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,519
and I used to look for

205
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:09,019
I've been thrown for a loop so many

206
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,019
times the last two seasons

207
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:14,339
I don't know okay I've been thrown for a

208
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,919
loop so many times the last two seasons

209
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:19,198
with doing the like you know touch the

210
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:21,180
buds you know how stringy it is how

211
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,538
Sandy the res it is

212
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,699
you know is it is it super sticky is it

213
00:08:24,538 --> 00:08:28,139
like the cherry pie that you touch it

214
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:30,419
your fingers literally just wet

215
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:32,278
obviously that's something

216
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:33,538
forget about that that plant is not

217
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:36,240
going to do anything

218
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:37,979
I don't know what's up with this mic but

219
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,440
can you guys hear me

220
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:43,099
everybody hear me okay

221
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,099
hello hello hello hello

222
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,800
I lost my train of thought because I'm a

223
00:08:45,539 --> 00:08:49,860
stoner

224
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,659
uh okay yeah so going off of how you

225
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,339
touch it it's wet yeah it's just wet

226
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:54,778
like you do you touch it you just see it

227
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,339
on your finger it's just wet where other

228
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:57,659
things like we were just talking about

229
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,940
cookies and cream so I'm going to use

230
00:08:57,659 --> 00:09:03,419
that for example you touch that and you

231
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,680
can literally see the heads whole just

232
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:07,319
sitting on your finger like little

233
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:10,079
Marbles and it's it's like sand between

234
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,959
your fingers that's obviously that's

235
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,240
gonna wash usually pretty well however

236
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:18,119
I've ran into a few in the last two

237
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,180
seasons that I touched that are Uber

238
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,500
grease and still washed well

239
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:25,199
so

240
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,059
now I I'm kind of it I'm kind of at the

241
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,278
point when it comes to the actual resin

242
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:30,599
I I send it through a jar I do the jar

243
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:33,059
test which I'm sure a lot of you people

244
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,139
have seen and Adam does the resin dial

245
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:36,439
now

246
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:38,759
and I I just you know I get a visual

247
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,200
representation for those that may not

248
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:43,679
know what a drug test is could you see

249
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:46,680
yeah yeah absolutely so we take uh a

250
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:49,799
large mason jar and I I specifically use

251
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:51,958
20 grams of fresh weed so I will throw

252
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,000
the weed in there the ice a little water

253
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,559
let that sit in the freezer for like

254
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,299
five or ten minutes just to get

255
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:59,518
everything to the safe temperature we'll

256
00:09:57,299 --> 00:10:01,799
shake that for 10 minutes and then we

257
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,200
will just let that sit and settle for

258
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:06,659
like a half hour or so and see what

259
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,339
settles to the bottom and then kind of

260
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:11,759
work it to the corner let it settle to

261
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:14,160
the corner and after doing that a bunch

262
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,139
of times and then washing that material

263
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:19,439
you start to be able to get a visual

264
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:21,419
picture of okay this this is about three

265
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,140
percent or this is about five percent

266
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:27,599
and I use 20 grams because visually we

267
00:10:25,139 --> 00:10:30,419
kind of all know what about a gram looks

268
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,459
like and if it's a gram on 20 grams then

269
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:34,799
it that's a five percent return which

270
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:37,500
you're killing it then so

271
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:39,838
you know that's always a really good

272
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,879
sign so I'll do the jar test just to

273
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,000
kind of see what is there

274
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:47,759
but I I'm still a fan of

275
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,820
doing a larger test wash batch like

276
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,259
maybe 2 000 wet grams so I'll do the jar

277
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,899
test first

278
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:57,958
I would prefer to always do a test wash

279
00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:00,600
but these days I'm just committed to the

280
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:03,838
hash so if it does a decent jar test we

281
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,639
send it and we wash it and then we get a

282
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,740
full representation of what is there

283
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,838
unfortunately the jar test doesn't tell

284
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,399
you if it's a sticky bag strain which is

285
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,560
just going to stick to your bags and

286
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,919
dunk everything up

287
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:19,439
so the selecting the plants you know

288
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:23,399
just off of field I've kind of gotten

289
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,380
away from that and I I do use a

290
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,958
microscope to

291
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:30,899
not so much to check the color but to

292
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:34,139
check the structure of the trichome is

293
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:36,720
it a long stock with a big head or is it

294
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:38,458
a really short stock with a small head

295
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,500
and we're you know we're generally

296
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:43,018
looking for a little bit of a longer

297
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:45,120
stock with a big fat head on top of

298
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:48,000
there usually those will fall off pretty

299
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,860
easy too much of a stock

300
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,839
sometimes you end up with a lot of stock

301
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,159
in your house so

302
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,579
I could probably I'm probably going to

303
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:58,500
start rambling here but so I've kind of

304
00:11:56,578 --> 00:12:00,059
personally gotten away from the touch so

305
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,159
like I don't have really a straight

306
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:05,578
answer to that question it's a lot of

307
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:08,159
experience and uh uh for me it's just

308
00:12:05,578 --> 00:12:11,338
committing to this is what I do and I'm

309
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:13,078
gonna wash this anyhow so

310
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:16,260
I tend to find out

311
00:12:13,078 --> 00:12:19,259
good or bad you know

312
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:19,259
okay

313
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,720
um

314
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:27,000
yeah so same thing like he was talking

315
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,360
about the finger feel like um that's

316
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,639
probably like my main indicator

317
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,259
um just feeling like how it feels on

318
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,299
your fingers if it's sticky if it's

319
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:37,919
Sandy or if because like you said you

320
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:39,719
know the oily ones

321
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,639
um you can just tell right off it almost

322
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,740
feels like you like touched some type of

323
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,480
canola oil or something you know and uh

324
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,100
so I feel like that's kind of my first

325
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,379
indicator of something that's going to

326
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,060
be hard to wash

327
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:52,799
um and I feel like the second thing I

328
00:12:51,059 --> 00:12:55,979
look for when like popping a pack of

329
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:58,078
seeds and doing a hunt through a pack is

330
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,300
um just the ones without any Terps at

331
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:01,739
all because sometimes you'll get all the

332
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:04,078
way through the cycle flower to plant

333
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,299
out and it uh it still doesn't really

334
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:10,019
have strong chirps you know so I'll try

335
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:11,879
to cool those ones pretty quickly

336
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:13,919
um and and if you're gonna like mix the

337
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,740
phenos you know into a wash I'd like to

338
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,120
call the ones that are turpless so it

339
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,339
doesn't affect the quality of the rest

340
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,078
of the wash

341
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,560
but yeah that's mainly what I that's how

342
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:24,559
I select

343
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,299
yeah I'd say honestly I agree with title

344
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:32,759
I've moved away a lot from the hand feel

345
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:35,159
stuff just because I feel like I've been

346
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,838
proven wrong A lot of times on things

347
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:38,578
that I thought one thing and then the

348
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,740
whole opposite thing happened compared

349
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:43,620
to what the hand feeler even sometimes

350
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,659
the microscope told me but

351
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,820
um a lot of the times like

352
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:50,219
it's surprising too when you start to

353
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:52,440
measure like resin per square foot some

354
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,240
of those two percenters depending on

355
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,639
like if they're really putting out a lot

356
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,139
of fresh frozen weight and flour you

357
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,480
know even though it's greasy even though

358
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:03,060
it's hard to work with like Smarties for

359
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,399
example is my per you know our example

360
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:08,159
for explaining this always is like

361
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,139
struggle to hit like two and two and a

362
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,299
quarter percent with that strain even if

363
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:15,000
you crush growing it and it is the

364
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:16,919
greasiest most annoying fucking resin to

365
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,200
deal with but it is

366
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:20,578
crazy good A lot of people really like

367
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,379
it you know it's like one of those

368
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:26,039
things that's just like you don't see

369
00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:27,778
that type of like blue candy flavor if

370
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:29,639
you guys have had like blue Diesel and

371
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:32,338
stuff from Oregon or no like kush for

372
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,079
breakfast genetic stuff like that

373
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:38,220
um it's just a very unique terpene

374
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:40,019
profile and even yeah and uh I think

375
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,940
like a funny thing that we figure out

376
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,620
what the smarties do is like starting to

377
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,600
wash strings together which is something

378
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:48,600
that we would not do and then the

379
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,159
smarties was so annoying that and and so

380
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,320
much from it would stay in the back that

381
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,000
we started using the super dry resin

382
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,420
like the cookies and cream that we were

383
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,519
discussing to wash together so when we

384
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:01,198
started washing together all that resin

385
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,799
was falling in the bag and it was not

386
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:07,259
sticking to the bag anymore

387
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:09,599
yeah I mean considerably yeah like it

388
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:11,578
would just like make a like get the bag

389
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,100
stuck you know and then you could work

390
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:16,138
easier with it so it was actually a good

391
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,759
strategy to have that cookies and cream

392
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:20,639
on the side and make sure sure you get

393
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,620
actually better yields and can work with

394
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,600
that material better because I'll say

395
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,278
sticky strains are very frustrating

396
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,079
because they do all the hard work to

397
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:30,360
grow it and you pay the power bill

398
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:33,059
depending if you do it indoor or not and

399
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,620
then all of that is in the bag and then

400
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:38,338
it goes to the iso that you clean your

401
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:41,519
bag so it's what do you do you

402
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:44,699
I I'm on a I'm on a thing this year of

403
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,278
purposely washing the sticky

404
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:48,899
strange that most people hate because I

405
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,000
personally think those usually make the

406
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:52,039
terpiest and best hash every time bro

407
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,299
okay

408
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:56,338
that's crazy every time like the

409
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:58,620
smarties it only hits two percent but in

410
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:00,959
a way it's worth growing because it

411
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,220
throws down on the flower weight like

412
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,319
even though

413
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,180
uh like cookies and cream it's awesome

414
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,459
it hits five percent but you do the

415
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:10,859
numbers like on a per square foot basis

416
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:12,479
they're actually like very neck and neck

417
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,159
the only reason the cookies and cream

418
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,320
comes out on top is because it puts out

419
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:19,078
more melt it's very hard to get melt out

420
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,379
of the smarties above like the 90 U bag

421
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:26,599
whereas the cookies and cream has like

422
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:28,980
90 up to 150 bags sometimes

423
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,440
yeah it's just one of those strains that

424
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:33,360
has like very clean dry resin that

425
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,240
you're gonna get a like very clean Melt

426
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,278
from but it puts out like half the wet

427
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,360
weight of the smarties so even though it

428
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:42,600
does like

429
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,278
more hash in a way it's way worth it to

430
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,139
run Smarties and way more than you would

431
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,778
think if you're maybe not the grower or

432
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:50,940
you don't look back and understand like

433
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:52,500
resin per square foot

434
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,880
um yields and stuff it definitely ends

435
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,980
up being a little more on the production

436
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,659
side of like washing and stuff but when

437
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,480
you're a cultivator and you take like

438
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:02,399
multiple months to grow something it'd

439
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,420
be that's very much less a factor that

440
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,420
you're thinking about a lot of times

441
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:09,678
okay uh what about

442
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,740
you know story of the ages right now

443
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:16,139
fresh pressed to Coke here do you guys

444
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:18,179
have certain strains that you have

445
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,559
practice on and you feel that the

446
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:22,500
bouquet of the strain is brought out

447
00:17:19,558 --> 00:17:26,099
more in a fresh press or more in a cold

448
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:28,078
cure or do you guys you know just have

449
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,879
strictly you know certain things you do

450
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,159
like oh I only do fresh press it cures

451
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,100
on its own uh certain strains that you

452
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,798
only do cold cure on like uh

453
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:40,678
those sort of things

454
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:42,900
all right we're just talking about this

455
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:46,140
um excuse me

456
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,000
yeah uh the cold cure versus

457
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,740
fresh pressed debate it's kind of like

458
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,660
the skiers versus snowboarder debate

459
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:55,679
back in the day to me

460
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:57,419
um I love both okay I used to I'll be

461
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,059
totally honest I used to hate cold care

462
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:02,400
I thought that it was just a way for a

463
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:06,798
lot of people to hide stuff this that or

464
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,798
whatever I was a fresh press guy

465
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,459
working with more cold cure and I'm

466
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:13,740
going to be honest this guy here

467
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,480
listening to one of his interviews and

468
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,620
him talking about cold care and certain

469
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,038
strains

470
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:23,219
you bring more out with the Cure than

471
00:18:20,038 --> 00:18:24,298
leaving it fresh where there are strains

472
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:27,419
that

473
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:30,359
I personally think aren't necessarily

474
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:32,759
left better fresh but are suitable for

475
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,819
fresh fresh pressed

476
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:38,279
um some some strains are just it's it's

477
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:42,240
kind of too potent and too spicy and

478
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:43,859
fresh press and uh the market doesn't

479
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,960
really like that and a lot of fresh

480
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:47,519
press doesn't have a nose to it and the

481
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,919
market doesn't like that so for me

482
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,000
specifically if it's got a good nose and

483
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,160
fresh press

484
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
and it's a strain that doesn't want a

485
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,740
butter super fast I will put a little

486
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,619
bit of it out in fresh press I'd ever do

487
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,720
anything just all fresh press or I will

488
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:06,239
do stuff all cold here but I usually

489
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,519
will only a couple strains pull out a

490
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,038
little bit of fresh press to do

491
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:12,839
because I I just got thinking about it

492
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,640
more and really looking into it more and

493
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:17,759
I I have to agree with Taylor down there

494
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,220
that a lot of strains end up better

495
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:23,099
after the Cure you can bring out more

496
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,980
flavors it gets a little bit of a deeper

497
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:30,678
flavor I think uh

498
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,679
so yeah that's where I'm at on it

499
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,460
yeah

500
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,679
uh you know I I agree with a lot of that

501
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,660
I love the fresh press and uh you know

502
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,160
it definitely does happen where a lot of

503
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,960
stuff isn't

504
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,120
um as

505
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,620
um loud on the nose and fresh breath so

506
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,959
I wouldn't say that necessarily there's

507
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:51,839
ones that I like better in one or the

508
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,660
other as far as the nose goes but

509
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:56,639
um as far as some strands of fresh press

510
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,980
just don't happen those you know so

511
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,500
there's ones that when they do really

512
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:04,200
smell good then it's it's a go for me

513
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,660
you know um but I like putting out more

514
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,580
too just because I feel like it's um

515
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:11,038
very saturated on the market right now

516
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:13,859
the coke here and um so I just feel like

517
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:15,900
off offering another option is uh is

518
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:18,839
nice for people and then they can kind

519
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:21,179
of experience just the um the like

520
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:24,000
complexities of the rosin as it changes

521
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:26,759
from fresh breads to cold cure

522
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,160
um but uh but I love stuff in cold here

523
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:32,700
too like you know they're they're both

524
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:35,038
just uh we all love rosin I I got one

525
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,120
other thing to say on that but he made

526
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:39,240
me think of

527
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:40,979
there are certain strains that I

528
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,200
wouldn't even cold cure going forward

529
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,839
honestly like I I've been hunting this

530
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,360
new 24K cut and the old one that I have

531
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,519
is like super terpy like

532
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:55,319
you kind of can't beat it if you like

533
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:57,960
orange Citrus but it cures out so dry no

534
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:59,939
matter what you do to it you can't get

535
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,919
that nice wet batter

536
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:05,340
and I don't mind that but the market

537
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,380
hates that so the 24K that cut in

538
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:10,259
particular I think is way better

539
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,720
represented in fresh press because it

540
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:15,779
doesn't have that dry cakey cold cure

541
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,400
and it has a really good nose the only

542
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:20,639
thing I don't like about it is that it

543
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:23,519
it tends to butter fast which is why it

544
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,440
dries out when it cold cures but that

545
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:27,359
that's one strain specifically for me

546
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,700
that like going forward if I keep

547
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:32,719
running that Fino it's just going to be

548
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,720
to do fresh press with

549
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:40,679
um I don't know I'd say I think it

550
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,360
depends on like and at the end of the

551
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:44,280
day the person who's maybe like

552
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:46,439
purchasing it what they would want I

553
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:48,779
think things can be represented well in

554
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:50,880
both ways I would definitely agree that

555
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:53,399
some strains you know for whatever

556
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,679
reason when you do the cold cure it

557
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:58,140
definitely adds like another level and

558
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,480
for me a more enjoyable experience maybe

559
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:03,659
versus the some strains in fresh press

560
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:06,000
but I would say that

561
00:22:03,659 --> 00:22:07,740
fresh or a cold cure is like a little

562
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,480
bit more accessible for some people

563
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,400
especially that maybe are just kind of

564
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,019
coming into the solventless market and

565
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,120
maybe aren't used to

566
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:17,158
don't have maybe the education behind

567
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,779
like how to treat a fresh press so that

568
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:20,580
they have a good experience like

569
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:22,019
consuming it because some people will

570
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:23,939
buy a fresh press and maybe not

571
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:26,158
understand once it gets to a certain

572
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:29,400
stage how to whip it into a batter to

573
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,500
like keep it you know not get that dry

574
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,538
crumbly consistency that kind of gives

575
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,460
those like dry caustic dabs on your

576
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:37,200
throat stuff like that similar things

577
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,659
can happen with full melt people who

578
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,058
don't understand like gotta keep it in

579
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:43,679
the freezer basically to keep it nicer

580
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:44,879
you know to keep it out for like a

581
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,740
couple days unless you're going to smoke

582
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,780
it pretty quickly this type of thing so

583
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,679
some of it can come down to that type of

584
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:51,480
thing

585
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,519
um you know customer education around

586
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,740
like different types of products and how

587
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:59,158
to treat them and stuff but I would say

588
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,779
I really like a good fresh press and I

589
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,820
think it comes out and adds like a

590
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:04,740
different level of terp

591
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:06,599
um and definitely a different on a lot

592
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,880
of strains you get a different look kind

593
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:11,579
of depending on if you cold cure or if

594
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,659
you fresh press it and I don't know I

595
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:14,460
feel like we put out a lot of cold

596
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:16,380
turkey too because a lot of people that

597
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,298
would tend toward the fresh press would

598
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,240
actually really also tend toward full

599
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:23,759
mouth hash which we do a lot of as well

600
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,400
so it kind of allows like a lot of the

601
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,140
people who would want fresh press really

602
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,940
would also probably prefer hash anyway

603
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:34,880
so they're gonna go for like a full

604
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,880
amount you know like preserved resin

605
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:39,538
oh I think they covered everything so

606
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:41,519
I'll keep it as personal preference I

607
00:23:39,538 --> 00:23:43,379
come from the traditional hash world so

608
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:45,119
I thought I was going to be a fresh

609
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,100
press person and I'm not I like cold

610
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,139
cure more and more in most of the stream

611
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:51,119
in most of the cultivars unless they get

612
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,820
super dry because if they start getting

613
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,859
super dry I split it out

614
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:57,960
is

615
00:23:55,859 --> 00:24:00,959
um I spliff it out so I

616
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,600
um I had this jar of Z Light that was

617
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,340
traveling with me for a few months and

618
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,158
uh it was a full jar like a full five

619
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:09,658
gram jar and I that's always my to go

620
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,700
when I need something to calm me down

621
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:13,559
and I literally travel with it for three

622
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,720
months and in the third month it just

623
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:18,119
kept getting better and better and

624
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,740
better and then I hardly ever see that

625
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:20,939
with all the fresh frozen material to

626
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,679
work with I

627
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,320
when I was doing more like traditional

628
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:28,380
hash world yeah the Cure and the Aging

629
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:30,599
was something more special but uh I'll

630
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,500
say that I'll keep with the cold care

631
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:33,839
um

632
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,140
because if it's something fresh I'll

633
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,480
choose the hash

634
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:42,900
that's not okay and uh how about we

635
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,579
finish off and talk about maybe

636
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,840
something new exciting you guys have

637
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:48,839
found this year

638
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:50,459
uh a new strain you guys are really

639
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:53,220
excited about something you're really

640
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,960
hopeful for maybe uh something you

641
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,700
haven't washed yet you got still frozen

642
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,600
and you're like man this is you know

643
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,600
this is gonna be the one

644
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:05,939
I'm actually most excited to see

645
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,538
something from two different people one

646
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:12,659
of them is Todd he grew the Bop gun

647
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:15,480
number seven selection from me from the

648
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:19,799
trails from like a female hunt that's it

649
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:22,679
and then also uh Enzo who is 420 Nomad

650
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:23,879
707 who I you know we work with quite a

651
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:27,059
bit

652
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:29,760
um the uh the work sauce collaboration

653
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:31,319
stuff and uh they both grew it and

654
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,480
they're both in like very different

655
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:35,399
micro climates because Todd's in Grass

656
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,259
Valley where it's super hot and dry and

657
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,419
he's right in Sonoma County where it's

658
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:42,179
like very cold and wet for the most part

659
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:44,038
so I'm actually super interested to see

660
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:45,240
like the differences and how it came out

661
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:47,759
and then they both approached

662
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,099
cultivation from a very like similar

663
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,140
ethos so you know I definitely am

664
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:54,359
excited for that for me this year

665
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,179
because we took a break from growing

666
00:25:54,359 --> 00:26:01,740
this last year after having some

667
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:04,220
civil fine difficulties I will say

668
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,740
I'm still thinking

669
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:09,600
it's so delirious

670
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,679
I'm really excited about the Z cam I had

671
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,418
that one out there I don't know if

672
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:15,720
anybody tried it but I really like the

673
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:18,179
zcam it's a z the Sunday driver to cam

674
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:21,538
uh and that one's from finest genetics

675
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:23,519
and uh yeah I like that one a lot it's

676
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:26,400
really stable in the fresh breath so far

677
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,619
it's been going on like almost five six

678
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,360
days in the fresh press at room temp but

679
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:32,699
it's pretty you know it's pretty cold in

680
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:34,740
the temperature right now but um I'm

681
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,419
really excited for that one

682
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,839
um you know I did five and a half

683
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:42,299
percent to hash and uh and a lot of it

684
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,579
came out nice and melty so I like that

685
00:26:42,298 --> 00:26:45,778
cultivar a lot and uh you know I'll

686
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:48,359
probably keep it around keep working

687
00:26:45,778 --> 00:26:50,460
with it and and pancakes is coming back

688
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:52,859
next year for anybody who got to who

689
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,019
liked the pancakes that is coming back

690
00:26:52,859 --> 00:26:56,519
it's getting mommmed out it's got the

691
00:26:55,019 --> 00:27:00,319
whole veg space

is coming back thank you man

693
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,620
um yeah it's kind of a hard one for me

694
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:06,178
no I know what it is I'm smoking on it

695
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:09,599
right now uh

696
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:11,220
we're calling it three-way Kush it's uh

697
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,599
puke

698
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,000
all right let me get it straight Ken

699
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:16,558
Valley Kush by pure kush by strawberry

700
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,159
Kush

701
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:24,599
from seeds I got at area 101 seed swap

702
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:27,539
probably in like 2017 maybe 2018 from

703
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:30,240
some old guy up on spyrock no idea who

704
00:27:27,538 --> 00:27:32,819
the guy was but it had chem in it so I

705
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,880
was like awesome I'll take some and

706
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:38,519
honestly put those in the ground not

707
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,340
even knowing what to expect not really

708
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:43,619
thinking that I would get anything that

709
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:46,139
special from it uh

710
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:48,599
this is fire I love it

711
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,880
the uh the flower is way different than

712
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:53,579
the hash the hash to me came out like

713
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,460
that sweet Bakery Kush that kush can get

714
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:58,439
sometimes but like I had sex with a

715
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,079
chemical Factory or something

716
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,640
so like to me it's like right up my

717
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:04,798
alley somebody today said it spelled

718
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,080
kind of like cat piss which sounds crazy

719
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:09,658
I'm kind of totally into

720
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:12,119
um but yeah like it was a total surprise

721
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:15,120
I'm totally into it so that was kind of

722
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:17,579
like Kirby personally the one

723
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:20,099
out of the garden this year

724
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:21,658
but things I'm most excited about is

725
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:25,379
probably

726
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:26,940
I popped a bunch of Z by chem dog from

727
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,080
skunk Tech I'm pretty hopeful on those

728
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,900
and I'm gonna find something really

729
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:33,558
gassy in there nice like that's

730
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:37,140
that's kind of my trip right now so

731
00:28:33,558 --> 00:28:39,000
bring that gas back

732
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,679
okay

733
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,240
ready have any questions for any of the

734
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:44,038
panelists

735
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,419
I know you had a bunch of questions for

736
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:47,759
Todd

737
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:50,159
I do have one question okay all right so

738
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,558
I see a lot of people post like 150 and

739
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,820
like the 120u like belt that's like just

740
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:57,480
mad clean

741
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:59,819
yeah you know super clean and I watch a

742
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,620
lot of outdoor material so obviously I'm

743
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:03,178
not pulling like the cleanest like 150

744
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:05,158
you heads and things like that like what

745
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:09,059
are these guys doing to get such clean

746
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:11,880
like big heads from outdoor uh clean 150

747
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:14,399
like that yeah I don't know man I rarely

748
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,500
see it very strange specific I will say

749
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,538
like we'll keep going back to cookies

750
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,919
and cream

751
00:29:18,538 --> 00:29:23,819
y like these guys get like such a clean

752
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:27,179
120 even outside uh you know for me it's

753
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:29,038
I I just preached dust mitigation I

754
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:30,059
don't I don't do like a pre-rinse or

755
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:32,640
anything

756
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:34,440
uh I haven't found it to be super

757
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,059
effective with fresh frozen though I

758
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,038
have maybe a different tactic of doing

759
00:29:36,058 --> 00:29:39,898
it if I did it again

760
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:41,339
um I have heard I have heard and I

761
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:43,379
haven't tried it myself of people

762
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:45,778
running double bags running like a two

763
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:47,940
two 150s this stuff is gonna get through

764
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:49,558
you know uh the other thing you can do

765
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,080
to like clean up the 120 on Outdoors

766
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:55,139
Don't Spray the 150. just like don't

767
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:57,480
touch the bag and whatever 120 and stuff

768
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:00,320
that gets caught up in there it is what

769
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:03,538
it is you know but I

770
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:05,278
you know we're we're pretty anal about

771
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:07,200
how clean that we can get it from the

772
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:11,519
outdoor we can only get it so clean yeah

773
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,960
so for me you know the 120 it's it's

774
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,298
hard to get it

775
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,919
like melt Quality Clean on the outdoor

776
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:19,619
it's really hard kind of no matter what

777
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:22,860
you do that's why I I will run the 120

778
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:25,439
the 104 bag and the 90 bag and usually

779
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:27,538
just put the 90 out as Mel which you

780
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,759
don't have a fat pull with that 104

781
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:31,919
really you'll clean the 90 up a lot you

782
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:34,079
know but keep going back to cookies and

783
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,640
cream just because it's it's just the

784
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:37,019
hash monster and I've seen it do things

785
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,460
I haven't seen other strains do like

786
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:42,839
pull clean 150 here on outdoor I

787
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,759
wouldn't

788
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:46,139
I wouldn't say it was clean enough to

789
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,759
put out his mouth

790
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,440
and I think I know what you're talking

791
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:51,298
about the 150 and I think I would say

792
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,600
the same thing on that yeah personally

793
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:53,599
yeah

794
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,620
yeah and maybe one of these guys has a

795
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,880
trick for yeah yeah let's hear it let me

796
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:02,339
learn something all right I got a little

797
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,460
trick for the 150 because uh I haven't

798
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:09,359
been big on the 120 150u for a while and

799
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:11,159
uh I have just kind of uh I realized

800
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,619
that part of it was the bags that I was

801
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:15,679
using there were some bags that I don't

802
00:31:13,619 --> 00:31:18,599
know if maybe the Micron was

803
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,340
something wrong with it in the 120 but

804
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:22,500
it just wasn't pulling and I switched

805
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:25,740
Brands and it started pulling a lot more

806
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,240
in the 120 but but can I ask what

807
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,339
specific yeah you got to tell some

808
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,440
friends uh well the ones that I'm using

809
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:35,759
now are Bubble Bags okay

810
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,798
Bubble Bags 120 years yeah and then the

811
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:41,058
other thing that I noticed was um what

812
00:31:37,798 --> 00:31:41,058
were you using before

813
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:49,080
I love the company so I have nothing bad

814
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:52,019
to say about them but just I just

815
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:54,058
noticed you know I tried but uh but I

816
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:58,259
would also say light diffused Greenhouse

817
00:31:54,058 --> 00:32:00,119
cloth or plastic like I've been using uh

818
00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:01,859
cloth that's even more diffused than

819
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:04,259
this right here you can see this is like

820
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:06,619
I don't know what it was maybe 30 or

821
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:09,240
something but I feel like I do like a 50

822
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:10,979
diffused cloth and I don't know if that

823
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,980
just gives better protection to the

824
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:16,980
trichomes it makes the heads be able to

825
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:19,259
get bigger maybe because of less

826
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,179
um you know less uh strength from the

827
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:23,220
Sun beating down on them

828
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:25,140
um but that with the greenhouse is also

829
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,940
from the wind I don't know if that

830
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,140
correlates but I've just noticed that

831
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,538
since

832
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:32,820
um like and this spring too I ran like

833
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:34,980
totally clear hoop houses and then my

834
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:36,778
brother ran all light diffused and I

835
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:41,880
noticed his definitely yielded more in

836
00:32:36,778 --> 00:32:43,319
the 120 and was uh less of uh less of a

837
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:46,679
stable

838
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:48,240
um gland around the trichome you know

839
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:51,120
like the outside of the trichome was

840
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,940
more strong on the totally clear Hoops

841
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:56,699
to compared to the light diffused ones

842
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,620
the uh fresh press from that just kind

843
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:01,679
of melted into cold cure without much

844
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:02,939
agitation so I'd say the light diffused

845
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,700
is a big thing and I'm definitely going

846
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:08,480
to be running all that from now on like

847
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,480
the fuse cloth

848
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,140
uh yeah it kind of is yeah okay

849
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,839
definitely definitely it's a cloth it's

850
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:23,759
not a plastic yeah and it's yeah it's

851
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:27,298
almost white you know it's like pretty

852
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:30,240
diffused yeah I'd say anecdotally this

853
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:33,000
year uh ABR a farmer we work with uh

854
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,880
looks us a lot he moved Farms actually

855
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,740
just slightly just like one property up

856
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,500
the hill and actually one of the plots

857
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:42,480
is a lot shadier and I found like the

858
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,599
clean the berry crunch like the cleanest

859
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,579
resin I think I've seen from like depths

860
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:49,740
or personally that I've produced at

861
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:51,359
least from depths or stuff up here that

862
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:52,440
we've produced from depths and stuff has

863
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:54,778
been uh

864
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,700
just incredibly clean resin like as

865
00:33:54,778 --> 00:33:58,619
clean as some of the stuff we've made

866
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,600
from our indoor and stuff it's just like

867
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:03,599
incredible which I usually don't see

868
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:05,278
from a lot of at least steps and you

869
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:08,098
know full sun full season I think it's

870
00:34:05,278 --> 00:34:10,139
very hard to produce like good foam out

871
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:11,338
in the 150 full sun full season it's

872
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:13,800
Gonna Come

873
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:15,898
a lot down to genetics and then having

874
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,639
the right seasonals like so many things

875
00:34:15,898 --> 00:34:20,039
you can't control it's just like the

876
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:22,378
coming together of you know the perfect

877
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:24,898
storm in a way

878
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:26,338
I was just in Chile now and I was very

879
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:27,838
impressed with like the quality of the

880
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:29,579
hash there like even though I'm from

881
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:30,838
South America I never expected what I

882
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:34,440
would see there and then one of the

883
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:36,079
cleanest hash we saw there was 150 to

884
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:40,260
179.

885
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:43,319
and I was like indoor but um I mean but

886
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:46,560
still you know like it's still like it

887
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,000
was just very impressive and uh I don't

888
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:49,440
know I'm a big fan of the big heads and

889
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,300
I know that on the out and on the

890
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,119
outdoors pretty challenging unless you

891
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:57,180
have all this like uh wind mitigation

892
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:59,280
like strategies but

893
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:01,079
uh with a berry crunch that he was just

894
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,140
mentioning it was very impressive to see

895
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:05,699
like such quality from like outdoor I

896
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:07,618
feel like the cleanest also I've ever

897
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:10,319
seen and it was nice to launch like

898
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:13,079
three different like microns like the 90

899
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,420
the 104 and the 120 so everyone could

900
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:17,039
just like taste it and actually taste

901
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,720
the difference like between the

902
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:20,279
different microns because that's

903
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:21,739
something that we get to do at home most

904
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:24,180
of the time right

905
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:25,739
when we're doing like the mount tests

906
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:29,039
and stuff but 104 definitely is

907
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:32,779
different yeah it's very different yeah

908
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,779
anybody else have any questions

909
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:37,980
oh bro you guys are off the hook

910
00:35:36,358 --> 00:35:39,598
I'm ready I'm like just getting started

911
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,159
oh man

912
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,140
come on any any like I got another

913
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:44,399
question

914
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:45,779
obviously wash like material from a lot

915
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,700
of different people have you noticed

916
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,960
like a different in like people that

917
00:35:47,699 --> 00:35:50,759
grow with salts and people that grow

918
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,820
organically like does it really make

919
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:57,540
that big of a difference in the hash

920
00:35:53,820 --> 00:36:01,500
I could do that personally it definitely

921
00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:03,539
does in like the size I've noticed like

922
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,358
we had a guy switch over to organic

923
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:07,858
growing from salts and every time no

924
00:36:06,358 --> 00:36:10,019
matter if you pulled right no matter

925
00:36:07,858 --> 00:36:13,319
what he did you'd always get a larger

926
00:36:10,019 --> 00:36:15,420
percentage in the 73 bag the 120 and the

927
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:17,160
90s would be minuscule then we switched

928
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,838
over and got him into like living soil

929
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:20,699
and all this stuff and his plants

930
00:36:18,838 --> 00:36:22,199
freaked out I mean we're starting to get

931
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:24,358
stuff in the 150 bags like we're talking

932
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:27,480
about yeah it just seems like the plants

933
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:29,519
just the way they responded they just oh

934
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:32,000
they literally blew up yeah yeah outdoor

935
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:32,000
growing yeah

936
00:36:37,858 --> 00:36:42,179
I don't I only have you know my little

937
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:43,679
bit of personal experience

938
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:45,618
um and that's

939
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:48,358
fuck what was the question

940
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:50,220
oh yeah the salt I knew what it was okay

941
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:52,219
the Salters organic

942
00:36:50,219 --> 00:36:52,219
um

943
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,858
I was totally thinking on the indoor

944
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:57,779
versus outdoor

945
00:36:55,858 --> 00:37:00,659
um I mean

946
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:02,460
I I think that like the quality and the

947
00:37:00,659 --> 00:37:04,618
flavor of the hash like it totally can

948
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,940
all be there with the salt

949
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:08,160
but

950
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,358
I mean I don't see that much of a

951
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,578
difference I don't feel like but I don't

952
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:13,039
feel like I also have really enough

953
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:16,260
experience

954
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:19,500
washing a lot of salt grown stuff that I

955
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:21,480
can really sit here and say like that

956
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:24,059
was probably a pretty decent sized Farm

957
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,740
I'm assuming that yeah you saw that at

958
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:27,299
so yeah he's like a 10 000 square feet

959
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:29,098
yeah I mean you know he's a good size

960
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:31,859
yeah I'd be seeing it on like nine

961
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:33,900
lights you know versus like 10 000

962
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:35,940
square feet so like I don't I just I'm

963
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,220
not really comfortable to say that I

964
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,980
think salts do anything bad

965
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:44,039
for to the resin or that there's a ton

966
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:47,599
of difference you know but I'm I'm

967
00:37:44,039 --> 00:37:47,599
guessing there's a little bit

968
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,000
that in a way like when I started uh

969
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,920
growing together with Flynn Flynn was

970
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,659
growing with salts and then we did that

971
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,539
I did that for a while with him and then

972
00:37:57,659 --> 00:38:03,659
we switched to organic and I feel like

973
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:07,440
the most drastic change I experienced

974
00:38:03,659 --> 00:38:09,838
was ethical ethical you know and less on

975
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,960
the like resin quality because I seen

976
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:17,279
him like pulling the 150 full milk from

977
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,559
like uh uh indoor with salts around for

978
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,900
I remember when I met him he gifted me a

979
00:38:19,559 --> 00:38:25,019
jar that's how he tried to like that

980
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:27,480
that's how he was like oh is this is if

981
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:32,179
he gave me like a baller jar of 150 U

982
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:32,179
full milk I remember that wash

983
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,619
good on the Progressive commercial with

984
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:40,460
the fishing pole but that's that's kind

985
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:42,660
of interest to interject a little bit

986
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:45,240
that's what I was kind of thinking about

987
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:47,338
but I can't get the thought out is that

988
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:49,858
what you're gonna see on salt versus

989
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:51,900
organic indoor and salts versus organic

990
00:38:49,858 --> 00:38:54,239
outdoor I think are going to be very two

991
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:58,680
very different outcomes because pulling

992
00:38:54,239 --> 00:39:01,979
a of a real proper organic indoor room

993
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:04,559
is breaking hard especially at scale and

994
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:07,980
at any scale even on nine lights it's

995
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,960
hard as hell to do a good healthy

996
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:12,000
organic indoor run

997
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,579
or outdoor that's really pretty easy

998
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,619
like you kind of throw some water and

999
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,240
worm shit at them and sun and they just

1000
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:21,420
kind of rage you know but inside they

1001
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:23,939
get really finicky so I think what you

1002
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,460
you know what you're saying on the

1003
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,800
indoor I that's why I didn't want to say

1004
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,380
that like salts is better organic is

1005
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,940
better because I think on the indoor I

1006
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:35,400
think you can run some salts and some

1007
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:40,019
bottles that are gonna like really make

1008
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:42,539
those those strains perform and like

1009
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:45,059
shine and I'm an organic guy and I'm

1010
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:46,679
saying that so okay can we say that

1011
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:49,159
organic is better because there's all

1012
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:51,480
the ethical parts of it yeah

1013
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:55,338
so even though I don't see that much

1014
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:57,420
like Joey's not in here

1015
00:39:55,338 --> 00:39:59,239
that's what I'm saying like I'm an

1016
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:02,579
organic guy and I'm saying this is

1017
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:05,399
I'll put it like this I think under an

1018
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:08,579
organic like more biologically based

1019
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:12,480
system you are gonna see a wider breath

1020
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:14,519
of strains be able to thrive versus with

1021
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,699
a salt regiment you are going to have to

1022
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:19,199
do a lot more tailoring to dial in what

1023
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:21,358
each strain is really going to need

1024
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:23,399
because you're really micromanaging

1025
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,679
things at like a very small level which

1026
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,880
is also why I think okay there are

1027
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:29,338
definitely good

1028
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,440
you know I've seen good resin grown in

1029
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:33,838
indoor salt rooms but I don't think it

1030
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,940
makes sense on a greenhouse or really at

1031
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:38,759
scale in a lot of ways if we can figure

1032
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:41,940
out how to do organic living soil

1033
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:44,480
indoors like it makes sense from every

1034
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:47,519
perspective cost of goods like

1035
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,619
economically ethically it's just it's

1036
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:53,039
been tough for people to apply that at

1037
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:56,280
scale because big AG has created a very

1038
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:58,980
simple system that basically relies on

1039
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:02,040
these kind of exogenous costs that are

1040
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:03,659
outside of the the supply chain and you

1041
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:05,219
know cause things on the world and

1042
00:41:03,659 --> 00:41:07,259
individuals and things like that it's

1043
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:09,838
not actually built into the people on

1044
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,700
the production side and it creates this

1045
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:13,679
kind of like

1046
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:16,379
what I would call you know uneven

1047
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:18,000
structuring in the market so sadly

1048
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,740
that's how it's structured right now but

1049
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,539
if we can change it and do it in a way

1050
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:24,419
and I think in the Cannabis industry we

1051
00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:26,400
have this very interesting opportunity

1052
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:30,180
because of where we're at in the

1053
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:33,000
industry your margins are so slim on the

1054
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:35,338
you know on the regulated side that if

1055
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,679
you're the person who's growing into

1056
00:41:35,338 --> 00:41:39,599
organic living soil and your cost of

1057
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:41,399
goods sold are so much lower than the

1058
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,019
guy who's buying fertilizer which has

1059
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,599
been getting more and more expensive

1060
00:41:43,019 --> 00:41:49,019
every year your business model actually

1061
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:52,260
has way more longevity so from a

1062
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:54,059
long-term perspective and not just this

1063
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:56,280
growing a plant for one cycle

1064
00:41:54,059 --> 00:41:58,799
perspective I think

1065
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,599
creating a balanced organic soil system

1066
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,140
is always going to be better and give

1067
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:06,420
you a larger breath of genetic variety

1068
00:42:04,139 --> 00:42:10,098
that will work well easily in that

1069
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,099
system without having to change it

1070
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,280
because we're talking about business for

1071
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,559
a second

1072
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,240
um resin per square foot

1073
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:22,320
that's my shit yeah what's up with the

1074
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:24,299
numbers if yeah listen so this is

1075
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,720
important basically when you're doing

1076
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:30,000
whole plant fresh frozen and you're on a

1077
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:31,858
more vertically integrated system like

1078
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,358
when you're just buying fresh frozen on

1079
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:34,980
the open market you're really just

1080
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:37,019
looking at what did it cost me to

1081
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,480
produce this cramp but when you're

1082
00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:41,460
looking at your your vertically

1083
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:44,159
integrated single Source washing your

1084
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:46,019
own stuff you need to be looking at

1085
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:48,838
resin per square foot because for

1086
00:42:46,019 --> 00:42:50,519
example you fresh freeze Smarties and

1087
00:42:48,838 --> 00:42:52,500
cookies and cream one hits two percent

1088
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:54,539
one hits five percent what are you gonna

1089
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,338
keep running cookies and cream but you

1090
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:58,800
just bottlenecked your menu in a way

1091
00:42:56,338 --> 00:43:01,019
because you didn't realize that actually

1092
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,079
if you do the math for resin per square

1093
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:07,199
foot and understand how many square feet

1094
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:10,019
did it take me to grow that kilo of

1095
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:11,759
fresh Frozen versus this kilo and do the

1096
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:15,000
math on like

1097
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,040
basically you just have to say how much

1098
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,019
resin did I produce how much square

1099
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:20,818
footage did I produce it in that will

1100
00:43:19,019 --> 00:43:22,318
give you your resin per square foot so

1101
00:43:20,818 --> 00:43:24,719
however you want to do that if you're in

1102
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:27,599
beds and you say okay

1103
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:29,818
you know I grew a 60 by 100 of this

1104
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,500
strain and I got this much resin for

1105
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:32,759
that square footage that's how you're

1106
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,440
going to want to measure every other

1107
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,180
thing that you do so you're going by the

1108
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,220
same standard and then looking at it

1109
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:40,019
you're going to be able to say wow the

1110
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:41,578
smarties even though it does are a

1111
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:43,440
strain even though it does two and a

1112
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:46,800
quarter percent when I go resin per

1113
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,900
square foot it's actually only maybe 10

1114
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,818
percent less than something else that

1115
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:53,099
when I grow it in the greenhouse I'm

1116
00:43:50,818 --> 00:43:55,139
going to get three quarters or maybe

1117
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:56,640
half as much fresh frozen because a lot

1118
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:59,279
of strains that are

1119
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:01,318
very good for hash you know not all of

1120
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,660
them but a lot of them that produce a

1121
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:06,300
lot of resin might not put out that much

1122
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:09,118
flour weight so you really have to go

1123
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:10,980
back to the resin per square foot like

1124
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,140
we always used to do pounds per light

1125
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,358
you know what I'm saying that's the real

1126
00:44:13,139 --> 00:44:16,920
measurement in a way not pounds per

1127
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:18,779
light you really want to be grams for

1128
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,940
water or grams per square foot depending

1129
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:22,560
on what you're wanting to like base your

1130
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:24,179
business model on and what your most

1131
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:26,159
restrictive costs are and stuff like

1132
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:28,500
that so I think

1133
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:30,239
when you're when you get to the single

1134
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,519
source and like vertically integrated

1135
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:34,618
level and you're not working with like

1136
00:44:32,519 --> 00:44:37,139
fresh frozen on the open market looking

1137
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:39,599
at resin per square foot is so important

1138
00:44:37,139 --> 00:44:41,039
and in the future like choosing genetics

1139
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:43,380
based on that

1140
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:45,119
is going to put people miles ahead

1141
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,039
because you're not bottlenecking all

1142
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,500
your things into this like five percent

1143
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,000
model that a lot of people are on with

1144
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:52,260
the fresh frozen because they're kind of

1145
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
you kind of have to because you're

1146
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,520
working with cultivators you're buying

1147
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,800
it at a price point and then that's your

1148
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:00,358
you know your economic variable that

1149
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,220
you're working with so that was actually

1150
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:04,559
my question was what is the number

1151
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:07,439
you're trying to hit as we're at the

1152
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:10,338
engineering farm with your grams per

1153
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,539
square foot or resin resin perspects but

1154
00:45:10,338 --> 00:45:14,338
what is that number that you're looking

1155
00:45:12,539 --> 00:45:17,039
that's that's desired I know it's more

1156
00:45:14,338 --> 00:45:18,659
more is always desired right but what's

1157
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:20,400
the number that's average or what's the

1158
00:45:18,659 --> 00:45:22,139
one that's kind of like topped here and

1159
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,099
will catch your eye or Draw you in that

1160
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:26,699
direction

1161
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:29,039
it's hard to I guess compare because my

1162
00:45:26,699 --> 00:45:31,019
resin per square foot is based on like a

1163
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:32,880
wholesale price that my assumption might

1164
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:34,980
be like vastly different depending on

1165
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,480
what I'm working with but you're you're

1166
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,699
always going to be basically want to

1167
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,559
compare things at your same wholesale so

1168
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:42,480
you'll get a comparative but you're not

1169
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:45,539
really amazing you're not maybe looking

1170
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,460
for a certain dollar per square foot but

1171
00:45:45,539 --> 00:45:49,559
when you do your comparative across your

1172
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,199
garden based on your wholesale because

1173
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:53,818
if I say my number if your wholesale is

1174
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:56,279
a lot different higher lower you're

1175
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:58,500
gonna be at a way different number you

1176
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,540
know I mean the number is Grand per

1177
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:03,318
square footage it's like resin grams per

1178
00:46:00,539 --> 00:46:03,318
six foot okay

1179
00:46:06,358 --> 00:46:08,420
um

1180
00:46:09,318 --> 00:46:14,400
no no I just I'm honestly struggling off

1181
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:16,920
the top of my head to remember what that

1182
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,619
would be grams per square foot because I

1183
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:22,260
always convert it honestly into Revenue

1184
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:25,440
because that is my ultimate end

1185
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:27,359
measurement is revenue also because I

1186
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,659
have a tiered thing of like we produce

1187
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:33,239
melt and rosin so some strains it's hard

1188
00:46:30,659 --> 00:46:35,219
to compare them at the resin per square

1189
00:46:33,239 --> 00:46:37,318
foot level because for example Smarties

1190
00:46:35,219 --> 00:46:40,259
and cookies and cream

1191
00:46:37,318 --> 00:46:42,779
it puts out like two and a half percent

1192
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:45,240
just melt so the variable so the

1193
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:47,220
variable and the and the wholesale rate

1194
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:49,259
of that is different for me I look at it

1195
00:46:47,219 --> 00:46:52,919
different so it gets to be this kind of

1196
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:55,740
like hard to compare but when you go to

1197
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:57,539
revenue per square foot or grams per

1198
00:46:55,739 --> 00:47:00,059
square foot if you're producing all

1199
00:46:57,539 --> 00:47:02,219
rosin or you just have a equal wholesale

1200
00:47:00,059 --> 00:47:04,019
for things but in reality from a

1201
00:47:02,219 --> 00:47:06,838
business perspective you should be

1202
00:47:04,019 --> 00:47:08,818
looking at dollars per square foot so

1203
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:10,858
you're gonna always convert your grams

1204
00:47:08,818 --> 00:47:13,318
per square foot to your wholesale price

1205
00:47:10,858 --> 00:47:15,598
and then look at your Revenue especially

1206
00:47:13,318 --> 00:47:17,579
when you maybe create multiple tiers of

1207
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:20,039
product because one of the biggest

1208
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:22,318
advantages in business and in the

1209
00:47:20,039 --> 00:47:25,559
Cannabis industry from a solventless

1210
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:28,318
perspective is you have the ability to

1211
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:30,719
create multiple products from one thing

1212
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:33,239
so like when you do a bubble hash and

1213
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:36,299
you do an ice water extraction you can

1214
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:39,000
get a super high quality foam out a nice

1215
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,500
rosin grade A food grade all of those

1216
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,480
things versus someone who does the

1217
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,460
solvent extraction is going to kind of

1218
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,980
be able to give you back like one one

1219
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:48,480
grade of things so a lot of people are

1220
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:50,699
finding that

1221
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,338
to really get all the profit out of

1222
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:55,618
something like uh just a common like you

1223
00:47:53,338 --> 00:47:58,019
know business tactic is called Product

1224
00:47:55,619 --> 00:48:00,720
differentiation and it allows you to

1225
00:47:58,019 --> 00:48:04,679
actually extract all the profit possible

1226
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:06,358
out of like uh manufacturing process so

1227
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:08,519
when you're looking at that that's kind

1228
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:11,400
of I guess the way I would look at it

1229
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:13,440
and why it's hard to answer grams per

1230
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,700
square foot also because indoor outdoor

1231
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,400
Greenhouse you're going to be looking at

1232
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:18,358
a lot different things too so yeah but

1233
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:20,460
I'd say

1234
00:48:18,358 --> 00:48:21,900
let me think let me think about do some

1235
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,358
quick math and then I'll get you the

1236
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:26,579
grams per square foot on average on like

1237
00:48:24,358 --> 00:48:28,799
uh you know a like five by five type of

1238
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:31,440
square foot oh yeah let me add to that

1239
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,119
quick yeah not not on business but

1240
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,500
something I've been talking about a

1241
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:37,140
while and I don't have a straight answer

1242
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:39,300
either because the first run I started

1243
00:48:37,139 --> 00:48:42,299
doing resin per square foot versus

1244
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,920
percentage I did some mix loss it washes

1245
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:46,260
so I couldn't

1246
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,619
say exactly I got this much resin off to

1247
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:52,880
square footage but I'm asking people to

1248
00:48:49,619 --> 00:48:57,599
start getting away from wash percentages

1249
00:48:52,880 --> 00:49:00,119
because everybody is tunnel visioned on

1250
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:03,420
high wash percentage

1251
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:05,400
we are missing things because they don't

1252
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,260
wash at five percent it might wash it

1253
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,599
two and a half percent

1254
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:11,640
I'm just going to use the sour d for

1255
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:13,920
example was the last room I grew grew

1256
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:16,318
all right the strain next to it pulls

1257
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,200
one let's just call it 1.5 pounds of

1258
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:21,420
light sour d pulls three pounds of light

1259
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:23,338
this strain washes at six percent this

1260
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,740
strain washes at three percent in the

1261
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:28,440
end the revenue is the same

1262
00:49:25,739 --> 00:49:30,199
that's that's the big thing to take away

1263
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,880
from resin per square foot versus versus

1264
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:34,739
is it a three percent wash or a six

1265
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,619
percent washer and I think we're gonna

1266
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:39,539
start as hashmakers opening ourselves up

1267
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:41,220
to different genetics that we aren't

1268
00:49:39,539 --> 00:49:43,619
necessarily looking at because the hash

1269
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:45,838
walk the percentage isn't so high but

1270
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:48,358
the square per square foot number might

1271
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:51,119
be you know the revenue in the end might

1272
00:49:48,358 --> 00:49:53,759
be the same so

1273
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,680
that's my personal Vendetta to get

1274
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,839
people off of just looking at percentage

1275
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:59,399
and get more into resin per square foot

1276
00:49:57,838 --> 00:50:01,799
and resin per square foot is going to be

1277
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,720
different for everybody based on how you

1278
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,940
measure your square footage are you

1279
00:50:03,719 --> 00:50:08,219
measuring the table itself are you

1280
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:10,920
measuring the room are you measuring the

1281
00:50:08,219 --> 00:50:12,659
canopy per run you know so everybody's

1282
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,700
gonna have to start to come up with

1283
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:16,019
their own Baseline of what is acceptable

1284
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:19,098
in their Garden

1285
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:22,259
and yeah so just food for thought

1286
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:25,318
for me based on canopy size if my quick

1287
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:28,079
math is correct like low end five and a

1288
00:50:25,318 --> 00:50:29,818
half high end like seven to eight grams

1289
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,160
a square foot if you're in like GMO

1290
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:35,159
numbers or like something that's hitting

1291
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:39,059
like seven percent type of hype five to

1292
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:41,399
seven grams per square foot of resin if

1293
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:43,338
I'm if I did my quick math right that's

1294
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:47,420
probably wrong

1295
00:50:43,338 --> 00:50:47,420
no maybe that's for yeah

1296
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,160
come on

1297
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:55,500
nope I'm sorry I'm being dead anybody

1298
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:57,299
else have any questions

1299
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,920
that was pretty

1300
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:01,079
cool all right

1301
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:04,500
well we'll end it with shout out to Gold

1302
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:06,359
Country resin Drew he's in the house

1303
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:10,219
love this guy right here another another

1304
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:10,219
really talented hash maker
