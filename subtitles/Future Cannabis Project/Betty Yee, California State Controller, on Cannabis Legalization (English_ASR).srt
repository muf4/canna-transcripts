1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,239
[Music]

2
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:19,960
we have to continue to make the case for

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:23,439
why we believe prop 64 should become law

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,760
today and so I'm just honored to be here

5
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,439
and to talk about the possibility of

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,480
California having a legal adult use

7
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,840
Recreation

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,679
marijuana industry potentially in the

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,680
very near future and uh as Californians

10
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:41,238
um begin to think about how they're

11
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:42,399
going to cast their votes um we know

12
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:44,599
that there's been a lot of information

13
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,520
about prop 64 that's been put forth a

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,800
lot of misinformation also uh but I

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,879
think it's fair to say there are still

16
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:54,679
concerns on both sides whether you're

17
00:00:51,878 --> 00:00:56,399
for or against it uh I personally I'm

18
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,518
still on the fence and I will tell you

19
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,239
why as I um uh present my remarks

20
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:04,920
clearly clearly from a social justice

21
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:07,798
perspective from the perspective that uh

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,680
we have had this uh wrongheaded drug

23
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,118
policy uh for decades after decades that

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:18,840
really hasn't done much with respect to

25
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:20,799
um uh um really minimizing um serious

26
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,240
drug use but also with respect to our

27
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,040
incarceration policies uh this is

28
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:29,039
something that uh the time has come to

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,560
address that however when you look at uh

30
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,118
what the Practical effects of this

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,399
measure will be and I'm you know and

32
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,118
I've been doing public policy work

33
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,320
particularly in the finance arena for

34
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:40,799
almost 35 years and I like to think that

35
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,000
um you know I chose the finance Arena

36
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,200
because it's a way to actually try to

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,078
approach problems not necessarily by

38
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,118
throwing money into it but looking at

39
00:01:47,078 --> 00:01:51,239
you know how we can actually use um

40
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,078
dollars as an incentive there are lots

41
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:55,478
of incentives for voting for this

42
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:57,118
measure uh the first of which is the

43
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:59,359
economic impact to

44
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,920
California uh the entrepreneurial

45
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,680
opportunity this could

46
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,320
create uh tax revenues for local

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,679
agencies in the state and as I look at

48
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:11,519
those numbers it portends well with

49
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,280
respect to why we should be voting for

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,560
prop 64 uh the initiative as you know

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,000
allows uh people ages 21 and older to

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,479
possess and cultivate in their homes

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,878
small quantities of marijuana for

54
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:24,719
personal use now supporters say is going

55
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:26,518
to raise significant funds for after

56
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,719
school programs for job training drug

57
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,959
treatment programs and also reduce

58
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:34,359
criminal justice costs by the tens of

59
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,120
millions per year um now most of you

60
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,239
knows I was introduced by Susan I am the

61
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,400
state's Chief fiscal officer so I bring

62
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,200
kind of an economic perspective um to

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,280
this issue prop 64 would regulate the

64
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,039
industry and generate substantial tax

65
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,878
revenue that is definitely true uh

66
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,759
opponents even some who believe that

67
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:54,439
marijuana should be legal make strong

68
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:57,120
arguments that prop 64 does not address

69
00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:00,318
enough of their concerns and this is uh

70
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,719
we've heard him uh it is uh things like

71
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:06,479
not establishing um DUI standards um it

72
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,919
allows advertising that can be seen by

73
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,878
young people uh one report touted by

74
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:14,238
opponents of 64 suggests that marijuana

75
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:16,318
should be treated like tobacco legal but

76
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,280
unwanted and it's been 20 years since

77
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,439
voters approved prop 215 the

78
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,640
compassionate use act allowing medicinal

79
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:26,120
use of marijuana some 55.6% of

80
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:27,318
California voters said yes to prop 215

81
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,280
back in

82
00:03:27,318 --> 00:03:31,919
1996 and uh I was serving as uh the

83
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,919
chief Deputy to State Board of

84
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,798
Equalization chairwoman Carol mden from

85
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,559
San Francisco when Senate Bill 420 by

86
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,438
the late Senator John bin celis took

87
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,039
effect about eight years later in 2004

88
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:44,560
and as you know that bill allowed for

89
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,079
the formation of cooperatives and

90
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,199
collectives to provide cannabis for

91
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,599
medicinal use it also created the card

92
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:54,598
identifying um qualified patients and

93
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:57,560
caregivers uh who were authorized to

94
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:59,000
procure cannabis on a patient's behalf

95
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,680
and this protected patients and

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,759
caregivers to to some degree but in the

97
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,200
eyes of the federal government uh they

98
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:08,318
were and are still engaged in illegal

99
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:10,798
activity none of that changes under prop

100
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,639
64 as the state's Chief fiscal officer I

101
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,920
view the possibility of a well-regulated

102
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,159
adult use

103
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:19,599
medical Adult Ed marijuana industry in

104
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,000
California in terms of potential and

105
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,759
also in terms of challenges and as a

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,240
California tax official I've seen

107
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,319
firsthand some of those challenges uh

108
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,079
after my predecessor um Carol M left the

109
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:33,120
board to be Equalization for seat in the

110
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,680
California state senate I was appointed

111
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,199
to serve out her term in my first months

112
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,680
in office I heard of uh dispensaries

113
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:42,079
that the Board of Equalization had

114
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,000
denied sales sellers permits for

115
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,319
medicinal marijuana because retail sales

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,240
had not been

117
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:50,599
legalized and the Boe sellers permit

118
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,120
itself explicitly stated that it was uh

119
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,639
not to be used for illegal

120
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,478
activity uh some operators sold

121
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,360
medicinal marijuana for years without

122
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,439
collecting sales tax and found

123
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,639
themselves on the hook for back taxes

124
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:07,478
that were high enough to put them out of

125
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,319
business and in September of 2005 9

126
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:10,839
months into my service on the board the

127
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:13,560
Third District Court of Appeals

128
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:16,799
determined that Senator vonellis uh bill

129
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,918
Senate Bill 420 did in fact sanction

130
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,919
marijuana

131
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,038
dispensaries so I recommended at the

132
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,799
time that we revised the Board of

133
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,759
Equalization policy to Grant a seller's

134
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,520
permit to anyone requesting one for the

135
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:30,280
sale of medicinal marijuana as defined

136
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,519
in the compassionate use Act of 1996

137
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:33,879
and the medical marijuana program

138
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,879
created by sb420 for the purposes of

139
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:37,719
collecting taxes due to the state and

140
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:39,319
you remember back in 2004 it was a very

141
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,560
different landscape very different

142
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:44,639
landscape we were seen the DEA quite

143
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,280
often in California uh they were subject

144
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:53,000
to the um the direction of uh the uh

145
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:54,599
George W bush era uh we had uh frankly

146
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,800
been putting up the fight with the feds

147
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,400
because a lot of the seized assets were

148
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,079
tax revenue that have been put aside in

149
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,879
bank accounts that belong to the state

150
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,199
of

151
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,038
California uh ultimately the compromise

152
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,639
was to say that the Board of

153
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:07,680
Equalization should end the explicit

154
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:09,960
refusal to Grant sellers permits to

155
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,519
businesses engag in illegal activity and

156
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:13,478
to no longer require that cannabis

157
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,198
businesses disclose the nature of their

158
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:19,279
sales and this was a way that we felt we

159
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,240
could actually have dispensaries um

160
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,159
really operate as legitimate businesses

161
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,199
in their communities and certainly not

162
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:27,560
have the tax board make any judgment

163
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,680
about the uh illegal or illegal nature

164
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,319
of their activity

165
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,800
so uh it was an unanimous vote I

166
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,560
convinced my Republican colleagues to

167
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,759
vote for this and the effect was to

168
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,360
allow dispensaries essentially to

169
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,919
operate within legal guidelines and

170
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,439
collect taxes due to the state but even

171
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:43,598
so the wording of that compromise

172
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:45,240
highlights the fact that the state

173
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:47,839
government still found itself walking a

174
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,879
tight line between state and federal

175
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:52,159
regulations and do not want to be seen

176
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,279
as condoning Federal illegal activity

177
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,080
and I remember how much of a tight RPP I

178
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,439
personally felt like I was walking I

179
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:58,800
felt this was the right thing to do it

180
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,360
was a way to get those who were

181
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
operating Underground to come above

182
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,479
ground to be recognized as legitimate

183
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,038
businesses and yet at the same time I

184
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,560
have my chief counsel of the board just

185
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:11,000
essentially kind of put his arms out to

186
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,759
say don't get too far out there because

187
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,800
of the federal prohibition so this

188
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:21,919
conflict is not um easily resolved and

189
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,759
obviously some further Federal um

190
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,240
further effects of federal prohibition

191
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,038
relates to

192
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,478
Banking and you know when I think about

193
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:34,318
some of the the issues that are still

194
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:36,839
unresolved today that will continue to

195
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,720
be unresolved when prop 64 uh should the

196
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:42,159
voters approve it become

197
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,840
law we still have the nasty issue of

198
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,759
banking that has not been resolved and

199
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:49,679
to me that is the singularly biggest

200
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,800
issue that we have got to make some

201
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,720
movement forward and uh it's my hope

202
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,360
that if California voters decide that we

203
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,800
should have an adult use recreational

204
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,319
marijuana industry here in California

205
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,800
that the federal government and our

206
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,120
Congressional Delegation will begin to

207
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:10,360
move to allow banking practices uh to

208
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,360
support uh marijana

209
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:15,840
[Applause]

210
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,520
businesses uh for 45 years the federal

211
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:21,119
government has had a banking secrecy act

212
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:22,519
that Outlaws laundering money obtained

213
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,120
through illegal activities through

214
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:26,079
financial institutions and uh I know

215
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,720
there have been some financial

216
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,598
institutions Credit Unions I know we've

217
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,320
read about in other states Colorado

218
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:34,639
Washington uh that have uh tried to be

219
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,360
of support most big banks will not

220
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,639
create an account for cannabis business

221
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,759
regardless of state law because

222
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:42,639
federally it is still illegal now the uh

223
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:44,439
Financial crimes enforcement network is

224
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,679
an arm of our federal treasury charged

225
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,880
with enforcing the banking secrecy act

226
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,559
and known as finson this enforcement

227
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:54,720
Network laid out some very specific

228
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,518
guidelines and said it will not take

229
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,800
action against financial institutions

230
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:02,839
that follow them the finson reporting

231
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:05,919
requirements are so time intensive and

232
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:09,079
labor intensive that financial

233
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:11,399
institutions if uh they allow

234
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:15,000
dispensaries to have accounts will

235
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:18,879
charge a steep monthly fee and for just

236
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,519
your uh regular uh normal dispensary uh

237
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,480
it probably is not worth it financially

238
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,839
despite the risk of running an all-cash

239
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,000
business so many in law enforcement have

240
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:28,360
conflicted views on legalization on the

241
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,278
on the one hand they would love to

242
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,759
eliminate the danger people people face

243
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,600
when they encounter illegal grow

244
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,879
operations guarded by well-armed

245
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,720
individuals um you know I look at our

246
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:40,039
tax board as not necessarily law

247
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,839
enforcement we are there to facilitate

248
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:45,559
tax collection and uh but I do have to

249
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:48,000
say it continues to give me pause when

250
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,439
uh each month or every quarter we have

251
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,360
to make special arrangements with

252
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,200
medical dispensaries medical marijuana

253
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,680
dispensaries to uh accept their sales

254
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,000
tax payments in cash you know from a

255
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,319
public safety perspective and you can

256
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,480
imagine and that getting magnified under

257
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,278
broader legalization that's a huge

258
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,720
concern so on the one hand while I don't

259
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:11,879
necessarily um agree with our law

260
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,160
enforcement community that uh the

261
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,360
typical public safety issue of Law and

262
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,719
Order is going to be um front and center

263
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,839
with prop 64 it does present other

264
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,600
public safety issues including this so

265
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:27,640
um Washington state has been very good

266
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,639
as I said with helping um its Credit

267
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:31,319
Unions understand the finson guidelines

268
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,759
and make accounts available to State

269
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,760
authorized cannabis Sellers and we hope

270
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,000
that this is something that our um State

271
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:40,159
of California government can also help

272
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,958
facilitate the state of Colorado was

273
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,360
leaving it to the feds to provide

274
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,439
stronger guidance and leaving it to

275
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,600
financial institutions to decide the

276
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,240
level of legal risks that they are

277
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,079
comfortable assuming uh it is estimated

278
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,560
that Colorado will have 1.2 billion in

279
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:57,399
cash transactions this year alone so

280
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,278
this is a problem that's not going away

281
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,600
and in fact will probably come exact

282
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:04,480
maturbated given the growth in the

283
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,278
industry uh overall about 40% of

284
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,600
cannabis businesses Nationwide say they

285
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:10,679
have been able to open a bank account uh

286
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,519
and that's a start but it leaves six out

287
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:15,039
of every 10 cannabis businesses in a

288
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:17,759
potentially unsafe position uh clearly

289
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,719
there are challenges to uh to address in

290
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,600
order to successfully launch a legal

291
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,000
recreational Cannabis industry in

292
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,639
California but there's also amazing

293
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,639
Economic Opportunity and I believe

294
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:30,399
that's why most of you are here Colorado

295
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,720
Washington and Oregon are averaging a

296
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,720
combined 123.5 million in monthly sales

297
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,839
of legal recreational marijuana and

298
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:42,040
that's uh as of this year and Oregon has

299
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,760
not even opened its retail stores yet if

300
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:46,719
steady increases continue there's a

301
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:49,399
potential for them to have $2 billion in

302
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,759
total sales this year there are between

303
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:54,000
100,000 and 150,000 people already

304
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:56,240
employed in the Cannabis industry in

305
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,639
Colorado they are even seeing what some

306
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,919
call um Can tourism

307
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:05,039
now uh tourism in California Susan was

308
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,399
asking me about this uh we have a uh

309
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:11,519
tourism business that amounts to about

310
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:14,600
12223 billion a year and uh Leisure

311
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,959
travelers to the state of Colorado uh

312
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,040
spent $98 million at our recreational

313
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,799
marijuana uh at recreational marijuana

314
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,679
stores last year um which represents 17%

315
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:27,000
of total sales but what they're this is

316
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,198
becoming a tourist industry and so we're

317
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,320
seeing bumps of potentially 20% in

318
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:35,039
tourism dollars uh which certainly can

319
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:38,040
help the economy as well so 20% of$ 122

320
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:41,879
$123 billion it's pretty big pretty big

321
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:44,559
uh gain for California uh sales could be

322
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:47,000
um 1.6 billion in the first year in

323
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,719
California and by 2020 the legal Market

324
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,679
in California could be well over $6.4

325
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,480
billion uh the California Legislative

326
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,439
anas Office estimates that state and

327
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,680
local governments could collect net

328
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,560
additional revenues that could

329
00:12:56,679 --> 00:13:01,198
eventually top a billion dollars a year

330
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,599
and recent polls by the public policy

331
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:04,078
Institute showed that support for

332
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,159
legalization has increased since the

333
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:09,879
failure of proposition 19 and 2010 when

334
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:12,198
53% of California voters said no to the

335
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,320
prospect of allowing recreational adult

336
00:13:12,198 --> 00:13:16,639
use of marijuana so the needle has moved

337
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,839
actually uh pretty quickly in the

338
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,240
direction towards legalization today 55%

339
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,839
of likely voters say they support

340
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,680
legalization I think some of the more

341
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:26,639
recent polls have that higher and the

342
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:28,599
partisan divide is not as wide as one

343
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,720
might think uh Republican support has

344
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:35,000
increased 10 points since 2010 to

345
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,199
44% now the only demographic that has

346
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
not increased its support for

347
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:41,120
legalization are people 35 to 45 years

348
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,360
old and particularly those with children

349
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,159
under the age of 18 perhaps reflecting

350
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,278
some of the concerns I mentioned

351
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:49,039
earlier now as the person who pays the

352
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,958
bills for the State of California and as

353
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:53,360
a member of the board charged with tax

354
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:56,799
collection I am looking at the Canabis

355
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,639
industry the uh adult use legal cannabis

356
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,838
industry as an eventuality

357
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:05,039
uh we will get there whether it be this

358
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,680
November or sometime soon and as such I

359
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,399
look at the challenges faced in terms of

360
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,198
seeking the solutions necessary to

361
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,720
overcome them and it's imperative that

362
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:16,319
when we do legalize cannabis we do this

363
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,199
right we do this right uh you know there

364
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,720
is enough public opposition to this

365
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,198
measure whether it be from concerned

366
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,560
parents whether it be from law

367
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:28,159
enforcement whether it be from you know

368
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:30,000
just uh those who believe that uh this

369
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,600
is the beginning of you know what we're

370
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,480
seeing um being developed as you know

371
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,480
big big Corporation cannabis you know

372
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,039
being established um there's even

373
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,560
frankly opposition within the industry

374
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:44,000
and so when we look at this opposition

375
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:47,719
it's imperative that we understand what

376
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,440
the uh arguments against the measure are

377
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,240
and to also look at how we're going to

378
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,920
get them addressed because they are not

379
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:56,759
going to go away and frankly the

380
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:59,439
opposition opposition um interests are

381
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:02,959
all going to be looking for missteps as

382
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,680
we carry out uh the uh mandates of the

383
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:08,799
initiative should it pass and one

384
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,120
misstep could really up in the industry

385
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,599
so there's a public perception but

386
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,440
there's also a public reputation

387
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,759
associated with this issue and I think

388
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,959
um you know I've been uh one to where I

389
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,800
feel my role certainly as a as a tax

390
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,198
collector certainly as a CFO I'm not

391
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:25,399
going to be part of any of the

392
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,799
regulating authorities in California

393
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,839
under prop 64 but we have to do this

394
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:32,318
right and I committed to rolling up my

395
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,199
sleeves and figuring the stuff out um

396
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:36,120
I've long advocated and have made the

397
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:38,278
ask of our federal officials to allow

398
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,879
California to actually have a banking

399
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:43,480
pilot you know just give us a chance to

400
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:45,919
just interface with our financial

401
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,560
institutions and just see what it is

402
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:51,078
that is so problematic that we have uh

403
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,479
dispensaries be able to do business with

404
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:55,278
our traditional financial institutions

405
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,360
so um you have a panel that's coming up

406
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,360
that's going to be talking about

407
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,079
different perspectives about um adult

408
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,560
use and um but the other thing I just

409
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:08,439
wanted to say um is this when we look at

410
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:10,198
um what the proposition provides for you

411
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:12,000
know the other great concern I have is

412
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:13,879
that we haven't had a track record with

413
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,559
respect to the regulatory framework that

414
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:18,720
was developed by the legislature for

415
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:20,318
medical cannabis and uh some of you know

416
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,879
this in the room and others may not but

417
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:23,198
I've spent the better part of the last

418
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:25,559
15 years working with the medical

419
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,679
cannabis Community it has been a tough

420
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,799
fight it's been a tough fight and we're

421
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,000
still not done so so aside from banking

422
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:32,559
we need to be sure that the federal

423
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,440
government recognizes these businesses

424
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,318
as legitimate businesses for tax

425
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,360
purposes so we can have business

426
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:41,479
expenses deducted and all of the other

427
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,399
tax benefits that it may uh it may use

428
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,360
to uh reduce their cost of doing

429
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:48,120
business but also uh as I look at just

430
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,919
even the regulatory environment as it

431
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,560
will evolve with the passage of

432
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,958
proposition 64 you have the Department

433
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:57,318
of Consumer Affairs that will be the

434
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:59,559
lead Agency for oversight of this adult

435
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:00,799
used cannabis industry you have the

436
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:02,799
Department of Public Health that will

437
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,678
have jurisdiction over testing and

438
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:07,558
Manufacturing and I will tell you right

439
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,839
now that department has zero banwi to do

440
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:11,838
that and how are they going to develop

441
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,918
that we have the department of food and

442
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,318
agriculture that will oversee all issues

443
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,400
related to

444
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:21,038
cultivation and we know that when uh

445
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,720
agencies delve into their specific

446
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:24,959
jurisdiction other issues will emerge

447
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,759
and I don't know how you speak about

448
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,759
cultivation without looking at issues

449
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:32,319
around pesticide use energy use water

450
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,640
use so I'm surmising that when all is

451
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,720
said and done and we actually get a

452
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,000
regulatory framework which now looks

453
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,079
like if 64 passes we'll piggyback on the

454
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,519
work that's currently being done for

455
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:46,079
medical but that is um I can easily

456
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:49,000
foresee over a dozen regulatory entities

457
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,159
at the state level overseeing adult use

458
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,440
recreational

459
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,480
marijuana now doesn't give you comfort

460
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,000
in terms of being a part of that

461
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,000
industry but at the same time uh I think

462
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,240
what we have to do to be honest about

463
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,558
these issues that still remain thorny

464
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,240
relative to what we have to resolve in

465
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:09,678
getting a an industry regulated and I

466
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,159
and I just need to applaud all of you

467
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,080
because I don't know of no other

468
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:15,880
industry that essentially has stepped

469
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:19,399
forward to say regulate

470
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:22,120
us right right who does

471
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:25,080
that who does

472
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:27,959
that and frankly that's your selling

473
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:30,199
point that's your selling point we want

474
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,200
to be looked at as legitimate businesses

475
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,759
under the guise of the law we want to be

476
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,080
regulated we know what happens when

477
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:37,000
we're not regulated we don't want a

478
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:41,119
black

479
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,880
market right and so um but kudos to you

480
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,158
for doing that and I have to say

481
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,080
particularly to the medical dispensary

482
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:48,559
uh folks who just really paved the way

483
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:51,079
for that that was not easy for them to

484
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,319
do uh but they've opened that door and I

485
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:53,798
think that's what we need to do but

486
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:54,798
here's what I'm going to say u in my

487
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:57,119
closing

488
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:58,480
remarks you know as I said we've got to

489
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,918
get this right because the forces that

490
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,558
oppos that still are quite strong and uh

491
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:03,640
we can't afford any misstep but the

492
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,158
other thing I'm going to say is that

493
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:09,320
this is going to be need to be very

494
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:12,919
exacting it's not okay to speculate what

495
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:15,279
will be or what won't be and there is

496
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:16,960
more that the body of science behind

497
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,079
this is becoming more and more

498
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,840
robust and certainly with respect to

499
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:22,240
cultivation there's a whole lot more

500
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:24,639
track record and experience that can

501
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,720
inform what we do here in California but

502
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,038
I say this to you because um you know

503
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,279
when we are regulatory bodies at the

504
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:34,798
state level and particularly regulatory

505
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:38,279
bodies you know up to a few dozen

506
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,558
potentially if prop 64 becomes the law

507
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:40,918
we don't have the expertise or the

508
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:42,359
bandwidth at the state level we're going

509
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:44,400
to need to reach out to

510
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:46,079
Industry and you have got to have your

511
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,280
act

512
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,000
together I mean to the point of being

513
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:51,319
very exacting being able to point to the

514
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,759
resources that are have been

515
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:55,200
demonstrated that have been researched

516
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,359
that have you know just uh shown what

517
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,798
works obviously from a government to

518
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,240
government perspective we'll be reaching

519
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:03,759
out to our colleagues in Colorado

520
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,440
Washington Oregon but from a business

521
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:09,079
perspective from a cultivation

522
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,880
perspective uh from what you all have

523
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:14,240
already begun to do and will continue to

524
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,799
do more of and expand into California uh

525
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,440
we need your

526
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:22,359
expertise but it has got to be robust it

527
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,600
has got to be based in um hopefully

528
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:27,639
research and empirical

529
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:30,000
evidence and it has got to be such that

530
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,759
when we devel this regulatory framework

531
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,720
more broadly that there is

532
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:38,038
a understanding and kind of a standard

533
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:40,279
and foundational level of understanding

534
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:42,400
such that when there is State oversight

535
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:45,519
and local jurisdictions decide how much

536
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,038
they want to get into this area that

537
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:49,759
they have the comfort that the state has

538
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,359
got their back so that's what's at stake

539
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,839
here and part of the reason I'm on the

540
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,079
fence is that I don't know that we're

541
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:58,678
there yet I don't have I don't have

542
00:20:55,079 --> 00:21:01,038
faith in my own state government frankly

543
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:02,960
uh but I also feel that we can't be

544
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,158
casual about the opposition that's out

545
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,679
there it's very real you know there are

546
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:10,080
days that I still get mail from parents

547
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,919
who are on me about you know the the

548
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:16,399
what I pave to kind of make 64 possible

549
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:18,520
today and uh you know frankly wake up

550
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,919
parents it's out on the street your kids

551
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:23,879
are getting their hands on it

552
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,679
so you know when we talk about

553
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,039
regulation and that's why you know

554
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,720
that's what you all have done to be

555
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:31,919
responsible regulate us us but when you

556
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,759
say regulate us give us the tools to be

557
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,679
able to do that effectively and so while

558
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:39,480
I stand before you on the fence about

559
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:40,919
proposition 64 I also am very hopeful

560
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,400
about the kind of industry this could

561
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,960
become in California but I'm going to

562
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,159
say but I'm also going to say within

563
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,120
your community within your community

564
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,559
come together there's been a lot of work

565
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:54,678
done in this Arena and I just need to

566
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,440
applaud those who are in the medical

567
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:58,000
cannabis Arena because a lot of that

568
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,080
work was pioneering ground break

569
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,319
groundbreaking

570
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:04,599
and frankly a very lonely time for many

571
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:07,480
of them many lessons learn from

572
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:09,319
that and uh you know for me I want to

573
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,798
continue to see some recognition of

574
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:15,000
medical cannabis when we do have adult

575
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:16,480
use uh legalized recreational use

576
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,319
because at the end of the day what we're

577
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,798
all after I hope I hope is safe access

578
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:25,439
to Safe

579
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:28,079
products and as soon as any of that is

580
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,080
compromised the whole industry will tip

581
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,599
on its head

582
00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:35,599
so it's precarious but it's exciting at

583
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:38,278
the same time it is serious but also the

584
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:40,959
possibilities are you know quite

585
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:44,720
Limitless and it is one where it can be

586
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,600
a game Cher If all of you really step up

587
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,960
to the plate and begin to inform how we

588
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:52,399
begin to get a system in place that is

589
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,960
responsible that begins to set some

590
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,120
standards and also where as local

591
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,000
governments decide whether they're going

592
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,678
to get into this Arena or not

593
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,319
that they have the comfort knowing that

594
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,600
the state knows what it's doing so it's

595
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:07,720
a lot of lot of responsibility back to

596
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:09,798
you but at the same time I'm going to

597
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,640
say that I'm one state level official

598
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:13,519
who is not going to be shy about rolling

599
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,840
up my sleeves whether a tax official or

600
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:17,119
otherwise or in any of the other number

601
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:19,240
of boards and commissions on which I

602
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:22,079
serve that when the voters approve pop

603
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,440
64 it will be the law of California and

604
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,918
my job is to enforce the law but my job

605
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,120
is also going to be as the chief fiscal

606
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:31,840
officer how to be sure that this is a

607
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:33,479
successful industry successful for you

608
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,759
successful for the state successful for

609
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,759
our local governments but also

610
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,640
successful in terms of the state

611
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:42,400
providing the type of oversight that

612
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,159
will help make this industry Thrive and

613
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,919
hopefully be a model for the rest of the

614
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,480
world thank you all very much for the

615
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,480
invitation to speak

616
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:59,720
[Applause]

617
00:23:53,569 --> 00:24:02,119
