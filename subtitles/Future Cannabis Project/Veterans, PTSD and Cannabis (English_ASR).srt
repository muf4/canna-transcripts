[Music]

2
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:10,980
there's so many veterans right now that

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,169
yeah have you know vets that have lost

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:14,490
limbs and stuff and you know have their

5
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:15,929
physical incapacity

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,219
but then there's veterans like myself

7
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:23,070
that physically were fit you know to an

8
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:26,309
extent but there's veterans right now

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:30,570
that are in their houses with a car that

10
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:30,960
runs with a body that's able to alright

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,640
bro

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,270
to come out and be a part of something

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,950
like this that's fucking amazing but

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,649
they can't get out of bed because the

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,930
wound is in the mind and there's like so

16
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:47,370
many of us right now man that are at

17
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:50,179
home like just miserable to wear if they

18
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:52,828
understood that there's a community of

19
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:54,210
people out here that like leave your

20
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,489
house and comments it's been an

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,259
afternoon and watch it change your life

22
00:00:56,488 --> 00:01:00,209
because that's what this is you're not I

23
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:03,149
mean like if you're like a selfless

24
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,769
person that's on that the military

25
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,469
teaches you like immediately you get the

26
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:10,109
basic training if we have like you know

27
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:12,658
core values and shit and one of them is

28
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:15,000
selfless service and selfless services

29
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:17,400
you give your life for your country like

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,019
that's where that kind of honor code

31
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,359
within a bet that you see like when we

32
00:01:19,019 --> 00:01:23,280
die like it's for the country like that

33
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,420
comes from when you get to basic

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,640
training you already know you feel it

35
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,409
but they actually have a fucking Eastern

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,728
Court and it's like to work at all cost

37
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,270
just for the greater good work

38
00:01:32,728 --> 00:01:40,179
regardless of what happens to you anyway

39
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:43,000
work selflessly without expectation

40
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,010
do right because doing right is what you

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,930
do go get the bad guys because they're

42
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,250
fucking hurting people like that's where

43
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:53,550
you know so life could be kind of like

44
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:56,289

I couldn't go to college like I at least

61

knew like I didn't want to just fuck up

62
00:02:46,229 --> 00:02:52,569
what I could do is join the military and

63
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:54,129
if I could join the military which my

64
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:56,319
family known in the world would ever

65
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:57,879
expect that you know I mean cuz they

66
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,519

consciously on say you know I'm gonna

73
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:17,530
fucking join the military and I'm gonna

74
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:20,680
try to do the hardest job that I can and

75
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:23,860
if I can do that I can do anything in

76
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,000
life like I swear my mom like that 17 18

77
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,480
years old man I had that conversation

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,620
where I'm like you know what fuck you

79
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,988
I'm gonna join the military and I'm

80
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:35,230
gonna make something of myself so that's

81
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:37,000
like what got me to basic training

82
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:39,729
and like got me through it was the

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,519
intestinal fortitude like that you know

84
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:45,818
what I'm not a loser I'm not going to be

85
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,709
what society has been saying you know to

86
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:50,979
me as you can I'm gonna make something

87
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:54,400
myself so my service for me you know

88
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:55,869
holds an invaluable fuckin place in my

89
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,810
heart and that's the thing for so many

90
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,879
vets it's it's so personal the reason we

91
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,709
enlists a lot of us most of us come from

92
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:05,768
broken homes and the broken communities

93
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:07,840
you know so it's like you know you give

94
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:25,389
that honor you know oh just say you know

95
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:27,038
what you know so when when you get the

96
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:29,889
fucking service you get the basic

97
00:04:27,038 --> 00:04:32,139
training you know like there's just this

98
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:34,750
like immediate understanding that that

99
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:37,530
person next to you like we're all about

100
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,000
to get the biggest mindfuck of our lives

101
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:42,879
we're about to all just go through

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,918
something crazy traumatic but you know

103
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,649
what we're all going through the same

104
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:50,288
amount of pain at the same time and

105
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:51,699
physically being there to pick each

106
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:54,759
other up when we're all being just

107
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:57,009
broken and like that's the whole thing

108
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,870
with veterans like it's not a sob story

109
00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:00,819
what I'm talking it's just real it's

110
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,579
just what it's like and there's been

111
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:06,250
like this coat of fucking we don't talk

112
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:08,560
about it you know out of services but

113
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,569
like that I had a Vietnam veteran Tommy

114
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,949
when I came home he's like Jose you need

115
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:13,959
to talk about your service he's like

116
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:15,550
because I didn't talk about it for 30

117
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:18,459
years and I'm fucked up and I watch this

118
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,560
man struggled as a vet before servo so

119
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:24,219
he's like listen you talk about it when

120
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:29,009
you're ready you know so this is my 15th

121
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:29,010
year home now you know but I found

122
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,699
I found through all the pain associated

123
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,800
with service you know the connection and

124
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:42,129
all that the things you experience in

125
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,050
combat that when we get out of service

126
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:45,520
we're very hard on ourselves you know

127
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,810
everything needs to be fucking perfect

128
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,788
and if our marriage ain't right the

129
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:51,009
whole fucking thing right because it has

130
00:05:48,788 --> 00:05:52,658
to be right the main that we have to be

131
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:54,449
able to figure it out you know and make

132
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:57,038
everything work and when we realize that

133
00:05:54,449 --> 00:06:00,819
that man on your left to your rights not

134
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:02,860
there you know it begins a struggle but

135
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,810
the thing with veterans is like we're

136
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:07,060
not mentally ill mentally strong we're

137
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:10,149
still here we're fighting a battle but

138
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:13,839
we think we don't matter we think that

139
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:15,609
all the shit that we've been through was

140
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,138
for nothing because we didn't do it for

141
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,300
the glory we didn't do it for the medals

142
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:21,430
it's beyond that but only if they

143
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,050
understand that so we lose hope in

144
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,199
ourselves but that's the biggest things

145
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:31,050
that's like look you know we all have a

146
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:34,240
story to tell and the reason I speak now

147
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,468
is to inspire that veteran that was just

148
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,168
like me thinking like the best

149
00:06:35,468 --> 00:06:44,528
alternative is just to end it all okay

150
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:47,799
you know like to be there and know you

151
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:51,158
want to die that bad but you won't do it

152
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,468
so you put the gun down you're

153
00:06:51,158 --> 00:06:54,879
consciously aware is like emotionally

154
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:56,528
you want to die but you know you don't

155
00:06:54,879 --> 00:07:00,610
want to leave your dog like okay fuck

156
00:06:56,528 --> 00:07:01,750
that you know you put the gun down what

157
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,020
happens after that

158
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:07,449
you're still faced with living the same

159
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:10,240
life that you had that pushed you to

160
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:14,288
want to kill yourself you have to figure

161
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,168
out a way to accept and understand that

162
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:19,658
this is your life now man like this is

163
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:22,240
where you're at right now it's not going

164
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:24,129
to get better tomorrow but you know what

165
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,560
I'm gonna do my best to fucking do it

166
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:32,189
cuz I don't want to die

167
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:34,560
and so right I and so my goal is to get

168
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:36,540
the vets who were right there who

169
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,699
already put the gun down but everyday

170
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,780
are still like I want to check out today

171
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,240
anyway

172
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:45,569
you know like look pause you know

173
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,569
there's 18 million of us out out of

174
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:51,000
service we can do some things together

175
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:52,819
where the private sector won't give you

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,680
a job because you're missing your limbs

177
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:57,509
we'll take care of each other you know

178
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,790
what I mean like that's the whole thing

179
00:07:57,509 --> 00:08:02,339
there's something healing about working

180
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,890
with plants I know that too and like

181
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:07,019
it's not just smoking together you know

182
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:09,240
join the fruits of our labor that can

183
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:12,539
excess you know but like learning how

184
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,639
the plants and the animals and you're

185
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,939
all part of that those systems and you

186
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,740
can play a role in effecting the

187
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:22,439
abundance that you reap you know is like

188
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:25,110
that stuff is powerful man and like I

189
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:26,879
don't have much experience you know

190
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,340
working with veterans per se but I'm

191
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,668
working with you know people with

192
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:34,500
disabilities I've seen amazing things

193
00:08:32,668 --> 00:08:38,269
like it just makes me happy it makes

194
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:41,099
everybody happy like working with good

195
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:43,500
regenerative soil practices seems to

196
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:44,129
have a positive impact on the spirit you

197
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,929
know

198
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:50,769
well that's the thing I can't come in

199
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:51,849
Florida that's the whole thing trying to

200
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:56,289
just rest

201
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:58,480
that's a lot that's why this is so huge

202
00:08:56,289 --> 00:09:00,458
right because I'm trying to create

203
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,430
initiatives right now because I

204
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:05,679
understand you know how much of a

205
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:08,379
life-saving tool this is but federally I

206
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:19,689
can I'm handcuffed but you know what

207
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:21,309
that doesn't mean today they encourage

208
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,470
you to have the conversation at the VA

209
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:26,619
with your doctor like their host and

210
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:30,570
they don't know that's so you know it

211
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:33,490
was thanks - it's backwards right now

212
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:37,180
you know so veterans like my sit like

213
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,919
myself I'm left - like right now I'm you

214
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:41,109
know establishing you know curriculum in

215
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:44,319
Florida I was telling you about it so my

216
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:46,509
goal is you know Hampus you're gonna be

217
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,290
able to put it yeah for a hemp license

218
00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:52,899
in Florida next month right so my mind

219
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:55,389
immediately went to okay how can I get

220
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:57,399
you know into this market it's legal now

221
00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:57,578
I'm gonna have the ability to fucking do

222
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:04,299
it

223
00:09:57,578 --> 00:10:06,129
okay what can I do to live like my my

224
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:07,958
virtue is hope happiness opportunity

225
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:10,299
purpose and empowerment like that's my

226
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:13,028
goal you know to provide to veterans

227
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:14,559
like that's my ethos personal ethos hope

228
00:10:13,028 --> 00:10:16,750
happiness because if you provide a

229
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,309
better with happiness that's given them

230
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,289
you know hope you know for an

231
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:21,669
opportunity now that opportunity is

232
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:24,909
given over purpose and now he's

233
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:26,528
empowered them so what can I do now so

234
00:10:24,909 --> 00:10:29,189
my mind immediately went to I want to

235
00:10:26,528 --> 00:10:33,309
put in for a HAMP license you know and

236
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:35,050
you know industrialized PEM Creek you

237
00:10:33,309 --> 00:10:38,500
know an installation to figure out a way

238
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:40,299
to build veteran homes but also and that

239
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,269
operation I want to work with a local

240
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:44,528
college or university to be able to

241
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:47,199
provide veterans that want to get

242
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:50,289
education at a degree in engineering or

243
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,470
AG whatever course curriculum there to

244
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:55,629
get college credits at our farm and then

245
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,490
create also certification program

246
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:59,919
doesn't want to go to get a degree he

247
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,169
can get certified at the farm eight to

248
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,328
12 weeks you know and now guess what

249
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:06,610
he's employable within the industries

250
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:08,888
and so what have we just done we have

251
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,389
provided a veteran with an empowerment

252
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:13,180
element that now it's giving him

253
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:16,870
education he's getting therapy just

254
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:19,179
through being a around medicine right

255
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:22,209
and now he's been getting towards and

256
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:23,799
coordinates within our own operation

257
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,119
or if he wants to go in the industry we

258
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:27,189
connect them with whoever but now you

259
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,039
have given a veteran that was supposed

260
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:34,029
to be disabled living off his shitty

261
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:35,620
disability now all of a sudden he's you

262
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:38,889
know built again because it's always

263
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:40,899
been be all you can be in army but what

264
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:44,019
about be all you can be when you're not

265
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:46,809
in the Army anymore where's the red tape

266
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:49,209
what's it going to take funding man like

267
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:51,250
that that's realistically I can have the

268
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:52,958
greatest ideas in the world you know

269
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,019
we're gonna have some fun you know so

270
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,369
honestly I've just kind of I can't say

271
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:59,679
the name of the college but I pitch to

272
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,629
college and they we've already kind of

273
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,088
put the first phase layer the curriculum

274
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:06,938
together you know to roll this out I've

275
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:08,800
you know so it's just been really been

276
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:10,929
finding someone who believes just as

277
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,539
much as me you know there's money to be

278
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:16,239
made everyone knows that the whole thing

279
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:18,669
is what is your goal when you get it and

280
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,680
what are you going to do with it so if

281
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:22,688
I'm coming into this to try to help you

282
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:24,789
do don't cross me in the process because

283
00:12:22,688 --> 00:12:26,769
I've had to learn a vicious lesson in

284
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:28,838
this industry there's a whole other side

285
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:31,539
there's a whole that people don't know

286
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:33,310
about you know that you really have to

287
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:35,740
figure out a way to stay in your lane

288
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:37,869
without selling yourself out knowing

289
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,688
that it's going to be a hard-ass journey

290
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,188
but I believe man is strong enough that

291
00:12:40,688 --> 00:12:43,899
you know I'm trying to create an

292
00:12:42,188 --> 00:12:45,399
ecosystem for veterans we've got two

293
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:47,438
hundred thousand coming out of service

294
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:50,198
every year we know that number did you

295
00:12:47,438 --> 00:12:54,549
call it an ecosystem yeah I'm trying to

296
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:55,659
create you know that hole because we're

297
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:57,698
killing ourselves like that's the whole

298
00:12:55,659 --> 00:12:59,110
thing like there's raw data it's known

299
00:12:57,698 --> 00:13:00,789
the government acknowledges we know

300
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,850
there's a veteran that

301
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:05,649
it's right now he's unsound and we don't

302
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:08,139
know where but he doesn't have to she

303
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:09,549
doesn't have to because we're you're

304
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:12,460
forgotten about out there you're not

305
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:13,629
forgotten about here and like I have you

306
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,639
know a daughter in the steps and my

307
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:18,009
daughter's gonna be seven my stepson is

308
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:19,120
going to be 18 next month you know at

309
00:13:18,009 --> 00:13:21,220
the end of the day man we're all going

310
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,519
to clock out you know whether we want to

311
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,139
or not

312
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,169
like I learned a lesson on death and

313
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:30,279
combat that dude there's dude even right

314
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:32,559
now you know so you you really you know

315
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:36,459
get to a point where you need to

316
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:38,199
understand that it's not about zeroes in

317
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,970
the bank account man yeah we can all

318
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,250
live a life you know whatever it's not

319
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,440
about all that what it's about is what

320
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,960
is your legacy what are you doing like

321

00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:53,320
runs out tonight that my daughter you

323
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,389

324
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,340
my father stood for something he stood

325
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:59,679
for humanity and that's what I want for

what you're saying is let's just let it

332
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:22,810
grow because if it has one more day or

333
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,660
two more days or fucking ten more years

334
00:14:22,809 --> 00:14:31,479
or who knows we live in the weird

335
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:35,079
- right let's live that day and the

336
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:39,670
plants want the same thing and so you're

337
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:43,060
connecting a whole ecosystem right and

338
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:47,860
so the intent that you bring to your

339
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:52,509
grow no matter how big sets the stage

340
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:55,330
and how you start alright so how are we

341
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:59,620
gonna let these plants grow we're gonna

342
00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:02,860
pump them full of salt right and then

343
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:11,549
you go wait a minute I'm not wanting to

344
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:11,550
grow like that and so this ecosystem

345
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:18,870
you've talked about education you talked

346
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:22,759
about agriculture right you've talked

347
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:28,948
about opportunities and Kealing

348
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:30,120
employment purpose healing that's that's

349
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:31,889
that's the whole thing

350
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,409
it's a wheat we're we're so on to

351
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:37,320
something and veterans have there's 18

352
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:39,929
million of us and it's like if you

353
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:43,410
really think about that number and so

354
00:15:39,929 --> 00:15:47,879
many of us are so doped up that we don't

355
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:49,679
even realize that the value we have and

356
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,820
that's what what's the heartbreak in

357
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,370
this whole thing it's like the

358
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:56,430
government you know I've been blessed to

359
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:59,269
be here as a speaker and I've spoken the

360
00:15:56,429 --> 00:16:03,120
us have like Lobby I do all that stuff

361
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:08,850
because at the end of the day what is

362
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:10,919
wrong is like I learned that in war like

363
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:13,079
I think that's the whole thing like in

364
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:16,620
in the shittiest places I learned the

365
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:19,349
most valuable of lessons that right is

366
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,448
right and when you're wrong you just own

367
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:24,060
you're wrong and you'll be okay and

368
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:25,889
that's the only thing I've wanted the

369
00:16:24,059 --> 00:16:27,419
government fucking to do is say you know

370
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:29,578
what you can't change

371
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:31,799
yesterday we you did to the Native

372
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:33,239
Americans you know we can't go back in

373
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:34,198
time but we can make a conscious choice

374
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,500
today

375
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:39,509
Lemar okay baby right now that's right

376
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:44,208
and my whole beef has always been like

377
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:49,828
why keep 18 million veterans unaware of

378
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:52,018
their true value to this country you

379
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:54,149
know make these men and women aware so

380
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:58,019
they don't want to die at the end of the

381
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:59,850
day man like when you like like I've

382
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:03,089
nearly taken my my life at a number of

383
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:04,828
times it you know one of the most

384
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,350

I mean the plants been here for 3,000

466
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:26,298
years for a reason we have an

467
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:28,850
endocannabinoid system for a reason you

468
00:20:26,298 --> 00:20:30,259
know and it's like let's just understand

469
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:33,019
that it's going to take a lot of work

470
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:36,558
but it's up to you you meet all of us to

471
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:37,970
do it the right way if you do it and you

472
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,819

just do the right thing and that's

476
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:50,389
that's those come from like when you

477
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:53,359
enlist in the military you know veterans

478
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:56,780
the army we have our core values loyalty

479
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:59,418
Duty respect selfless service honor

480
00:20:56,779 --> 00:21:01,819
integrity and personal courage you know

481
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:04,880
I mean like and those are you know

482
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:06,379
ingrained in us in basic training let

483
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,020
alone you go to combat you get to the

484
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,309
point where you know you're willing to

485
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:13,429
die for your country you know like

486
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:15,200
there's a liberation in that moment that

487
00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:16,610
you just you know you make peace with

488
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,769
your I made peace with my maker out

489
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:20,000
there understand like this is what it is

490
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:21,950
there are bad people doing bad things

491
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,619
here regardless of what the government

492
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:29,419
initiative is if I see I'm here to stop

493
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:30,959
evil my job is it's my job and there is

494
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:34,980
such a

495
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,169
beauty in living your truth that you

496
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,819
know when like I used to just look at

497
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:42,270
the flag on my arm and just thank God

498
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:46,019
look at you know in combat because you

499
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:47,369
get to a point where at least for me I'm

500
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:48,240
a field artillery better and you know

501
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:51,359
it's our job

502
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,269
you know most it up and seeking the sure

503
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:56,459
that you know and we were tasked with

504
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:58,048
securing Baghdad so we did more infantry

505
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,019
operations than anything raised and all

506
00:21:58,048 --> 00:22:03,480
that stuff and you get to a point where

507
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:06,048
death it's it's just you know quick-draw

508
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:10,288
man at the end of the day it's 50/50 and

509
00:22:06,048 --> 00:22:13,019
you also realize that the brother next

510
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:16,648
to you if anything there assists are

511
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:20,548
next to anything was to be put in that

512
00:22:16,648 --> 00:22:23,819
person's way of harm that giving your

513
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:27,269
life for that person like is naughty

514
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:30,869
it's it's just that's what's so hard for

515
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:32,519
veterans to articulate is that that bond

516
00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:35,009
is so real that like if there's a

517
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:39,119
grenade and you see it rolling towards

518
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:41,669
you there there's just there's it's it's

519
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,209
done it's yes it's like it's already

520
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:50,340
done like it's just at that point and

521
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:53,190
die for you bro and so that love you

522
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:54,689
know that's why when we like you ever

523
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:58,259
want to see a grown man cry fill his

524
00:22:54,690 --> 00:23:02,070
brother in combat goes that's a pain you

525
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:05,000
know that never goes away and so when we

526
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:10,009
come back we're confused

527
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,589
because warriors don't cry yeah we you

528
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:15,319
know you know I mean because we're human

529
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:18,709
and so it's getting the veteran to

530
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:22,339
understand that just because you're not

531
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:24,200
valued by your country as you should be

532
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:26,658
warrior right like thousands of years

533
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,788
ago you know you would come home and you

534
00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:30,919
would have land and you would have you

535
00:23:28,788 --> 00:23:32,390
know things you'd be set for life

536
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:34,880
you'd be gilded whatever the case may be

537
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:38,000
but now you know there is that doesn't

538
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,380
exist but it can we know there's two

539
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,319
hundred thousand veterans coming out of

540
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:45,140
service let's create as many operations

541
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:48,819
as possible to make sure that if the

542
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:51,620
private sector won't hire no cares

543
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:54,460
create you know proud hempcrete that's

544
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:57,019
why I want how am I gonna help reduce

545
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:59,840
you know the veteran homeless issue

546
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:02,269
let's build some asses let's get it done

547
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:02,990
and then that connects to that as well

548
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:05,869
right

549
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:09,980
and let's and you leverage like when I

550
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:12,048
go to go to DC or I go to Tallahassee

551
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:15,349
and I speak to these lots it for the

552
00:24:12,048 --> 00:24:16,609
lawmakers and stuff you know I just put

553
00:24:15,349 --> 00:24:19,788
it too in black and white I said listen

554
00:24:16,609 --> 00:24:21,259
guys I'm here not for me I'm here with a

555
00:24:19,788 --> 00:24:22,788
bunch of veterans on my back you don't

556
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:24,349
see they're being ignored so when I'm

557
00:24:22,788 --> 00:24:27,408
coming to talk to these politicians I

558
00:24:24,349 --> 00:24:29,329
said look at the end of the day this is

559
00:24:27,409 --> 00:24:31,820
a rights from right from wrong issue man

560
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:34,308
and you need to explain to me why right

561
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:36,740
now you'll make it available for

562
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:40,269
veterans to go get a narcotic but they

563
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:43,339
still can't get medical cannabis so I

564
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:44,119
say look you support me and you support

565
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:47,269
what I'm fighting for

566
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:48,918
or you're turning your back and that's

567
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:50,779
the leverage we have to put on them and

568
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:52,880
that's why I love all them see you

569
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:54,500
basically you hold them accountable at

570
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,510
the end of the day you have influence

571
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,429
that I don't and there are people that

572
00:24:56,509 --> 00:25:00,950
are suffering and they can't be here to

573
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:02,330
tell you that so are you willing to make

574
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,730
the change or not and don't give me a

575
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:07,129
political response give me the real yes

576
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:11,298
or no that's it and that's what they

577
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:13,419
feel but we're here today you're doing

578
00:25:11,298 --> 00:25:13,418
it

579
00:25:17,648 --> 00:25:22,518
so we got to do it's too late we're

580
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:25,699
entering a new decade like if you think

581
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:27,709
about like the trajectory of what's

582
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,019
going on right there just like a

583
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:31,190
subculture that has just pretty much

584
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:33,769
gotten to a point where we can really

585
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:36,798
make some influence and we can do some

586
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:39,588
things the misfits made a you know what

587
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,249
I mean in a way and so heading into a

588
00:25:39,588 --> 00:25:42,829
new decade

589
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:44,899
let's already start on you know this

590
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:47,509
decade in the last decades man have been

591
00:25:44,898 --> 00:25:49,819
pretty bad why don't we just start the

592
00:25:47,509 --> 00:25:51,919
new one just crushing it already

593
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:53,598
establishing we've always had the

594
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,589
opportunity to be the next greatest

595
00:25:53,598 --> 00:25:59,028
generation you know we're educated we've

596
00:25:57,588 --> 00:26:01,158
educated ourselves you know how to use

597
00:25:59,028 --> 00:26:03,229
the internet we can just go away so

598
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:06,829
we're not dumb you know the smoke and

599
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:09,739
mirrors effect is gone for them and now

600
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:11,628
it's up to us yeah I think we know and

601
00:26:09,739 --> 00:26:14,239
they the thing is now it's like it's

602
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:16,608
openly like just chaos it's like this is

603
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:19,069
what it is guys sorry at least you know

604
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:22,189
we're attempting to cover shit up but

605
00:26:19,069 --> 00:26:24,319
yeah it's pretty bad and that's what

606
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:27,019
should motivate you know that's just as

607
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:27,528

00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,398
journey more about altruism and wanting

620
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:06,320
