Brian Chaplin founder of medicine box we

3
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:12,119
make mindful medicine through the wisdom

4
00:00:09,029 --> 00:00:15,119
of cannabis our product is a tincture

5
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:18,210
that's a sleep elixir by the name of

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:20,969
equanimity my definition of equanimity

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:22,618
is remaining cool calm collected when a

8
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:25,049
person place or thing is triggering me

9
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:26,910
and everyone has a different

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,969
representation of what equanimity means

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,000
them in the scientific world we hear

12
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:36,000
homeostasis or equilibrium this

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,920
particular product that we make has

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,009
blended with chamomile lemon balm catnip

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:48,719
skullcap musa acuminata which is a

16
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:50,369
vitamin b6 and tryptophan so tryptophan

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,739
converts your serotonin while you sleep

18
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:54,959
and then we blend that with a specific

19
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:59,689
cultivar that's grown out of Nevada

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:04,409
County California we have a local co-op

21
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:07,859
in Nevada County Sun grown Cirrus Sun

22
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,439
grown co-op they have 45,000 square feet

23
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,840
of canopy space and in Nevada County the

24
00:01:10,438 --> 00:01:16,519
maximum square footage of canopy is

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:20,490
10,000 square feet so all very craft

26
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:21,629
boutique artisanal farmers born and

27
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,329
raised

28
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:27,750
men of medicine boxes values as

29
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:29,548
collaboration with our community so we

30
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,938
are providing them with our specific

31
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:36,979
genetics we provide the genetics as the

32
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:39,548
brand to the to the polite to the coop

33
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:42,009
where are you

34
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:44,390
those genetics have been passed down

35
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:46,909
through the wisdom of cannabis in Nevada

36
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,789
County okay yeah it's a specific

37
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:58,789
cultivar that landed up on the North San

38
00:01:49,789 --> 00:02:04,789
Juan Ridge around 1974 it does it was

39
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:08,840
yeah there was a so yeah we use full

40
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:10,909
spectrum extract and we blend that with

41
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,759
the other synergistic girls that makes

42
00:02:10,909 --> 00:02:16,159
make makes a very very potent sleep

43
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:18,500
elixir so the concoction was created

44
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,750
just really following the mission and

45
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,840
that intuitive guidance of Medicine box

46
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:26,209
which is blending science with the

47
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,680
practical wisdom of cannabis when I say

48
00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,769
practical wisdom that's all the

49
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,129
anecdotal experience and the knowledge

50
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:37,640
that's been passed down way before prop

51
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:39,709
60 for 40 50 60 years thousands of years

52
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:41,958
with indigenous cultures and that

53
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:44,539
knowledge has been consistently passed

54
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:46,549
down and we all know experience turns

55
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,030
into knowledge knowledge turns into

56
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:50,269
wisdom

57
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:52,969
so we're blending the science and the

58
00:02:50,269 --> 00:03:02,930
wisdom of cannabis with our cannabis

59
00:02:52,969 --> 00:03:06,189
culture absolutely absolutely so the

60
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:10,090
amount of R&amp;D that we've done has been

61
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:14,780
it's been a couple years I brought on a

62
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:17,989
PhD plant scientist from Israel to help

63
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,519
formulate and this isn't just throwing a

64
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:22,789
bunch of herbs and some you know

65
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,259
full-spectrum cannabis in a pot mixing

66
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:30,349
it up over grandma stove this was actual

67
00:03:26,259 --> 00:03:32,798
specific ratios and combinations of the

68
00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:36,348
herbs and their absorption rates and

69
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,140
then a lot of experience all data that

70
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:41,629
we've

71
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:44,849
and handing out to people as we know

72
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:49,829
there is no real blanket umbrella

73
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:52,409
approach to treating people or helping

74
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,150
them sleep everyone has a little bit of

75
00:03:52,409 --> 00:03:57,780
different experience as I like to say

76
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,670
every body is different and everybody is

77
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,689
different it's not a one size fits all

78
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:05,339
so there will be that variation on a

79
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:08,520
little bit of trial and error to figure

80
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,849
out what dose properly works for you

81
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,890
and it might take 2-3 times but again

82
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:16,079
back to that mission statement is

83
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:18,358
mindful medicine through the wisdom of

84
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,480
cannabis a tincture would be sublingual

85
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:25,339
okay we prefer to use a sublingual as

86
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:28,439
dosed by one dropper is 10 milligrams

87
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:29,189
okay 10 milligram between 5 and 10

88
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,490
milligrams

89
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:34,769
what the majority of our consumers or

90
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,960
patients that have taken that find that

91
00:04:34,769 --> 00:04:39,810
between 5 and 10 milligrams is the

92
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:43,109
optimal dose for sleep anything under

93
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:46,410
that between 1 and 3 milligrams as a

94
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:49,050
micro dose can really help calm the

95
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,700
central nervous system during the day

96
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:54,509
and you're not going to get drowsy

97
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:56,879
anything over that 3 to 5 milligram

98
00:04:54,509 --> 00:04:57,689
threshold you may as well sit down and

99
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,610
take a siesta

100
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:01,560
we're selling sleep we're not really

101
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:08,220
selling the tincture we're selling sleep

102
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:10,819
but anxiety as a sleepless life I sleep

103
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,830
it is that the anxiety is a sleepless

104
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:15,959
person's worst nightmare pun intended

105
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:18,180
they go hand in hand it's like staying

106
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:20,489
in the beach things people with riddled

107
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,350
with anxiety ruminate on their thoughts

108
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,530
when they lay in bed they can't sleep

109
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:28,860
they don't they don't get a good night's

110
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:31,709
rest the next day they're filled with

111
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,370
anxiety cognitive functions off their

112
00:05:31,709 --> 00:05:37,409
homeostasis is off they're not in

113
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,478
equanimity when we're in equanimity we

114
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,520
show up for ourselves we show up for our

115
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:42,409
loved ones we show up for our business

116
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:44,329
partners

117
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:46,820
if an employer is selling academic I'm

118
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:51,109
selling equanimity huh and some and for

119
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:52,699
me equanimity was my mentors this is a

120
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,800
really good piece of culture here

121
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:57,490
my mentor Michael Hollister god bless

122
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,280
him he passed away with cancer last year

123
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:04,430
he was 52 years in the cannabis industry

124
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,169
as a breeder and medicine maker and he

125
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,560
passed down a lot of his wisdom to me

126
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:12,560
which I was able to formulate and then

127
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:15,110
take like Frodo Baggins and some Mordor

128
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,120
right and to Mordor with what the

129
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:21,319
industry is Mordor right now and I feel

130
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:24,709
like Frodo Baggins and be able to really

131
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:25,639
blend the science with that so I owe a

132
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:28,009
lot to him

133
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:31,969
and that's part of that wisdom of

134
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:34,819
cannabis that's been passed down and it

135
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:38,660
helped me personally as the founder I'm

136
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:41,779
a recovering alcoholic drug addict that

137
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:45,070
celebrated seven years of sobriety on

138
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:50,209
the 9th of September and my physician

139
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:53,540
prescribed me an SSRI two years in peaks

140
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:55,789
and valleys peaks and valleys a little

141
00:06:53,540 --> 00:07:00,200
SSRI by the name Prozac I didn't know

142
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:03,950
any better I was on Prozac for about a

143
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:07,729
year and a half and my mentor and I used

144
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:11,149
this blend of equanimity and another CBD

145
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:13,240
high CBD ratio blend that we'll be

146
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:16,549
bringing into market next year in

147
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:20,769
combination to transition me off of

148
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:24,170
SSRIs CBD isolate verse coal plant

149
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:28,639
completely different beasts Copeland as

150
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:30,960
a full spectrum blend furthering the

151
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:37,620
science behind this

152
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:40,859
is this massive trend CBD ghetto right

153
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:44,629
coming from hemp with all this deceptive

154
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:48,509
marketing practices full-spectrum

155
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:51,899
isolate full-spectrum hemp 300

156
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:54,810
milligrams of cannabinoids hold on 300

157
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:59,189
milligrams of cannabinoids is clurel CBD

158
00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:01,530
isolate is singular compound all right

159
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:04,199
so whole plant medicine when I say whole

160
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:06,239
plant we don't use the trim we use the

161
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,288
whole flower we use the tops of

162
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,930
sun-grown

163
00:08:07,288 --> 00:08:17,219
flower and soil Sun and water we use the

164
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:20,840
tops so we get the full spectrum range

165
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,840
of cannabinoids and terpenoids

166
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:29,699
there is one particular genetic that has

167
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:32,129
a beautiful combination now I'll get

168
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:35,278
into some combinations of specific

169
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:40,469
terpenes mercele in a little visible

170
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:44,610
abetik roughly it also has a nice ratio

171
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:48,180
of CBN CBN in combination with THC is an

172
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:53,070
extremely effective sedative two and a

173
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:56,879
half to five milligrams a CBN see pill

174
00:08:53,070 --> 00:09:01,070
labs of the study is as effective as 5

175
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:04,679
to 10 milligrams of diazepam all right

176
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:06,660
however the rare cannabinoids have to be

177
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:08,909
in combination together for them to

178
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:11,639
effectively work so let's go back to the

179
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:16,919
CBD isolate ghetto first the whole plant

180
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:18,328
okay CBD just take CBD in your your all

181
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:20,949
your problems will go away

182
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:25,179
no no CBD

183
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:30,700
is an antagonist which means it does it

184
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:34,120
only binds your cb1 receptor THC is an

185
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:37,810
agonist which activates your cb1

186
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,870
receptor THC the cannabinoid that Co

187
00:09:37,809 --> 00:09:43,049
mingles with your synapses your

188
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:46,179
presynaptic and your postsynaptic

189
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:48,759
actually acts as a key and unlocks your

190
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:51,909
cb1 receptor or in laymen terms

191
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:54,250
it's the lubricant I like to say tea a

192
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:58,240
little bit of teach see is the lubricant

193
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:01,330
to unlock that cb1 receptor so all the

194
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,730
other cannabinoids and herbs and terpene

195
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:07,139
profile can come in and work its magic

196
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:10,470
in your endocannabinoid system cb1

197
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:15,129
receptor as your central nervous system

198
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:17,759
that helps regulate your sleep your mood

199
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:20,759
and bring you back into homeostasis or

200
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,759
equanimity

201
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:29,170
I like to live my life in like Venn

202
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,209
diagrams a little bit so let's take a

203
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:36,659
simple Venn diagram here's the cannabis

204
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:39,939
industry but over 20 billion by 2022

205
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:43,778
here's the sleep industry right here

206
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:48,750
here's a cross over sleep industries 50

207
00:10:43,778 --> 00:10:54,929
billion plus the same year our product

208
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:54,929
sleep industry anywhere from mattresses

209
00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:03,899
apps on your phone

210
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:09,989
white noise makers fans bedding curtains

211
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:13,929
noisemakers herbal things essential oils

212
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:17,379
anything like that sleep it's an

213
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:19,899
epidemic right now we live the lack of

214
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:22,208
sleep is an academic which translates

215
00:11:19,899 --> 00:11:24,519
into more anxiety more anxiety

216
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:27,489
translates into lack of sleep

217
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,019
it's a bitches cycle and then as an

218
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:32,139
entrepreneur in the cannabis space

219
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:35,110
there's too many pressures and there's

220
00:11:32,139 --> 00:11:39,039
too many people places and things that

221
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:41,318
knock us off balance so again the very

222
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:44,318
thing that we're all going for in the

223
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:46,838
cannabis industry we forget it's the

224
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:48,698
very thing that can help us and that's

225
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:51,550
what I'm all about being of service to

226
00:11:48,698 --> 00:11:53,740
others and helping people have a more

227
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:56,740
holistic lifestyle through practical

228
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:59,049
wisdom that's it and if people are

229
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,180
getting off they're ambience and they're

230
00:11:59,049 --> 00:12:03,969
prozac's and there's olaf's and there's

231
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:06,219
annexes at the same time we're winning

232
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,589
we're all winning okay

233
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:11,920
ambien is a hypnotic so you don't get in

234
00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:16,720
that REM you need to get into your REM

235
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:19,269
sleep so you dream right when we dream

236
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,089
we create

237
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:23,649
Google was created through a dream how

238
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:26,920
many great inventions are created from

239
00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:30,639
dreaming and sleep sleep is something

240
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:33,149
that people it's an afterthought right

241
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,708
like let's look through the lens of

242
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:37,629
sleep and wellness and that's what

243
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:40,299
that's what medicine Marx is doing with

244
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:42,970
this very niche product the amount of

245
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:45,870
people that I know that don't know how

246
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:48,910
to sleep well are looking for solutions

247
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:52,149
right they don't want to be on ambien

248
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:54,819
right my my friend's grandmother was

249
00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:58,169
trying to get off ambien and is using

250
00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:00,459
this product to help with that okay I

251
00:12:58,169 --> 00:13:02,679
want to get back to the euphoria with

252
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:04,659
teeth you asked about the you forum glad

253
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:07,569
you asked about that again that's like

254
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:11,829
the let's use the spoonful of sugar

255
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:16,660
analogy again okay and not CBD but THC

256
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:19,300
if you just take THC alone or just we

257
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:21,969
know it as distill it right you were

258
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:25,059
going to get high all right we don't use

259
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:28,060
distiller distill it you take everything

260
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:29,739
out of that to get the THC and it's not

261
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:32,889
about getting high

262
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:35,649
it's about getting well okay a little

263
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:37,480
bit of euphoria we don't need to be

264
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:39,669
scared about people don't need to be

265
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,500
scared about a little bit of euphoria

266
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:43,958
are you that you for a phobia that's

267
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:47,169
going on CBD good it doesn't get you

268
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:52,689
high THC bad it gets you high no it's

269
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:56,799
not CBD verse THC it's CBD in THC they

270
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:59,950
are friends okay a little bit of THC in

271
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:02,439
our product it's actually it's actually

272
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:06,070
the highest concentration concentrated

273
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:09,339
cannabinoid in this specific product but

274
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,540
it works well with the CBD the CBG and

275
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:14,110
the CBN

276
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:17,250
and when you're sleeping again let's

277
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:20,620
think about like when we were children

278
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:24,250
right we're just called big kids right

279
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:26,950
our mom or dad or someone or grandmother

280
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:31,120
on they would lullaby us to sleep

281
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:33,390
what's THC do a little bit of THC gives

282
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,899
you a little bit of that euphoria

283
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:40,509
that's a lullaby it's a lullaby THC is a

284
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:44,769
little let's not be scared or euphoric

285
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:47,019
feeling and again CBD is psychotropic

286
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:49,509
anything that changes your brain can

287
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,860
chemistry is considered psychotropic so

288
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:53,319
there's a lot of that to set the

289
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:58,050
marketing going out there and CBD

290
00:14:53,320 --> 00:15:01,260
doesn't help you sleep CBD does there's

291
00:14:58,049 --> 00:15:06,779
there's being marketed and sold as sleep

292
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:09,730
CBD is more of a stimulating cannabinoid

293
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:14,909
then and that does not help you sleep

294
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:17,830
it's it's it's a it's contradictory so

295
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:19,899
CBD isolate blended with a little

296
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:22,530
lavender and they can say it helps with

297
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:26,709
sleep that to me is a very lackluster

298
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:29,110
generic shit product and it could help

299
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:33,490
you sleep and the specific cultivar that

300
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:38,830
we use as it is in indica and it is bred

301
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:44,289
from Afghan indica that came from India

302
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:46,420
in 1972 that's the wisdom of cannabis

303
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:48,459
right there and the wisdom of cannabis

304
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:51,879
also has open source I mean these

305
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:55,120
breeders they they worked these seeds up

306
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:59,559
and down the coast of California up to

307
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,740
British Columbia down to Mexico and just

308
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:06,689
like wines have specific Appalachians

309
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:09,610
those specific that's landrace genetic

310
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,450
adapted to those Appalachians to those

311
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:13,528
Roma condition

312
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:16,930
there and Grass Valley in Nevada County

313
00:16:13,528 --> 00:16:19,809
the elevation that is at between 1200

314
00:16:16,929 --> 00:16:22,259
from the valley floor up to 3000 feet

315
00:16:19,809 --> 00:16:26,979
the amount of sun exposure that we get

316
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:28,778
hot hot hot summers mild wet winters

317
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:32,500
just like the Mediterranean climate

318
00:16:28,778 --> 00:16:37,889
it grows specifically well there so we

319
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:41,139
use a localized cultivar and a local

320
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:43,919
manufactured product that is distributed

321
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:43,919
throughout the state

322
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,200
no one ever said this was going to be

323
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:55,070
easy you know and getting getting

324
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:58,790
medicine to people that don't even know

325
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:02,060
they need medicine it's been it's been

326
00:16:58,789 --> 00:17:04,039
really rewarding it's been stressful I

327
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:07,819
use my own product

328
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:09,319
the politics of Grass Valley I have to

329
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,720
give a shout out to the avada County

330
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:17,389
cannabis Alliance I was a former board

331

that kind of a measure w the Nevada

334
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:30,100
County cannabis Alliance was formed to

335
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:33,560
overturn that ban and within two years

336
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:36,649
we voted in a new ordinance okay there

337
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:40,690

practical wisdom and holistic lifestyle

373
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:56,520
we do yeah and the reason why we didn't

374
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:59,160
go with multiple products I really

375
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:02,009
wanted to focus in and laser in on that

376
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,048
niche again we're selling sleep we're

377
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:06,679
not selling cannabis or a tincture we're

378
00:20:04,048 --> 00:20:09,839
selling sleep cannabis is really that

379
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:12,210
evolving medium that weaves it all

380
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,849
together and medicine box

381
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:18,120
it's a binder you know it's like

382
00:20:14,849 --> 00:20:20,548
cannabis is the is that thread that

383
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:22,259
pulls it all together and it's not just

384
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:26,279
the herbs

385
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:29,069
it's it's a lifestyle so medicine box

386
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:31,379
really is what's in your box of Medicine

387
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:33,990
what is if you opened up your tool box

388
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,360
and dumped it at your feet what are

389
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:40,048
those tools that you use to heal

390
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:43,319
yourself or stay whole or in equanimity

391
00:20:40,048 --> 00:20:46,168
day to day my initial calling are the

392
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:49,139
vision for medicine box was that the

393
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:51,390
majority of human beings across the

394
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,970
globe would replace the traditional

395
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,049
contents of their medicine cabinets with

396
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,690
the cannabis health and wellness

397
00:20:55,048 --> 00:21:00,480
supplement or sit and meditate or do

398
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:03,390
Qigong or walk in nature or be an

399
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,970
advocate for the plan right or recover

400
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:12,720
from drugs alcohol harmful relationships

401
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:15,779
physical you know all of it hold it it's

402
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:20,039
a it's a it's a holistic lifestyle and

403
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:21,808
that is the that's the truth that we're

404
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,668
really trying to bring to the table and

405
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:27,899
yeah you can say cannabis helps you

406
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:29,190
sleep but again like is it smoking a

407
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,710
joint taking a bong hit

408
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:35,519
taking a DAB rubbing a topical eating a

409
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:39,870
Nevel what what is the specific product

410
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:42,329
that's really going to make an effect on

411
00:21:39,869 --> 00:21:45,239
a wide range of people and that's a

412
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:46,859
product that we created i've bootstrap

413
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,039
this whole venture and I'll continue

414
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:51,750
bootstrapping it and we finally it's

415
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:53,000

416
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:56,039

418
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,990
that big win right

419
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:03,089
we finally have a fully licensed

420
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:06,179
compliant product through a licensed

421
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:07,659
manufacturing facility in Nevada City we

422
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:10,810
did a 5,000 unit

423
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:13,900
right very attractive product very

424
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:16,839
attractive brand got brought on to a

425
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:19,180
distributor in Santa Rosa through a

426
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:20,500
friend in the cannabis industry and an

427
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,740
associate that I built a relationship

428
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:26,710
with again the alignment was there the

429
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:29,319
mission the values were there very

430
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:33,340
gravitated towards the product signed us

431
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:37,179
on after a 30-day negotiation okay they

432
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:40,599
represent 150 stores astronomical

433
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:42,430
service fee for distribution hey it's a

434
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:45,609
pay-to-play they have the relationships

435
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:48,340
you know you're gonna get us get us in a

436
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:51,009
tenant 1020 percent of those stores by

437
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:55,379
the end of q4 I'm good with that I don't

438
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:55,379
need to be in all of them six weeks

439
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:04,409
two stores in six weeks so enter turmoil

440
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:09,659
and conflict with the internal startup

441
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:20,730
team and the Canadian food company that

442
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:23,190
acquired them before I knew they had

443
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:27,420
Canadian funding I didn't know the

444
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:29,789
details of all of that everything's

445
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,920
really warm and fuzzy and chummy and

446
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:34,559
we're negotiating we're doing a good

447
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:37,259
great job negotiating doing our due

448
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,750
diligence 5,000 units that was our

449
00:23:37,259 --> 00:23:45,829
proof-of-concept run they have a full

450
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:50,789
sales team bulla Geist --ax they carry

451
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:54,329
several other internal brands we are a

452
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:58,289
third party brand okay so as a third

453
00:23:54,329 --> 00:24:03,119
party brand we kind of just stood alone

454
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:06,420
on the side street right and Canadian

455
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:08,429
company trying to run a California

456
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:13,190
cannabis company without giving

457
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:16,410
themselves the proper time to understand

458
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:20,250
the principles and personalities of

459
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:21,769
California cannabis okay and I can have

460
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:26,069
some compassion

461
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:29,519
but then my patience runs dry okay so

462
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:31,649
what happened getting any company

463
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,960
acquires and starts pushing around the

464
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:36,259
internal startup scene what's happening

465
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,259
over here

466
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:42,210
one year one year one year yeah we say

467
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:43,829
one year but the the fractionated

468
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:46,319
coconut oil acts as a preservative

469
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:48,960
anybody can sit they can't sit for two

470
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,609
years my brain can't sit for two years

471
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,808
I need be make important momentum

472
00:24:50,609 --> 00:24:56,490
involving okay so a lot of drama

473
00:24:54,808 --> 00:25:01,259
happened in the airdrome royal inner

474
00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:04,710
turmoil for timing but what did it do a

475
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:06,950
little bit of chaos bomb as enough

476
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:10,019
entrepreneur and keep you on your toes

477
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:13,069
and we're pivoting and we're maneuvering

478
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:16,379
and we'll see what happens

479
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:19,740
we negotiated non-exclusivity that's

480
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:23,070
what took 30 days so we can go with

481
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,480
another distributor and any seeing

482
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:27,089
localize what I've learned through the

483
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,970
process is seeing localized in your

484
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:33,139
local community as part of our value and

485
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:33,140
teaming up together

486
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:46,859
yeah yeah it's turbulence you know it's

487
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:51,339
like we sat on the runway for 30 days

488
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:54,250
negotiating right we finally take off

489
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:56,349
the runway and we hit this momentum but

490
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,759
we expend we have experienced turbulence

491
00:25:56,349 --> 00:26:05,288
and we haven't even hit cruising

492
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:06,638
altitude yet the original person that

493
00:26:05,288 --> 00:26:11,109
brought me in was their global brand

494
00:26:06,638 --> 00:26:17,678
manager and the CEO of the acquiring

495
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:20,229
company fired him because he was

496
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:24,990
speaking up on behalf of the brand that

497
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:29,169
he brought in on customer service so

498
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:31,359
instead of sitting down like that so

499
00:26:29,169 --> 00:26:35,560
much that

500
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:38,139
I'm my control saying saying in

501
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:40,629
equanimity the best I can write and

502
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:44,560
trying to preserve the relationships

503
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:45,970
that I have and I just saw the CEO of

504
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,159
that company and I looked him in the

505
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:52,690
eyes and I said through this whole

506
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:55,779
process it's humbled me and I realized I

507
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:58,590
wouldn't trade my problems for your

508
00:26:55,779 --> 00:27:01,779
problems right now and we can hug it out

509
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:03,909
because we're homies and we came from

510
00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:04,960
the underground world the cannabis and

511
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:07,269
there's not going to be any hard

512
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,529
feelings so but this the guy who sold

513
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:11,950
his company yeah

514
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:14,710
and he's he's working hard at leveling

515
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:18,309
the playing field with it with his

516
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:22,690
startup team and the kidney and the

517
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:24,639
Canadians so I learned a lot through

518
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:27,220
that process but what did it do it

519
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,650
toughened me up and it made me realize

520
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,769
that I can be in control of my own

521
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,769
destiny

522
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:42,009
oh yeah one of my best friend's his his

523
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:46,089
babe is an extract company his

524
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:48,549
distributor yeah

525
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:50,769
it's happening the distributors are

526
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:53,829
trying to push out the little guys and

527
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:56,109
it's it's a it's a tactic like let's

528
00:27:53,829 --> 00:27:57,579
annoy them let's shadow band now let's

529
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:59,589
not give them the customer service

530
00:27:57,579 --> 00:28:03,009
representation that they deserve and

531
00:27:59,589 --> 00:28:05,679
hopefully they get so frustrated that

532
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:08,348
they just quit I'm not gonna quit you're

533
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:16,129
not gonna see me quit

534
00:28:08,348 --> 00:28:20,868
I am yeah or sit down it's all out on

535
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:22,908
the table now I do it's part of that

536
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:25,189
yeah we have representation in their

537
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:28,609
booth and I'm also here to network and

538
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:32,330
do this I've been talking to some other

539
00:28:28,608 --> 00:28:35,778
distributors yeah and it'll be by the

540
00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:38,298
time this comes out well I think all the

541
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:40,368
distributors came in and realized you

542
00:28:38,298 --> 00:28:42,378
know let's get the distribution license

543
00:28:40,368 --> 00:28:47,928
let's try to control the supply chain

544
00:28:42,378 --> 00:28:49,759
let's make all the money right let's we

545
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:52,879
don't care about bringing on brands in

546
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:56,509
my opinion Hall of flowers is here to

547
00:28:52,878 --> 00:28:58,398
showcase brands ultimately brands will

548
00:28:56,509 --> 00:29:01,578
have all the equity and the cannabis

549
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:04,058
space distributors need brands just as

550
00:29:01,578 --> 00:29:06,769
much as brands need distributors and

551
00:29:04,058 --> 00:29:09,618
brands also need a supply healthy supply

552
00:29:06,769 --> 00:29:12,429
chain retailers and the retailers you

553
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:17,449
know they're the end of the supply chain

554
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:22,548
they need brands to and I wholeheartedly

555
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:26,899
believe in my mind in my heart that the

556
00:29:22,548 --> 00:29:29,538
retailers and five years will be the

557
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:34,848
wooby wellness dispensaries it's where

558
00:29:29,538 --> 00:29:36,669
people can go to get a high end value

559
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:41,588
based product like the one that we make

560
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:44,710
flower concentrates that ocean

561
00:29:41,588 --> 00:29:47,740
marketplace of commodity

562
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:50,409
they'll they'll there will be a clear

563
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:53,470
contrast of those dispensaries you know

564
00:29:50,409 --> 00:29:56,919
I'm here in dispensaries that have 1200

565
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:58,149
SKUs that's it that's like Trader Joe's

566
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:01,119
that's Whole Foods

567
00:29:58,148 --> 00:30:04,209
you know so finding and aligning with

568
00:30:01,118 --> 00:30:14,589
retail spaces that have it you know the

569
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:15,548
niche products we aren't I always say

570
00:30:14,589 --> 00:30:18,368
stay in your lane

571
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:20,200
that's CBD Brian you need to do a CBD

572
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:22,928
frog no no that's a different Lane I

573
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,879
call it the whole plant medicine lane or

574
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:28,629
the intuitive highway I just follow my

575
00:30:24,878 --> 00:30:31,648
gut and sometimes I think we might be a

576
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:34,538
little bit too far ahead of the

577
00:30:31,648 --> 00:30:37,979
oversaturated flowers and pre-rolls in

578
00:30:34,538 --> 00:30:37,980
faiths and gummies

579
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:52,980
it could be a disaster so we're working

580
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:55,919
it out and you know no and I and in the

581
00:30:52,980 --> 00:31:00,390
best product we have is the brand itself

582
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:03,210
I just want people to understand to get

583
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:05,390
people how to think what is medicine to

584
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,390
them

585
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:19,000
it's all logistics and I'm very grateful

586
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:21,519
for my associates and my co-founder to

587
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:23,910
stay back in Nevada County today to sit

588
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:27,519

589
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:34,930
manufacturing Alliance and I'm here

590
