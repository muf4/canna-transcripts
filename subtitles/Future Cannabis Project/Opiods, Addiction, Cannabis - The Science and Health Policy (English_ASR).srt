[Music]

2
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:16,350
excited for a conversation on a topic

3
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,379
that is that we don't talk about enough

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:22,020
which is balance talking about opioids

5
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:24,149
and cannabis and tonight in particular

6
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,698
in professional sports just to give you

7
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:28,799
a little background on me before I just

8
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,118
michelle shares a little bit herself my

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,589
background is as a health care

10
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:34,979
regulatory lawyer I've been working for

11
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:37,769
about 26 years in health care I was I

12
00:00:34,979 --> 00:00:39,988
think the first lawyer in California to

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,020
start doing regulatory work around

14
00:00:39,988 --> 00:00:46,488
cannabis back in 2009 and even earlier

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,859
doing work for maps on issues around

16
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:51,869
psychedelics and trying to sort of work

17
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:53,759
for more rational drug policy and

18
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:56,849
advising clients on how to navigate a

19
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,218
complicated environment I have a book

20
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,609
actually coming out tomorrow morning

21
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:04,859
tomorrow the United States of opioids

22
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:06,450
published by Forbes which talks about a

23
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:09,030
little bit about cannabis and a lot

24
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,900
about my sort of deep dive personally

25
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:14,700
into overdose response and some of the

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,240
other challenges that we're facing with

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:20,129
regard to the opioid crisis and and and

28
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,929
hopefully what I what I hope we'll talk

29
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:24,719
about tonight is the extent to which

30
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:28,530
cannabis holds out incredible promise as

31
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:30,450
a potential solution to a crisis in

32
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,049
which as of the last year we have data

33
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,460
for nearly 50,000 Americans died so with

34
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,368
that I'll just turn it over to Michelle

35
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:41,129
just to introduce yourself yeah sure so

36
00:01:38,368 --> 00:01:42,959
my name is dr. Michelle Ross and I just

37
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:45,478
want to start off too by acknowledging

38
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,728
the opioid crisis so my little brother

39
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,549
actually died from an alcohol and

40
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:53,280
oxycontin overdose almost 10 years to

41
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,229
this day actually on Wednesday so has a

42
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,689
drug addiction neuroscientist this topic

43
00:01:55,228 --> 00:01:59,489
is really really it really means

44
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:01,379
something to me to do this work and to

45
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:08,669
be able to bring cannabis in to save

46
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:11,759
lives okay so I actually started off as

47
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:12,869
a cannabis scientist I was studying the

48
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,329
effects of heroin

49
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,209
hain cannabis all these illegal drugs

50
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:21,120
and what they did to the developing

51
00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:23,009
brain and actually my very first paper

52
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,750
was on cannabis and then you know when

53
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,209
you look at the benefits of cannabis as

54
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,949
opposed to the negative harms of

55
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:30,360
cannabis you don't get any more funding

56
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:31,829
for your work so I do wait a couple

57
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,470
years to actually start studying the

58
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,469
benefits of cannabis until I basically

59
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:39,780
moved to California so I ended up

60
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:42,030
founding the first nonprofit for

61
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,009
cannabis and women's health and that was

62
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,949
partly because of my relationship with

63
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:48,810
cannabis so as a scientist I ended up

64
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:50,789
having endometriosis as all these other

65
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,709
different health problems and I was on

66
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:55,530
pharmaceuticals I was even on morphine

67
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:57,269
and as an addiction scientist I didn't

68
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,489
realize how horrible these drugs were

69
00:02:57,269 --> 00:03:01,349
how addictive they were even if you are

70
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:03,000
not addicted to them you were still

71
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:05,369
dependent on them and so I became

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,799
dependent on morphine ended up getting

73
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,170
off these drugs with cannabis and I'm

74
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,969
happy to say now despite all the things

75
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:14,339
have happened to me I am only on

76
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:16,739
cannabis but I really dedicated my life

77
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,989
to helping other people get healthy with

78
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:21,269
cannabis and to start living their life

79
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,759
because when you're on opioids you don't

80
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:27,539
have a life you are depressed you're

81
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:29,310
sick and it's just really hard to manage

82
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:31,798
your chronic illness when you're on

83
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,949
those drugs so I actually found it at a

84
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,920
he online health network that helps

85
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:39,810
people get off of opioids and

86
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:41,909
antidepressants and treats other medical

87
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,409
conditions with cannabis because it's so

88
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:45,060
hard when you go to your doctor they

89
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:45,750
don't know anything when you go to the

90
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,489
dispensary

91
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,259
you know you might find a gem of a

92
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:50,819
dispensary that actually has educated

93
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:53,009
bud tenders but really in most places

94
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:55,229
they're sort of like your cashier at

95
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:56,098
Target instead of a pharmacist right and

96
00:03:55,229 --> 00:03:58,590
you shouldn't be having those

97
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:01,379
conversations with them so that's a

98
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,810
long-winded story there but I really am

99
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,329
just excited to talk with you because

100
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,549
you know so much about opioid policy and

101
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:10,500
as somebody who's worked trying to

102
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:13,829
legalize cannabis and trying to set up

103
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,239
clinical trials on cannabis for the

104
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:18,358
treatment of pain I mean there's so much

105
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,280
that we can discuss today so thank you

106
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,199
so I wanted to before I want to ask you

107
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:25,109
some questions sort of biochemically to

108
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,189
set the stage for contrasting cannabis

109
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,870
and opioids but if it's all right

110
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:30,990
I just want to take a minute to frame

111
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:34,050
the opioid crisis we mark the opioid

112
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:37,680
crisis most people market from about the

113
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:40,410
late 90s or right around 2000 the the

114
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,389
opioid that sort of signaled a real

115
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,850
change in the overdose death rate in

116
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,589
America was oxycontin which has been

117
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,120
getting a lot of attention because of

118
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:50,429
its manufacturer Purdue

119
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,800
Purdue Pharma and there found the

120
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,199
founders the Sackler who made billions

121
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,060
but but the real the the story when you

122
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,649
think about the opioid crisis the way I

123
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,980
would encourage people to think about it

124
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:05,219
in broad terms is as really three inter

125
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,560
woven problems that is an overdose death

126
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,420
rate that has quadrupled in the last 20

127
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,240
years from roughly 11,000 people

128
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:15,540
overdosing on all opioids prescription

129
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:19,410
opioids illegal forms of opioids heroin

130
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:23,490
and fentanyl and and then to about 40

131
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:25,290
almost 49,000 in 2017 the last year we

132
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,990
have data for going all about at least

133
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:30,569
10% a year so part of the problem is

134
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,370
overdose deaths and then we get to the

135
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:34,680
the second issue around the opioid

136
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,540
crisis is addiction and when we talk

137
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,189
about professional sports that's going

138
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,319
to be a big part of the equation we have

139
00:05:38,189 --> 00:05:43,199
roughly 20 more than 20 million

140
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:45,209
Americans who suffer from some form of

141
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,339
substance use disorder or addiction

142
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:50,819
about two-thirds of those about 12

143
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:53,429
million people claim to an opiate some

144
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:55,560
kind of misuse of opioids or an opioid

145
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,759
use disorder and then finally we have

146
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,569
the problem of chronic pain we're going

147
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,019
to talk about tonight

148
00:05:57,569 --> 00:06:03,449
so which is 50 million Americans 50

149
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:06,089
million adults complained that in the

150
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:08,909
last six months pain has been a severe

151
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:11,159
limitation in their lives 20 million of

152
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,230
them say that it has limited most or all

153
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,260
work or life activity so we're talking

154
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:18,180
about three problems overdose deaths

155
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:19,469
addiction and pain and then I would the

156
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,860
other piece that I talked about in the

157
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:27,060
book is there's an underlying root which

158
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:29,460
is all of the the emotional and and

159
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,470
social issues that's what whether you

160
00:06:29,459 --> 00:06:34,680
identify it as stress as isolation as

161
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,390
despair

162
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,720
there's a whole set of issues that are

163
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:42,000
driving a driving the crisis

164
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,340
with respect to with respect to all

165
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,449
three prongs so anyways so I don't we

166
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:47,969
think when we talk about the opioid

167
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:49,709
crisis that's the the problem we're

168
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,980
talking about all three pieces of the of

169
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:55,739
the problem and so I want to come back

170
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:58,020
to the biochemical side of it and and

171
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,900
I'm wondering if you can explain what

172
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:03,859
the why opioids have become such a have

173
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:06,449
been a such a powerful source of

174
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,509
treatment in medicine and and and and

175
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:11,550
for treating pain and and talk about the

176
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:16,230
biochemical process that leads to their

177
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:19,020
risk so opioids are very very effective

178
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:21,300
for pain and because we supply them in

179
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:23,310
these little milligram tablets they're

180
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,680
you know they're absorbed pretty evenly

181
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,449
by each patient so that's why you know

182
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,370
the healthcare system likes to prescribe

183
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,560
that as opposed to cannabis where you

184
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,050
know if you smoke it you eat it etc it's

185
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,759
very different and varies for pain

186
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:41,759
so opioids are very effective for pain

187
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,500
so one of the ways that opioids works is

188
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,418
it actually activates your mute opioid

189
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:51,959
receptor and then that helps actually

190
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:56,939
relieve pain by reducing the signals in

191
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:58,168
the in the spinal cord and brain and

192
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:00,149
there's a lot of other things that will

193
00:07:58,168 --> 00:08:05,039
be way to do actually we know that

194
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:06,750
opioids can cause some of the symptoms

195
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,550
of clinical depression actually at their

196
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,310
lowest dose this is an interesting fact

197
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,930
so five milligrams of oxycodone which is

198
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,370
a low dose of opioids will actually

199
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,680
cause clinical depression in the brain

200
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:20,459
so there's a lot of things that opioids

201
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,110
do that we don't really think of one

202
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:23,250
more prescribing opioids and doctors

203
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,569
don't think about that right we don't

204
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,000
think that we're causing depression when

205
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:29,459
when we cut when we prescribe opioids to

206
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,290
patients we don't you know tell them

207
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:33,000
about the risk of addiction we don't

208
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:34,769
tell them are out the risk of overdose

209
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,538
right and the reason why people can

210
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:38,668
overdose on opioids it's because there's

211
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:41,729
opioid receptors all throughout the body

212
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:44,480
and the brain and especially in the area

213
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:48,200
for her

214
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,200
sorry for the area that regulates

215
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,970
breathing so

216
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,900
and overdose on opioids because you're

217
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,610
activating opioid receptors in the area

218
00:08:54,899 --> 00:09:00,939
that can cause respiratory depression

219
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:03,039
and death right so so in other words

220
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,510
people are basically the higher doses

221
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,569
that people take as they become

222
00:09:04,509 --> 00:09:08,590
dependent is leading them to essentially

223
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,720
suffocate themselves I mean to

224
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:12,810
asphyxiate themselves with with lower

225
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,700
lower oxygen intake because that is oh

226
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:19,899
yeah so I mean there's a lot of opioids

227
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:22,259
that the ld50 right like the dose that

228
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:25,600
you need to overdose is actually very

229
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:27,610
low range so how effective that drug is

230
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,730
for pain and versus how many you need to

231
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:32,440
take to die from right so for example

232
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,509
there's opioid it's like tramadol right

233
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,460
that you can take just like one or two

234
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:40,230
extra pills on and then you can actually

235
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:42,910
overdose from so there's more and more

236
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,649
stronger opioids being prescribed now

237
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:46,870
you know fronting all for example

238
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:48,850
something that you cover quite well in

239
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:52,840
the book about how the addition of

240
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:55,629
fentanyl in both legal and illegal drugs

241
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:58,350
that are illegal opioids are available

242
00:09:55,629 --> 00:10:02,049
on the market actually contributes to

243
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:03,399
the opioid crisis yeah so that's another

244
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:05,709
thank you for bringing it up it's

245
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:07,480
actually a fascinating piece of when you

246
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,030
if you just again thinking about what

247
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:13,779
the opioid crisis is so really from

248
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:15,639
about 99 2000 to about 2010 the driving

249
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:18,669
piece of the overdose death rate going

250
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:20,230
up was purse position prescribing right

251
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:23,049
eye and actually I'm excited to talk

252
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,779
with dear Kasim talk about it because I

253
00:10:23,049 --> 00:10:30,039
I remember getting calls in the in the

254
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:31,959
late 2009 2010 11 from actually from NFL

255
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:35,709
teams and they were getting calls from

256
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:39,250
the DEA because the NFL was was just you

257
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:41,080
know full of doctors prescribing very

258
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,899
loosely there would be team trainers

259
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,480
giving out drugs that was really really

260
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:47,709
troubling so anyway so in that period we

261
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,629
were talking about physician prescribing

262
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:52,750
what happens is that what we saw was

263
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:55,149
that the DEA cracked down on physician

264
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:57,309
prescribing they continued to do so but

265
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:59,559
in around 2010 the crackdown was big

266
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:01,659
enough from the DEA and state medical

267
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:03,339
boards that we began to see black tar

268
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:05,769
heroin filling the void

269
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,040
and Sam quinones who wrote the book

270
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:11,649
dreamland talks about the way that

271
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:14,469
basically the traffickers who were

272
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:16,659
getting shut out of cannabis turned to

273
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:19,690
black tar heroin and then we saw so we

274
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:23,289
saw from about 2010 to 2013 a huge spike

275
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:25,990
in heroin usage including I there's been

276
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:27,969
reports of a lot of NFL alumni and other

277
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,549
professionals athletes turning to heroin

278
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,680
it's it's absolutely terrifying in the

279
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:35,199
book I tell a story of somebody who I

280
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:38,349
know personally who turned to heroin

281
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,820
when her doctor cut her off and and so

282
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,800
then we get to this third phase of the

283
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,390
opioid crisis that people that were in

284
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,609
now which is what you talk about which

285
00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:47,889
is the fentanyl crisis fentanyl is both

286
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:50,528
a legal prescribed drug but it's also an

287
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:52,210
easy to manufacture illegal form if you

288
00:11:50,528 --> 00:11:54,399
have the right priests precursor

289
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:56,350
chemicals in the lab and people are and

290
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,730
it's cheap so that what's happening

291
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,830
today is that a lot of the overdose

292
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:01,330
deaths are people thinking they're

293
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,370
getting one drug but actually getting

294
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,920
fentanyl and it's absolutely frightening

295
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,539
III heard a story this morning of a

296
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:10,779
teenager who thought he was taking an

297
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:12,730
antidepressant and he was it was really

298
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:15,220
a counterfeit fentanyl cuz fentanyl is

299
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,100
so cheap that it's just proliferating

300
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:21,839
anyway so so to get back I want to get

301
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:25,899
back to this the the question of

302
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:28,720
thinking about pain opioid treatment of

303
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:31,899
pain and cannabis drinking the treatment

304
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,550
of pain from a neural lot

305
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:37,059
clinical perspective I'm just wondering

306
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:38,729
if you can describe sort of how the

307
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:42,459
difference in terms of you know

308
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:44,830
effective efficacy for for treatment of

309
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:46,379
pain between the two yeah so there's

310
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,509
actually a lot of overlap between

311
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:51,549
cannabinoids and opioids so the new

312
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:54,370
opioid receptor is found in the same

313
00:12:51,549 --> 00:12:57,789
location as the cb1 and cb2 receptors

314
00:12:54,370 --> 00:13:00,970
and so that's actually why when you take

315
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:03,039
th see the and you take an opioid you

316
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,080
actually need less of the opioid and

317
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:07,929
it's actually called a canapa sorry an

318
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,330
opioid sparing effect so

319
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:12,099
because these receptors are located in

320
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:14,139
the same place when you take a

321
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:17,889
cannabinoids they actually make the

322
00:13:14,139 --> 00:13:19,120
opioids more effective and so you would

323
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:21,039
think maybe okay it makes them too

324
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,419
effective you might overdose and things

325
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,730
like that what actually makes is that

326
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:28,360
you get more pain relief without having

327
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:30,759
to use more opioids so these cannabinoid

328
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,970
receptors are located on these neurons

329
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:35,470
that actually control how much

330
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:38,500
endorphins for example are released and

331
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:41,710
endorphins are your natural and your

332
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,269
natural opioids just like you know we

333
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,060
have these natural and do cannabinoids

334
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:48,159
like Ananda might they're in our body so

335
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:50,229
cannabinoids can actually increase the

336
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,699
amount of endorphins or natural opioids

337
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:55,840
that are released they can actually make

338
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,980
the opioid pathways more effective so

339
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,310
there's a lot of different ways that

340
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,470
they work cannabinoids don't cause the

341
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:04,059
same kind of inflammation that we see in

342
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,590
the brain when you use opioids so

343
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:08,439
there's some different there's some

344
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:11,530
mechanisms that are very different so

345
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,970
THC and CBD are also very different from

346
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:14,470
each other they're not the same

347
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,080
you know cannabinoids right not all

348
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,779
cannabis products have CBD in them that

349
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,970
well CBD products have THC in them so

350
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:24,069
THC and CBD wort a little bit

351
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:26,470
differently and we won't go too much

352
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:28,300
into it but CBD can actually have

353
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,399
effects that are slightly different from

354
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:32,859
teach seeing and actually reducing xiety

355
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,779
- we're gonna serotonin receptors and

356
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,330
that can actually relieve pain in a very

357
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:40,839
different way than just opioids which

358
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:42,700
are not really treating say some of the

359
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,290
stress and mood issues that you see with

360
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,570
chronic pain so when you're using

361
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:48,339
cannabinoids not only are you treating

362
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,830
the pain but you're also treating some

363
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,180
of the other underlying mood issues that

364
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:53,860
contribute to pain if you're more

365
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:55,779
stressed out if you're more depressed

366
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,210
you're more anxious you're actually

367
00:14:55,779 --> 00:14:59,740
going to perceive your pain as worse and

368
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:02,110
so there's a lot of things about

369
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:05,549
cannabinoids that really true to treat

370
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:08,500
the root of the problem as opposed to

371
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:09,699
just you know masking in the pain can

372
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,440
you okay so you just touched on

373
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,420
something that that is what like that

374
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,860
for me was like some learning that

375
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:17,399
happened as I was writing the book which

376
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:20,769
is that talking about pain both as a

377
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,279
physical sensation and an emotional

378
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:23,919
reaction

379
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,809
I came across theirs I cited it in the

380
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:27,849
book a study which candidly I didn't

381
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:30,399
really understand from dr. Ethan

382
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,870
Rousseau who's a prominent researcher

383
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,899
and he talks about the fact that

384
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:38,370
cannabis may be well he sort of says

385
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:41,559
even if there's not research to support

386
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:43,600
cannabis as being at the efficacy of

387
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:45,159
cannabis on certain pain issues it

388
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,810
clearly affects emotion can you just

389
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:49,449
sort of explain the difference between

390
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:53,229
treating pain as the sensation versus

391
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:56,920
pain as an emotion okay so treating pain

392
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:59,259
as a cessation that's interesting so you

393
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:01,449
obviously have a whole bunch of

394
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:03,100
different brain structures right you

395
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,140
have brain structures that process pain

396
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,659
you have pain you have brain structures

397
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:09,580
that process emotional pain and it's

398
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:11,500
sort of interesting so the mukhda love

399
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:15,070
for example in the brain is your area

400
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,659
that processes fear and some of these

401
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,210
negative emotions including how we

402
00:16:16,659 --> 00:16:21,100
respond to pain and what's nice about

403
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:23,320
cannabinoids is that can actually turn

404
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,920
off that signaling they can also help us

405
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,800
forget

406
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:29,349
so cannabinoids are very very good at

407
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:31,449
binding to receptors in our hippocampus

408
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:34,000
and in our amygdala and shutting off

409
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:36,220
these memories that we don't want to

410
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,379
have and for a lot of people though that

411
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:40,600
are in chronic pain they are depressed

412
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:44,259
and part of depression isn't reliving

413
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,960
some of these painful memories or even

414
00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:48,279
memories of being ill and so when you're

415
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,650
able to shut off some these negative

416
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:52,629
circuits you're no longer experiencing

417
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:54,730
those those physical symptoms of pain

418
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:56,769
and literally depression is there some

419
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,240
people that are you know that experience

420
00:16:56,769 --> 00:16:59,559
sort of what we think of typical

421
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,500
depression as sadness

422
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:04,029
you know loneliness despair etc there's

423
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,859
other people that actually exhibit

424
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:08,349
depression as physical pain back pain

425
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:10,479
neck pain gut pain all sorts of

426
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:12,279
different pain even joint pain right so

427
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,559
the fact that we can use cannabinoids to

428
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:16,779
treat emotional pain does actually

429
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,990
increase our ability to treat the

430
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:22,119
physical pain as well so there's just so

431
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:23,890
much that is going on between treating

432
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:26,129
cannabinoid treating pain with

433
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,910
cannabinoids versus treating pain with

434
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,679
opioids right we're talking about

435
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:32,529
opioids actually is causing inflammation

436
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,390
causing some of these these clinicals

437
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:38,379
of depression so it's obviously working

438
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:41,200
on different pathways so so that's

439
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:43,510
fascinating so I'm I want to go back to

440
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,309
that so I'm cuz I'm years ago I had a I

441
00:17:43,509 --> 00:17:47,529
sprained my back of maybe three years

442
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:49,539
ago and so I went I decided I'm not

443
00:17:47,529 --> 00:17:51,579
gonna take I'm not gonna get painkillers

444
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:53,079
by the way I'm curious when I come back

445
00:17:51,579 --> 00:17:54,639
to this on the at the end of this

446
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:58,179
question on where the place of

447
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,100
non-steroidal anti-inflammatories you

448
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,769
know we like the the mo trends and

449
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:05,529
ibuprofen is all the naproxen where all

450
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:07,480
that stuff fits into the pain circuitry

451
00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:08,889
in our bodies but I I'll just share a

452
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:12,339
personal experience I had I sprained my

453
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:14,040
back I was very nervous about taking an

454
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:16,869
opioid which was what my doctor

455
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:19,029
prescribed for me so I went actually to

456
00:18:16,869 --> 00:18:21,759
see dr. Alan Frankel and got a

457
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:25,509
recommendation and and and and used and

458
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,650
and and used a sublingual spray to treat

459
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:29,680
it to take it with cannabis and I do

460
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:32,830
remember that there was I remember is

461
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,990
just from it was that I I did it was the

462
00:18:32,829 --> 00:18:37,000
pain didn't go away but I was I was just

463
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:38,769
I was tolerating it better you meaning I

464
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,269
noticed that it was still there and I'm

465
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:42,910
just wondering like for on a more basic

466
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:44,289
level you know is that it does it make a

467
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:46,540
difference what I know what I noticed

468
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:48,129
personally was that it was treating the

469
00:18:46,539 --> 00:18:49,960
pain differently the sensation was

470
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,120
completely different than the pain going

471
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,309
away but I was mortal it was more a

472
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:55,389
sensation that I was okay with with

473
00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:57,190
feeling that pain I'm just wondering if

474
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,560
you can speak to that and does it

475
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,390
ultimately make a difference if people

476
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,990
can tolerate the tolerate pain just

477
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:06,720
because the because they're emotionally

478
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,500
calm or with it and not and not being

479
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,329
you know I'm just wondering if you can

480
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,819
speak to that and where do where do you

481
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:15,329
and I also sorry to throw a lot at you

482
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:18,250
but where do NSAIDs non-steroidal

483
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:19,839
anti-inflammatories fall in the in the

484
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,869
amount even sort of in the in the

485
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:26,049
process sure so a lot of times we'll

486
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:28,299
talk about you know what is the ability

487
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:31,599
of cannabis to bring down really

488
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:33,759
significant pain to talk about on a pain

489
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:37,949
scale from you know one to ten ten being

490
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,450
the worst pain like er level pain right

491
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,710
you know there are pain patients that

492
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:42,990
can take cannabis and they can be

493
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:44,940
dropped to a level six or five and those

494
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,769
patients will say like you said well I

495
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,480
still know that the pain is there but it

496
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:50,970
doesn't bother me so it's basically

497
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,160
cannabis is helping distract them or

498
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,140
being able to cope by reducing the

499
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:57,060
anxiety that's around their pain right

500
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,400
chronic pain patients really sort of

501
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:02,339
sometimes hyper focus on their pain that

502
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,950
hyper focusing actually increases their

503
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:06,539
or actually decreases their ability to

504
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,160
deal with that pain right if you're so

505
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,450
focused on it you can't really do

506
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,509
anything else and you make that pain

507
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,950
worse right if you were able to sort of

508
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:15,299
compartmentalize it and not deal with it

509
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:17,970
you're able to deal with that pain

510
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:20,549
better now opioids on the other hand

511
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,200
will can you know depending on the doses

512
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:24,299
completely knock out that pain and I

513
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,740
think that's also part of its abuse

514
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:27,450
liability right if it's able to

515
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,069
completely knock out the pain and it's

516
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,390
able to make us feel good in so many

517
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:32,849
different ways one thing you're like I

518
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:34,860
want more opioids no one that is getting

519
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:36,599
the relief from cannabis and saying it's

520
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,579
distract me for pain is like I need to

521
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:40,349
be even more distracted give me more

522
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:42,629
cannabis more cannabis you know we don't

523
00:20:40,349 --> 00:20:44,759
have that kind of drive within us most

524
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:47,970
people will actually try treat their

525
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,859
cannabis use and that's one of the

526
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,460
better things about using it for pain

527
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:53,789
management

528
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:57,180
now you mentioned OTC pain relievers out

529
00:20:53,789 --> 00:21:00,269
naproxen some of these and sets the way

530
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:03,750
that they work is actually by blocking

531
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:07,700
an enzyme called coxswain or Cox - these

532
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:09,710
are enzymes that actually help produce

533
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,210
prostaglandins so these are inflammatory

534
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:15,120
molecules that are in our brain and our

535
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:17,299
body and make us feel like crap so the

536
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,319
ability for an approximate be able to

537
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:21,569
stop the production of these

538
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:22,679
inflammatory molecules and stop pain is

539
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:24,509
really important

540
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,130
however they have a lot of nasty side

541
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:28,200
effects like for example if you take

542
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:31,020
these drugs too often you're gonna end

543
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,230
up with a lot of stomach hips etc what's

544
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:37,109
interesting about some cannabinoids

545
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:39,390
specifically I believe it's CBD a is

546
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:42,349
actually the raw version the on

547
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:45,690
carboxylated version of CBD and that

548
00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:47,219
cannabinoid can actually inhibit cox-2

549
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:49,049
which is important because that one

550
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:52,299
doesn't act

551
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:54,190
it basically drugs that inhibit Cox T

552
00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:55,539
we're not going to mess up your gut or

553
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,250
things like that so you want to be able

554
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:58,920
to reduce inflammation and I think that

555
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,569
there's a lot more potential for just

556
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:03,820
for drugs to be able to treat pain and

557
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:07,179
inflammation more than just CBD and THC

558
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:10,210
we need to look at a CBD a TCA and I

559
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:11,740
think there are some different clinical

560
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:15,579
trials out there that have looked at

561
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:17,589
these cox-2 inhibitors for different

562
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:20,109
types of pain and even for anti-cancer

563
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:22,209
effects so there's like there's so many

564
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:24,250
things that we haven't even touched on

565
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,950
in terms of cannabinoid medicine and

566
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:28,839
pain relief let's I'd love to get some

567
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,759
you thoughts on so for me and as a

568
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:32,799
lawyer one of the most exciting things

569
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:34,599
that happened was the farm bill if

570
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,599
people followed that passed in December

571
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:39,819
which basically finally stopped the DEA

572
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:43,269
from treating all hemp source

573
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:44,619
cannabinoids as a Schedule one I'll just

574
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:47,109
share I just did share this quick story

575
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:50,229
I was in Washington DC meeting with

576
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:52,779
policymakers in late October and I met I

577
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:55,509
spent a day with the head of policy from

578
00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:56,500
the DEA and and I literally it could

579
00:22:55,509 --> 00:23:00,039
have it might as well have been a

580
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:02,740
conversation that I had with him in 1984

581
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:04,779
the level of like profession you know of

582
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,069
progressed thinking around cannabis it

583
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:08,470
was a little bit depressing right it was

584
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:10,569
it was the same old conversation and I

585
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:13,809
asked specifically the question when are

586
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:15,639
we gonna see movement on emp'd CBD and

587
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,710
it was actually it was you know his

588
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,930
answer was good luck that's never gonna

589
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:21,759
happen that's not happening anytime

590
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:24,310
anytime soon and sure enough two months

591
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:26,559
later we saw that Congress passed a farm

592
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:30,279
bill that actually changed the status of

593
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:32,319
all the non THC cannabinoids from hemp

594
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:34,269
and so that was a huge development and

595
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:37,629
I'm wondering I'm curious if you can

596
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:39,309
contrast you mentioned CBD a I'm curious

597
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,310
if you can talk a little bit about where

598
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:43,839
the most you know in terms of THC still

599
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:46,960
being we don't we don't have access to

600
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,429
THC and honest outside of schedule one

601
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,860
of the Controlled Substances Act and

602
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:52,210
just to be sorry as a lawyer let me just

603
00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:54,519
explain that just I think everybody

604
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,680
understands it but at the risk of saying

605
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:58,359
the obvious and putting it on schedule

606
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,350
one of the Controlled Substances Act

607
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:02,879
which is where cannabis still sits today

608
00:24:01,349 --> 00:24:05,129
means that there is no accepted

609
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,450
medicinal use doctors can doctors and

610
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,460
states that decriminalize it can

611
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,380
recommend it but they can't prescribe it

612
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:12,390
the significance of putting it on

613
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,210
schedule to is scheduled to as a list of

614
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:18,299
prescribed 'el drugs that are at a high

615
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,710
risk of abuse as far as the the DEA and

616
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:22,589
the government are concerned but are

617
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:24,690
still prescribed 'el so so most of the

618
00:24:22,589 --> 00:24:26,759
most dangerous and most powerful opioids

619
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:29,460
for example fentanyl and it's prescribed

620
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:33,419
forms are on schedule too and now hemp

621
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:36,298
sourced CBD CBG all these other cut non

622
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:37,679
THC cannabinoids are on schedule too so

623
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:39,779
I'm curious if you can talk other than

624
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,509
CBD a if you can talk about some of the

625
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:45,089
the opportunities that the hemp source

626
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:47,490
cannabinoids offer and where you think

627
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:50,459
the the most promise is with respect to

628
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:52,650
pain well that's an interesting one so

629
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,029
we are just at the tip of the iceberg we

630
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:57,150
really don't know what these other

631
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:59,308
cannabinoids do or even some of the

632
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,960
terpenes right so some of the

633
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:02,849
cannabinoids the minor cannabinoids that

634
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,259
can be found in hemp and also some

635
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:11,399
cannabis products include canaveral CVG

636
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:13,829
CBC CB n th T V is even a found in small

637
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,470
amounts and some ham strains so I think

638
00:25:13,829 --> 00:25:18,000
that because of these cannabinoids being

639
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:21,029
found in such low amounts we don't

640
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
really know what they do some are

641
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:26,730
suggested to have promised for cancer

642
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,859
treatment some are effective for

643
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:30,029
seizures for example some are being

644
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:31,798
studied by some of the big

645
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:34,288
pharmaceutical companies right now like

646
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:38,069
CBD B for example it's been study four

647
00:25:34,288 --> 00:25:39,900
by GW Pharma for epilepsy so we're just

648
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:42,928
learning about these rare cannabinoids

649
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:46,140
right now and unfortunately until some

650
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:47,970
of the you know well I guess if we can

651
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,409
get them from hemp we can study them I

652
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:51,298
was gonna say but you know we can't

653
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:53,940
really study them but the rules just

654
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:55,619
changed although it's still hard getting

655
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:57,710
some of these cannabinoids it's you

656
00:25:55,619 --> 00:26:00,058
I think the academic research pipeline

657
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:01,679
as somebody that worked with some of the

658
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,058
universities I used to live in Denver it

659
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,890
was really hard to be able to study

660
00:26:03,058 --> 00:26:07,288
these compounds and you would have to

661
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:09,540
get them actually imported in from UK or

662
00:26:07,288 --> 00:26:10,028
Canada which seemed ridiculous when they

663
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,528
were being

664
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:13,229
old everywhere but right now there's

665
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:15,219
actually a lot of products on the market

666
00:26:13,229 --> 00:26:17,769
that we're starting to see like for

667
00:26:15,219 --> 00:26:19,808
example little blends has specific

668
00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:22,179
cannabinoid products in tablet form and

669
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:25,178
so you're seeing now just CBG tablets on

670
00:26:22,179 --> 00:26:26,259
the market or a TV or cbn products it's

671
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:28,359
sort of interesting because they're

672
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:30,098
they've been rolled out and we don't

673
00:26:28,358 --> 00:26:33,218
even know what would happen to a person

674
00:26:30,098 --> 00:26:36,128
if they takes a CBG every day you know

675
00:26:33,219 --> 00:26:38,710
it's sort of crazy that these these

676
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:41,019
cannabinoids exist but we don't know

677
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:42,729
what they do you know in isolation or

678
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:44,919
together so I think that there's a lot

679
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:47,348
of promise but there's also like a lot

680
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:48,609
of you know maybe we should take a step

681
00:26:47,348 --> 00:26:50,348
back and make sure that we know that

682
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:53,558
these things are safe before we're

683
00:26:50,348 --> 00:26:55,239
rolling them out to everyone right I you

684
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:57,668
know I just would share off just another

685
00:26:55,239 --> 00:27:00,548
story I was talking to a fairly

686
00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:02,229
prominent research university a couple

687
00:27:00,548 --> 00:27:04,989
months ago and this was before the farm

688
00:27:02,229 --> 00:27:07,058
bill and and the comment was from this

689
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:10,088
from this the head of policy at this

690
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:12,878
university was that we we have many many

691
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:15,460
researchers in our system who are asking

692
00:27:12,878 --> 00:27:16,988
to do this research and the problem is

693
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:19,450
that like most universities being

694
00:27:16,989 --> 00:27:20,889
federally funded we can't figure out a

695
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:23,229
way to do it where we don't put our

696
00:27:20,888 --> 00:27:26,288
federal funding at risk so I do think

697
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:27,788
that we're really on the brink of a huge

698
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:30,819
opportunity in it I'm not you know I

699
00:27:27,788 --> 00:27:34,108
candidly can't say how many universities

700
00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:36,960
have have really seized on the the

701
00:27:34,108 --> 00:27:39,878
rescheduling of heme sourced

702
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,700
cannabinoids to to pursue the research

703
00:27:39,878 --> 00:27:45,128
but I do think that we're going to see

704
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,538
significant movement on it well I really

705
00:27:45,128 --> 00:27:48,908
do hope so there's been a lot of

706
00:27:46,538 --> 00:27:50,919
universities that have you know cannabis

707
00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:53,229
and even hemp as advice I'm I think

708
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,119
Colorado is one of the first movers in

709
00:27:53,229 --> 00:27:57,848
terms of I think even accepting money

710
00:27:55,118 --> 00:27:59,618
from see how company is to do research I

711
00:27:57,848 --> 00:28:01,778
don't know what the policies are but I

712
00:27:59,618 --> 00:28:04,148
know you say wouldn't accept cannabis

713
00:28:01,778 --> 00:28:07,888
money for example for research studies

714
00:28:04,148 --> 00:28:10,388
so I'm hoping that they allow hemp unded

715
00:28:07,888 --> 00:28:12,548
studies because again the research is

716
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,929
great to do without funding I mean the

717
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:15,940
federal government really

718
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:17,320
in huge funding this research I mean

719
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,390
they're finally starting to put like

720
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:22,210
maybe like five million dollars here or

721
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:24,460
there for opioid research looking at

722
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:26,140
cannabinoids but I mean we need a lot

723
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:28,269
more than that to be able to make a dent

724
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:30,070
in the opioid crisis and also you know

725
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:31,900
be able to establish how effective and

726
00:28:30,069 --> 00:28:33,399
safe these these different cannabis

727
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,350
products are I mean think about it

728
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,490
there's a lot more than just vaporized

729
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:38,199
or smoked cannabis

730
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:40,299
there's topical cannabis which we have

731
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,299
even talked about but there's canvas

732
00:28:40,299 --> 00:28:45,069
creams that you can use for pain right

733
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:47,109
there's patches or gels there's all

734
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:49,329
these different forms of cannabis and

735
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:51,039
yet we're we're just starting like hey

736
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:52,659
let's study what a joint does right

737
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:56,170
there's so much more that we could be

738
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:58,000
doing you know I was gonna actually so

739
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:00,190
you raise an interesting question I so

740
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,019
first of all there's this whole we

741
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:04,750
talked a little bit before the calm

742
00:29:02,019 --> 00:29:06,940
before the the program today about the

743
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,980
contrast between what you know to me

744
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,930
that I get a lot of flack I do a lot of

745
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,450
work in the addiction treatment world

746
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:15,100
and a lot of people in which a lot of

747
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:17,559
people have very negative attitudes

748
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:20,469
about cannabis and so I you know usually

749
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:22,869
my response is twofold number one is we

750
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:24,370
have a lot of research to do that we

751
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:26,349
just don't know there clearly are some

752
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:28,149
concerns to have around cannabis but

753
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:30,099
number two we don't have a cannabis

754
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:32,410
crisis to match the opioid crisis

755
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:35,889
meaning we don't have 50,000 Americans

756
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:37,420
dying of cannabis overdoses and so I

757
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:40,090
just wondering if you can talk about the

758
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,890
sort of the concerns you know how do you

759
00:29:40,089 --> 00:29:44,139
as a as a neuroscientist how do you

760
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:46,210
address the the concerns that people

761
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,160
have around around cannabis and

762
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:51,579
cannabinoids you know it's interesting

763
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:53,740
everyone usually that is has that kind

764
00:29:51,579 --> 00:29:55,299
of emotional reaction that people that

765
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,670
have an opioid addiction shouldn't be

766
00:29:55,299 --> 00:29:59,799
treating you know the opioid addiction

767
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,930
or you know people in recovery shouldn't

768
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:04,029
be using cannabis there's usually a good

769
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:06,370
reason for it it's usually very

770
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:07,990
emotionally tied people that I have met

771
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:09,849
that have been so against it have been

772
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:13,120
you know they have this kind of crazy

773
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:15,429
story like okay my father you know got

774
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,929
high one day and left my my sister in

775
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,970
the bathtub and she drowned like that's

776
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:21,190
why they're so angry about people using

777
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,259
cannabis like these very very you know

778
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:23,850
very tragic stories but not things that

779
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:25,559
are

780
00:30:23,849 --> 00:30:27,480
you know medically based right you can

781
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:29,069
be neglectful with any type of substance

782
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,049
or any drug I mean think about how many

783
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:32,849
people use opioids and probably have

784
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:34,589
some kind of child neglect

785
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:35,909
you know incident right and we don't

786
00:30:34,589 --> 00:30:36,240
mention those kind of things all the

787
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,470
time

788
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,359
I actually faced a lot of stigma as a

789
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:44,610
former drug addiction neurosciences that

790
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:48,689
ended up researching campus in fact I

791
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:51,269
went back to my old lab in in Dallas

792
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:53,220
Texas which was one of the top drug

793
00:30:51,269 --> 00:30:54,569
addiction labs in the country and I

794
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:57,960
actually went back to my mentor that I

795
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:59,879
did my PhD under and she was you know

796
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,470
talking to me and she goes well cannabis

797
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,570
is okay if it's for those babies with

798
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:05,220
epilepsy but it'll never be okay for

799
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:06,480
anyone else to use it because it's an

800
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,400
addictive drug and you shouldn't be

801
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,620
treating one addiction with another

802
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,120
addiction and you're like well we know

803
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:14,009
how many people have died from heroin

804
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:16,199
overdose and these other types of drugs

805
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:18,000
or alcohol right but no one is dying

806
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,640
from cannabis what is the stigma

807
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,079
attached to it and it's still like I

808
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,150
feel like it's almost like trying to

809
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,949
convince somebody who was anti cannabis

810
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:27,269
sometimes as almost as hard is trying to

811
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,279
convince a Republican to become a

812
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:33,119
Democrat like sometimes people are these

813
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:36,000
ingrained biases and there's a part of

814
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:37,649
me that says ok you know where do you

815
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,029
devote your time and energy I want to

816
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:41,130
devote my time towards being all to

817
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:42,240
convince people that are open to change

818
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,970
and there are some people that just

819
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,670
aren't right but I think the flippin

820
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:49,769
point comes to when somebody who was

821
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:52,740
very very staunchly against cannabis

822
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:54,839
either needs it themself because oh no I

823
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,059
got diagnosed with breast cancer or my

824
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:59,879
child has epilepsy something like that

825
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:02,069
happens and then they go okay now it's

826
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,130
time for me to reevaluate my you know

827
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:07,049
very you know biased view of cannabis as

828
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:09,120
a treatment because oh no now I need it

829
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:12,000
right or now I know someone I love needs

830
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:13,529
it and so I found that really the

831
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,119
science hitting somebody over the head

832
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:17,129
with science sometimes it's not so

833
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:19,289
effective you know so I always talk

834
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:21,930
about science Plus heart is really where

835
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:24,210
I live because without those stories of

836
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:26,820
people actually really benefiting from

837
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:29,250
cannabis you know we can hit them on the

838
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:30,720
head with all the data in the world you

839
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:31,359
know unfortunately the facts are there

840
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,850
the facts

841
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:37,779
been there for years I mean you know TV

842
00:32:33,849 --> 00:32:39,609
was discovered in 1964 I mean dr. mill

843
00:32:37,779 --> 00:32:41,769
Shalom has been doing Studies on

844
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:43,808
cannabis and seizures for years he's

845
00:32:41,769 --> 00:32:45,670
been doing all these studies and you

846
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:47,589
know we knew that cannabis was useful

847
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:50,650
for so many different things but the

848
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:53,470
fact is that the the fact that it was a

849
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:56,200
Schedule one drug for so many years

850
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:58,600
since the 60s has really stigmatized

851
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,179
this drug in a way that it's really hard

852
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:03,129
to come after it with logic again people

853
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:05,559
were like well if it was actually not

854
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:07,480
harmful it wasn't something that you

855
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:09,849
know my teenage son just gets high and

856
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,910
you know like it's just like lazy stoner

857
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:15,579
type of stigma associated with cannabis

858
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:16,720
we would be living in a different world

859
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:18,548
where we wouldn't have to convince

860
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,620
people of its effectiveness if it was

861
00:33:18,548 --> 00:33:21,879
just legal already right there are so

862
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:23,979
many challenges with it being illegal

863
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,630
and I think we're starting to see

864
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,210
countries like Canada which has

865
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:30,460
completely federally legalized cannabis

866
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:32,230
there's gonna be less thing about when

867
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:33,940
it's a completely legal market so I'm

868
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:36,669
hoping for the day that we turn around a

869
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,019
United States so you said a couple of

870
00:33:36,669 --> 00:33:40,780
things I want to follow up on so first

871
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:42,250
you you know you actually touched on one

872
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:44,168
of the most interesting responses I've

873
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:46,720
had to you know as I've gone around the

874
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:48,730
country talking about the opioid crisis

875
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,860
and trying to call attention to the fact

876
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:53,500
that it's a structural systemic problem

877
00:33:50,859 --> 00:33:55,808
and not just one of strictly of greedy

878
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,119
drug makers and deceptive marketing a

879
00:33:55,808 --> 00:34:00,250
lot of longtime people in the addiction

880
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:02,589
treatment community have thrown back at

881
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:04,630
me that alcohol is alcohol is a much

882
00:34:02,589 --> 00:34:06,189
bigger problem I think the numbers I've

883
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:08,590
heard numbers as high as 90,000

884
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:11,829
Americans dying every year from alcohol

885
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:12,730
and so I'm just you touched on that I'm

886
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:14,949
just I don't know fear anything else to

887
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:16,510
say about that but it really and the

888
00:34:14,949 --> 00:34:18,789
more that I you know it's funny a lot of

889
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,840
people have said to me once we I you

890
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:21,809
know again this is in the addiction

891
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:25,450
treatment community once we take on

892
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:27,668
opioids and call it you know fully sort

893
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:29,049
of get awareness on opioids the next

894
00:34:27,668 --> 00:34:30,579
target is alcohol and I'm just wondering

895
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:33,190
if you can say if you anything else to

896
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:33,789
say about that contrast well it's

897
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:36,300
interesting

898
00:34:33,789 --> 00:34:38,469
so from the scientist world right

899
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,789
people's passions and

900
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:41,230
what they were studying was actually

901
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:43,029
based on how much funding there was for

902
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:44,829
different things so you know there was a

903
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,839
lot of stigma against cannabis because a

904
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:48,730
lot of the research funds were going

905
00:34:46,838 --> 00:34:50,828
towards cannabis use disorder research

906
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:53,409
which was how to stop people from

907
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:55,389
becoming addicted to cannabis or you

908
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:56,889
know you know all these different

909
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:58,300
treatments that you can give them a

910
00:34:56,889 --> 00:35:01,000
pills you can give them to get them off

911
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,200
of cannabis whereas you know when you

912
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,480
flip it and try to tell them that

913
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:06,578
cannabis is helpful it's very confusing

914
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,199
for them there's no flip with alcohol

915
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:09,550
right we're not like please drink your

916
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:10,838
alcohol it's a good thing for your

917
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:13,329
different diseases so we're never gonna

918
00:35:10,838 --> 00:35:15,909
see that right so it's really clear-cut

919
00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:17,260
to say alcoholism is bad alcoholism

920
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:19,420
causes all these problems yeah

921
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,190
alcoholism isn't that sexy I mean as a

922
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:22,659
drug addiction scientist you're like

923
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:25,150
well I don't really want to study

924
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:28,598
alcohol I drink alcohol I feel bad about

925
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:32,139
it you know alcohol is good for me but

926
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:34,588
not everyone is sort of funny but most

927
00:35:32,139 --> 00:35:36,969
scientists have you know pretty blasé

928
00:35:34,588 --> 00:35:38,920
opinion about alcoholism even though

929
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:42,399
it's you know one of the biggest killers

930
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,800
out there and I think though the major

931
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,650
problem when we talk about substance

932
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,510
abuse research and treating these

933
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:51,970
substance abuse problems is that the

934
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:54,369
problem really isn't substance abuse the

935
00:35:51,969 --> 00:35:56,500
problem is these underlying reasons why

936
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:59,440
people take drugs or they drink right

937
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:02,500
again its loneliness its despair its

938
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,869
abuse its trauma right now we are

939
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,179
holding on to so much trauma and it's

940
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:09,400
harming our ability to function and so

941
00:36:07,179 --> 00:36:11,799
harming our ability to hold down our

942
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,960
jobs to keep families together we're

943
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:15,550
literally living in a broken society and

944
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:17,679
we're putting on the band-aid whether

945
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:19,539
it's alcohol whether it's hard drugs for

946
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:20,649
some people it's even cannabis as much

947
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:22,210
as I hate to say it

948
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:24,818
some people use cannabis in a

949
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:26,769
respectable you know manner and some

950
00:36:24,818 --> 00:36:29,230
people abuse it too I mean that's that's

951
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:30,880
a very real thing so what we need to be

952
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,539
treating it is not so much substance

953
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,088
abuse

954
00:36:31,539 --> 00:36:35,739
we need to be treating is really the

955
00:36:34,088 --> 00:36:37,989
loneliness epidemic and the depression

956
00:36:35,739 --> 00:36:39,879
of it I think because without that we're

957
00:36:37,989 --> 00:36:42,399
not gonna be able to fix the opioid

958
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:44,950
problem no I so you this is a very

959
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,680
important point I in the book the

960
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:49,689
research I did for the for the book for

961
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:51,279
United States of opioids the the study

962
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,210
that actually shocked me the most this

963
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,700
came out in September

964
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,769
of 2018 from University of Pittsburgh

965
00:36:54,699 --> 00:36:57,879
Medical Center you know we at the

966
00:36:56,769 --> 00:37:00,519
beginning we talked about the opioid

967
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,900
crisis is a 20-year phenomenon what what

968
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:04,420
they what the University of Pittsburgh

969
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,068
researchers found and I'm happy to send

970
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,480
anybody the link if you want to see this

971
00:37:06,068 --> 00:37:09,039
this I think this is a very important

972
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:13,210
study they said that there's a

973
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:15,190
forty-year exponentially rising overdose

974
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:17,318
death curve in this country when you

975
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:19,240
take all the sub epidemics of drugs and

976
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,250
put them together with the notable

977
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:22,929
exclusion of cannabis but when you add

978
00:37:21,250 --> 00:37:26,050
together the barbiturates in this and

979
00:37:22,929 --> 00:37:29,049
the PCP and and coke and crystal meth

980
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:31,150
and all of the opioids you end up with

981
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:32,950
this exponentially rising curve of

982
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:35,619
deaths and so the conclusions from that

983
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:36,789
are a few things number one that the

984
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:38,740
government effect you know the

985
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:40,630
government's effectiveness in terms of

986
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:43,179
pushing down on any one drug is

987
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:44,829
absolutely meaningless because the

988
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:47,318
problem pops up someplace else right

989
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:49,690
it's like whack-a-mole but but but then

990
00:37:47,318 --> 00:37:51,909
as exactly to your point if you you know

991
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:53,559
if the if the if the the market if

992
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:56,618
there's a hyper efficient market of

993
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:57,640
people who are trafficking in any

994
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:59,710
illegal drugs that are killing people

995
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:02,828
and people who want who are looking for

996
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:05,588
them is you know then the answer is not

997
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:08,079
in drug policy on focusing on any

998
00:38:05,588 --> 00:38:11,199
particular drug it's on it's on the

999
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,780
social causes underneath and so I'm

1000
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:16,929
curious on the on the isolation there's

1001
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:18,250
the stress the trauma as you say there's

1002
00:38:16,929 --> 00:38:20,739
a lot of different ways to frame it but

1003
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:23,469
that's the core issue so do you see

1004
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:25,389
cannabis as a where does cannabis fall

1005
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:29,529
when when thinking about that social

1006
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:32,108
crisis in America okay so if the real

1007
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:35,769
reason why people are depressed right is

1008
00:38:32,108 --> 00:38:37,690
stress and they reach to drugs or

1009
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:39,969
alcohol to relieve their stress and

1010
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,588
that's causing all these you know the

1011
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:43,919
substance abuse and all these other

1012
00:38:41,588 --> 00:38:47,980
issues like duis overdoses and deaths

1013
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,230
etc cannabis is the one healthy way that

1014
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:52,960
you can deal with stress right and so

1015
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:54,969
you can't overdose on it it was actually

1016
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,440
going to relieve your stress relieve

1017
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:58,000
your pain I mean there are people that

1018
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,019
you're using cannabis for stress and

1019
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,500
they don't even realize that they

1020
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:01,090
actually

1021
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,159
chronic pain until after they stopped

1022
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:05,170
using cannabis they're like oh wow I did

1023
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:07,449
actually have back pain oops I think you

1024
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:09,340
know so people are using cannabis and

1025
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:10,899
it's actually making them healthy or

1026
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,570
making them less stressed out people

1027
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:15,730
that use cannabis relationships are less

1028
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:17,860
likely to actually show domestic

1029
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:19,780
violence towards their partners and it's

1030
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,849
actually those benefits are increased

1031
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:23,950
when both partners use cannabis whereas

1032
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:25,750
you know if you talk to any couple you

1033
00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:27,309
throw alcohol and with one partner both

1034
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:28,929
partners you're gonna get domestic

1035
00:39:27,309 --> 00:39:31,779
violence so there's a lot of things that

1036
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:34,599
cannabis can do both medically but also

1037
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,650
emotionally and spiritually and I think

1038
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:37,809
that there's a lot of people are

1039
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:39,610
actually using cannabis to overcome

1040
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:41,259
trauma and I'm involved with a

1041
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:43,809
documentary called this is Jane that's

1042
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:46,230
actually exploring how cannabis actually

1043
00:39:43,809 --> 00:39:48,549
helped rape survivors and other women

1044
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:51,070
different forms of trauma so I think

1045
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:53,200
that there's a lot to do with cannabis

1046
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:55,600
like nobody is taking you know oxycontin

1047
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,429
to you know overcome trauma like come

1048
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,159
out the other side you know better but

1049
00:39:57,429 --> 00:40:02,259
we're seeing this with cannabis and I

1050
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:04,119
think that there's a lot to it I really

1051
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,880
think that cannabis can help heal us

1052
00:40:04,119 --> 00:40:08,859
both physically mentally emotionally

1053
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,900
spiritually and that's like that's not a

1054
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:13,300
very scientist thing to say but as

1055
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:15,700
somebody who is a patient themselves and

1056
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,110
who helps patients I mean cannabis is

1057
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:19,000
really this catalyst where they're using

1058
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:20,230
it for one thing like okay I'm using it

1059
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,179
for pain and then they would start

1060
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:23,469
realizing hey there's these other pieces

1061
00:40:22,179 --> 00:40:25,119
of my life they don't make me feel

1062
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:26,919
comfortable and I need to work through

1063
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,389
this you know there's people that have

1064
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,889
started cannabis for pain and they

1065
00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:31,509
didn't realize that they need to go see

1066
00:40:29,889 --> 00:40:32,769
a therapist and like work through some

1067
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,630
of their trauma and things because

1068
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:37,420
they're ready to write it's a catalyst

1069
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:39,070
for growth in a lot of ways and that's

1070
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,079
something that's really exciting

1071
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:43,539
it doesn't numb you opioids numb you

1072
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:47,019
cannabis does not know you cannabis

1073
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:48,309
helps you feel so I feel like I have to

1074
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:53,230
play devil's advocate here because I

1075
00:40:48,309 --> 00:40:55,509
well III agree with the potential here I

1076
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:57,969
working in addiction treatment the the

1077
00:40:55,510 --> 00:41:01,240
the fear that a lot of people who work

1078
00:40:57,969 --> 00:41:05,409
in addiction recovery have is that you

1079
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:07,839
know the most promising pathway for

1080
00:41:05,409 --> 00:41:10,329
addiction recovery is sort of two

1081
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,030
elements is psychosocial community where

1082
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:14,009
people feel like they have

1083
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:15,870
connection to other people who have been

1084
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:18,150
through the same experience and a

1085
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:19,739
spiritual path that gives them a sense

1086
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,690
of purpose and meaning and that's not

1087
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:23,219
the only solution but those are that

1088
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:25,740
when you when you when you spend time in

1089
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:29,429
addiction recovery those are the two

1090
00:41:25,739 --> 00:41:32,519
elements that really characterize social

1091
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:34,440
model addiction recovery so you know a

1092
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:37,679
lot of people who I talked to who you

1093
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:40,440
know who either who who have come into

1094
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,059
recovery post heavy cannabis use or

1095
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,889
parents whose who are struggling with

1096
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:46,469
what their kid should do worried that

1097
00:41:43,889 --> 00:41:48,779
cannabis cannabis use that can can't be

1098
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:50,519
an isolating factor that some people get

1099
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:53,550
stuck using it so I'm wondering if you

1100
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:56,849
if you want if you had to I mean you you

1101
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:58,950
said some very you know bold things

1102
00:41:56,849 --> 00:42:01,259
about cannabis is spiritual potential

1103
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:02,879
I'm just wondering if you want to frame

1104
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,620
it or if you if you have any if you

1105
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,750
would sort of you know contextualize it

1106
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:09,230
within the broader thinking about

1107
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:12,030
recovery what what recovery looks like

1108
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:14,309
yeah so I mean everything is context

1109
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:17,600
right context frequency your intention

1110
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:22,009
with use so I talk actually a lot to

1111
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:24,809
groups that focus on young people and

1112
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:26,550
depression and how oh what the

1113
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:28,590
difference is between using drugs to

1114
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:31,769
numb yourself versus using drugs to

1115
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:33,720
elevate yourself and again cannabis

1116
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:35,250
being one of those drugs that you can

1117
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:37,079
either have this very negative thing

1118
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:39,000
where it can be isolating right if you

1119
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:41,190
smoke every day on the couch by yourself

1120
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,840
you never get out to socialize or do

1121
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:44,519
anything like that you're just home like

1122
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:46,140
playing video games every day right like

1123
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:49,559
that might not be the healthiest thing

1124
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:51,869
you know we do want people to be able to

1125
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:54,360
use cannabis and actually go outside go

1126
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:55,440
for hikes play sports like that's

1127
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,480
actually one of the most fascinating

1128
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,039
things for me and I think it's actually

1129
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,840
really relevant because of what we're

1130
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:03,389
gonna be talking about next with a panel

1131
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:05,280
is that there's so many people that were

1132
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:08,849
chronically ill dependent on opioids

1133
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,310
that then switch to cannabis and before

1134
00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:14,519
when they were on opioids they were so

1135
00:43:11,309 --> 00:43:16,199
sick and so depressed and just solely

1136
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:17,789
victimized by the whole situation that

1137
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:20,099
they didn't work out they were too sick

1138
00:43:17,789 --> 00:43:20,659
to ever be able to be anything but a

1139
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:23,299
sick

1140
00:43:20,659 --> 00:43:24,649
and now we see these these patients that

1141
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,510
have gone over opioids and on to

1142
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:28,369
cannabis and they're actually able to

1143
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:31,460
work out the cannabis actually helps

1144
00:43:28,369 --> 00:43:33,500
them be able to be able to do yoga or to

1145
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:35,179
be able to exercise or to be able to go

1146
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:37,760
outside and do things like they have

1147
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:39,440
motivation to go exercise so I think

1148
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,140
that there's some pieces there it's all

1149
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:45,200
about how you use cannabis right you can

1150
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:47,480
use any substance for harm or for good

1151
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:49,429
right and I think cannabis it's about

1152
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,889
informing the patients about how to

1153
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:53,329
properly use this and I don't think any

1154
00:43:51,889 --> 00:43:55,009
doctor out there by the way is like

1155
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:57,079
please smoke this joint and go take a

1156
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:59,420
hike they're not doing that you know

1157
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:01,460
your bud tender might might be giving

1158
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,960
that advice and said but that's one of

1159
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,970
the things that we really explore as

1160
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,470
health coaches is being able to do that

1161
00:44:04,969 --> 00:44:07,009
and I think that's a very different

1162
00:44:06,469 --> 00:44:09,439
model

1163
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:11,180
you know then traditional recovery like

1164
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,750
these are different conversations we're

1165
00:44:11,179 --> 00:44:16,159
having right about using this substance

1166
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:18,860
and about where you should be using it

1167
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:21,199
what you should be doing with it and be

1168
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:23,240
able to use you know basically that

1169
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:25,099
alters needs a seat of consciousness

1170
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:26,599
which normally people and work you know

1171
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:28,089
that work in recovery don't want you to

1172
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:30,889
go for altered states of consciousness

1173
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:33,590
but here it's reframing the height it's

1174
00:44:30,889 --> 00:44:35,509
a different type of high and again it's

1175
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:38,150
about the context where you're doing it

1176
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:40,520
if you're able to who engage people

1177
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:43,130
better when you're on cannabis and be

1178
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:44,719
able to be more social that is really

1179
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:46,430
really important and for a lot of people

1180
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:47,989
that are abusing drugs they're very

1181
00:44:46,429 --> 00:44:49,519
isolated they're not able to connect

1182
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:51,109
with others right it may be sober

1183
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:53,659
they're still not able to connect with

1184
00:44:51,110 --> 00:44:57,380
others and I think that people that feel

1185
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:59,299
they can explore cannabis safely and not

1186
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:01,070
feel like they are breaking their

1187
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,870
sobriety and are supported by others

1188
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:04,010
that have used cannabis successfully I

1189
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:07,579
think that there's something really

1190
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:10,160
exciting there and I really applaud the

1191
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:11,989
groups that have explored using cannabis

1192
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:14,509
or allowing cannabis say in a rehab

1193
00:45:11,989 --> 00:45:15,919
facility that's very rare there's some

1194
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:18,800
groups here that are you know in Los

1195
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,990
Angeles that are allowing cannabis use

1196
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,090
but to be able to say are you still

1197
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:25,250
sober if you're using cannabis is an

1198
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:27,010
interesting question yeah I'll just

1199
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:29,840
share with you it's so one of the big

1200
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:32,450
issues in addiction treatment today has

1201
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,309
been medication assisted treatment right

1202
00:45:32,449 --> 00:45:36,288
the primary Medicaid

1203
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:37,910
that's being used to combat opioid

1204
00:45:36,289 --> 00:45:41,689
addiction these days is buprenorphine

1205
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:44,179
right we cut it's in suboxone subutex

1206
00:45:41,688 --> 00:45:46,399
sub located all of these products that

1207
00:45:44,179 --> 00:45:47,929
are being given to people who are

1208
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:50,449
addicted to opioids and the point of

1209
00:45:47,929 --> 00:45:53,509
these drugs is that you essentially help

1210
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:55,400
people bypass the pain of withdrawal and

1211
00:45:53,509 --> 00:45:57,048
the discomfort of withdrawal because you

1212
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:59,420
put them on these drugs the addiction

1213
00:45:57,048 --> 00:46:00,708
treatment community the longtime people

1214
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:03,619
who have been involved in social model

1215
00:46:00,708 --> 00:46:08,088
abstinence based addiction and recovery

1216
00:46:03,619 --> 00:46:10,430
are very leery of buprenorphine as they

1217
00:46:08,088 --> 00:46:12,798
were as they are of methadone which has

1218
00:46:10,429 --> 00:46:15,379
been with us longer for heroin because

1219
00:46:12,798 --> 00:46:18,139
they essentially it takes away the pain

1220
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:20,630
point that drives people to seek out

1221
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:22,879
community and to find a spiritual path

1222
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:24,410
and so it's interesting I I have to tell

1223
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,140
you I am seeing one of the things that's

1224
00:46:24,409 --> 00:46:30,259
very exciting is that we are seeing a

1225
00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:33,348
beginning of cannabis being used in

1226
00:46:30,259 --> 00:46:36,438
recovery because of the promise for

1227
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:38,119
getting people off of opioids but at the

1228
00:46:36,438 --> 00:46:39,649
same time I think it's going to be a

1229
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:41,239
slow adoption what we're seeing is that

1230
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:43,009
essentially the federal and state

1231
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:45,048
government are trying to are essentially

1232
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:47,659
forcing the addiction treatment

1233
00:46:45,048 --> 00:46:49,759
community to come to terms with with

1234
00:46:47,659 --> 00:46:51,409
buprenorphine and medication assisted

1235
00:46:49,759 --> 00:46:52,909
treatment by saying you can't

1236
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:55,548
discriminate against people we've had at

1237
00:46:52,909 --> 00:46:58,608
we had a major case again the federal

1238
00:46:55,548 --> 00:47:00,349
government pursued and in Virginia at a

1239
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:02,328
chronic pain clinic called Selma Medical

1240
00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:04,489
Associates where the government actually

1241
00:47:02,329 --> 00:47:06,650
came in and sued under the Americans

1242
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:08,358
with Disabilities Act for a pain clinic

1243
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:10,910
that said to a patient in chronic pain

1244
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:12,619
who was on buprenorphine we're not going

1245
00:47:10,909 --> 00:47:14,420
to treat you because we don't have we

1246
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:17,630
don't deal with people who are who are

1247
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:18,170
taking a form of m80 of you know taking

1248
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:20,689
suboxone

1249
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:22,579
so I actually think that the there's a

1250
00:47:20,688 --> 00:47:24,739
lot of promise you know it's funny that

1251
00:47:22,579 --> 00:47:26,869
this is a challenging issue when I speak

1252
00:47:24,739 --> 00:47:28,338
to people in addiction recovery in the

1253
00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:30,650
addiction treatment community it's

1254
00:47:28,338 --> 00:47:32,989
people are not excited about this push

1255
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:35,389
by the government for m80 but I actually

1256
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:36,849
think that you know what your comment

1257
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:40,009
really made me think is that we are

1258
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:43,309
likely to see a growing acceptance of

1259
00:47:40,009 --> 00:47:45,978
cannabis as a form of medication that

1260
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:48,100
helps people make a transition off of a

1261
00:47:45,978 --> 00:47:50,449
far more dangerous drug

1262
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:52,039
absolutely and I think it's very

1263
00:47:50,449 --> 00:47:53,689
interesting that we've seen actually

1264
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:55,340
people that have been involved in the

1265
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:57,289
opioid industry actually going in the

1266
00:47:55,340 --> 00:48:00,260
cannabis industry in fact people that

1267
00:47:57,289 --> 00:48:02,179
were involved with releasing oxycontin

1268
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:04,310
then you know invested and launched

1269
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:07,759
companies cannabis companies in Canada

1270
00:48:04,309 --> 00:48:09,289
we've also seen and I'm totally blanking

1271
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,790
on the name of the drug but there was

1272
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:15,199
someone else that was involved in

1273
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:17,809
creating a a medication for opioid abuse

1274
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:19,909
I ended up working on a cannabis product

1275
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:21,920
to treat opioid addiction so it's funny

1276
00:48:19,909 --> 00:48:24,889
like a lot of people that are that came

1277
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:27,139
out looking to try to solve the opiate

1278
00:48:24,889 --> 00:48:30,319
addiction problem or not turning to

1279
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:32,659
cannabis so the one thing I have to note

1280
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:34,789
is you know should we give the reins of

1281
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:36,920
that to people that caused the problem

1282
00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:38,599
in the first place like is Canada are

1283
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,829
they creating cannabis products that are

1284
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:41,269
going to help or are they going to

1285
00:48:39,829 --> 00:48:43,130
create another cannabis product that's

1286
00:48:41,269 --> 00:48:46,039
more harmful right that could be even be

1287
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:48,410
abuse I think that there's a lot of

1288
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:50,029
ethical issues in the opioid industry

1289
00:48:48,409 --> 00:48:52,009
right and we have to be careful about

1290
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:53,869
you know how these products are being

1291
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:56,030
used are we creating products that might

1292
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:59,180
be you know have more abuse liability

1293
00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:01,820
right like TT by itself is not exactly

1294
00:48:59,179 --> 00:49:04,460
as safe as the full plant extract for

1295
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:05,690
example so you actually triggered this

1296
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,159
was something that you said earlier that

1297
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:09,500
I want to pick up on so we're at this

1298
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:11,179
very funny point right now where we have

1299
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:12,949
a whole series of thirty more than the

1300
00:49:11,179 --> 00:49:15,699
30 states that have decriminalized in

1301
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:19,339
some form and our we have a whole set of

1302
00:49:15,699 --> 00:49:20,929
cannabinoid cannabis products coming out

1303
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:23,059
in these states right and here in

1304
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:25,699
California certainly and and we have the

1305
00:49:23,059 --> 00:49:27,650
FDA kind of standing down other than

1306
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:29,599
with respect to the three approved

1307
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:33,889
cannabis drugs right Marinol see cement

1308
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:35,868
and epidemics which has been approved in

1309
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:38,509
a number of other countries still going

1310
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:40,490
through the FDA process here but but I'm

1311
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:43,940
wondering like if you in this period you

1312
00:49:40,489 --> 00:49:45,649
made a reference earlier to not quite

1313
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:47,840
you know of the questions about

1314
00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:50,269
different products how do you suggest

1315
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:52,190
that people navigate the I mean this

1316
00:49:50,269 --> 00:49:55,190
question of of products in the states

1317
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:57,858
that are not fully you know not having

1318
00:49:55,190 --> 00:50:00,409
gone through FDA approval and are making

1319
00:49:57,858 --> 00:50:01,880
claims that that may or may not be

1320
00:50:00,409 --> 00:50:05,029
born out what's your you have any

1321
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,710
thought about that well if your CBD

1322
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:09,800
water says I know it's your drug

1323
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:11,809
addiction and probably don't buy it no

1324
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,160
this is like that sounds like a joke but

1325
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:14,150
I need three or four years ago there

1326
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:15,769
were companies that were like

1327
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:17,240
advertising these things like literally

1328
00:50:15,769 --> 00:50:19,699
drink this border you'll go to your area

1329
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:21,289
where PTSD in addiction so you have to

1330
00:50:19,699 --> 00:50:23,299
be really careful with the products that

1331
00:50:21,289 --> 00:50:26,300
are in the market technically I worked

1332
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:29,210
in nutraceutical formulation compliance

1333
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:31,100
before I worked in cannabis as part of

1334
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:32,210
the industry and you know there are

1335
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:33,710
certain things that you can say with

1336
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:35,269
nutraceuticals and there's certain

1337
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:38,090
things you can't and even though we're

1338
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:40,730
not a completely legal you know industry

1339
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:43,309
I still tell companies I'm like please

1340
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:45,079
act like you are a you know is a

1341
00:50:43,309 --> 00:50:46,849
nutraceutical and follow the rules that

1342
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:49,279
say like you can't be treating medical

1343
00:50:46,849 --> 00:50:51,380
conditions on the label like there are

1344
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,600
some people that have products that are

1345
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:56,240
marketed for opiate addiction it's like

1346
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:58,369
you can't say it unless your product was

1347
00:50:56,239 --> 00:51:00,829
actually involved in a clinical study

1348
00:50:58,369 --> 00:51:02,690
you have the validated you know results

1349
00:51:00,829 --> 00:51:04,309
that say my product went in a

1350
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:05,900
double-blind study and there are some

1351
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:07,489
clinical trials right now with products

1352
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,800
that are going through that and only

1353
00:51:07,489 --> 00:51:11,569
then only those companies can claim that

1354
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,220
their product does that but a lot of

1355
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:15,050
times you'll see this you know we saw

1356
00:51:13,219 --> 00:51:17,449
this in the nutraceutical world where

1357
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:19,190
people who are just jumping on you know

1358
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:20,480
the published results of another company

1359
00:51:19,190 --> 00:51:21,980
and you're like well that's not even the

1360
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,429
same substance it's not the same dosage

1361
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:26,809
you know you can't say that that result

1362
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:28,699
is what's going to happen if it if

1363
00:51:26,809 --> 00:51:30,710
somebody takes your vitamin or your

1364
00:51:28,699 --> 00:51:34,009
supplement so I think that right now

1365
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:36,650
it's sort of buyer beware you know if

1366
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:38,480
you're trying to work with different

1367
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:40,099
products really work with a professional

1368
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,230
that knows what they're doing that can

1369
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:45,170
steer you towards you know quality

1370
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:46,579
tested products I have unfortunately met

1371
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:48,980
a lot of people are looking for high

1372
00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:51,799
dose TG products to get them off of

1373
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:53,869
heroin for example and you know they

1374
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,340
can't get you know thousands of

1375
00:51:53,869 --> 00:51:56,989
milligrams they can't afford the

1376
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:58,440
products they're in the dispensary so

1377
00:51:56,989 --> 00:52:00,059
they go to like a care go

1378
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:01,349
or something like that we're talking no

1379
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:02,818
there are patients all across the

1380
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:04,800
country some of them are not even in

1381
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:06,509
legal markets and they're going well you

1382
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,010
know my brother's gonna die of heroin

1383
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:11,040
overdose so like we don't care where we

1384
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:11,579
get this like RSO or Rick Simpson oil or

1385
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:13,469
something

1386
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:15,568
we just need it so that they'll be able

1387
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:17,639
to get off of heroin by themselves and

1388
00:52:15,568 --> 00:52:19,079
you're like this is a little dicey and a

1389
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:20,400
little dangerous and that's because a

1390
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:22,079
lot of the products that are available

1391
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,119
on the black market are available from

1392
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,010
growers sometimes aren't even what they

1393
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:27,240
say right like some like there was

1394
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:28,890
actually people that thought they were

1395
00:52:27,239 --> 00:52:31,709
buying new bricks some Sun oil which is

1396
00:52:28,889 --> 00:52:33,539
really high potency THC oil turns out if

1397
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:36,059
they even have any THC in them it was

1398
00:52:33,539 --> 00:52:37,559
actually CBD oil like very little and I

1399
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:39,179
had a bunch of other like roasting as

1400
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:41,338
and that's what we need regulated

1401
00:52:39,179 --> 00:52:44,219
markets we need high quality products

1402
00:52:41,338 --> 00:52:46,799
because you know getting somebody off of

1403
00:52:44,219 --> 00:52:48,689
drugs is not an easy process I mean this

1404
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,300
is why we have detox centers is why we

1405
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:52,349
have rehabilitation centers and to think

1406
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:55,170
that there are people because of

1407
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:56,550
whatever the laws are or whatever the

1408
00:52:55,170 --> 00:52:58,349
supply is out there that they're going

1409
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:00,630
through these back alley like sources to

1410
00:52:58,349 --> 00:53:03,359
be able to get off of opioids it's very

1411
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:05,369
dangerous and very scary and it's

1412
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:07,469
something that you know we we don't want

1413
00:53:05,369 --> 00:53:09,750
anyone to die but we also don't want one

1414
00:53:07,469 --> 00:53:11,759
to die from the treatment and so I think

1415
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:13,650
that there's a lot of cool things that

1416
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,990
are happening in terms of you know a

1417
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:18,660
plant assisted at treatment I actually

1418
00:53:15,989 --> 00:53:21,409
know someone who started a facility in

1419
00:53:18,659 --> 00:53:23,699
Maine where she actually has

1420
00:53:21,409 --> 00:53:25,980
professionals that are trained in an

1421
00:53:23,699 --> 00:53:27,899
addiction treatment actually be able to

1422
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:30,929
watch people go through the heroin or

1423
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:33,030
opioid detox and they have you know a

1424
00:53:30,929 --> 00:53:34,799
real program there and they are able to

1425
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:36,450
give them cannabis and watch them go

1426
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,829
through that they even have you know a

1427
00:53:36,449 --> 00:53:39,480
therapy program where they teach them

1428
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:41,220
how to grow their own plan so that when

1429
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:42,809
they're out of rehab that they can

1430
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:44,009
actually afford their treatment because

1431
00:53:42,809 --> 00:53:45,269
they're growing their own medicine

1432
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:47,010
rather than trying to spend like

1433
00:53:45,269 --> 00:53:49,679
thousands and thousands of dollars of it

1434
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:51,569
on high tea high dose THC products right

1435
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:53,129
so I think that there's responsible

1436
00:53:51,568 --> 00:53:55,469
programs out there there's responsible

1437
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:58,079
brands out there but then there's a lot

1438
00:53:55,469 --> 00:53:59,699
of unfortunately still a mishmash of

1439
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,818
things that shouldn't be out there I

1440
00:53:59,699 --> 00:54:04,588
really hope that you know more brands

1441
00:54:02,818 --> 00:54:07,949
and more dispensaries really try to

1442
00:54:04,588 --> 00:54:08,849
establish programs to help opioid

1443
00:54:07,949 --> 00:54:10,980
abusers

1444
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:12,360
and we see this in Canada there was

1445
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,969
actually a lot of studies in Canada

1446
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:18,539
looking at how we can use cannabis to

1447
00:54:14,969 --> 00:54:19,829
help opioid abusers and we just we

1448
00:54:18,539 --> 00:54:21,779
haven't seen the same in the United

1449
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:23,909
States and I really hope that the

1450
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:26,010
dispensary systems become sort of you

1451
00:54:23,909 --> 00:54:28,250
know maybe like a first step in opioid

1452
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:30,600
abuse care rather than the last step

1453
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:33,139
dude do you guys want to take a couple

1454
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:37,230
questions sounds great

1455
00:54:33,139 --> 00:54:40,199
does anybody have a question let's say

1456
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:44,610
the for example NFL Players Association

1457
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:46,319
hires you as a strategist there are a

1458
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:47,970
lot of sports leagues but I feel like

1459
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:52,039
the NFL is kind of a laggard

1460
00:54:47,969 --> 00:54:56,059
in the sense that it's almost forcing

1461
00:54:52,039 --> 00:55:01,400
prescription painkiller addiction on its

1462
00:54:56,059 --> 00:55:04,650
employees you have decades of systematic

1463
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:06,840
you know handing out of pills and

1464
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:09,780
slapping on the ass and saying get back

1465
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:16,019
out there if the NFL Players Association

1466
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:17,310
hired you chief strategist go so first

1467
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:19,050
of all like I'll just tell you my own

1468
00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:21,259
background on this issue is I was

1469
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:23,730
contacted by three different NFL teams I

1470
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:26,670
technically I was hired by a criminal

1471
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:29,670
defense lawyer in in in two of the cases

1472
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:32,180
who was working with teams because what

1473
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:36,420
we saw going on in the late 2000s early

1474
00:55:32,179 --> 00:55:40,019
2011 2010 2011 period was that you had a

1475
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:42,809
bunch of doctors affiliated with NFL

1476
00:55:40,019 --> 00:55:45,000
teams who were a little bit wowed by the

1477
00:55:42,809 --> 00:55:48,029
celebrity of being around NFL players

1478
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:50,760
and what we saw was just all the rules

1479
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:53,610
went out the door security secur sort of

1480
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:55,530
storage of prescription medications

1481
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:57,539
vicodin was like it was you know you

1482
00:55:55,530 --> 00:56:00,420
talk about pill we talk about pill mills

1483
00:55:57,539 --> 00:56:01,679
being places where doctors were just

1484
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:03,300
giving out the opioids they weren't

1485
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:04,980
selling them on NFL teams they were just

1486
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,990
giving them out and putting them in the

1487
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,039
hands of players and not practicing

1488
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:11,669
medicine they were basically just

1489
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:13,250
enabling a bad culture so so if they

1490
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:16,170
Anna if the NFL Players Association

1491
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:18,929
wanted to work with me what I would say

1492
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:20,700
first and foremost is we need the

1493
00:56:18,929 --> 00:56:22,009
conversation needs to get outside of

1494
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:24,469
just talking to

1495
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:26,150
to Goodall's office right that the

1496
00:56:24,469 --> 00:56:29,989
bottom line is the commissioner and the

1497
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:33,650
league have been so myopic and so locked

1498
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:36,049
down on the potential for cannabis to be

1499
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:37,910
a difference maker and also to the

1500
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:39,560
destructive role that opioids are

1501
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:43,009
playing the role in which they're

1502
00:56:39,559 --> 00:56:45,799
masking pain serious nerve damage and

1503
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:47,180
and and just and leading to a physical

1504
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,369
dependency that's leaving so many

1505
00:56:47,179 --> 00:56:52,789
players both still in the league and

1506
00:56:49,369 --> 00:56:55,340
retired really suffering and so I think

1507
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:56,889
this needs to be a national conversation

1508
00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:59,210
and I think the Players Association

1509
00:56:56,889 --> 00:57:00,679
needs to take that message to the

1510
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:05,329
American public right the American

1511
00:57:00,679 --> 00:57:06,949
public has stood with NFL players on the

1512
00:57:05,329 --> 00:57:09,139
concussion issues on their concerns

1513
00:57:06,949 --> 00:57:11,419
around concussions there's a deep

1514
00:57:09,139 --> 00:57:15,139
sympathy right everyone was shocked when

1515
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:17,329
when when Nike created like a campaign

1516
00:57:15,139 --> 00:57:18,858
that was really heroic around NFL

1517
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:20,769
players I know is divisive but I'm

1518
00:57:18,858 --> 00:57:22,969
saying for that was heroic around

1519
00:57:20,769 --> 00:57:25,130
players standing up for what they

1520
00:57:22,969 --> 00:57:27,230
believed in so I think that the NFL

1521
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:29,240
Players Association should go to the

1522
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:30,829
American public and really take and make

1523
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:33,079
an advocacy advocacy game playing

1524
00:57:30,829 --> 00:57:35,289
campaign that will get this away from

1525
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:38,090
Roger Goodell and and in the hands of

1526
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:40,250
and make this a concern that the that

1527
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:42,530
the that the league is you know

1528
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:44,300
understands that viewers are unhappy

1529
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:48,290
that the league is essentially

1530
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:50,840
perpetuating the opioid crisis right and

1531
00:57:48,289 --> 00:57:52,670
missing a huge opportunity to offer a

1532
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:55,160
new therapeutic and I think that is an

1533
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:57,289
awareness that starts with awareness and

1534
00:57:55,159 --> 00:57:59,659
that starts with players sharing their

1535
00:57:57,289 --> 00:58:02,509
stories and and I'm excited to hear from

1536
00:57:59,659 --> 00:58:05,629
Cosima and I and I really think you know

1537
00:58:02,510 --> 00:58:08,510
hearing from players currently dealing

1538
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:12,289
with the the stress on the human body of

1539
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:15,050
playing football and alumni veterans who

1540
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:16,070
are living with the effects after the

1541
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:18,380
extent to which people are sacrificing

1542
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:20,300
their bodies and and the role that

1543
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:23,059
opioids are playing I think would be

1544
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:25,400
just mind-boggling for and I think I

1545
00:58:23,059 --> 00:58:29,690
think people would people care right I

1546
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:31,789
remember 1996 I was I was just a baby

1547
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:34,010
lawyer back then but when Brett Favre

1548
00:58:31,789 --> 00:58:35,480
was addicted to vicodin when that came

1549
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,920
out that just like blew my

1550
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:38,840
world like aye aye and and it was

1551
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:40,309
amazing to me to think back how that

1552
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:42,829
didn't register with everybody you know

1553
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:44,480
it was just another story of one

1554
00:58:42,829 --> 00:58:46,849
person's addiction we didn't think about

1555
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,889
it in a systemic way so what I would say

1556
00:58:46,849 --> 00:58:51,108
to the Players Association is you've got

1557
00:58:48,889 --> 00:58:52,849
such an opportunity this moment in time

1558
00:58:51,108 --> 00:58:55,009
we're just we're really just beginning

1559
00:58:52,849 --> 00:58:58,279
to wrap our heads around you know how

1560
00:58:55,010 --> 00:59:00,260
big this crisis is and to take people

1561
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,910
who so many Americans look up to to

1562
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:04,970
might you know my own kids I have four

1563
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:08,000
kids you know who are really like their

1564
00:59:04,969 --> 00:59:09,889
heroes are I don't want to be unpopular

1565
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,108
in LA I'm from a Detroit Lions fan I

1566
00:59:09,889 --> 00:59:15,319
know Kasim I know you spend a year or

1567
00:59:12,108 --> 00:59:17,179
two there but uh but but to be able to

1568
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:19,190
like I think I think that's an issue

1569
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:21,019
that gets through to people and that

1570
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:23,780
would move the needle and getting away

1571
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:25,969
from just letting the league a you know

1572
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:28,810
tell its own story on this would be all

1573
00:59:25,969 --> 00:59:28,809
the difference in the world

1574
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:52,110
yeah yeah thanks that really

1575
00:59:48,429 --> 00:59:52,109
[Applause]
