[Music]

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,379
but what I'm saying though is that it's

5
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:23,639
it's the point of sale that education

6
00:00:22,379 --> 00:00:26,640
can occur

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,740
the only way this can occur is if people

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,599
who who could control shelf space which

9
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:34,320
are larger entities

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,480
they're able to understand that their

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,280
criteria dictate that they produce

12
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:40,439
things that fit into that five

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,000
categorical breakdown I gave earlier

14
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:44,459
right that's where they sell the product

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,159
the only way they get out of that Loop

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,000
is to work collaboratively with a small

17
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:50,398
farm

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,219
and so cure Leaf was the example and so

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,960
cure Leaf has a rough um public opinion

20
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,539
because they've gone after home grows

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,340
and they've done all kinds of crazy shit

22
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,020
but nonetheless when they sent their

23
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,899
fucking head of sales through a program

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,000
that I worked with I showed her the

25
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,579
program that we did at Humboldt where we

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,978
tied small farmers into cookies and said

27
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,200
do you see the impact it had on these

28
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:15,420
small farms where their product is now

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,219
being elevated and promoted and it's

30
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,640
giving them market share and it's giving

31
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:24,060
them validity and stability yes and

32
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,920
validity the validity that you are the

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,900
problem in America is that if you're not

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,519
on top what's that Ricky Bobby shit you

35
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,020
ain't first you last right there's no

36
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,420
second fucking place second place is

37
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,578
first loser first loser and the problem

38
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,478
with that is that's not really true in

39
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:42,118
life it's just this hyper you know I

40
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:44,700
want to say like Macho fucking idiot but

41
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,859
it doesn't really work and so what you

42
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,320
have to do is you got to be able to say

43
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,640
okay we're the biggest but what we want

44
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,519
is we want

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,500
really quality products in addition to

46
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,478
the things that we can produce at our

47
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,640
level and the only way you can do it is

48
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:01,379
in collaborative forms so curaleaf took

49
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,259
the the program that we created in

50
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:05,938
Humble and then copied it and then I

51
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,200
bumped into their their head of sales at

52
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:09,118
one of the events and she was like yeah

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,060
she goes we clean that shit out she goes

54
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:14,280
the public absorbed it and so

55
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,640
that means that it works for cure relief

56
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,439
and it will then be copied by other msos

57
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:21,000
because once you succeed in candidates

58
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,739
everybody just copies you because people

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,239
really aren't inventive and what I

60
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,860
learned from businesses most people are

61
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,659
only good at competing in a room they've

62
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,000
been educated in when you take them out

63
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:31,859
of that room they drown and so that's

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,239
kind of how I like to play the Cannabis

65
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,440
game is I want to take you into a room

66
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,780
you don't know where the fuck you're at

67
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,098
I want to drown you I want to fucking

68
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,439
drown you

69
00:02:38,098 --> 00:02:43,738
like the kangaroo drowns the dog I want

70
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:45,419
to drown you and because ultimately who

71
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:48,120
am I not trying to drown is the customer

72
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:50,039
the customers who I'm trying to satisfy

73
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,840
and what I want is the customer to be

74
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,419
able to buy something that they desire

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,640
and what I know is it's beneficial to

76
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:58,859
them and as a craft farmer

77
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,939
and and so like for me that's why we all

78
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,980
smoke weed because it's a little bit

79
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:03,659
special it's beneficial to you yeah and

80
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:05,939
it's just that but that craft farmer

81
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:09,180
means like small scale there is no such

82
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:11,158
thing as crafted scale it's an oxymoron

83
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,980
you can't touch it you can't do both you

84
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:16,259
can't have cheap and best

85
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:18,000
you can have an idea that simple invest

86
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:19,139
but when you put that fucker together it

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,580
costs money you could have one or the

88
00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:23,219
other but not both yeah yeah you can

89
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,480
have price delivery or quality but you

90
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:26,580
can never have all three yeah right

91
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,139
that's the rule of distribution

92
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,420
and so

93
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:33,539
what we what we have is

94
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:36,719
the ability for small farms

95
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:40,199
to be able to say okay let me release

96
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:42,959
the products that were not hot five six

97
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:46,318
seven ten years ago but a little prior

98
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,539
to this turn of events and they why did

99
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,298
they sell prior because they were really

100
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:52,560
really desirable and then a lot of those

101
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:54,000
people because when somebody got that

102
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,340
pound back to wherever they got that

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,598
everybody loved it they love the weeds

104
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,459
you remember getting that one bag of

105
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,199
weed from that one guy that one time and

106
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,598
you're like oh my God if I can get that

107
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,979
forever you'd be happy and and the

108
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:06,780
customer doesn't give a fuck about the

109
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,419
struggle at a farmer they don't care

110
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,818
about your legacy Story the customer is

111
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:13,559
Legacy the customer was also engaged in

112
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:15,479
a criminal drug deal so what makes them

113
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,798
any less fucking important than you I'm

114
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,478
the one that produced it who gives a

115
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,459
fuck I'm the one that bought it you

116
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:24,120
wouldn't have a business it's about the

117
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:26,819
genetics it's a legacy argument craft

118
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,759
Farmers fucking focus on their story too

119
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:32,279
much about their struggle you're telling

120
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,560
someone I'm in Colombia right we're in

121
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:37,918
the jungle of Colombia and I was outside

122
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,339
of bashada okay and we light up fucking

123
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:44,159
Jenny and put on the YouTube and the

124
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:46,339
Colombians are in hysterics laughing at

125
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,380
the fuck what they call them hipsters

126
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:51,239
the hipsters because the Colombians are

127
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:53,459
working for fucking 400 bucks a month

128
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,860
totally at a level of work you couldn't

129
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:58,439
handle they've been fucking with weed

130
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,819
for centuries yeah and you're telling

131
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:01,079
them about your struggle and your

132
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:02,939
hardship and they're just looking at

133
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,339
we're all cracking up and I'm like oh my

134
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:08,339
god when other countries are laughing at

135
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:11,039
them we used to be revered and then we

136
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:14,239
became less revered because we didn't

137
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,460
catch the fact that the customer

138
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,740
absolutely did everything we did they

139
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:21,959
took the same fucking risk everybody was

140
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:26,160
taking everybody took the risk and so

141
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:30,120
the story isn't about my struggle the

142
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,880
story is about my desire to give you

143
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,459
something equality however hard I have

144
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,759
to do to get it who gives a fuck no one

145
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:42,120
asks the Olympian yeah Usain Bolt that

146
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:45,060
motherfucker ran a million fucking hours

147
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,340
to really only run like 18 total minutes

148
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,259
on the track his whole track career is

149
00:05:47,339 --> 00:05:51,000
like 18 fucking minutes how many

150
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,379
hundreds hundreds of thousands of plants

151
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,538
are you going to look through to find

152
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:56,100
the one that's actually gonna do that

153
00:05:54,538 --> 00:05:59,279
thing that's gonna help that one person

154
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,500
or just it's just about your effort to

155
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:04,859
to produce and give

156
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,459
but it has to be wonderful yeah it has

157
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,840
to be one of honesty where the customer

158
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:12,719
understands I'm trying to meet you

159
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:15,418
halfway I need you to pay me for this

160
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,740
but I'm not trying to fuck you over I'm

161
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:18,740
trying to give you I'm doing my part

162
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,500
being unique but then like how much you

163
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,360
risks doing like what canopy level does

164
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,978
he devote to that and try it out yeah

165
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,979
well no there no longer is there a

166
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:39,899
bottleneck of how much to get rid of so

167
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:42,240
there's no ceiling anymore so it's all

168
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:44,399
about if you can get rid of it if you

169
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,019
have a customer that wants it if you

170
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,418
have that market that once that long

171
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:49,740
flowering sativa which in California I

172
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:51,418
would say right now that's the number

173
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,120
one thing I hear from most dispensaries

174
00:06:51,418 --> 00:06:55,318
is can we get some more sativa but they

175
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,740
don't even know what the fuck that means

176
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,939
sure sure but just as a basis I hear her

177
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,319
too and I'm laughing and I'm like what

178
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:03,240
you want you don't want to pay for

179
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,560
though no no you don't want to pay for

180
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,740
that what they want is they want these

181
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,240
hybrids that that are terpinoline based

182
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,360
and I'm like yeah but that that doesn't

183
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,759
indicate an ethereal High yes

184
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,319
trepinolean is connected to energy as a

185
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,300
fucking as a as a terpene we can

186
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,780
identify that it's impact the human upon

187
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,478
scent does this no there's zerobe

188
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:26,698
there's zero data on smoking it so zero

189
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,079
data on smoking but plenty of data on on

190
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,900
aromatherapy

191
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:33,060
it's the cannabinoids

192
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:34,859
and all the other volatiles combined

193
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,500
that make that effect and what people

194
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:40,379
want is they want what they used to get

195
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,418
from overseas production because it was

196
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:43,860
diverse

197
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:45,839
your equatorial right so you're fucking

198
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,580
with equatorial work well depends where

199
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:50,159
you were but if you were in Europe it

200
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:51,598
was coming out of Africa but but that's

201
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,360
Ash though but that's still not going to

202
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,279
be considered a sativa and even though

203
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,780
we no States we had the sativas the

204
00:07:56,279 --> 00:08:00,478
states wanted everything coming up out

205
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:02,758
of Colombia but 50s and 60s they had

206
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,579
they had they had access to India though

207
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:08,460
right so Europe has access to India so

208
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:11,758
India and those parts of Asia Africa

209
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:14,279
feed Europe America was fed by like hash

210
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,598
moving from Asia and then herb moving

211
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:20,939
from Colombia from Mexico right Jamaica

212
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:22,800
was the way the layover Point yeah and

213
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:24,379
Jamaica was moving herb too but like the

214
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,500
amount of Colombian coming in was

215
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:29,939
Jamaica was halfway between Colombians

216
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:33,240
but it's a great growing zone too but

217
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,918
amazing yeah in the culture it's still a

218
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,899
type and so the thing is when people

219
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:38,579
talk about what they want I'm like you

220
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:41,038
realize you can't grow that in the

221
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,719
United States and so then we hybridize

222
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,519
it and we like we're hybridized and I'm

223
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,140
like yeah we modernize it we modernize

224
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:48,000
it changed it now I'm not getting the

225
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,039
same Clear Lucid effect no that's why

226
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,320
that's why we have to quantify that

227
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,480
lucid effect and then be able to

228
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,339
identify it in the Fino hunt so you can

229
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,839
modernize things well you look through a

230
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,640
thousand or a hundred thousand of them

231
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,640
and find that one that has the bud

232
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:04,319
structure the COA looking for but also

233
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,059
carries through that effect that you

234
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,399
started off looking for well when when

235
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:09,778
people are asking for sativa though they

236
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,480
don't give a fuck about anything other

237
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:14,179
than that part and so the problem is

238
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,800
it's it's effective

239
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:19,679
and it's really hard to do hundred

240
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,539
thousand plant population sifs and

241
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,278
actual accurately determine the

242
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:25,019
qualities because like

243
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,000
I mean I can I think the most I've done

244
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,220
in a day was like 50.

245
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,720
where I ran through 50 and I pulled out

246
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,759
the two outliers

247
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,560
and someone challenged me and said

248
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:35,458
there's no way you did it I said I'll do

249
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,539
it in the mouse do it again tomorrow

250
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:39,119
give me give me the whole batch again

251
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:40,679
we'll do it again the plant was growing

252
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,539
the plant was in a bag it was in a bag

253
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:45,000
right in the bag so I had samples

254
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:46,379
anything full is fully sampling I went

255
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,299
through 50 of them went through 50 of

256
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:49,980
them and said these are the two

257
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:52,939
and someone was like that's impossible I

258
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,259
said no no it's quick because I'm I'm

259
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:57,420
calibrated so like that means that like

260
00:09:55,259 --> 00:09:59,220
I'm pretty clear what where where my

261
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:01,139
whole life becoming a cannabis

262
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,759
calibration machine where yeah we're on

263
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:04,919
believing that these things stand out

264
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,480
and I can explain no respect I feel that

265
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:09,259
and then when we when we taste great

266
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,019
what is this that's the it's a it's a

267
00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:15,360
Testarossa to uh it's uh yes I want to

268
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:17,759
say it's cherry pie black lime reserve

269
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,320
and a Skittle it's from uh Dutch Blues I

270
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,419
guess I can kind of taste the skin yeah

271
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:24,060
the Skittles but light you know but the

272
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:26,699
the line the lime and the cherry and

273
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:28,379
this is from Dutch too so even at the

274
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,759
end of this it's still super tasty yeah

275
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:31,980
it holds it a roach and it's super

276
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,480
resistant I think there's a problem you

277
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,580
know consumer education because again

278
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,220
it's just like I think lack of education

279
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:41,278
has provided for this huge overflow of

280
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,839
shit weed on the market versus something

281
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,299
good like this where you're not going to

282
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,160
roll a joints taste it but even if they

283
00:10:45,299 --> 00:10:50,159
were educated it doesn't change the fact

284
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:51,958
that the production the main problem in

285
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,759
cannabis to me

286
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,619
if I had to put my fucking finger around

287
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,078
like say one thing about this that you

288
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,139
think is real is that the customers were

289
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:03,719
not considered in legal cannabis

290
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:05,879
they're they're a tax generator their

291
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,379
only consideration is how much tax can

292
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:09,379
be struck in from their pockets

293
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,439
that's because that's what regulation

294
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,060
creates regulation creates industries

295
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,160
that are meant uh not on your happiness

296
00:11:15,059 --> 00:11:19,500
but on the tax revenue so when you've

297
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:22,019
got that tax revenue everything's good

298
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,639
no one's asking the customer what can

299
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:26,159
you afford

300
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:28,139
what is a price range that is reasonable

301
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,299
to you that would allow us to be able to

302
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:33,120
figure out what we have to do to make

303
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:36,240
that happen how many of you really would

304
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,399
like to have ethereal how often do you

305
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,139
want to consume it I know the patterns

306
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,759
because I researched the patterns right

307
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:43,679
so I just observe them throughout life

308
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,838
yeah and why observe them do life but I

309
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,179
also like look at the data so I can use

310
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,700
my intuition and then I can ask

311
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:51,838
questions and then use the data to prove

312
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,120
the answer

313
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,620
and what I know is certain demographics

314
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,560
just do certain things no matter where

315
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,778
we are and so you know where there's

316
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,099
zones of high sales and you have zones

317
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:04,379
of no sales

318
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,720
and what you want to be able to do is

319
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:08,879
try to understand you know how do we get

320
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,180
the products that have the Velocity into

321
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:15,120
the right velocity areas at the right

322
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:17,039
rate of production so that we don't

323
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,560
slow it down so that they never get

324
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,299
anything that is going to be less than

325
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:22,799
satisfactory we all know that you can

326
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:25,259
age herb well

327
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:28,439
but when you leave when the herb leaves

328
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:30,958
your farm it's rarely refrigerated till

329
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,820
sale it's out of your control it's out

330
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,919
of your control that's where major

331
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,839
disconnects between the farmer and the

332
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,399
consumer huge disconnect and and the

333
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,019
consumer just knows that there are

334
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,299
conversations gone or there used to be a

335
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,500
farmer consumer conversation yes and

336
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:46,199
they're and they and that's where they

337
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,360
they made you know the sin of it and so

338
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,519
farmers can go to like stores and talk

339
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,220
to some customers but all you did was

340
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,740
talk to a cluster of customers at One

341
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,120
calendar or you were in the building and

342
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,100
people had to walk there they had a

343
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,419
desire to talk to you and you had there

344
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,000
you would one day

345
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:05,099
and there was 364 other days you weren't

346
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,320
there so how many fucking potential

347
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,379
customers did you really catch and how

348
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,480
many days of the week can you go sit in

349
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:14,939
a dispensary

350
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,420
who's running your operations

351
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:21,360
no craft farmer has squads of workers

352
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:23,519
anymore you're the your worker owner and

353
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,039
part of the distribution process you're

354
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,799
the marketer you wrote them things and

355
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,599
so what it does is the Regulatory

356
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:33,120
Compliance officer the sales team yeah

357
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,459
and so like the only way that so to me

358
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,200
when he was asking you know like what do

359
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,578
you do with these really long flowering

360
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,519
things it's the same thing that I do

361
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:44,039
with with odd products I grow weird shit

362
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,259
all the time that's what the fun is yeah

363
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:49,559
and what it does it allows me to because

364
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:50,759
I meet so many people it lets me say hey

365
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,099
you want to check out some really

366
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:54,480
interesting shit right yeah I guess so I

367
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,220
get some rosin in my pocket I'll break

368
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,600
out right because it's the example it is

369
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:02,720
so I don't even smoke Rising that much

370
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,720
anymore and my buddy sends me some rosin

371
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:10,578
basketball through

372
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,579

377
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:24,778
was it was cold it was shipped cold

378
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:27,000
because it's winter and then it uh

379
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:30,058
yourself

380
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,058
[Applause]

a goodie and so this is this is uh

382
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:40,620
um picket OG from lime Rising on a

383
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:42,839
Michigan okay right and so bickett was a

384
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,839
GMO that got pollinated by a cherry pie

385
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,720
accidental pollination except that Nick

386
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,760
was able to say I wonder how the seeds

387
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,680
turned out cracked a bunch of the seeds

388
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:55,139
and lo and behold out comes this outlier

389
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,219
just unbelievable quality right so I can

390
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:58,320
smell you

391
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,778
oh yeah that's good that's better right

392
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,879
there boy beautiful consistency yeah I

393
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:06,740
think terp wizard made these

394
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:09,179
well I'm getting like strawberry

395
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,940
a little orange orange strawberry cream

396
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:14,159
yeah it's got an interesting Citrus too

397
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:16,019
it almost has like a like an alcohol

398
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:18,240
that's coming off of it almost like when

399
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:20,459
you're when you're fermenting fruit to

400
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,680
make like a fruit booze you can smell

401
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:25,518
that sweetness oh yeah wine fermented

402
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:28,078
pineapple yeah

403
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,899
but it's stuff that's you know it's it's

404
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,458
it's stuff that's uh off the norm and

405
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,759
what you're able to do is you take stuff

406
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:38,518
like this and and this is what I would

407
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,720
share with somebody that I that I met so

408
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,100
when you would ask the question that's

409
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,820
what we're answering

410
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,560
that if one wants to grow some of these

411
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,480
odd varieties

412
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,859
what do you do with them well what

413
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,039
you're doing with them is you're using

414
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:55,379
them as your differentiator and you're

415
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:57,838
not necessarily producing even enough to

416
00:15:55,379 --> 00:16:00,360
sell you're producing enough so that

417
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,800
when you're present in the world you can

418
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,539
say to people

419
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:05,759
these are the things that I'm into that

420
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:07,799
I would like to sell and then you can

421
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,600
let them experience and then gauge the

422
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:11,219
interest and talk about what would you

423
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,920
be willing to spend for this because I

424
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,600
have to charge 22 percent more because I

425
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,439
can't get it to the market any fucking

426
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,778
less

427
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,399
I'm somebody that used to run 140 day

428
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:23,039
shit right like I mean I went out there

429
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,899
I eat hostile yeah I went out every year

430
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,519
I went out there to the 140 day fucking

431
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,440
like indoors I would run I would I was

432
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,480
on a haze quest for a while where I

433
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,760
hooked up with I hooked up with Neville

434
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,800
but I hooked up with Scott Blakey

435
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,259
out of uh uh at the time he was in

436
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:39,599
Switzerland and so Blakey was sending me

437
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:41,278
every fucking Haze variety that I that I

438
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,399
mean I had boxes of this shit coming in

439
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:47,039
and I was going on this Quest and I was

440
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,179
cracking up because some fire stuff came

441
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,879
out of Switzerland people don't think

442
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:52,620
it's Switzerland oh yeah well it was it

443
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:55,379
was they moved from Holland when I it's

444
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,480
kind of like San Francisco well San

445
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:59,159
Francisco was the birth of cannabis in

446
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,339
in California in terms of medical

447
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:04,918
cannabis San Francisco turns its back on

448
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:06,720
the medical community Oakland said we

449
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,759
will embrace you and that's how Oakland

450
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,699
became the new medical marijuana capital

451
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:14,459
of California was that San Francisco

452
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:16,439
birthed it rejected it Oakland adopts it

453
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,679
Oakland stands up

454
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:21,959
Holland is the hot spot in Europe

455
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:24,480
Holland tightens up Switzerland opens up

456
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,980
Switzerland compresses Switzerland opens

457
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,439
up again right now Switzerland just went

458
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,058
legal oh there's huge greenhouses in

459
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,500
Switzerland right now but the point of

460
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:33,660
it is the cool stuff was that I had

461
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,759
access to all this European Haze stock

462
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,620
from guys that were playing around with

463
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,000
it at every level so every hybrid every

464
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:40,319
every derivative of it I was getting

465
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,419
stopped if you haven't seen since the

466
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,579
90s what kinds of crazy shit so I went

467
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:46,440
on this crazy run for a while and I had

468
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:48,779
I had a

469
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:51,538
a building that I could play with

470
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:53,460
and I was just sifting and hunting and

471
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:55,740
looking and playing and learning of what

472
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,500
it's like to go 142 days into a flower

473
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,440
cycle it's hilarious is it done yet is

474
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,119
it done right now it's not done yet and

475
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,019
you have to learn about and all of a

476
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,019
sudden sometimes you turn around and

477
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:09,240
it's done nuances that like any any

478
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:11,579
fertilization more than optimal in the

479
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,380
plant just folds up it's like you're

480
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:16,339
having to learn how to manipulate a

481
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,900
plant that wants to be 25 feet tall

482
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:21,119
and you get all that work done and you

483
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,400
realize that out of that population it

484
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:25,439
was pretty good so you go 142 days and

485
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,880
it's pretty good so in order to find the

486
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,660
outlier someone's going to be able to

487
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:34,440
commit a tremendous amount of detailed

488
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:36,120
research work to find it and now what is

489
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,798
it worth and who's willing to do it and

490
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:39,058
how much of it can move into a market it

491
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:41,099
depends on the individual and the

492
00:18:39,058 --> 00:18:43,379
problem with these varieties is that

493
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:45,359
they're really fragile and that's why

494
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,039
they were created as flour because they

495
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,599
held together better because they're all

496
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,460
equatorial so they always stayed

497
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:53,519
moisture and softer they didn't crumble

498
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:55,200
you took an equatorial put into a dry

499
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,660
environment that shit turns into sawdust

500
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,279
in a bag will not handle Transit does

501
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,759
not handle

502
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,619
and that that creates problems for

503
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:05,940
sellability and so to me what you what

504
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:08,699
you do is you

505
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,980
you realize that the market can only

506
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,500
take so much of any one thing

507
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:16,319
and and what I do is I break up I I

508
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,940
break up a division into at least four

509
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,859
or five categories because really the

510
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:22,320
distributor wants

511
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:24,839
Indigo sativa hybrid

512
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,220
right this girl asks for three things I

513
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:27,899
want do you have it looks like you're

514
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,579
finished do you have a sativa do you

515
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,740
have a hybrid it looks like it does it

516
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:33,659
have color is it over 25 percent

517
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,919
you answer one of those fucking

518
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,480
questions correctly you're selling some

519
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:39,240
weeds

520
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,000
and the problem though is that

521
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,620
that originally had to come from the

522
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,119
equator so it cuts out so much right so

523
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:47,279
good but within that but within that

524
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:50,699
grouping though it lets you say okay

525
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:52,019
well if they want some sativa then and

526
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,259
and even though we're going to say all

527
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:56,339
cannabis is sativa because it is

528
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:58,379
interesting yeah you gotta give it a

529
00:19:56,339 --> 00:20:00,480
good pinch

530
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:03,380
yeah that's all hazy shit that old shoe

531
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,380
leather uh-huh

532
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:07,319
super loose structure but like I bet you

533
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:10,700
there's probably all kinds of weird

534
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:10,700
little things in there oh yeah yeah

535
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:17,819
it looks like like a rice like a rice

536
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,620
head or something someone is stronger I

537
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:22,439
ever smoked was I was working out on

538
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:24,959
this island called uh panape out

539
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,480
Micronesia right so you go from

540
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,880
California to Hawaii continue on that

541
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,440
same equatorial line and you'll go

542
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,000
another couple thousand miles and you'll

543
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,860
get into the the micronesian island

544
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,960
chain and then you keep going a little

545
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:39,479
further you start getting into like uh

546
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,759
uh New Guinea and then Australia right

547
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,298
so you're around that side of the world

548
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:46,919
so on that island upon a bay

549
00:20:44,298 --> 00:20:48,839
uh me and the we I was in the military

550
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,220
then but we were hanging out with this

551
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:51,839
dude in the bar and there was a brawl

552
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,279
and we backed the guy up we were hanging

553
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,659
out with well I didn't know that the guy

554
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,579
I was hanging out with was really a

555
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,259
criminal like we were just hanging out

556
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:00,178
but me and my pot in the fucking we went

557
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:01,200
we fought with with him against them

558
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:04,080
dudes

559
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,880
and he was so happy that he was like man

560
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,019
he goes he finds a Grace like you know

561
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,820
what do you really want and I said man

562
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:11,579
I'm looking for some weed and he was

563
00:21:08,819 --> 00:21:13,740
like oh I got you and the next day we

564
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:16,439
went to the other side of the island and

565
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:18,359
this this cat in a little tiny pickup

566
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,980
truck meets us and says I brought you

567
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:21,599
some weed I'm like right where is it and

568
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:23,400
he pulls back the tarp and it was the

569
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:25,500
whole back of the pickup truck nice it

570
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,240
was fucking great nice I'm in the

571
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,659
service though so I'm like that's more

572
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,980
than I can fucking taste much

573
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:34,500
it looks like it's in my backpack right

574
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,599
so I filled my backpack and and I filled

575
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,640
the backpack they didn't smoke it and

576
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:40,379
then stashed it in the ship and then

577
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,380
when I got to port and back home in

578
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,520
Hawaii I ship some to my buddy and I'm

579
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,020
still not holding so I was getting drug

580
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:47,460
tested constantly at the time right so

581
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:50,220
we getting constant drug tests they

582
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,140
would test you like Friday night

583
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,120
and then Monday morning they would be in

584
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,380
the bathroom with the piss test cups and

585
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:56,759

586
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,900

587
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:58,859
telling them you don't go to piss at

588
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,298
five in the morning when you're holding

589
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,000
your dick in your hand like no I don't

590
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:04,079

591
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,119
and so they get you on these Friday

592
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,558
Monday fucking tests right oh I was in

593
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,119
the service when they were skimming

594
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:11,158
people off of dope right

595
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,599
and so I was like fuck and I had just

596
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:14,460
fucking been in trouble as a kid for

597
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:16,019
dope and I just didn't want to fucking

598
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,519
embarrass my grandmother I was I'm

599
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:20,099
serious if I didn't have a good

600
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,599
grandmother oh so my good grandmother I

601
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:22,980
went embarrass her so I do my best not

602
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:24,480
to get caught so I'm holding the weed

603
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,919
until I can have a little break where I

604
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,179
know I'm safe

605
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,980
and

606
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,419
when I smoked it I got so fucking high

607
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,279
that I couldn't figure out how to get

608
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:34,320
the car off the highway and I kept

609
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:37,558
driving in circles until finally I came

610
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:39,240
down and could navigate an off-ramp but

611
00:22:37,558 --> 00:22:41,220
I sent it to my pot this shit looked

612
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,558
like hey it was probably like 12 it was

613
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,360
the worst looking there like that but I

614
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:47,460
just knew that it was it and I was

615
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,379
already herb knowledgeable at that time

616
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,940
but I just knew that these people that

617
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:53,640
were cultivating and consuming it

618
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,798
weren't casually using it they had a

619
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:57,419
relationship with it and I knew that

620
00:22:55,798 --> 00:22:59,639
this equatorial cannabis would be

621
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:01,259
unbelievably psychoactive

622
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:03,299
I sent it to my partner though he hits

623
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:06,298
me up and he's like bro he goes you send

624
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:07,679
me away he goes you look like shit so I

625
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:09,359
didn't even think nothing of it he goes

626
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,340
so I sat down and I smoked a joint on

627
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,599
the toilet before I went to work and he

628
00:23:11,339 --> 00:23:13,859
goes by the time I was done smoking The

629
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,538
Joint I couldn't get off the toilet I

630
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,219
couldn't like really navigate standing

631
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:19,859
up and he goes and I had to have my girl

632
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:22,019
call in and tell him I was sick and I

633
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:24,959
was fucking dying right he's like bro he

634
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:26,579
goes it was fucking brutal he goes can I

635
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,980
have some more

636
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:30,779
so that was some of the strongest herb I

637
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,099
ever smoked in my entire life the impact

638
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:33,418
it had on me when I mean I remember

639
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:34,980
driving that car around the island

640
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:38,640
Hawaii and every time I got to the off

641
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:40,980
ramp I would like panic and not be able

642
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,679
to navigate getting the car off and I

643
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,960
would drive around the island again for

644
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,460
three hours I just was like at some

645
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,798
point I'll come down

646
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,380
and I'm just hoping the gas stays in the

647
00:23:49,798 --> 00:23:53,279
rig you know that that's still between

648
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,780
the white

649
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,980
line yeah and someone said it was

650
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:57,899
because of this because of that I said

651
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,400
no no it's because the psychoactivity it

652
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,659
was just really unique yeah it's a

653
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,980
marriage of things that are in there

654
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:03,480
stuff you don't even understand no no

655
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,460
and I don't think we will almost

656
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,538
ethereal stuff and I hope we don't you

657
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,159
know there's still terpenes that are

658
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:10,259
being named in cannabinoids that are

659
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,520
being discovered like and and we don't

660
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:13,619
understand it's kind of like when you

661
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,720
take toxins and you mix them in the

662
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:17,759
ground they form new toxins so you can

663
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,319
have toxicology experts to tell you hey

664
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:20,579
that dioxin does this but we don't know

665
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:22,759
what dachshund does when it's mixed with

666
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:26,339
buttermilism

667
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:28,319
yes yes some other stuff in there you

668
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,819
don't really know about this point three

669
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,519
percent CBN let's just see what happens

670
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:34,200
it becomes a new deal and so for me you

671
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:36,000
know what you're looking at is you're

672
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,679
you're gonna most Farms are gonna pick

673
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,599
up clones from a nursery

674
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,919
that most most of them unless you have

675
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,139
unless you're running your own Nursery

676
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:44,820
which is expensive because you're having

677
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:48,000
to you're having to actually like keep

678
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:49,859
living plants alive doing the job you

679
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,419
get from a nursery what you want to do

680
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:53,519
is you want to get as many Nursery lists

681
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,780
as possible and put them together and if

682
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,579
you could you could put them into a

683
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:58,440
fucking into a spreadsheet and say okay

684
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:59,939
give it to me by over production and

685
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,320
you're going to see some numbers come

686
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:03,179
out that are going to be unbelievably

687
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:05,279
overproduced where you're going to say

688
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:07,559
listen they know this is hot and they're

689
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,058
going to flood the market with it and

690
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:10,619
what's going to happen is anybody in

691
00:25:09,058 --> 00:25:13,079
those zones if you don't catch this

692
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:14,279
first little initial wave you're sitting

693
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,480
on a river of it because there's too

694
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,740
many choices

695
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,620
so then you have to go through the list

696
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:22,679
and say okay where do we see reasonable

697
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:24,599
numbers and does that work for me in my

698
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:26,880
situation because so much of the stuff

699
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:29,579
that's being created and worked on is

700
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,620
from either mixed light or indoor most

701
00:25:29,579 --> 00:25:33,178
operations that are doing outdoor and

702
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:34,619
not doing the release and testing and if

703
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:36,298
you're releasing outdoor for indoor

704
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:37,798
groups you're fucking up and if you're

705
00:25:36,298 --> 00:25:38,700
releasing end off or outdoor groups

706
00:25:37,798 --> 00:25:41,220
you're fucking up because you're

707
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,900
extrapolating data that's not really

708
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,480
accurate you're saying that this means

709
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,580
that it's not applicable it's not it

710
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,880
lets you know I use indoor heavily for

711
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:53,038
flavor so it lets me go through 100 I

712
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,419
can put 100 plants on a table and the

713
00:25:53,038 --> 00:25:56,759
only thing I'm looking for is which one

714
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,740
had the best mouth which went flavored

715
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:00,658
all the way through I pulled that one

716
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,798
out bumped the rest then I could take

717
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:04,200
that outside

718
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:06,119
does it work outdoor because ultimately

719
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,058
what I'm seeking is a transfer of

720
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:11,038
quality where growability I need but if

721
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:14,038
I don't have quality as my primary

722
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:16,019
criteria I can't compete because now I'm

723
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:18,778
in the mid market and I'm competing

724
00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:20,519
against 500 000 pound players

725
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:23,519
so I have to go with really really

726
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,778
really full flavors and I have to be

727
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,298
aware that

728
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:28,679
not all flavors are attractive and so

729
00:26:27,298 --> 00:26:30,119
some of the unattractive ones are

730
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:31,919
attractive to certain groups and but you

731
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:33,839
need to make sure that you know that

732
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,640
yeah yeah you have to make sure you

733
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,639
understand how many people want cheese

734
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:42,058
it goes a long time it goes along

735
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,220
regionally though right so like if

736
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:46,980
you're in Michigan cheese and Earth are

737
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:49,500
by far your two dominant flavor profiles

738
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,179
that you see but where in California and

739
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,740
you're looking for you're looking for

740
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:55,140
some kind of citrus and some kind of

741
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,480
fuel so in the Caribbean you're looking

742
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,759
for fruits

743
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,798
and then where did the skunks go fucking

744
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,240
disappear

745
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:04,740
and the real skunks man I I've been

746
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,778
digging for years too like I didn't

747
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,700
expect it to be this difficult but I

748
00:27:06,778 --> 00:27:10,558
find stuff that's skunky and we would

749
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,319
say skunky just means that it's got a

750
00:27:10,558 --> 00:27:15,480
high sulfur content and it's high high

751
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:17,460
volatility so that when I touch the

752
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,900
plant it releases and fills the room so

753
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,120
when I cut you don't even touch the

754
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,460
plant when I'm cutting clones and it

755
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:26,038
fills the building with no combustion no

756
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,740
no finished plant but the problem is

757
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:31,980
that it doesn't transfer to that

758
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:35,220
ammonia-like skunk and and what it did

759
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:37,679
to you where it was an ultra narcotic

760
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,900
and the impact on you was profound where

761
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,659
you never had such bloodshot eyes you

762
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,759
never had such a dry mouth and you were

763
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:47,220
never so like wow that stuff is sedative

764
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:48,778
I can't find it yeah it's gone and I'm

765
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:50,159
digging through no I'm sure it'll exists

766
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:51,720
somewhere just the genetics are still

767
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,580
there yeah let's see this somewhere and

768
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,558
it wasn't that I was trying to

769
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:58,099
a lot of the stuff I just haven't looked

770
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:58,099
for in a long time

771
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,740
but just even the smell

772
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,659
it doesn't have the smell it doesn't

773
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,519
happen

774
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:10,020
it doesn't have the key and so like I've

775
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:12,599
got some killer ones that I got out of

776
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:14,460
the mid 80s out of Europe that are more

777
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:15,599
like you know they remind me really of

778
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:18,000
like when you were a kid and you were

779
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,639
dragging your shoe your sneakers on the

780
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,058
concrete like that burnt rubber pencil

781
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,620
eraser burnt rubber and then

782
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:27,119
um I that the one I got that was from

783
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:29,339
the like first of the 80s that I got

784
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:31,199
from Ringo when he passed away

785
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:34,199
um that's super pungent but it's this

786
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,960
musky tropical fruit but the pungency of

787
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,659
it is Supernatural so it had the same

788
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,220
problem that that acrid skunk had where

789
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,960
you couldn't grow it in a house without

790
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,220
it permeating through every square inch

791
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,159
of the fucking without getting busted

792
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,579
yeah exactly yeah but it doesn't have

793
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:52,020
the the aggressive

794
00:28:49,579 --> 00:28:56,220
full-bodied smack you down so back in

795
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:59,038
the day you know gas became to me skunk

796
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,620
chemical and gas are all the same

797
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:04,019
category because really they serve the

798
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:06,178
same Purpose with extremely impactful

799
00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:08,879
highs so things that have a very

800
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:11,159
chemical scent things that have a very

801
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,220
fuel scent things that have a very skunk

802
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:17,039
scent all of them are really aggressive

803
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:19,140
on you in the smoke in a very specific

804
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:22,200
Direction impactful like you're like

805
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:25,440
slowed down and for me

806
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,419
I need it at times I otherwise my mind

807
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,940
moves too fast and it

808
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:33,059
it makes it I wear out the people around

809
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:35,220
me and so it's better if I consume weed

810
00:29:33,058 --> 00:29:37,079
you're doing it for their benefits I

811
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:39,240
mean I am I'm doing I do I'm serious I'm

812
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:41,158
serious I have to slow the fuck down so

813
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,599
that I don't wear out my fucking family

814
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:45,539
members because they're like my old man

815
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:47,939
is a fucking lunatic and your your wife

816
00:29:45,538 --> 00:29:50,579
wants to divorce you so so narcotic

817
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,798
cannabis balances out with me very well

818
00:29:50,579 --> 00:29:54,538
yeah and then I like ethereal stuff when

819
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:55,798
I'm when I'm working by myself and I

820
00:29:54,538 --> 00:29:57,740
just want to be able to like mentally

821
00:29:55,798 --> 00:30:01,740
just fucking fly

822
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:04,319
and so I I use them in the way I need

823
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:06,058
but I can't find that exact profile and

824
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,918
and people try to say like you know it

825
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:09,000
didn't exist or you have memories but I

826
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,080
had a whole collection of them but they

827
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,359
were all in different morphological

828
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,980
forms so they weren't all the same some

829
00:30:12,359 --> 00:30:15,599
of them looked like a leafy cabbage

830
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,460
others had and back then a lot of stuff

831
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,699
was grown from seeds so like what skunk

832
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:23,038
was to one farmer completely but I had a

833
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,679
collection of clones I lost in 201 in a

834
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:27,298
raid and that was like the most after I

835
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,559
lost that collection of 201 I didn't

836
00:30:27,298 --> 00:30:30,900
collect again until like probably two

837
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:35,759
and a half years I just produced

838
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:37,050
