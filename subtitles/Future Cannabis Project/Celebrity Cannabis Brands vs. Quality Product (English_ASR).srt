1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,809
we did the Willie Nelson transaction

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,370
okay we led the series and Willie we

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,660
actually were working very closely with

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,039
the Grateful Dead and the Garcia band

5
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,599
estate as well at the time you know we

6
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,919
were looking really seriously at do we

7
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,210
bring it Grateful Dead cannabis brand to

8
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:14,189
market and that's right when Marly was

9
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,150
being done by privateer and it's right

10
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:17,219
around the same time that you're

11
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,579
watching you know snoop pork with Casa

12
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:22,500
Verde so you know everyone was thinking

13
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:24,299
about the standpoint of you know do you

14
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,518
need a marque sort of an endorser to do

15
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,800
it and the thing I kept hearing that was

16
00:00:26,518 --> 00:00:30,538
consistent across everyone was well the

17
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,859
advertising equivalency of having these

18
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,730
people out there having the name out

19
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,899
there because you know if there's

20
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,488
restrictions in advertising and

21
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:36,899
marketing can you make up for those

22
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:38,488
restrictions by actually having you know

23
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,200
Willie Nelson every single tour stopped

24
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:42,029
wearing a welder's Reserve hat or having

25
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,410
you know Snoop Dogg talking about the

26
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,390
fact he's got some deal with live well

27
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:47,419
in Colorado and that that was gonna you

28
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,320
know drive business but but ultimately

29
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,850
you know you look at the wine industry

30
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,439
and you know while you might have a

31
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,000
couple of wine it's not couple his name

32
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,769
that drives the other sales it's the

33
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,179
underlying product itself okay and I

34
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,980
think with cannabis you know it's I

35
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:01,859
think right now what's becoming hotter

36
00:00:58,979 --> 00:01:03,808
are specific genetics are still hot and

37
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,540
then specific growers that are putting

38
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:09,658
those genetics out what made Willie

39
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:13,409
Nelson's likeness compelling to you I

40
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:16,609
voted against it only person on the

41
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,609
investment committee that said no
