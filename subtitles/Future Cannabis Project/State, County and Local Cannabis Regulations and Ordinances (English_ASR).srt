1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,649
[Music]

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,519
Lynn is going to talk to us about two

3
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:25,960
things today Federal so you're going to

4
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:27,439
learn about the feds and also she's

5
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,080
going to give you a short summary on

6
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,039
what's going on in the state so thank

7
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,719
you so much one of the greatest

8
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,160
challenges right now is lack of

9
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,480
information and misinformation about

10
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:40,640
what's going on so this is a great way

11
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:44,439
to educate the broader Community that's

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:49,239
directly interested um in this issue so

13
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:51,679
um on November 8th we legalized cannabis

14
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:51,679
in

15
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:57,640
California it was a long haul and I know

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,518
a lot of people had different opinions

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,239
about it and and that's okay and there

18
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:05,920
was a lot lot of people involved in in

19
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:09,560
the Drafting and I think um it was it

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,879
was really the best piece of legislation

21
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,519
um that we could have possibly come out

22
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,560
of there with given the broad array of

23
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:19,319
stakeholders who had a say in this

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,280
everybody from the governor to the

25
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:25,919
police to the industry to patients to um

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,960
anti-marijuana groups and on and on and

27
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:33,118
on and so um but really the biggest task

28
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:35,719
ask is implementing this law um a lot of

29
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,478
people say hey we won we're done and you

30
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:40,158
know you have crazy things going on like

31
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:43,078
the prop 64 compliant Cannabis stores

32
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,079
that does not exist and there is no such

33
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:48,478
thing you have lots of um people taking

34
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:51,118
advantage of new folks like you trying

35
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,959
to get into the industry um saying you

36
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,560
know give me $20,000 I'll get you a

37
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:57,639
license there are no licenses well just

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,399
a few cities in the state have licenses

39
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,280
but for for the most part there are no

40
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,239
licenses anybody who wants to say um you

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,519
know $20,000 I give you a license don't

42
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:09,719
believe them so there's there's a lot

43
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:12,598
going on what I'm going to do tonight is

44
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:16,120
um really just talk about two huge

45
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:18,878
issues um the first is probably the most

46
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:22,480
important uh because with what's going

47
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:25,199
on in Washington DC we may not be able

48
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,799
to actually have a legal cannabis Market

49
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:31,318
here in California despite what happened

50
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,840
uh on November 8th so you may know that

51
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:36,199
um the Attorney General of the United

52
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:38,598
States Jeff sessions is um thinks

53
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:41,719
marijuana is the worst thing he's ever

54
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:42,919
yeah boo how many people know about Jeff

55
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:45,519
sessions just raise your hand if you

56
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:46,719
have a good sense okay most most of the

57
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,120
people so I'm just going to give you one

58
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:52,000
of his quotes to give you an idea of of

59
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,039
who he is he said he thought the klex

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,919
clan was a pretty good group until he

61
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,919
found out they used marijuana

62
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,238
so he continues to threaten yeah so this

63
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,120
is who we're dealing with right um he

64
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:11,959
continues to threaten to come in and

65
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,519
shut down uh marijuana markets in the

66
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,280
states that have recreational marijuana

67
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,120
he he has said for the most part he's

68
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,000
not going to interfere with medical um

69
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,519
unless there's a gross violation going

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,959
on but he is threatening pending the

71
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,560
resources he can Garner to come in and

72
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,719
shut down Colorado Washington California

73
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,799
um so what we've done at the drug policy

74
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:37,080
Alliance and I I don't I don't know if I

75
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:39,680
mentioned that you said who I was okay

76
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,799
okay so I'm Lyn Lyman sorry I'm the I'm

77
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,680
the state director for the drug policy

78
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:46,319
Alliance um so and and we work on more

79
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,438
than just marijuana let me say that we

80
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,599
are trying to end the drug war outright

81
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:52,639
that's what we're trying to

82
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:56,400
[Applause]

83
00:03:52,639 --> 00:04:00,000
do so um so we have a bill this year in

84
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,438
the legislature it's assembly Bill 1578

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,519
and um we have information about it in

86
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:06,318
the back my colleague cat Packer back

87
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,120
there by the table razor hand cat a lot

88
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,359
of you may already know

89
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,158
her so there's information about the

90
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,439
bill there but essentially what the bill

91
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:17,439
does is it says that California law

92
00:04:14,438 --> 00:04:20,560
enforcement and tax dollars cannot be

93
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:22,639
used to help the feds interfere with our

94
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,519
marijuana

95
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,720
Market AB absent a court order so um

96
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:31,198
that that doesn't stop intervention

97
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,240
completely because the feds can still

98
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,800
come in on their own but there's only

99
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,079
4,000 DEA agents for the whole country

100
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,720
so there's only so many people they're

101
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:43,079
going to be able to send in without the

102
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:47,160
help of our local cops um as you might

103
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:49,439
imagine the police Lobby is pushing back

104
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,400
really hard against this bill as is the

105
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,680
league of cities the league of cities is

106
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:57,879
one of the strongest lobbying arms in

107
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,360
Sacramento they represent the 480 cities

108
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:02,319
um but they are lobbying along with the

109
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,879
police Chiefs to stop this bill because

110
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,399
they want to be able to cooperate with

111
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:06,680
the feds and shut you down that is

112
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:09,198
exactly what they want to do they want

113
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:12,160
to bring in um The Wrath of the federal

114
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,879
government to get this done so um so

115
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,919
that's assembly Bill 1578 the author is

116
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,240
assemblyman Reggie Jones Sawyer right

117
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:20,719
here at a South La if you don't know who

118
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,079
he is you should write it down and

119
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,800
Google him there's only a handful of

120
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:27,800
cannabis friendly truly cannabis

121
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,079
friendly legislators in Sacramento and

122
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,560
so you should know who they are you

123
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:32,599

124
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,079
campaigns they really stick their necks

00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:40,039
out there um for our

126
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:41,839
issues so um so uh I I would ask you all

127
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:44,360

128

135
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,960
we did make it through our First Comm

136
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,000
committee which was the Public Safety

137
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,519
Committee we did we did win that vote

138

going to be on the assembly floor and we

140
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,759
expect expect it to be a pretty big

141
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,478
battle um if any of you have

142
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,160
relationships with your um local mayor

143
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:20,120
City Council Members we're trying to get

144
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,639
um cannabis friendly cities to come out

145
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,800
and say that um that that they uh

146
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,319
support this bill West Hollywood I

147
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,598
believe will be the first city to do

148
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,360
that that vote's coming up next week um

149
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:32,000
here in West Hollywood

150
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,759
so that's that's the assembly bill

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,560
that's the that's the federal piece

152
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,759
other things going on um from the

153
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,759
federal level uh really at this point is

154
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,479
just trying to stop the madness um the

155
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:46,240
the bills that we've been moving for

156
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,359
many years in the federal government are

157
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,280
still there you know and they're

158
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,319
bipartisan bills they get more

159
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,318
Republican votes each year and these are

160
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,759
bills that address the the banking

161
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,680
problem um dress PTSD for veterans so um

162
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:02,560
in terms of an actual marijuana

163
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,959
legalization bill at the federal level

164
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,759
nobody's bothering with that at this

165
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:07,198
point right now we're just trying to fix

166
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,560
some of some of the issues we've been

167
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,800
trying to fixed for

168
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,839
years um so I'm going to move on to the

169
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,918
state because I think that's where um

170
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:18,359
there's so much going on and

171
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:20,918
um way more than I can talk to you about

172
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,400
tonight uh but but how many people have

173
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:29,878
heard of the governor's trer Bill

174
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:34,519
language raise your hand okay okay so um

175
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:40,160
prop 64 uh like Mera or now M

176
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:43,560
mura um are both uh intended to be uh to

177
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,000
go into implementation on January 1st so

178
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,120
licensing is supposed to begin on

179
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,918
January 1 under prop 64 because it's a

180
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,639
voter mandated initiative um they have

181
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:56,000
to or or they will be in violation and

182
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,478
we would be able to sue them um so they

183
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,680
have to start recreational by the 1 they

184
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:03,800
are they already started on medical so I

185
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,319
I do believe that both um both licensing

186
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,598
types will go into effect then but there

187
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,560
is a bloody battle going on between now

188
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,560
really just the rest of the next month

189
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,038
about what those regs are going to look

190
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,280
like and what the framework is going to

191
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:21,800
be so there were differences between

192
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:24,239
prop 64 and and the medical regulations

193
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,879
um and so you'll hear this term

194
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,720
reconciliation that's what everybody's

195
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,400
talking about how how is the government

196
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,278
going to reconcile the differences

197
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:36,399
between the two bills and there's a

198
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,240
number of issues at stake uh again if if

199
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,799
you are in this trying to get into this

200
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,080
business in a serious way you really

201
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:46,838
want to know about the trailer Bill

202
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,360
language it's trailer Bill 200 um and so

203
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,720
what I know that there's some people in

204
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,959
here who who have specific questions it

205
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,440
touches on everything it eliminates the

206
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,439
so the governor put out his language

207
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,040
again that's what reconciliation is

208
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,440
there's the medical regs there's prop 64

209
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,719
and then a couple of weeks ago the

210
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,360
governor put out his hybrid um

211
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,639
essentially of how he wants things to go

212
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,360
forward and the process is that for the

213
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:12,600
next month he has to negotiate with the

214
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,879
legislature uh about what's going to be

215
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,759
in there there are many people in the

216
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:18,078
legislature who aren't happy with what

217
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,679
he did there are some people who are

218
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:21,519
there are some Advocates who are happier

219
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,239
with him there are others who aren't

220
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,679
there's people all across the Spectrum

221
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:30,039
on the issues and so uh the final

222
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:32,000
language will be part of the California

223
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:34,159
state budget that's how it works and the

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,919
budget has to pass by June 1st so

225
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:40,759
there's not a lot of time to weigh in on

226
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:44,399
everything from Dual licensing

227
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:47,039
collocation um medical cards testing and

228
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,759
labeling I mean he's that everything is

229
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,159
almost like everything is up for grabs

230
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:52,838
again and now we have a month to figure

231
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,719
it all out um so I'm just going to pause

232
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,079
and see if anybody has a specific

233
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,800
question about reconciliation or or the

234
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:00,879
trailer Bill language because there are

235
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,159
dozens of issues and I don't have time

236
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,679
to go through them all does anybody have

237
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:07,399
a question you said something about

238
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,039
cocation

239
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:13,039
coing can you explain that collocation

240
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:16,240
cocation so um what the governor is

241
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:18,639
proposing um on one hand is a unitary

242
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,959
regulatory system between recreational

243
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:24,958
and medical with two different license

244
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,958
types and a medical license and a

245
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,119
recreational license that part we think

246
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:31,119
is a really good idea and the reason is

247
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,919
that that when the feds come they're

248
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,278
coming for recreational so anybody who

249
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,360
really wants to hold on and and hold

250
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:40,559
their place in the medical Market it

251
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,879
makes sense so you don't lose everything

252
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:43,159
that if you are going to lose something

253
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:45,559
you just lose the one side of your

254
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:48,199
business what the governor also did that

255
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:50,599
some people have more of a concern with

256
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,680
um is he said that you can't be in the

257
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,000
same space so you can have both a

258
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,399
medical and a recreational say um retail

259
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,839
license or manufacturers license you

260
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:03,159
can't be in the same physical space

261
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,959
so um it's it's not the kind of issue

262
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:09,039
that that me as as a as a social justice

263
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:10,479
Advocate we're going to weigh in on but

264
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,360
they're important issues for those of

265
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,320
you in the industry um and there's a

266
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,839
number of groups who represent the

267
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,278
industry in Sacramento the California

268
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:21,959
Cannabis industry Association the

269
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,078
California manufacturers Association Etc

270
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:26,958
there's a number of them and so if one

271
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:29,319
of these issues pertains to your the the

272
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,638
part of the business you're in um you

273
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,360
going to want to get involved with those

274
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,560
folks so but that is the issue at stake

275
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,919
that he's saying you can't be in the

276
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:38,838
same physical

277
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:40,759
space hi I'm Aaron with kisur Brands um

278
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,240
can you just go a little deeper on that

279
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:45,720
uh medical and recreational side in

280
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,039
terms of uh you know where what they're

281
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:52,399
allowing you if you go recreational that

282
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:54,599
will affect um the the licensing itself

283
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:58,759
sure so um in

284
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,399
2015 the legislature passed um so in

285
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,679
2015 I see you're getting your camera so

286
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,839
I'm going to say it again for you so

287
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,479
he's like videotape so in 2015 the

288
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,760
legislature passed and the governor

289
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,039
signed was then MCA the medical

290
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:13,399
marijuana regulatory act or something

291
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:15,879
like that um and it was the first time

292
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,320
in California's 20-year history of legal

293
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:20,879
cannabis that we have had state

294
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,879
regulations but those regulations are

295
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,198
not set to take place and to go into

296
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:28,639
effect until January 1st of

297
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:29,759
2018 so when we wrote prop 64 we aligned

298
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,039
the timing

299
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,799
so they have to give out the

300
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:38,278
recreational licenses in January 1st as

301
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:40,120
well um if if there's been a lot of talk

302
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:41,958
about um they're not going to be ready

303
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,320
it's not going to happen particularly

304
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:47,919
from the the assembly members who want

305
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,120
to delay licensing um we are saying if

306
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,278
you delay recreational licensing you

307
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,039
have violated prop 64 we will take you

308
00:12:52,278 --> 00:12:56,759
to court um we can't say that about

309
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,599
medical because but we can say that

310
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:00,879
about

311
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,920
recreational um on the other hand the

312
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,559
safest license to have right now because

313
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:07,159
of the federal government is going to be

314
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:10,399
the medical license uh because Jeff

315
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:12,120
sessions has made it clear that he's not

316
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,919
as interested in shutting down medical

317
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,919
marijuana he's interested in keeping

318
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:20,198
recreational marijuana um to keeping

319
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:24,000
prohibition going on so so there's two

320
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:26,359
license types that answer the question

321
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,679
it does and my followup is uh if you go

322
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,759
medical and don't opt for the recreation

323
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,359
right now

324
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,319
um will that impact future to get

325
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,199
recreational or would you still want to

326
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,040
be on a list to be able to get that yeah

327
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:42,559
I I think that anybody who's a good

328
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:44,278
actor so you know you try to set up your

329
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,078
business you know you try to follow the

330
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:49,799
rules hire an attorney you know take the

331
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:51,359
time to get all the right permits make

332
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:53,958
sure you're a th000 feet from the school

333
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,320
Etc so if you're doing that as a medical

334
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:59,119
business right now you are going to be

335
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,399
in believe it or not a very small

336
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,679
percentage of what we call the good

337
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,958
actors and those are the ones that the

338
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:06,958
cities want to get the recreational

339
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,879
licenses to so it's about building a

340
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,919
relationship with your city with your

341
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,600
community you know do you give back do

342
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:15,240
you have some kind of you know Community

343
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,519
give back program community service so

344
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,879
so those are the medical actors who are

345
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,480
going to be first in line for those

346
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,958
recreational licenses so it I don't

347
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,800
think it takes you out of the running to

348
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,958
wait I think there might be an argument

349
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,319
for spending more time really working on

350
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:32,439
your cannabis bus your medical business

351
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,240
building your reputation and then in a

352
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:37,160
few years when things settle down um you

353
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,919
know going for the recreational

354
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:43,159
license when you said they needed two

355
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:46,278
different spaces how apart two different

356
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:47,759
addresses right next to each other what

357
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:49,639
yeah that wasn't addressed and that was

358
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,120
exact our question so if you're just

359
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:54,079
door to door is it okay do you have to

360
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,078
be a foot he he didn't say so it's also

361
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,159
not the best written piece because it's

362
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,479
very vague it says no collocation

363
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:03,439
essentially the same premises is what it

364
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,440
says it cannot be on the same

365
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:08,078
premises yeah so those are the kinds of

366
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,399
details that are now being negotiated in

367
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:11,439
Sacramento there's another question a

368
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,720
quick question about Transportation

369
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,639
right now when we try to move it to our

370
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,320
store we can't move it legally and I'm

371
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,159
just wondering if they're going to give

372
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,199
transportation licenses or how we can

373
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:25,439
legally move our

374
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:28,159
stuff yeah no absolutely the

375
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,440
Transportation license is key so right

376
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,318
now um under an ounce so obviously not

377
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,440
for business purposes but under an ounce

378
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:37,039
is now legal for transporting 100% no

379
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,680
violation of the law if you have under

380
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:43,439
of an ounce in your vehicle um more than

381
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:45,799
that um you are definitely um in the hot

382
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,319
water right now but in January 1st I

383
00:15:45,799 --> 00:15:49,078
believe the transportation licenses

384
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:51,078
there's not a lot of controversy about

385
00:15:49,078 --> 00:15:53,078
that particular license type I think

386
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:54,399
everybody knows we need it and I just I

387
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:56,679
think it's going to happen I haven't

388
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:59,679
heard anything about not doing that can

389
00:15:56,679 --> 00:16:03,000
you have more than one license yes yes

390
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:06,679
absolutely um and however so so yes

391
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,078
under prop 64 and yes under Mera

392
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:12,000
um the how many license types and how

393
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,318
you can have is one of the topics of

394
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,440
negotiation under under reconciliation

395
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:19,240
right now so the and it's sometimes it's

396
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,800
called vertical integration so can you

397
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,560
have you know the different license

398
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:26,000
types we allowed that under Pro 64

399
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:27,958
except for testing testing always has to

400
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,720
be a separate license if you have a

401
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:33,318
testing license you can't have any other

402
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,800
license type um under Mera there was

403
00:16:33,318 --> 00:16:37,838
more uh restrictions around which

404
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:40,278
license types you could have depending

405
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,000
on the one you already had so the

406
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:44,759
governor's reconciliation essentially

407
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,759
says we're just going to go with the way

408
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:50,199
it is in prop 64 and let everybody have

409
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,480
um you know ver basically allow vertical

410
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:55,399
integration except for testing um the

411
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,959
other thing that the governor did though

412
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:59,559
that doesn't concern me again we wrote

413
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:02,518
that into prop 64 but what concerned me

414
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:05,000
is that he stripped um he stripped it of

415
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,599
the anti-monopoly language we had put in

416
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,519
so we are concerned about about

417
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:10,958
monopolies and about big businesses kind

418
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:14,240
of taking this over and we had done two

419
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,519
things to prevent that we delayed the

420
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,679
large cultivation licenses for five

421
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:21,078
years we said nobody gets you know the

422
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:24,280
type five licenses which was 22,000

423
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:26,599
square feet or larger fiveyear delay on

424
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:29,279
that and then we said you have to get

425
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:31,319
your license renewed every year and one

426
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:34,160
of the issues that The Regulators have

427
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:36,200
to review specifically is whether you're

428
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,360
trying to build a monopoly whether you

429
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,880
this license um would could possibly

430
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:41,959
lead towards a monopoly and they get to

431
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,200
make that decision every year the

432
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,000
governor took of those pieces out in the

433
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,400
current reconciliation language so it

434
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,160
feels more open to to Monopoly and and

435
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,080
so you know we we will probably have to

436
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,320
weigh in on that but and if you're a

437
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:56,678
small business and that's something you

438
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:58,359
want to weigh in on um again some of

439
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:00,480
these industry associations are are

440
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:02,798
certainly doing that let me talk about

441
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,839
one last issue that might not be as

442
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:07,720
important to you but is so important uh

443
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,000
to us at the drug policy Alliance and I

444
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,960
think uh for people who've been in the

445
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,480
Cannabis industry for a long time I I

446
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:20,759
think um this is an important piece so

447
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:23,159
under prop 64 we denied discrimination U

448
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:24,759
I'm sorry we prohibited discrimination

449
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:28,440
against people with a prior drug

450
00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:29,839
conviction on their record so right now

451
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,720
most most of the people who've been in

452
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:35,240
this 20y year under regulated quasi

453
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,120
regulated market in the medical cannabis

454
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,759
industry been risking their lives and

455
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:44,798
many of them you know have done serious

456
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:47,720
time in jail and in prison and um and

457
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:49,918
even Beyond cannabis we know that when

458
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,440
you look at who uses and sells drugs in

459
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,799
this country it's roughly equal across

460
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:57,840
racial lines when it comes to marijuana

461
00:18:54,798 --> 00:19:00,639
white people sell and use at higher rate

462
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:03,439
but for all drug it's roughly equal and

463
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,520
yet if you are black or Latino you are

464
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,400
far more likely to be arrested and

465
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,319
convicted for a drug crime if you're are

466
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,159
black you're four times more likely to

467
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:13,759
get a marijuana felony if you're Latino

468
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:15,760
you're two times more likely to get a

469
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:19,480
marijuana felony so we have been

470
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:21,158
building in this this discrimination you

471
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,640
know and then it becomes institutional

472
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,760
racism and then once you have a record

473
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,240
you can't you can't even get a

474
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:28,720
certificate to be a hair stylist in this

475
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,759
state if you have a criminal convic

476
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,720
fiction on your record so it just it it

477
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,158
seems so crazy for the first time

478
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,720
legalize something that has been a

479
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,760
controlled substance and say and yet all

480
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,839
you people who have been doing this you

481
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:45,158
can't get into this Market because you

482
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,678
have these records and the people with

483
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:50,640
those records tend to be predominantly

484
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,159
black and brown young men so we fought

485
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,360
hard to have this provision in prop 64

486
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:58,080
to to basically say they cannot deny a

487
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,079
license based on somebody's record and

488
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,599
they're trying to Undo It particularly

489
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,558
in the assembly the police Chiefs the

490
00:20:02,599 --> 00:20:07,079
law enforcement Lobby this is this is

491
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:09,480
the one that really sticks in their craw

492
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:10,918
um they got it into medical into the

493
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,679
medical regulations that you

494
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,000
discriminate against somebody based on

495
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:16,400
their record um it's one of the reasons

496
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,919
in the end we had to oppose that

497
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,919
legislation even though we worked on it

498
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,320
for a decade um but because we could go

499
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:25,280
to the voters with the initiative we did

500
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:27,639
the right thing and we said there will

501
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:30,639
be no discrimination and Licensing under

502
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
prop 64

503
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,720
so the other thing I'm going to ask of

504
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,840
you if since you're on this list or ask

505
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,759
Jackie to ask of you is to sign on to a

506
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,319
petition about this to the State

507
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,480
Assembly that we'll be Distributing

508
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:47,678
probably in the next week so please when

509
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,120
you get that email from Jackie or from

510
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,640
US Open it take the time to sign on

511
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,199
because we have to let them know that

512
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,240
the whole industry is not okay with that

513
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,200
kind of discrimination and not just let

514
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,679
it be me and the NAACP standing up there

515
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,798
by ourselves opposing it and that's what

516
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:07,000
happened two years ago so please don't

517
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:09,200
let us go to sacri loone on that issue

518
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,200

so thank you let's bring up Jonathan so

537
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,960
in the next few minutes let me try my

538
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,158
best to Crunch down what we've been

539
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,679
doing in a little over a year about year

540
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,919
and a half now within LA County

541
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:03,600
uh my journey on this started uh back

542
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:05,159
around February March of last year when

543
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,359
we had the band craze that went up and

544
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:09,080
down the state the states at the time

545
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,399
Mera regulations pretty much said that

546
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:13,199
if the local jurisdictions did not uh

547
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,559
regulate that they had the option to

548
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,319
either adopt what the state did or just

549
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,158
ban all together uh around that time is

550
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:20,759
when the LA County ended up deciding

551
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:22,120
that they were going to put in a ban and

552
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:23,919
they already had to be a little clear

553
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:25,519
here they had a ban already on

554
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,919
dispensaries within what is called the

555
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:31,278
unincorporated La uh territories of LA

556
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,200
County so LA county in general is or

557
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:35,159
they have 88 cities that are

558
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,600
Incorporated within it and they have a

559
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:38,200
very large portion of that territory

560
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:41,359
that is unincorporated which is where it

561
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,679
came to affect me the ban uh that

562
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,519
already existed there was for

563
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:46,360
dispensaries and delivery services or at

564
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:47,960
least the dispensaries part but the band

565
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:49,519
that they ended up putting in coming in

566
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,240
last year ended up extending that

567
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,480
expanding it to manufacturing delivery

568
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:55,759
services and cultivation so while they

569
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,200
never expressly allowed for those um

570
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,158
portions of the Cannabis industry to be

571
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,679
in there within the medical they also

572
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,760
didn't ban it until that moment so when

573
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,200
that ended up happening pardon me when

574
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:08,359
that ended up happening um we quickly

575
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,080
sought out any organization any group

576
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:12,000
that we could attach ourselves to to see

577
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,199
how we can help out what we can do our

578
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
little part in and along the ways we

579
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,960
certainly met each and every one of the

580
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,759
LA City groups that certainly have been

581
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,558
working together as best as they could

582
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,759
on that towards the fight on there but

583
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:26,000
none of them did we notice have any um I

584
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:27,640
don't want to say interest necessarily

585
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,798
but their focus wasn't in on the LA

586
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,400
County unincorporated areas at the time

587
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:33,440
so we quickly found ourselves pretty

588
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:38,320
much alone trying to stand up against

589
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:40,159
this ban uh we ended up taking a uh we

590
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,798
went to a uh conference down in San

591
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,360
Diego where we end up meeting California

592
00:23:41,798 --> 00:23:45,918
Cannabis industry Association and down

593
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:47,558
there someone in the audience ended up

594
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,919
uh asking uh what are they doing in the

595
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:52,759
LA area and uh there was no Focus again

596
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:54,759
at that time from that group itself in

597
00:23:52,759 --> 00:23:55,960
LA and I foolishly raised my hand and

598
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:57,919
said well I know a little something

599
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,120
about it and turned out and said that

600
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,600
that conference turned around with

601
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:02,239
everyone else kind of asking me as if I

602
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:03,359
was someone that was an authority on

603
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,720
that when it wasn't when all I'm doing

604
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,879
is try to get the word out there and see

605
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,919
where I can get help shortly after that

606
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,960
I had one of their uh I had the deputy

607
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,600
director of California Cannabis industry

608
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,240
Association reach out to meet with us

609
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,319
and he was thankfully located in Redondo

610
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,919
Beach where I myself am and from there

611
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:21,759
we started making plans on how we could

612
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:23,480
fight back against this span uh reaching

613
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,278
out to anyone and everyone friends that

614
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,960
we could at the time uh you many of you

615
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:28,839
probably know her Tracy Ryan from canak

616
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,399
kids certainly came out help us out with

617
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:33,359
that and I will be always grateful for

618
00:24:30,398 --> 00:24:35,158
her on that um and so we stood up there

619
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:37,119
the first meeting we had and there was a

620
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:38,720
good six of us six to seven of us I

621
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:40,319
think total at that time they went to

622
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,480
speak against this and what we were

623
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:43,038
looking at is the county was looking to

624
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,278
introduce a ban that would have been

625
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:46,440
extended for up to two years so they had

626
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:47,679
their first portion that would have been

627
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,440
great we're going to have this in for a

628
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,200
year with an optional second year and

629
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,440
what we ended up uh finding an affecting

630
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,319
change on is they ended up coming back

631
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,399
and saying you know what we're going to

632
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:56,240
hold back and we're going to just do

633
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:58,479
this for 45 days and review this from

634
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,120
there so we had our first chance of what

635
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,798
understood to kind of play Within this

636
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:03,319
game and also what that Victory kind of

637
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:04,359
meant for us to where rather than just

638
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,480
saying we're going to do the full two

639
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:08,798
years we're going to start off with the

640
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,360
45 days um since then we obviously ended

641
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,879
up uh organizing better trying to get

642
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:13,479
our efforts going on there and we were

643
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,640
quickly introduced to drug policy

644
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,720
Alliance and they have been phenomenal

645
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,600
Partners in trying to uh you know change

646
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,240
what's going on in the county the

647
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:24,240
education piece that Lynn mentioned on

648
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,240
there it's something that I can't stress

649
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,839
enough how much of a moving Target it's

650
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,240
been not just for uh us as operators

651
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:32,599
because the conly keeps changing but

652
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,319
also for the county and so it's not

653
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:35,678
something that you can we've learned

654
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,759
quickly you can't expect them to know

655
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,240
everything and anything all the time so

656
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,679
which gives us an opportunity to educate

657
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,399
them as best we can and along the way we

658
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,960
had a discussion last year with one of

659
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:46,319
the supervisors and they were very

660
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,399
active in trying to understand how they

661
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,599
could raise funds towards their um

662
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:52,359
efforts with homelessness fighting

663
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:53,398
homelessness within LA County some of

664
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:55,119
you may have heard last year but the

665
00:25:53,398 --> 00:25:56,639
county end up introducing at one point a

666
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,719
bill that would have actually taxed

667
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,600
cannabis uh to help towards that

668
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,880
Homeless uh cause they were looking for

669
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:03,158
and that was due to the efforts that we

670
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,320
came out there we end up speaking to

671
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:06,360
them and it was interesting that they

672
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,960
had no clue at the time that Aurora

673
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:09,879
Colorado ended up using its revenues

674
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,480
from taxes on cannabis to go towards

675
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:14,600
their homeless crisis they had uh that

676
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,880
unfortunately was not as much of a win

677
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:17,519
as we wanted to and while we disagreed

678
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,880
with them taxing us before regulations

679
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,200
we saw that as a great opportunity to

680
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,320
have a foot in the door to start the

681
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,200
discussion uh a couple weeks after they

682
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:26,639
passed the idea of let you know having

683
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,558
that bill put on there in November for

684
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,240
that they actually repealed that because

685
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:31,720
unfortunately uh United Way one of the

686
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,079
largest homeless Advocate groups out

687
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,120
there decided that they did not want

688
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:38,079
cannabis money to go to them so they

689
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:41,678
ended up repealing that all together and

690
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:42,960
that died two weeks afterwards um since

691
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,519
that time to speed up a little bit on

692
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,120
this stuff uh in January January

693
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,480
February or so the supervisors ended up

694
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:51,278
uh finally putting in their

695
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,679
recommendations as to how they want to

696
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:55,278
see some regulations go forward uh there

697
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,798
are two aspects of it one one on the

698
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,319
recommendation side that we disagree

699
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:00,158
with strongly one is if you end up end

700
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:03,398
up taking a look at the unincorporated

701
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:06,600
area of LA County the richest resource

702
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:10,000
they have is the agricultural Zone land

703
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:12,839
um that land takes up 39% of the zoned

704
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,679
areas within unincorporated La the

705
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:17,879
supervisors proposed to not allow any

706
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,559
type of cannabis based activity within

707
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,240
the agricultural land and instead they

708
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:25,319
want to uh allow for cultivation

709
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,079
manufacturing so on and so forth but

710
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:28,879
only within the Industrial and

711
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:31,278
Commercial zoned areas

712
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,880
by comparison we look at those two parts

713
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:35,679
they they together make up just about 1%

714
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,760
of the total zoned areas within LA

715
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,480
County so when the supervisors have

716
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,319
already stated that their goal is to

717
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,839
maximize the transition of this illicit

718
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:45,278
Market into a regulated market if

719
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,639
they're going to be looking to do that

720
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:49,480
we don't agree that giving us only 1% of

721
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,720
these zoned areas is going to allow for

722
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:52,960
that so we disagree with them on that

723
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,079
and of course we have more education

724
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,880
process going forward on there but more

725
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:59,519
curiously was really disturbing to us is

726
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,640
towards the end of that um first meeting

727
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,919
or that meeting where they introduced

728
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,759
their regulation recommendations uh we

729
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:07,320
had one supervisor that tacked on a last

730
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:09,200
minute amendment to where she had

731
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:11,240
suggested that she wants to clean out

732
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,440
essentially all the illicit operators

733
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,120
within the county itself and when asked

734
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,240
where they would pull the funding from

735
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:19,239
the CEO's office quickly volunteered

736
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,359
that uh last year they ended up winning

737
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,880
a uh settlement against Wells Fargo

738
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:24,119
which we all kind of heard how they end

739
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,480
up doing this up with their consumers

740
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,199
last year and that they have $25 million

741
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,919
setting around sitting around that they

742
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,600
can use towards this that is extremely

743
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,880
alarming to us because again if their

744
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:36,278
goal is to maximize the transition to

745
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,720
the regulated market why in the world

746
00:28:36,278 --> 00:28:40,798
would they spend $25 million towards

747
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,880
closing down these operators

748
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,558
first uh so we've been fighting that now

749
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,559
for the last several months and maybe

750
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:47,278
some of you might have gotten some our

751
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:49,319
emails from an Cal or have seen some of

752
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:50,640
stuff around it's been an interesting

753
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:52,480
battle because we're trying to do this

754
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,960
education piece again touris them trying

755
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,240
to tell them that that is not the proper

756
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,679
way to be spending these funds if

757
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,599
spending them at all makes sense uh

758
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,919
we've been waiting for a while to get

759
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:02,599
this report that there was going to come

760
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:04,360
out from the sheriff's office from the

761
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:06,158
County Council and the DA's office as to

762
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:07,558
how they would propose to spend these

763
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,600
$25

764
00:29:07,558 --> 00:29:11,678
million and the report's been a little

765
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,278
elusive for us and thankfully along the

766
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,200
way we had cat that did some great work

767
00:29:13,278 --> 00:29:19,398
on this um to where we uh discovered the

768
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,278
report was actually attached to the

769
00:29:19,398 --> 00:29:24,558
previous um mention of the well spargle

770
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:26,159
settlement back in November so had cat

771
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:27,558
not been looking back in November to

772
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,240
find out where this report was we would

773
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:31,398
not have seen that their recommendations

774
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,798
came out to actually using about $20

775
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:36,239
million of this 25 to actually close

776
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:38,278
down all the operators currently they

777
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,038
have a list of about 70

778
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:43,038
operators so 70 operators and that is

779
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,158
focused primarily now on the uh

780
00:29:43,038 --> 00:29:46,038
dispensary side of things because

781
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,880
they're certainly most um visible when

782
00:29:46,038 --> 00:29:49,798
it comes to this industry and they are

783
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,480
using thirdparty data practically just

784
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:54,359
using weed maps to find out who these

785
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,319
guys are at least that's her stated um

786
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:59,000
statement on that uh the $20 million

787
00:29:57,319 --> 00:30:00,398
piece is a little concerning us on there

788
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,960
because uh part of that if you look in

789
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:03,479
the footnotes on the report it ends up

790
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,240
saying that the sheriff's department was

791
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,200
actually um asking for about $15 million

792
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,519
alone so out of three different groups

793
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:12,278
the sheriffs wanted $15 million of that

794
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:13,880
the County Council or the the report end

795
00:30:12,278 --> 00:30:15,440
up suggesting to give them only 3.8

796
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,960
million but if you do the math and you

797
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,640
read between the lines there still is a

798
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,278
potential where altogether there's about

799
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:21,759
$30 million that they want to use to

800
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:23,839
shut down the

801
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:25,158
operators so as we keep doing this

802
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:26,839
education piece trying to discuss with

803
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:28,399
the Board of Supervisors on how that is

804
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:30,839
not the right way to inform before

805
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,398
regulating us we have been um fighting

806
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,119
that to where they have delayed this

807
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,639
report to be published around six times

808
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:38,959
already in the last 2 months uh this

809
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,640
last Tuesday though they finally ended

810
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,159
up sitting down to listen to this report

811
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,440
and in the report part of that was a

812
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:47,399
presentation given and the presentation

813
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,200
end up showing that they have currently

814
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:53,158
closed down 31 operators in the last

815
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,519
couple years they have 49 that they have

816
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:57,600
enforced against at the moment and there

817
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,359
are an additional 26 that are currently

818
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,839
under

819
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,759
investigation so they want to use these

820
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:06,278
funds now to actually go after them to

821
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:07,599
shut down the operators and it's been a

822
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:09,880
challenge for us as far as trying to

823
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,798
organize everyone for it so that we can

824
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,200
you know fight back against this part of

825
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:14,359
this is then because there is what

826
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,038
everyone pretty much calls this

827
00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:17,879
whack-a-mole game many people in the

828
00:31:16,038 --> 00:31:19,119
industry certainly understand or have

829
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,679
seen how they will shut down the

830
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:23,638
operators they'll pop back up in a

831
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:25,038
couple days and continue on including

832
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:27,158
some of the operators themselves it's

833
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:28,319
not been something that they have seen

834
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:30,919
or taken as serious iously as they

835
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:33,079
needed to for this uh this last Tuesday

836
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:34,399
though we had enough uh people come out

837
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:35,759
to the meeting and something that I'm

838
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:37,319
going to call out for you guys as well

839
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,079
too to please understand that this fight

840
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:41,079
is still not over but while the report

841
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:42,398
Was Heard over there 70 of us ended up

842
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:44,798
showing up to this

843
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,278
meeting 70 of us let me stress that

844
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:47,638
because we started this with only six

845
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:51,240
seven of us actually showed up the first

846
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:52,918
time a year ago 70 of us showed up to uh

847
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,880
give our testimony to show them why it

848
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:56,880
was not the right way to regulate uh to

849
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,240
enforce before they regulate against us

850
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,200
to show them that at the ended of doing

851
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,038
that it would also promote a illicit

852
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:04,038
dangerous Market as opposed to having

853
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:05,440
safe access for patients if you look at

854
00:32:04,038 --> 00:32:06,720
the map on there you'll see clearly that

855
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,278
in the northern part of the county which

856
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,880
is the largest unincorporated areas on

857
00:32:08,278 --> 00:32:11,558
there patients would literally need to

858
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,760
drive about two hours in order to get to

859
00:32:11,558 --> 00:32:15,278
the nearest Legal dispensary so they can

860
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:16,798
get the medicine that they need that's

861
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,038
not something that's very practical on

862
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:21,398
there uh I'm happy to say that at the

863
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:23,319
end of that meeting the supervisors

864
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:25,119
decided not to vote one way or another

865
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:27,439
on this and have withheld it I have only

866
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,959
at this moment accepted the reports

867
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,480
coming in

868
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,120
so we take that as partly a victory that

869
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,599
we ended up holding back the enforcement

870
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,959
piece on there um but is also there was

871
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:38,759
another important in this thing that was

872
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,840
really interesting to see the change

873
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:44,158
happen uh they have now started to use

874
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:46,038
the rhetoric that there are good

875
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,320
operators within a county The Narrative

876
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:49,759
has changed so one of the supervisors

877
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:52,200
who ended up previously at the meetings

878
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,839
ended up stating that she recognizes

879
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,480
that we have one as far as prop 64 goes

880
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,918
and some data on that I want to give you

881
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,440
on that real quickly is that on the the

882
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,080
county side of things the county voted

883
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,558
actually 59.5% in favor of prop 64 and

884
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:06,199
that means each and every of the five

885
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:07,158
districts end up voting in favor it as

886
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,038
well

887
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:11,440
too the um that same supervisor at that

888
00:33:10,038 --> 00:33:13,919
previous meeting end up stating that

889
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,320
while she recognizes she has to regulate

890
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,159
according to what the people have said

891
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:19,519
she still said that marijuana was a

892
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:19,519
gateway

893
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:24,038
drug of course we took qu quite some

894
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:25,240
exception to that and when we had our

895
00:33:24,038 --> 00:33:26,638
meetings with them afterwards on that we

896
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,079
tried to understand where they were

897
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:29,959
getting their information from what is

898
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:31,398
it that they're pulling their facts from

899
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,278
and quite frankly in the end what we got

900
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:35,599
was a lot of crossed arms and telling us

901
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:37,079
that that supervisor has a doctor friend

902
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:39,959
and the doctor friend told her and that

903
00:33:37,079 --> 00:33:42,319
is what she's basing her opinion

904
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,480
on fair enough of course we're angry on

905
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:44,839
that too but let's let's give it a

906
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,319
little chance here as well too I want to

907
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,798
put that out there because it is really

908
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:49,678
about educating them so they understand

909
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:50,879
what it is so part of our education

910
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,600
piece has also been we've been fortunate

911
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,919
enough that they have a um Department

912
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:55,798
within there that is called the office

913
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,919
of marijuana management and the office

914
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:57,960
of marijuana management is made up of

915
00:33:56,919 --> 00:33:59,679
several different departments in the

916
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,600
county about 12 of them or so and they

917
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,798
all together are going to have to

918
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:05,439
coordinate their efforts on reg writing

919
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:06,759
these regulations for it um we ended up

920
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,838
having the opportunity to take them out

921
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:10,440
to Palm Desert and to Palm Springs so

922
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:12,838
they could see what a license facility

923
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,960
looks like so we took them first to a

924
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:16,480
cultivation at the cultivation site it

925
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,639
was something it was good for them to

926
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,878
understand because they did not

927
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,159
understand the power consumption piece

928
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:24,239
that comes into restricting a market to

929
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,960
strictly indoor cultivation we don't

930
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,918
Advocate that it should be um one or the

931
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,800
other we're looking to obviously uh give

932
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,158
the largest amount of opportunity for

933
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,519
people to make this transition so we

934
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:35,159
want that agricultural piece within the

935
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:38,000
county opened up outdoor Greenhouse so

936
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:39,200
on and so forth uh it was it was hopeful

937
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,480
it was nice for them to see because they

938
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,559
didn't understand this one cultivation

939
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,240
site ended up using 4,000 amps worth of

940
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:45,440
power when on average for those of you

941
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,118
who may not know your home will have

942
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,280
about 100 to 200

943
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,280
amps so they understand now the they're

944
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,720
getting to the point where they

945
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,839
understand the electrical concerns that

946
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:55,439
we go on the great as well on there um

947
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:56,440
and also on the dispensary site we got

948
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,119
to take them for that and we're going to

949
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,599
continue on with the extraction piece so

950
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:02,760
on and so forth um on the so we have

951
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,320
that opportunity and the reason I bring

952
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,480
that up is because after Tuesday's

953
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,760
meeting we had uh ended up having joined

954
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,159
to a second meeting on Wednesday on

955
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,560
there where we were informed that this

956
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:12,960
office of marijuana management is

957
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:15,358
actually going to be changing its name

958
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,199
to the office of cannabis management and

959
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,358
we take that as a really good sign as an

960
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:22,000
indicator that County does intend to

961
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:23,279
regulate soon they understand the issues

962
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,960
that are behind the stuff and the stigma

963
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,200
that can be caused by causing calling it

964
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,199
marijuana if you will and uh you know so

965
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:31,480
those are some of the successes that

966
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:32,598
we're seeing this thing on here but um

967
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,760
what I want to kind of point out more

968
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:35,039
than anything else and sum it up to give

969
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,760
you guys a chance to ask any questions

970
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,920
you may on the county side now going

971
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,280
forward we have held them back obviously

972
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,480
from putting this enforcement piece out

973
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,760
there but that doesn't mean that it's

974
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,719
finalized it's not done by any means the

975
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,040
money itself is still there they still

976
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:49,159
can use it they still have the

977
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,838
Temptation for it and we need to still

978
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:51,920
start continuing on this discussion this

979
00:35:50,838 --> 00:35:54,119
narrative with what it means to be a

980
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,760
good operator so you will see our group

981
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:57,960
along with DPA and others and ccia to

982
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,800
start doing efforts and in the next

983
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,039
several weeks as to defining what it

984
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,839
means to be a good operator doing

985
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:04,400
community outreach showing that we want

986
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:06,078
to obey the guidelines that are set

987
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,160
forth many of the operat themselves

988
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,519
haven't had a chance to really read

989
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:10,078
through that stuff to understand what

990
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:12,358
they need to follow

991
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:13,680
by um and on that piece that's where we

992
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:15,279
say we want to reach out to everyone

993
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:16,960
here and if you can tell others as well

994
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,880
too we need more support as this goes

995
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,079
forward because we are fighting a huge

996
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,960
battle the county itself intends its

997
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:24,760
regulations to be a piece that will be

998
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,960
distributed towards the other cities

999
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,760
within the county that have not done the

1000
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,960
regulations yet it's going to an

1001
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,000
interesting thing because one thing that

1002
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,599
we've uh recognized as well too for

1003
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,920
instance the county ends up having uh

1004
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:37,559
their environmental um Department that

1005
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,599
actually is contracted out to 85 of the

1006
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:40,759
88 cities the same also kind of goes

1007
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,680
through with their fire department as

1008
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,680
well so when they're writing these

1009
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:44,960
regulations these cities that could also

1010
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:46,480
write their own regulations need to find

1011
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,760
a way to be copae between the two

1012
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,240
because you're not going to have fire

1013
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,400
department come in and say oh I steep

1014
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:51,639
into this side of the street so that

1015
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,880
means I've got to regulate differently

1016
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:54,838
than I would on the county end of things

1017
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,358
but all that's going to be a group

1018
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:58,239
effort so whether you are yourself

1019
00:36:56,358 --> 00:36:59,400
within the unincorporated area

1020
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:00,799
um that we're discussing we're fighting

1021
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,760
on this at or within one of the other

1022
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,560
Incorporated cities I really would like

1023
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,359
you guys to have your help and please

1024
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:07,799
join us come over where you can so we

1025
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:10,519
can work together towards getting that

1026
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,519
figured out that's great that's great

1027
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:15,440
thank you so much Jonathan so we have

1028
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:17,800
time for like two questions for him and

1029
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,838
uh he'll be around afterwards if you uh

1030
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,519
need to talk to

1031
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:26,279
him hi Aron with Canada sewer Brands

1032
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:28,119
again um can you tell me how this County

1033
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,400
regulation uh

1034
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:33,519
would be uh associated with the Bureau

1035
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:35,920
of medicinal cannabis regulation from a

1036
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:39,000
state level is there any are they

1037
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,280
talking between those organizations or

1038
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:45,960
is it just kind of isolated um

1039
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:47,400
regulating um so on this one I I I want

1040
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,440
to refer back to the meeting that cat

1041
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,200
and I ended up attending on Wednesday uh

1042
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,720
it was really encouraging a previous

1043
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:54,480
meeting were there we she ended up

1044
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,358
hearing a lot of rhetoric that was very

1045
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,199
discouraging as to what they understood

1046
00:37:56,358 --> 00:38:00,119
the issues to behind as as regulations

1047
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:01,559
go the county has proven this last

1048
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:03,599
Wednesday that they are finally

1049
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:05,039
listening they are seriously learning

1050
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,680
they're educating themselves on how this

1051
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:07,920
enforcement piece along with regulations

1052
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:10,719
and everything else will work on the

1053
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,880
state level as well as local so uh if I

1054
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:13,199
understood your question correctly it

1055
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,440
was a matter of are they discussing this

1056
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:16,719
with the state is that

1057
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,679
correct we we seem to see indication at

1058
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:21,039
this point that they do finally but at

1059
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:23,078
the same time we also have um we have

1060
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:24,400
their ear so we are able to educate them

1061
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:27,720
and and provide them the information

1062
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,760
they need for that as well

1063
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:32,439
so are you suggesting to them to have

1064
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,040
some continuity between state and local

1065
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,760
because I mean it gets really gray the

1066
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:37,599
state can say one thing but it really

1067
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,640
comes down to what the the city itself

1068
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:42,440
says or the county in this case well on

1069
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:44,118
on on the county end of things their

1070
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,440
their concern their Focus right now they

1071
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:47,800
they are recognizing that the state

1072
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,760
certainly has their piece to take care

1073
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:51,119
of the county has the other stuff that

1074
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,520
they're we certainly were concerned with

1075
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,880
right now is how do they regulate in a

1076
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:55,639
way that makes sense with also the other

1077
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,599
surrounding companies around us so that

1078
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:58,279
way you're not literally going to be

1079
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:59,640
different from one side of to the other

1080
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,760
and also how that affects all the other

1081
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:02,879
cities within the county itself so

1082
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,240
they're understanding at least enough

1083
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,519
this is their Lane this is what it's

1084
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:07,318
been a challenge because they've tried

1085
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:08,440
to introduce certain ideas that we're

1086
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:10,279
trying to educate them from they don't

1087
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,639
have to spend their resources and energy

1088
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,079
on because the state is going to be

1089
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:15,358
taking care of that So Courtney right

1090
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,400
here who is in addition to being one of

1091
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:18,880
my volunteers who's amazing and also

1092
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,240
working with Cana kids you're all over

1093
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,480
the place is doing a lot of work in the

1094
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:24,879
cities and uh she's going to tell you a

1095
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,760
little bit about what's going on we'll

1096
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,318
just give him a quick update um for

1097
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,000
example in what city are youing Monica

1098
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:33,400
right so tell us so here's the thing

1099
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
before you start is a lot of the work

1100
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,000
that you're hearing about tonight that

1101
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,280
for those of you who haven't gotten

1102
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,039
involved yet and maybe want to get

1103
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,400
involved as you can see there's a lot of

1104
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:43,880
different levels to all this so if

1105
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,838
you're the kind of person that likes to

1106
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:49,280
speak out and fight for things the

1107
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:51,880
places you can probably do the most work

1108
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,119
is in cities in the county there's

1109
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,318
definitely room in the state but

1110
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,559
obviously a lot of people up in

1111
00:39:54,318 --> 00:39:59,318
Sacramento doing things so but in your

1112
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:01,519
cities is where your your community the

1113
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:03,759
city councils all over California right

1114
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:06,280
now are having these conversations more

1115
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,880
and more and more every day about what

1116
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:10,720
is going to be their cannabis policy in

1117
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,519
their for their community so it takes

1118
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:15,078
people like us to go out there and do it

1119
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:16,838
and actually show up to these meetings

1120
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:19,318
and speak and let them know that hey

1121
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:21,559
we're there we don't want the story to

1122
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:23,480
just be dictated by law enforcement

1123
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:26,318
that's just one side of of the of the

1124
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,838
story we want to have Fair policy So

1125
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:31,000
Courtney tell us what what you are doing

1126
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:33,440
thank you Jackie for inspiring me to get

1127
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,280
involved uh Santa Monica passed an

1128
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,960
ordinance permitting two dispensaries

1129
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,960
and that was over two years ago so with

1130
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,358
the passing of prop 64 uh clearly it was

1131
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:46,880
time to move forward I'm pleased to say

1132
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:49,679
that uh they were very responsive to

1133
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,720
cannabis and they also I think had some

1134
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:54,838
change in their mindset about what the

1135
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:56,759
concerns were uh one of the issues that

1136
00:40:54,838 --> 00:40:59,318
I raised is that because cannabis is

1137
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:02,040
illegal in Santa Monica just working out

1138
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:05,559
of my home office and working with

1139
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:08,719
cannabis is technically illegal so uh

1140
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:10,679
Lord Jones was there to of the founders

1141
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:12,838
and they spoke uh they interested in

1142
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:15,719
manufacturing out of their home for

1143
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:17,880
their product line Lord Jones and uh so

1144
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:20,159
that was another another party that was

1145
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,599
also kind of hoping to have a presence

1146
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:25,639
in Santa Monica outside of dispensary

1147
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,720
zonings uh there were a number of people

1148
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:30,159
that came out to to address address this

1149
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:32,559
issue and uh one of the concerns they

1150
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:35,000
had was how do we have a dispensary with

1151
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:37,519
this zoning restriction if we have

1152
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,318
Nursery schools all over town how do we

1153
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:41,039
figure out where that's going to be so

1154
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:42,800
uh some of the residents came out and

1155
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:45,318
said you know made some suggestions

1156
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,119
about where they might want to place

1157
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:49,318
these dispensaries there's also

1158
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,800
consideration about how much traffic

1159
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:52,199
those dispensaries will encounter

1160
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,519
because that's something that you want

1161
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:57,358
as a thriving dispensary business of

1162
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:59,880
course uh but now um this the purpose of

1163
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:02,039
this particular event was uh to have a

1164
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,079
study session to to address those issues

1165
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:06,920
and learn more about what those issues

1166
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,680
were and that's why I attended because

1167
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,960
Jackie inspired me to get involved and

1168
00:42:08,679 --> 00:42:12,279
one of the ways of getting to get

1169
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:15,119
involved is to present those issues and

1170
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,680
say hey I'm a resident uh this is my

1171
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,160
concern and I would like to be

1172
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:21,440
represented in this fashion so uh that

1173
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:23,318
was that was how that went down and I

1174
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,440
would say it was successful um nothing's

1175
00:42:23,318 --> 00:42:27,800
moving forward yet but they are putting

1176
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,079
together an Advisory Board and on that

1177
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,440
board will be uh individuals who are

1178
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,720
involved in the Cannabis industry and I

1179
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:37,280
have requested to be a part of that

1180
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:38,679
organization so uh here's hoping that's

1181
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,559
great thank

1182
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:44,919
you you know um just to to really give

1183
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:46,519
you some a punch on what she was just

1184
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,680
talking about in Santa Monica because I

1185
00:42:46,519 --> 00:42:51,920
was there that particular night and so

1186
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:53,639
here's a City Santa Monica you you would

1187
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,440
think that they kind of are hip and know

1188
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:58,480
what's going on and right two years into

1189
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,400
deciding that they're have two medical

1190
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,280
marijuana dispensaries forget about

1191
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,039
adult use recreational they want no part

1192
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,519
of that they didn't even really

1193
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:09,440
understand until this brand Lord Jones

1194
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:11,679
which is like a you know medical brand

1195
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,880
chocolates and I don't know what else

1196
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:16,318
they have anyway topicals Tropicals and

1197
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:19,160
stuff so but so they got up there and

1198
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:21,159
were like hi we live in Santa Monica we

1199
00:43:19,159 --> 00:43:23,199
work in Santa Monica we're manufacturers

1200
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:24,719
and they were like manufacturers and

1201
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:26,439
they didn't really even understand that

1202
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:28,318
there were secondary products in the

1203
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,240
Cannabis industry they just thought it's

1204
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:33,119
all about flower but right bongs or

1205
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:34,479
bongs they really they really truly

1206
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,880
didn't know and you could see the looks

1207
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,358
on all their faces they were like the

1208
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:40,519
light bulbs were going off and they were

1209
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:42,199
like oh you mean there's other

1210
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:44,639
businesses in cannabis that don't need a

1211
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:46,919
storefront we don't have to watch

1212
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,759
cannabis being cooked do we well no of

1213
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,639
course not the warehouse areas or

1214
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,960
whatever they didn't even understand

1215
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:53,440
that and this is two years into them

1216
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,358
having the conversation so it takes

1217
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,159
people like are in this room and

1218
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:59,000
Courtney and others to go up there and

1219
00:43:57,159 --> 00:44:00,920
tell them this stuff because otherwise

1220
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,358
they're going to make bad decisions

1221
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,240
right so that's what we're here to talk

1222
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:07,318
about uh and I just want to add one more

1223
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:09,000
thing uh if you did want to get involved

1224
00:44:07,318 --> 00:44:12,119
one thing I did was just go to the drug

1225
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,440
policy.org website thank you and uh

1226

1227
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:18,760
toolkits and they have some Pro tips

1228
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:21,440
there on how to get involved uh I also

1229
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:23,200
wrote an article on Direct Canabis

1230
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,039
Network that you can read about uh to

1231
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:28,039
see how we can change things looking

1232
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:30,279
back at prohibition uh when alcohol uh

1233
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:32,558
prohibition ended we can we can start

1234
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,319
new and have uh 2020

1235
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,000
hindsight that's great thank you

1236
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:38,239
Courtney you could put that right down

1237
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,639
there and there and and while I'm here I

1238
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:41,078
want to tell you guys about West

1239
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:43,078
Hollywood because here we are in West

1240
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:45,400
Hollywood I spend time in West Hollywood

1241
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,960
at the city council as well so this

1242
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:51,358

uh they are putting marijuana on the

1246
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:59,199
agenda to actually le start to have a

1247
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,880
discussion about what they're going to

1248
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:04,279
do ironically West Hollywood was the

1249
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:06,039
first one in California to really get

1250
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:08,519
behind medical marijuana a lot of that

1251
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:12,079
having to do with HIV and AIDS at the

1252
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:14,759
time so they got in front of that now

1253
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,039
they got to catch up with adult youth so

1254
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,359
Monday May 1st 6:30 if you're a West

1255
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:19,838
Hollywood business or thinking about

1256
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:21,199
being West Hollywood business I

1257
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:23,279
encourage you to get there and speak

1258
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:24,439
anybody can speak but of course if you

1259
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,599
live in the community and work in the

1260
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,960
Comm it's even that more powerful but

1261
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:30,280
we're going to need to even keep a city

1262
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,079
like West Hollywood which is as

1263
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,800
Progressive as it may be we still have

1264
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:36,200
to make sure that they have Fair policy

1265
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,839
like some of the things ly was talking

1266
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:39,318
about they don't have discrimination and

1267
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:41,599
all those things we still need to make

1268
00:45:39,318 --> 00:45:43,279
sure even in the most Progressive cities

1269
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,760
so encourage everybody to come down to

1270
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:49,359
that okay one more short speaker and

1271
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:52,920
then we're going to wrap this so this

1272
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:56,318
person Terry Bev I just met recently

1273
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:59,280
Terry come on up Terry is in the law

1274
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:01,599
enforcement security side of cannabis

1275
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,800
and as we go forward in with licensing

1276
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:07,039
and compliance security is a big issue

1277
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,640
so Terry give us a few minutes and let's

1278
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:10,519
talk about some of those things that you

1279
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,239
do say hi to everybody first thank you

1280
00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:14,599
for having me Jackie I appreciate it

1281
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:16,118
absolutely now you're a a member of leap

1282
00:46:14,599 --> 00:46:17,800
as well right that is correct what is

1283
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:20,440
Leap tell people what leap tell what

1284
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,920
leap was and what it is sure leap is an

1285
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,240
amazing

1286
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,960
organization uh the whole time I was a

1287
00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:30,399
police officer I I I always had a

1288
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,639
conscience about the drug laws and the

1289
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,559
things that were going on and I never

1290
00:46:32,639 --> 00:46:36,118
agreed with it and I never knew that

1291
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:39,040
there were other police officers out

1292
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:41,519
there that felt like I did but uh uh

1293
00:46:39,039 --> 00:46:44,880
leap is made is a National Organization

1294
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:47,000
it's made up of over 5,000 people uh

1295
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,480
mostly law enforcement and former law

1296
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:53,079
enforcement officers who basically admit

1297
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:56,199
that we lost the war on drugs and say uh

1298
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:58,640
you know we recognize the fact that uh

1299
00:46:56,199 --> 00:47:00,679
that drugs probably shouldn't be illegal

1300
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:06,000
at least you know the the softer what

1301
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:09,159
might be considered softer drugs and uh

1302
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,920
that during the War on Drugs a lot of

1303
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:12,879
harm was done to certain communities

1304
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:15,318
within the United States and it's

1305
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,599
basically things that uh Lynn has

1306
00:47:15,318 --> 00:47:19,838
touched on and you've touched on and

1307
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,640
Jonathan touched on it's uh it's

1308
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:26,318
something that uh that has gone on for

1309
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:29,639
decades and and uh leap basically fights

1310
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:33,400
uh they have lobbyists in Washington DC

1311
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:36,639
and they uh uh promote drug policy

1312
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:39,280
reform uh uh fight against over

1313
00:47:36,639 --> 00:47:42,400
incarceration and mandatory sentences

1314
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,839
and all of those U laws and policies

1315
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,519
that uh that inflicted harm on certain

1316
00:47:44,838 --> 00:47:48,759
communities great cuz we need law

1317
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:50,719
enforcement on our side right or even ex

1318
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,200
law enforcement we definitely need that

1319
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:53,879
and there's a lot more of them out there

1320
00:47:52,199 --> 00:47:55,960
than people might think so you have a

1321
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,400
company called arlex security right that

1322
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,480
correct so what kind what types of

1323
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:03,119
security do you do to help cannabis

1324
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:05,480
businesses well you know cannabis uh

1325
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:08,838
businesses require a special type of

1326
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:11,440
security and uh that's why we're uh we

1327
00:48:08,838 --> 00:48:13,719
provide security for all types of uh

1328
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,639
Industries but we specialize in that

1329
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:17,879
specifically just because it is

1330
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:22,679
something that that requires a unique

1331
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:24,599
type of uh of uh approach uh one of the

1332
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:26,759
things that we do we start off by

1333
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:29,280
helping businesses that are applying for

1334
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:31,000
for their licenses because uh one thing

1335
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,280
that some people might not realize is

1336
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,760
that when you apply for a license a

1337
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:38,680
large percentage of the points that are

1338
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:41,920
attributed to or that are given to you

1339
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:43,358
have to do with your security plan so uh

1340
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,800
I've seen people try to do their own

1341
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:47,838
security plans and it doesn't always

1342
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:49,280
work out that well so that's one of the

1343
00:48:47,838 --> 00:48:52,239
things that we do we're happy to help

1344
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:54,400
with that now I'm I've been told by some

1345
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:56,439
people in the room that um security

1346
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,760
plans are usually required as part of an

1347
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:01,639
an application to assist a license is

1348
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:04,839
that have you seen that I have not seen

1349
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:07,480
any uh regulatory agency that does not

1350
00:49:04,838 --> 00:49:11,039
require a security plan and sometimes it

1351
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:14,000
can be um up to a third of the overall

1352
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:16,119
points that you get for your uh for your

1353
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,280
license the other thing that we do is we

1354
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:21,838
provide uh uh security design for the

1355
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:23,839
space because if we can get involved

1356
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:26,798
early on we can help design the space so

1357
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:29,599
that it's it can be secured more easily

1358
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:33,519
uh we provide uh installation of

1359
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:36,760
CCTV uh Access Control Systems uh

1360
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:40,358
biometric uh Access Control Systems uh

1361
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:42,359
alarms we also provide security officers

1362
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:44,000
and another thing that we're working on

1363
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:46,519
right now that I've had a lot of

1364
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,760
questions about this is uh The Insider

1365
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:51,079
threat a lot of cannabis businesses have

1366
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:53,119
said uh you know how do we keep people

1367
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:55,119
our employees from stealing from us

1368
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,440
because uh it's you know it's bound to

1369
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,559
happen and so we're developing a program

1370
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,440
right now that uh it's an employee

1371
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:05,119
training program and it uh involves

1372
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:09,318
engaging employees uh so that they're

1373
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:10,559
less likely to uh steal from you and one

1374
00:50:09,318 --> 00:50:12,880
of the things that we find in the

1375
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:16,480
security industry is that employees who

1376
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,480
steal didn't feel engaged with their the

1377
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,400
company that they were working for so

1378
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,519
that's one of the things that we're

1379
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,160
working on right now and uh well I've

1380
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:25,838
had a great response from people in the

1381
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:28,480
industry so far that's excellent so to

1382
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:31,000
finish this up what advice do you give

1383
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,519
to uh canab businesses that are going to

1384
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,559
go for license as they're thinking about

1385
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:37,000
security well I know that we've talked

1386
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:39,960
about it a lot but I don't think it can

1387
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,838
be talked about too much anybody that

1388
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:45,000
decides that they're either going to go

1389
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:47,639
into the Cannabis industry or stay in it

1390
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,920
for those businesses like you know pre

1391
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:53,039
propd other um businesses uh that may be

1392
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:55,119
operating outside the law who want to

1393
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:56,798
become legal it's going to be all about

1394
00:50:55,119 --> 00:51:00,798
compliance compliance is going going to

1395
00:50:56,798 --> 00:51:03,119
be really huge and uh it's going to be

1396
00:51:00,798 --> 00:51:08,239
uh possibly the most regulated industry

1397
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:10,000
in California and so owners right up

1398
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:11,879
front need to have that compliance

1399
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,199
mindset and what they need to do is they

1400
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:16,318
need to create a compliance culture as

1401
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:18,519
an owner if you're interested in

1402
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:22,159
compliance you can't do that by yourself

1403
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:24,079
you have to uh get your EMP employees on

1404
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:26,558
board so you need to create a compliance

1405
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:28,680
culture and a big part of that is uh sec

1406
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,200
securing your facility and training your

1407
00:51:28,679 --> 00:51:32,879
employees and that's one of the things

1408
00:51:30,199 --> 00:51:34,558
that we can help do so well that's great

1409
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,440
let's thank Terry for giving us all that

1410
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,380
wonderful information thank you so much
