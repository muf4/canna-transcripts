[Music]

2
00:00:21,528 --> 00:00:28,170
we're going to talk about why agreements

3
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:33,090
and contracts are so important and how

4
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:35,600
they set you up for success for the

5
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,980
long-term of your business

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,579
collectively on the panel today you've

7
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:44,159
got probably two to three decades worth

8
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:47,969
of legal experience which is a really

9
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:50,640
invaluable lesson as we charter these

10
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:54,170
waters that are consistently evolving

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,878
and turbulent during the emergence of

12
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:59,640
cannabis regulation here in California

13
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:02,670
and across the country if not the globe

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,530
so first I'd like to outline what we're

15
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,439
gonna talk about this evening we're

16
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,299
gonna go through investment agreements

17
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,699
and then agreements throughout the

18
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,320
cannabis supply chain focusing on what

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,680
that supply chain looks like here in

20
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:18,750
California first and foremost I don't

21
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,509
know all of you but I say this

22
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:25,140
consistently as we talk about investment

23
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:27,209
agreements moving into 2019 the way that

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,909
I look at it for my clients is that

25
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:32,759
you've got three options as you move

26
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:36,030
throughout this process you're going to

27
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,469
be an acquisition target and whether or

28
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,710
not you are the crown jewel and

29
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:43,859
somebody's Canadian IPO which is the

30
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:45,989
topic to shore at the moment is going to

31
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:48,868
be how well you are set up with your

32
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:50,699
contracts and your internal structure or

33
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:53,670
you're going to be able to survive an

34
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,219
acquisition event otherwise you will be

35
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,200
extinct if there is no secret option

36
00:01:56,218 --> 00:02:01,140
number four and in order for you to

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,990
survive in one of the first two buckets

38
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,239
and be a desirable acquisition target

39
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:08,728
you need to have good investment

40
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,598
agreements so with that I'd like to open

41
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:15,469
it up to our panel to

42
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:18,679
advise or give an overview of what are

43
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:21,829
some of the fundamentals for in good

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,900
investment agreements startups and what

45
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:25,700
you look for on the back end during a

46
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:30,438
due diligence check as an acquisition

47
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:32,419
target you can start with Michelle if

48
00:02:30,438 --> 00:02:35,060
you've been in the industry longer than

49
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:38,138
the last two years then you know that

50
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:41,949
back in the day pre legalization

51
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:45,169
papering up or making contracts between

52
00:02:41,949 --> 00:02:47,509
businesses and other businesses or their

53
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:49,819
investors was never really something

54
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:52,548
people did the whole point was to not

55
00:02:49,818 --> 00:02:55,399
leave a paper trail to avoid getting

56
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:59,389
arrested by the cops etc so now that

57
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,889
we're moving into legalization you know

58
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:04,219
now it's getting better

59
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:05,959
getting people to learn how to be

60
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:09,138
comfortable with us papering up

61
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,319
everything so back five years ago it

62
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:15,500
would be a very typical deal where

63
00:03:11,318 --> 00:03:19,310
someone's cousins friends lawyer brother

64
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,348
or something gives a 100 grand cash to a

65
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,139
dispensary and then I promise I'll give

66
00:03:21,348 --> 00:03:27,798
you 10% of my proceeds that's not gonna

67
00:03:24,139 --> 00:03:29,719
fly anymore you know now we have to pay

68
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:33,650
for up all those investor agreements

69
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:36,049
these private offerings and it's a lot

70
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,469
of paper and there's a lot of due

71
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:41,389
diligence involved and again back to the

72
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:44,568
same problem of not keeping a paper

73
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:48,560
trail due diligence is a challenge in a

74
00:03:44,568 --> 00:03:51,258
company that isn't accustomed to keeping

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,859
accurate books lots of these companies

76
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:58,399
books are cooked they handwritten

77
00:03:54,859 --> 00:04:00,319
receipts it's very hard to get a true

78
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,139
accurate feel of what a company's

79
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:05,718
financials are are so investors have a

80
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:08,599
unique challenge in this and industry

81
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:10,698
than they do in any others and it's very

82
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:13,358
hard to value a company for those

83
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:16,098
reasons there's a lot of obviously

84
00:04:13,359 --> 00:04:18,739
cannabis related disclosures that you

85
00:04:16,098 --> 00:04:21,589
have to put in your investor Docs things

86
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:23,870
like you know telling potential

87
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:24,829
investors that cannabis businesses are

88
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:28,848
subject to

89
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:31,878
AEE and don't have access to banking so

90
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:33,680
you can't really properly track your

91
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:36,710
investment where all your funds are

92
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,319
going mix it's not really for the

93
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:41,239
faint-hearted investor but you know

94
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:43,430
these are all kind of things depending

95
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,340
on the nature of the transaction how

96
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,228
much money is involved a accredited

97
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:50,060
investor or not accredited investor

98
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:52,128
there's a lot of different things that

99
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:56,689
go into it and it's kind of really

100
00:04:52,129 --> 00:05:00,020
specific to each situation but the over

101
00:04:56,689 --> 00:05:02,090
arching the premise is that you need to

102
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:05,750
have you need to be properly papered up

103
00:05:02,089 --> 00:05:09,068
for two primary reasons one you face

104
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:13,509
extinction after being acquired you face

105
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:16,669
crazy securities fraud related

106
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:19,580
accusations charges fines whatsoever you

107
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:21,589
know what have you and then you also if

108
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:25,250
you're gonna try to impress a legit

109
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:27,948
investor and they see that you don't

110
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:29,990
have things buttoned up on paper they're

111
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:31,278
really gonna think less of your company

112
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:35,840
and whether or not you're a viable

113
00:05:31,278 --> 00:05:38,478
investment so all around it's a it's a

114
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,908
challenging transition but and it's not

115
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,408
a easy one to go through but there are a

116
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:45,259
lot of different things to go through

117
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:47,300
that are very specific to cannabis so

118
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:49,879
I'm Michael Chernus I've been an

119
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,829
attorney for more than I care more years

120
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:54,770
than I care to tell you and been

121
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:58,519
practicing in the cannabis space for ten

122
00:05:54,769 --> 00:06:02,359
years and the ten years has seen a lot

123
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:04,968
of changes in terms of what all work is

124
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,528
because it used to be keeping you out of

125
00:06:04,968 --> 00:06:09,139
jail and trying to keep you out of

126
00:06:06,528 --> 00:06:11,240
trouble and now it's really about

127
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:15,560
protecting you as Michele said through

128
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:18,579
papering transactions and and in that

129
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,468
way it's not unlike any other industry

130
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:24,948
there are nuances having to do with

131
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:27,829
federal issues and there's uniqueness

132
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:29,838
about the regulations that that you have

133
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:33,439
to deal with in the cannabis space but

134
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:36,480
with respect to investing in startups

135
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:38,490
what what I've seen

136
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:41,189
when I've been brought in to like

137
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:46,230
private equity transactions

138
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:49,170
recently is there are challenges that

139
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:51,780
are unique to cannabis and I think one

140
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:54,480
of the challenges is this is a brand new

141
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:57,419
industry we're in day one how do you

142
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:00,030
evaluate a company's financials when

143
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,730
there's no history to base it on how do

144
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:05,009
you evaluate their for any of this stuff

145
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,740
in other industries when you're making

146
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:09,990
an investment you have some track record

147
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,050
maybe to look at or at least you have a

148
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:15,240
track record of an industry that's or

149
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,090
another comp in the industry here you

150
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,800
don't have that at all so I can't tell

151
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:22,919
you how many times I mean it happens

152
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,030
today a client who want to invest six

153
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,100
million dollars to buy a piece of

154
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:28,289
property and these licenses and the

155
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,330
financials project blah blah I'm like I

156
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,250
don't even listen after that the

157
00:07:30,329 --> 00:07:34,919
financials are just there made up

158
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:37,589
because there's no history it's not to

159
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:40,319
say that financials have no basis in

160
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:42,179
reality but you really need to dig in

161
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,550
and try to get underneath these

162
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:46,350
financials there's different ways of

163
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:49,230
valuing companies there's different ways

164
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:51,810
of doing financial projections and you

165
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:54,300
it's really incumbent upon you to look

166
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,069
beneath the paper and try to get some

167
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,889
understanding of where the numbers came

168
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:01,250
from so that's one huge issue another

169
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:03,360
huge issue that we keep coming across

170
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:05,819
especially if you're gonna be on the

171
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,680
debt side and you're gonna do a debt

172
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:10,800
transaction that maybe involves a

173
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,560
convertible note where if the borrower

174
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,340
doesn't meet its obligations your debt

175
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,829
turns to equity the question is so now

176
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:22,219
I'm an equity holder in a licensed

177
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:26,579
business how am I gonna actually

178
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:30,150
effectuate that ownership because every

179
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:32,879
city has limitations on how licenses can

180
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:36,120
be transferred so you may now be the

181
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:39,179
owner the equity holder in a licensed

182
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,149
entity in LA or some other city but is

183
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:44,599
LA gonna honor your rights as an equity

184
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:46,470
holder are you gonna be able to execute

185
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,870
upon that interest

186
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:51,360
those are huge questions that

187
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:54,060
know that anyone really has a good

188
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,970
answer to and then there's there's other

189
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:59,338
nuances that keep popping up like we're

190
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:01,920
investing in a company that is a non

191
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,170
profit mutual benefit corporation it's

192
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,479
supposed to convert to a for-profit

193
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:08,849
entity it hasn't happened yet are there

194
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,009
going to be problems with that so those

195
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:14,190
are some sort of unique things that we

196
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:17,850
keep coming across as well as you know

197
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:19,710
potential liabilities that we maybe if

198
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,500
you're an investor potential liabilities

199
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:24,080
that may pre-exists your investment a

200
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,299
lot of which are hard to calculate

201
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,040
because not all these businesses have

202
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:31,588
great track records and just to give you

203
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,939
an example you may be investing in or

204
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:35,580
acquiring an entity that's been

205
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:38,100
operating under the collective model for

206
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:41,759
five or ten years but maybe they didn't

207
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,740
pay any sales tax what is your

208
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:47,129
responsibility for that who's gonna

209
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,899
carry that liability so from my

210
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:52,070
perspective as somebody who's to do a

211
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:54,000
lot of litigation but the due diligence

212
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,940
focuses on those kinds of issues

213
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,799
liabilities what's gonna happen if

214
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:03,150
things go sideways will I be able to

215
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:07,169
execute on my interest okay I'd like to

216
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:10,199
know from you since you're representing

217
00:10:07,169 --> 00:10:14,789
growth companies from idea to exit which

218
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:17,490
I like as we see the great constriction

219
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:20,399
or consolidation of the market with M&amp;A

220
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:23,100
because some operators maybe got a

221
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,259
license but didn't have enough money to

222
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,790
effectuate that license to get it

223
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:29,069
through Landry's entitlement to

224
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:31,289
operation how are you advising clients

225
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:33,930
and what would you suggest for

226
00:10:31,289 --> 00:10:35,639
maneuvering through that M&amp;A process I'm

227
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:37,799
Jay I work at Clark Newburgh were

228
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,620
women-owned law firm in San Francisco

229
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:45,149
Sacramento Santa Barbara in Los Angeles

230
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:48,000
I grew up to be a corporate lawyer which

231
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:53,189
everybody dreams about becoming when

232
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,259
they're little and the neat thing that

233
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,209
we get to do is help little companies

234
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:59,458
try and become bigger companies right

235
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:02,059
being an entrepreneur is super difficult

236
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:08,179
in any industry cannabis

237
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:11,599
that much harder a couple thoughts one

238
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:13,219
of them is no one ever regretted

239
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,690
spending too much time with their

240
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:20,330
attorney right people regret like not

241
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,890
having flood insurance people regret not

242
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:24,050
spending enough time with their attorney

243
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:27,559
find an attorney you like and you're

244
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:29,089
willing to say I screwed or even a curse

245
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:31,099
word find an attorney you're really

246
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:34,570
willing to share what's going wrong

247
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,769
you'll never regret it

248
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,620
corporate law is moving really quickly

249
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:41,929
especially around cannabis lots of

250
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,610
companies have been operating with non

251
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:45,949
profit mutual benefit corporations with

252
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,810
LLC's with corporations spreading their

253
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:52,009
operations between different companies

254
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:55,219
for years filing inconsistent tax things

255
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:57,110
all of this can be fixed but the sooner

256
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,870
you start the better which I've heard

257
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,759
the other panelists talk about there's a

258
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,230
planning process that you can really go

259
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,460
through to clean some of these things up

260
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:10,009
before you become in this M&amp;A process

261
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:12,019
the biggest challenges we see are

262
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:14,960
companies who don't realize until it's

263
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:16,549
too late we have companies come to us

264
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,750
and somebody wants to buy them for

265
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:19,579
millions of dollars and they're so

266
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,169
excited and it turns out they never

267
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,000
actually purchase stock in their own

268
00:12:21,169 --> 00:12:24,740
company

269
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,110
this isn't rare because they thought

270
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,090
they had done it because maybe a couple

271
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:32,120
years ago they're cousins friends

272
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,830
husbands neighbors nephew got them set

273
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,480
up with a non profit mutual benefit and

274
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:38,570
they started operating but they never

275
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:40,550
actually purchased any equity in a

276
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,930
company the crystal equity where they

277
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:43,609
never issued themselves membership

278
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:46,959
interest in their nonprofit and we say

279
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:50,060
there's this universe of acronyms that

280
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:54,590
you've got to get a hold of and you can

281
00:12:50,059 --> 00:12:56,649
get a hold of there's also I'm trying to

282
00:12:54,590 --> 00:13:02,330
find a nice way to say this but there's

283
00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:05,289
not always awesome advice but there's a

284
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,290
lot of people giving it

285
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:10,519
accredited investors hasn't been

286
00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:13,199
requirement in since November of 2016

287
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,299
right some of your investors will be

288
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:16,588
concerned about this but many of your

289
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:19,559
investors shouldn't be concerned about

290
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:20,999
this at all all of your companies can

291
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:23,849
raise up to five million dollars with

292
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:25,889
zero accredited investors you don't have

293
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,170
to disclose anything to them this has

294
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:31,259
been an SEC rule since November of 2016

295
00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:33,058
and I'm not saying you should do that

296
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:36,058
but it's an option that's available to

297
00:13:33,058 --> 00:13:37,620
everybody the most important thing that

298
00:13:36,058 --> 00:13:40,469
I think cannabis companies need to know

299
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:43,318
is this corporate law stuff can destroy

300
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:44,910
you but it can also empower you if you

301
00:13:43,318 --> 00:13:46,588
set this up right you'll get great tax

302
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:47,909
rates if you set this up right you'll

303
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:50,129
have clear ownership

304
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:52,379
you'll feel empowered to raise money

305
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:55,050
through convertible notes to find a

306
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:57,889
great M&amp;A exit but this is really one of

307
00:13:55,049 --> 00:14:01,620
those like you have to get your vaccines

308
00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:04,558
you have to spend more time and money on

309
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:07,558
this then you want to early because if

310
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:09,659
you don't you get that horrible news

311
00:14:07,558 --> 00:14:12,539
that somebody wants to buy you for ten

312
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:15,629
million dollars but you don't own any

313
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:17,639
stock in your own company like that

314
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:19,050
happens because people are confused

315
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,740
about what they actually purchased a

316
00:14:19,049 --> 00:14:25,019
couple years ago if you find out too

317
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,600
late you don't own stock you think okay

318
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,679
I'll just buy it but if you buy it today

319
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,870
and sell it tomorrow

320
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:33,359
you get nailed on taxes you could lose

321
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:36,299
like a third of the ten million dollars

322
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,278
that you're hoping to get I know much

323
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:41,818
more about investment stuff then I will

324
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:46,049
about the supply chain stuff so so I'm

325
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:48,659
gonna okay I'll finish up but on the

326
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:51,109
deal with corporate law is it's scary at

327
00:14:48,659 --> 00:14:54,688
first and then it's really empowering

328
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,579
right it can like really the purpose of

329
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:58,558
the Corporations code is to let you

330
00:14:56,578 --> 00:15:00,388
start companies that grow and expand and

331
00:14:58,558 --> 00:15:02,578
become more valuable and they can do

332
00:15:00,389 --> 00:15:04,289
that cannabis companies like any other

333
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:07,558
companies should use the Corporations

334
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:09,509
code to build and they can do that and

335
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:15,269
you can do that with a lawyer you love

336
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:18,209
with a lawyer you love happily every day

337
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:33,179
Lord Allah love your lawyer love you a

338
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:36,479
lawyer Albatros that takes you down if

339
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:40,319
you don't invest in it it's very

340
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,120
difficult and it hurts right it hurts to

341
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,209
have to spend that money it hurts more

342
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:47,250
later when either you can't take ten

343
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:49,500
million dollars or your evaluation

344
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:51,089
should be a tax and all the sudden

345
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:53,100
you're getting pennies on the dollar

346
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:55,350
because when somebody does your due

347
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,720
diligence when they look up your

348
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,720
proverbial skirt as a business and they

349
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,339
see you haven't kept minutes ever right

350
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,320
they asked for a corporate book which is

351
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:06,060
very simple and when you're doing a due

352
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,610
diligence and you don't have one you

353
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:11,009
can't show the train of events and

354
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:13,230
transactions that you've had then all

355
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:16,139
the sudden this valuation you have this

356
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:19,560
great business that you put your time

357
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:22,860
energy sweat tears into all the sudden

358
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:25,078
becomes greatly diminished and somebody

359
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:29,730
can say that to you simply by not having

360
00:16:25,078 --> 00:16:31,528
records and not loving your lawyer so

361
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,899
with that building blocks or with that

362
00:16:31,528 --> 00:16:36,899
framework in mind really we want to turn

363
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:39,149
to the devil in the details and that

364
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:42,750
comes with how are you going to run your

365
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:44,759
business prior to finding that exit

366
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:47,578
strategy and that's where we want to

367
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:50,100
look at how the supply chain acts and

368
00:16:47,578 --> 00:16:53,549
how agreements with between supply chain

369
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:57,180
actors occur I think we can start at the

370
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:59,958
natural place which is cultivation right

371
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:02,549
we have no industry if we have no

372
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:06,359
cultivated flour to then turn into other

373
00:17:02,549 --> 00:17:08,338
manufactured products or sell at the

374
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:12,208
dispensaries and so with that comes

375
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:15,000
sourcing agreement and how if you're a

376
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:17,818
manufacturer do you go about sourcing

377
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,160
your products and what does that mean

378
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:23,819
how do you interface between a

379
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:27,240
cultivator and either a distributor or

380
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:30,210
cultivator and a manufacturer and what

381
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:34,470
has our panelists been exposed to and

382
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:36,450
how do they advise operators to maneuver

383
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,600
if somebody comes to them and says I

384
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:44,759
want to purchase from you X number of

385
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:46,109
pounds a month or a supply any time

386
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:48,299
you're dealing with a cultivator you're

387
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:49,500
gonna have to deal I guess any operator

388
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:51,029
between any awkward you're gonna have to

389
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,849
deal with your distributor so the

390
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:55,829
distributor contracts and the connection

391
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:58,679
between the cultivator and the

392
00:17:55,829 --> 00:18:00,179
manufacturer or the cultivator and the

393
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,220
retailer you're all going through the

394
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:05,420
distributor so that are kind of that the

395
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:09,089
mandatory middleman and that's where all

396
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:13,430
the details get a little confusing the

397
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:16,439
we've been seeing a lot of a lot of our

398
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:17,789
at least my work load lately has been

399
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,130
dealing with these distribution

400
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:22,319
contracts in light of the new

401
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:25,560
regulations which as we all know keep

402
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:28,409
changing which we probably won't expect

403
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:31,970
a final version that's adopted until wet

404
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:34,800
like early 2019 something like that so

405
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,390
these distribution contracts and at

406
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,369
least I've been seeing they they change

407
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:42,060
they look completely different when they

408
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:44,219
were first started up last November and

409
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:46,679
they're evolving as the regs are

410
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,900
evolving and now it's a completely new

411
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:51,480
template or new beast and every single

412
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,730
time we have to take a look at it but

413
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,829
things like from the cultivator to the

414
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:59,670
manufacturer I guess I'll just use like

415
00:18:55,829 --> 00:19:03,029
a case study let's say we have a grower

416
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:05,370
in Salinas County a green house who

417
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:08,759
wants and we got an L a manufacturer who

418
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:11,609
wants to source the the the Sun grown

419
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:13,710
from up there does how do we get it down

420
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:16,019
there does the cultivator have a

421
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,789
distribution license can the cultivator

422
00:19:16,019 --> 00:19:20,970
who has the distribution license

423
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:23,099
transport that down to LA or does the

424
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,319
manufacturer in LA have a distribution

425
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:27,419
license can the manufacturer use its

426
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:30,750
distribution license to go up north and

427
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:33,150
go get the flower itself or do we just

428
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:36,150
use a third-party distributor who has a

429
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:37,500
transport only license to just take it

430
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,840
from A to B

431
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,119
so you there's a million ways to skin a

432
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:46,019
cat each business has its own licenses

433
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:48,449
as its own internal strategies what have

434
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:51,900
you but but depending on who's gonna do

435
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:55,980
that part that just the transportation

436
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:58,710
the testing of you know collection of

437
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:03,630
the excise taxes that's all distributor

438
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:05,579
so you got to really make sure whatever

439
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:08,010
distributor you use whether your self

440
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:09,299
distributing or using another party you

441
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:12,150
got to make sure you trust that

442
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:14,159
distributor that distributor is buttoned

443
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:16,920
up is a good operator knows what it's

444
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,860
doing and in those contracts there's a

445
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,840
lot of and then there's other things to

446
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:23,490
think about is that distributor not only

447
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,529
transporting and testing but are they

448
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:29,220
gonna be packaging for you you're doing

449
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:32,129
all the you know the packaging and

450
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,930
labeling compliance so someone else

451
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,030
could even do that part for you you can

452
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:38,100
add another party just a straight

453
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:40,440
packaging company and so you got to

454
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:42,599
figure out where all these players who

455
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,210
are gonna fit all these pieces whether

456
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:47,730
that's you by yourself or up to four

457
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:50,700
different companies who knows and

458
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:52,920
depending on how that business structure

459
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,440
is modeled then you can kind of get into

460
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,300
what this contract is gonna say and what

461
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,360
that contract is gonna say it's gonna

462
00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:02,849
give delineate everyone's roles and

463
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:07,919
responsibilities and obligations clearly

464
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:10,799
it's gonna determine things like if the

465
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:13,400
packaging ends up being non-compliant or

466
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,500
if the product gets recalled due to

467
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:18,690
contamination who's footing the bill for

468
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,700
that who's responsibility is it are you

469
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:23,549
splitting the baby how are you gonna

470
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,019
figure that out and we got a lot of I

471
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:27,720
got a lot of people asking me well

472
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:31,049
what's the standard what's the standard

473
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,420
rate for distribution fees there's no

474
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:35,099
such thing as a standard rate in

475
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:39,150
cannabis there's no such thing as

476
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:41,250
standard anything in cannabis so those

477
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,080
are all business questions how you get

478
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:44,700
up those numbers how many different

479
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:47,220
operators you're involving in this

480
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,620
supply chain really will impact how you

481
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,269
structure your contract but at the end

482
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:54,149
of the day the most important thing

483
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:56,879
a lot of people just go into the

484
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:59,130
contract hoping look they're gonna make

485
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,929
my product for me I'm a brand they're

486
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,550
just gonna make it for me and they're

487
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:03,030
gonna sell it out and they're gonna give

488
00:22:02,549 --> 00:22:05,759
me

489
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:07,710
royalty fees for it's not that simple

490
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:10,379
you guys got to throw in all this other

491
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:12,840
stuff about what happens in the worst

492
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,450
case scenarios we're gonna be the debbie

493
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:17,369
downer attorneys who tell you about how

494
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,650
easy it is to get married but how

495
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:20,579
difficult it is to get divorced but it's

496
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,650
very true

497
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:24,839
so you got to contemplate all these

498
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:27,269
worst-case scenarios and figure out

499
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:29,519
beforehand and agree beforehand what's

500
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:33,650
gonna happen like I was tiling Pam

501
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:38,579
earlier we've got I've encountered a

502
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:40,700
brand who is a brand that was co-packing

503
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:44,730
with another manufacturer that

504
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:48,299
manufacturer use a distributor licensee

505
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:51,679
transport only to you know transport

506
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:54,899
product from A to B to the retailer that

507
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:58,470
distributor has all the cash taking it

508
00:22:54,900 --> 00:23:00,690
back to the manufacturer and gets pulled

509
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:03,839
over by ATF one hundred and eighty

510
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:06,630
thousand dollars in cash seized federal

511
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,939
forfeiture and now the parties are

512
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:11,370
fighting about you file the forfeiture

513
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,830
action a you file the forfeiture action

514
00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:16,799
we got the licensee who doesn't want to

515
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:20,189
raise any red flags you obviously got

516
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:22,678
the brand who wants their money but you

517
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:24,779
know now you got this an uncomfortable

518
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:27,150
situation where there's a lot of money

519
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:30,299
that you need to get back but no one can

520
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:32,820
agree on how to do so so think about

521
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:35,490
horror stories like that prepare in

522
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:39,119
advance I know it's no fun but it you'll

523
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:42,859
you'll thank yourself for it later we've

524
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:46,159
seen a lot of brands that were very

525
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:48,899
profitable and knowledgeable prior to

526
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:50,970
regulation where you had to go and

527
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,230
source a license they have a brand so

528
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:54,660
they have something that they can

529
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:57,000
license in the market where somebody

530
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:59,040
else was able to capitalize on securing

531
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,069
a property and getting through licensure

532
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,250
how do you go about doing these

533
00:24:01,069 --> 00:24:04,289
licensing

534
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:06,839
agreements so that your brand can

535
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:08,789
survive through another licensee they

536
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:10,949
think that is something that is of

537
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:13,409
interest and is a very vexing

538
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:14,549
complicated area of putting those

539
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,380
contracts together

540
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:21,000
I actually know the answer to that

541
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:22,710
question but before I before I get into

542
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,880
that I just want to touch on the

543
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:29,430
cultivation issue what makes the

544
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,720
cultivation and the manufacturing a

545
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:34,320
little bit different as far as I'm

546
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:39,350
concerned is cultivation your product

547
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:43,500
can go down two paths it can go to the

548
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:45,389
distributor retailer path which makes it

549
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,430
similar to manufacturing and then as

550
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:49,590
Michelle was alluding to you're dealing

551
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,880
with issues of who's gonna package it

552
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:52,559
you're gonna package it yourself you can

553
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,820
have the distributor do it the testing

554
00:24:52,559 --> 00:25:01,259
all that risk of loss stuff which is a

555
00:24:56,819 --> 00:25:03,689
big issue risk of loss or you can agree

556
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:06,119
that some or all of your product is

557
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,769
going to go to a manufacturer to be

558
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:10,379
turned into brownies and oil and

559
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:13,500
concentrates and if you go down that

560
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,750
path in some ways I think your life is a

561
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,309
little simpler because you don't have to

562
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:19,079
deal with a distributor for that piece

563
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:21,990
of it you can just have somebody

564
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:25,589
transport it there's no testing that's

565
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:29,700
required by state law before it goes to

566
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:32,369
the manufacturer you should certainly

567
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:34,170
test it on your own but these are two

568
00:25:32,369 --> 00:25:36,119
very different paths I mean I have some

569
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:38,850
clients that are doing rows where all

570
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:41,009
product just gets freeze I think it's

571
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:43,409
called free shipped directly to a

572
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:44,910
manufacturer to turn into oil and then

573
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,529
other people obviously they want to get

574
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:49,019
their product out there is flour and as

575
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:51,799
a brand so those are very different

576
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:54,180
paths and they involve different

577
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:56,279
different contracts and considerations

578
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,930
and then you know there are these

579
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:59,970
concepts and maybe Jay could talk more

580
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:02,070
about it but you can enter into a

581
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:04,410
requirements contract if you're a

582
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:06,000
distributor or a retailer where a

583
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,950
cultivator has to meet all of your

584
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,099
requirements and give you as much flour

585
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:12,600
as they as they can produce and if

586
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:14,759
you're on the other side of you're a

587
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:15,928
cultivator there are contracts where

588
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:18,269
basically

589
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:21,210
you may be obligated to give all of your

590
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:23,878
flower to a particular distributor or

591
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:25,350
retailer as much as they want so there

592
00:26:23,878 --> 00:26:28,469
are different ways of like engineering

593
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:30,269
those kinds of contracts but the

594
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:33,118
question that Pam asked me which is

595
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:37,409
really I think a an interesting question

596
00:26:33,118 --> 00:26:40,859
is we're a brand we have some traction

597
00:26:37,409 --> 00:26:42,419
out there but we don't have the means to

598
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:44,368
get a license we don't want to get a

599
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:47,460
license we don't want to spend all that

600
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:51,418
money on real estate how do we stay out

601
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:53,490
there and actually I think what at least

602
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:56,639
when I'm seeing is there's a lot of

603
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:59,009
brands out there that have just opted

604
00:26:56,638 --> 00:27:01,558
like it makes more sense to not have to

605
00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:05,490
go through the hassle of hiring someone

606
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:08,368
like me or Pam to get a license and

607
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:11,249
instead we can just hire someone like

608
00:27:08,368 --> 00:27:14,158
Michelle to negotiate a contract between

609
00:27:11,249 --> 00:27:17,460
the brand and the and the manufacturer

610
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,990
so white labeling is huge I have a

611
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,819
client and Michelle and I have been

612
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:23,519
actually on opposite sides of a

613
00:27:20,819 --> 00:27:26,609
transaction where she represents a brand

614
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:29,788
my client makes the stuff my client

615
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:33,449
packages it my client distributes it her

616
00:27:29,788 --> 00:27:35,700
client designs it so and that model that

617
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,889
white label model and for those of you

618
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,048
that don't know the terminology

619
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:41,548
essentially there's a manufacturer out

620
00:27:40,048 --> 00:27:44,849
there that's got a license to

621
00:27:41,548 --> 00:27:47,579
manufacture they have the machines they

622
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:50,189
make the oil and they can put her

623
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:52,648
clients label on it or J's clients label

624
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,028
on it or my clients label on it and

625
00:27:52,648 --> 00:27:56,729
maybe there's some there's gonna be

626
00:27:54,028 --> 00:27:58,589
nuances and differences in terms of the

627
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:02,069
mixtures and the terpenes and the blends

628
00:27:58,589 --> 00:28:04,859
and all that but that is a different and

629
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:08,609
in some ways much more affordable model

630
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:11,178
for a brand to survive what makes it

631
00:28:08,609 --> 00:28:11,178
challenge

632
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:16,649
social media I mean I have clients that

633
00:28:14,669 --> 00:28:19,288
have brands and you would think by their

634
00:28:16,648 --> 00:28:21,209
social media like their Apple but really

635
00:28:19,288 --> 00:28:23,940
they're very small but the social media

636
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,278
and the PR makes them seem much bigger

637
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,109
than they really are

638
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:29,339
but in those contracts there are so many

639
00:28:28,108 --> 00:28:31,648
complexities

640
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:33,990
because you have the brand on one side

641
00:28:31,648 --> 00:28:35,788
which hopefully owns intellectual

642
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:38,370
property which is like a whole separate

643
00:28:35,788 --> 00:28:40,829
conversation how to acquire it what it

644
00:28:38,369 --> 00:28:43,168
is and then you license the intellectual

645
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:45,058
property to the manufacturer so the

646
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:47,999
manufacturer can put it together and

647
00:28:45,058 --> 00:28:50,398
sell it and then the manufacturer will

648
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:53,399
either turn it over to a distributor or

649
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:55,739
there'll be the distributor and so all

650
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:58,408
those different pieces have to be worked

651
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,480
out it's not super complicated but there

652
00:28:58,409 --> 00:29:03,330
are some details again dealing with

653
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,528
who's gonna have insurance what happens

654
00:29:03,329 --> 00:29:08,819
if a product is contaminated whose

655
00:29:06,528 --> 00:29:11,339
responsibility is that well you design

656
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:13,618
the cartridges the cartridges are

657
00:29:11,339 --> 00:29:15,959
defective well you put the cartridges

658
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:18,480
together with the packaging it's your

659
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,740
fault so those kinds of issues have to

660
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,589
be worked out and honestly I don't think

661
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,778
they're unique to cannabis they're just

662
00:29:22,589 --> 00:29:27,808
unique for everyone in this room because

663
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:29,788
it used to be that you just grew it put

664
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:32,519
it in a bag brought it to the dispensary

665
00:29:29,788 --> 00:29:34,440
and you just waited for your money but

666
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:37,528
now it's a little bit more complicated

667
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:40,320
and it's a little bit more mainstream I

668
00:29:37,528 --> 00:29:42,749
think it's helpful sometimes imagine um

669
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:46,499
somebody's like behind a soundboard with

670
00:29:42,749 --> 00:29:49,980
like 16 different like levers to twist

671
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:53,759
right that's a commercial contract one

672
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:56,700
of the levers is who's responsible which

673
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:59,639
percent you or me it's responsible if it

674
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:01,980
gets seized in process right between the

675
00:29:59,638 --> 00:30:04,019
two places are you 100% or my a hundred

676
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:07,440
percent like there's a knob how many

677
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:10,288
days late is the product before there's

678
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,389
a penalty that's another knob so each

679
00:30:10,288 --> 00:30:14,849
one of you probably has one or two

680
00:30:12,388 --> 00:30:16,740
transactions you're constantly doing if

681
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:20,278
you're a cultivator you're constantly

682
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:23,190
selling to dispensaries or to

683
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:24,749
distributors or to manufacturers if

684
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,730
you're a manufacturer you're constantly

685
00:30:24,749 --> 00:30:28,710
buying from cultivators and maybe you're

686
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:31,460
sending it out to distributors there's

687
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:34,409
one or two deals you're constantly doing

688
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:37,649
spend a couple hours with one of these

689
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:40,980
people and figure out what are like the

690
00:30:37,648 --> 00:30:42,669
ten things you're always negotiating in

691
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:45,349
those two transactions

692
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:47,029
what are the 10 things you always have

693
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:48,909
to deal with and then they'll tell you

694
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:53,240
the six ones you're not thinking of

695
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:55,580
spend the time get to good form

696
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,640
agreements for the two deals you do

697
00:30:55,579 --> 00:31:00,679
every day right and then get a little

698
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,220
familiar with the ten different knobs

699
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:05,840
because wool writer and Greek but you

700
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,210
guys can negotiate with your

701
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:10,970
counterparties you know what 15 days is

702
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:13,400
too many okay so this parts gonna be 15

703
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:15,620
days who should bear the risk if it gets

704
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:18,500
seized in the road who should bear the

705
00:31:15,619 --> 00:31:19,519
risk if it gets moldy like these 16

706
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,390
different knobs

707
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,460
you know when Google sells something it

708
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:29,090
doesn't do a new contract each time it

709
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:31,340
takes the form of selling stuff and then

710
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:33,439
goes and it sales people fill in the

711
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:36,649
blanks it's more complicated than that

712
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,990
but you want to have a couple forms that

713
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:41,570
you use all the time so that you're not

714
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:43,160
reinventing the wheel right so think

715
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:45,319
hard about what are the two or three

716
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,660
things you're doing several times a week

717
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:50,029
or that constitute like the bulk of your

718
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:53,440
sales and your purchases and then invest

719
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:58,000
like make this tool make this template

720
00:31:53,440 --> 00:32:02,420
the goal for us is you get this really

721
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:05,119
polished like mercedes-benz that you can

722
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,620
drive because you know how to use the so

723
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,629
we got like a soundboard we got a car we

724
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:10,549
got all kinds of things but the goal is

725
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:14,690
for you to get this tool that you can

726
00:32:10,549 --> 00:32:17,029
use all the time there are a lot of

727
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:20,059
knobs it does get really intricate but

728
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:23,720
you probably do one or two transactions

729
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:26,720
several times a week right like this

730
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:30,710
will get commodified and the sooner you

731
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:34,610
can have some like confidence in what

732
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:37,490
you're doing I think the sooner this

733
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:40,429
will get demystified right because we're

734
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:43,308
buying and selling agricultural products

735
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:45,840
that become finished products

736
00:32:43,308 --> 00:32:47,668
you can you guys know how to do the

737
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,668
business side of it we can show you how

738
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:56,249
to do the legal side of it and then it's

739
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:58,799
perfect I mean what Jay said was really

740
00:32:56,249 --> 00:33:01,200
empowering to you to be able to ask

741
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:04,679
those questions and the only way that it

742
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,080
will become normalized that agreements

743
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:10,470
are the mainstay of this industry is by

744
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:12,449
you as operators requesting them of each

745
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,730
other because I think it's important to

746
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:17,129
note that we can sit up here tell you

747
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,899
how important agreements are but unless

748
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:21,418
you were willing to invest in them

749
00:33:18,898 --> 00:33:24,298
invest in yourselves and ask that of

750
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:26,129
each other as operators that's the only

751
00:33:24,298 --> 00:33:29,368
way we're gonna see this normalization

752
00:33:26,128 --> 00:33:32,189
now we've also talked about regulatory

753
00:33:29,368 --> 00:33:34,558
changes we're seeing those potentially

754
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:37,320
coming by the end of the week we've also

755
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,788
seen some interesting legislation which

756
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:41,668
as we've talked about distribution

757
00:33:38,788 --> 00:33:43,859
agreements I it's interesting some of

758
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:47,460
you in the room may be distributors what

759
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:49,288
does SB 311 have come into play it was

760
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,919
an urgency bill it came into effect

761
00:33:49,288 --> 00:33:55,019
right away as soon as it was signed and

762
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:57,149
it allows for distribution to

763
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:59,089
distribution transfers right

764
00:33:57,148 --> 00:34:02,689
distribution agreements down the line

765
00:33:59,089 --> 00:34:05,099
the storage only part of what

766
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:06,929
distribution movement throughout the

767
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:09,148
state means a few of our products coming

768
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:12,480
from up and humbled and it needs to get

769
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:14,608
down into LA and we're also under this

770
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,260
California driving restrictions you can

771
00:34:14,608 --> 00:34:18,088
only have a driver in the car eight

772
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,270
hours you can only stop in a secured

773
00:34:18,088 --> 00:34:23,219
area when your store product and these

774
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:26,338
COAS are moving along the supply chain

775
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:27,868
how has that affected distribution

776
00:34:26,338 --> 00:34:29,849
agreements and how you're advising

777
00:34:27,869 --> 00:34:33,269
clients JC your heads shaking vigorously

778
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:34,919
so you have some common I just moved

779
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:37,588
here from Oakland so a lot of my clients

780
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:39,179
are still in North Bay and they spent a

781
00:34:37,588 --> 00:34:40,619
lot of time like looking at naps to

782
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:43,260
figure out how long does it take to

783
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:46,019
drive from Mendocino like how far could

784
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:48,359
they get before the driver needed to

785
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:50,608
like stop and where could they get

786
00:34:48,358 --> 00:34:52,048
licenses and I think at this point they

787
00:34:50,608 --> 00:34:55,769
have a license in Culver City they have

788
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:56,730
a license in Mendo and that's kind of as

789
00:34:55,769 --> 00:34:58,739
far as they can go

790
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:00,599
I unfortunately don't know about this

791
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:02,849
new legislation that it sounds like will

792
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:12,659
change their business plan so you should

793
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:13,949
talk to my clients I feel like I should

794
00:35:12,659 --> 00:35:18,329
be the moderator and you should be on

795
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:26,339
the panel but she knows that she knows a

796
00:35:18,329 --> 00:35:29,759
lot so so SB 311 has to do with sort of

797
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:33,690
plugging a gap that was or a disconnect

798
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:37,350
between mikasa and the regulations

799
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:41,840
mikasa had contemplated that the product

800
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:44,489
would go from manufacturer to

801
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:46,640
distributor from distributor to retailer

802
00:35:44,489 --> 00:35:49,349
or from cultivator to distributor

803
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:51,839
distributor to retailer but you have

804
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:56,608
these distributors that are up here and

805
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:58,800
you have retailers down here and the

806
00:35:56,608 --> 00:36:01,460
logistics of it made it really

807
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,550
challenging so the regulations

808
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:07,199
contemplated that you could have a

809
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:09,539
storage only or transport only

810
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:13,079
distributor where there could basically

811
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:15,840
be a handoff from the primary

812
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:17,699
distributor if they will if you will to

813
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,430
somebody else that would then take the

814
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:23,219
product the rest of the way or store it

815
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:25,919
so that it could then go from your spot

816
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:29,339
to the retailer because so the way they

817
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,380
divide up the responsibility is that the

818
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,059
product can't leave the cultivator if

819
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,858
it's finished product it can't leave the

820
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:37,199
cultivator and if it's finished product

821
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:39,960
it can't leave the manufacturer until

822
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:43,739
it's batch tested and it goes to a

823
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,329
quality control check so the distributor

824
00:36:43,739 --> 00:36:47,129
is in charge of that

825
00:36:45,329 --> 00:36:51,059
the distributor can then take it from

826
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:53,400
their facility to the retailer or the

827
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:55,920
facility or the distributor can take it

828
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,650
to another distributor who would then

829
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,019
store it and then transport it to the

830
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:03,030
retailer without that second distributor

831
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:05,429
having to go through the same batch

832
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:08,040
testing and quality control process so

833
00:37:05,429 --> 00:37:10,500
what SB 311 did again is it reconciled

834
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:13,050
mikasa with a change in the regular

835
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:15,869
nations that had authorized that sort of

836
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:17,970
secondary use of a distributor so if

837
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:19,219
you're a distributor what SB 311 now

838
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:22,019
allows you to do is essentially

839
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:24,569
piggyback on another distributor that

840
00:37:22,019 --> 00:37:26,909
might be located a little closer to the

841
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:34,800
ultimate destination the products are

842
00:37:26,909 --> 00:37:38,639
going to but here's the wrinkle the

843
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,500
money so the distributors are performing

844
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,869
generally like five different functions

845
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,280
they perform a quality control function

846
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:46,589
to make sure the product is labeled

847
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,720
correctly they promote they perform the

848
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:50,220
batch testing process to make sure it

849
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:51,629
gets batch tested before it gets

850
00:37:50,219 --> 00:37:53,489
released they have to collect

851
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:56,340
cultivation taxes they have to collect

852
00:37:53,489 --> 00:37:59,909
excise taxes they have to then remit

853
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:01,860
those taxes to the California ftda or

854
00:37:59,909 --> 00:38:04,009
whatever it's now called and then they

855
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:07,530
have to transport it but if you're now

856
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:10,080
using that transport only person to do

857
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:12,360
part of the transport how do you divvy

858
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,549
up the dough how does who gets what like

859
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:17,519
that's a nuance that again like there's

860
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:19,080
no right answer for that there are sort

861
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:20,909
of some standard rates that are out

862
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:23,130
there but it's just another thing to

863
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:25,199
think about if you're if you're a

864
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:28,650
product manufacturer or if you're a

865
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:30,599
brand I am in LA but I want my stuff to

866
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:32,400
be in the Bay Area how am I gonna get it

867
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,739
there who's gonna be in charge of that

868
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,840
is it me is it my distributor is it my

869
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:40,049
manufacturer these are all things to

870
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:43,740
kind of be worked out there are nuances

871
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:46,289
to nuances exceptions to exemptions this

872
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:49,199
is how contracting works and talking

873
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:50,550
about distribution one of my favorite

874
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,039
agreements that comes off of a

875
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:55,890
distribution agreement is testing lab

876
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:59,000
agreements and it's ones that I don't

877
00:38:55,889 --> 00:39:04,799
see done often enough especially with

878
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:07,920
distributors - testing labs and riffing

879
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,900
off of that is recall procedures every

880
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,079
distributor should have recall

881
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:15,840
procedures if and when there is an issue

882
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:18,380
with a testing lab I know we're gonna

883
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:20,760
hear from operators later but one of the

884
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:22,610
critical components of why testing lab

885
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,530
recruitments are important is we

886
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:27,530
testing lab equipment is very sensitive

887
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:29,480
and it is very expensive and anytime you

888
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:32,480
have sensitive and expensive equipment

889
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:35,119
the subsidiary to that is that it will

890
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,389
at some times fail or need to be

891
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:42,019
recalibrated and what happens from the

892
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:44,509
bcc's point of view is that anytime the

893
00:39:42,019 --> 00:39:47,059
bcc sees discrepancies that are too wide

894
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:51,020
and you as a testing lab can no longer

895
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:54,440
issue a coa or certificate of analysis

896
00:39:51,019 --> 00:39:57,289
what happens in the following situation

897
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:01,400
that i will present to our panelists

898
00:39:57,289 --> 00:40:04,639
it's called a legal workshop in this

899
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:07,130
situation where you would have a testing

900
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:09,859
lab who was taking in product there

901
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:14,210
discrepancies were being called into

902
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:15,500
question by the bcc and in in this entry

903
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:19,429
room where they're trying to work with

904
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:22,000
the bcc they continue to take in batch

905
00:40:19,429 --> 00:40:25,129
samples from a distributor that

906
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,369
distributors product is then in cue from

907
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:29,900
the current regulations pursuant to the

908
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:32,869
readapted regulations that we're working

909
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:35,210
under it says that if the bcc were to

910
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:38,509
pull that testing labs ability to issue

911
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:41,119
a cui then all of the products is

912
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:43,850
stopped in the pipeline because it

913
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,369
cannot go to another testing lab either

914
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:48,409
a testing lab that is owned by that

915
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:51,529
testing lab licensee if it has multiple

916
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:54,109
labs it can't move it and it can't

917
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:56,480
contract with another licensed testing

918
00:40:54,110 --> 00:41:00,140
lab to test that product so that product

919
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,110
is sitting either the batch samples are

920
00:41:00,139 --> 00:41:05,029
sitting at the testing lab and have you

921
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:06,620
made an arrangement between the testing

922
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:08,360
lab and the distributor if you have to

923
00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:11,029
take a secondary set of batch sample

924
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:13,070
testing or if it's sitting not at your

925
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:16,420
distributors warehouse it's sitting in a

926
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:19,280
transport only storage storage

927
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:21,920
distributor it's taking up space there

928
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,640
and how long can it take up space so

929
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,110
what is a distributor and then therefore

930
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:28,849
a manufacturer or cultivator who's

931
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:31,740
waiting for this product to be released

932
00:41:28,849 --> 00:41:33,389
do in that situation and it's

933
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:35,309
interesting to note these are white

934
00:41:33,389 --> 00:41:38,279
testing lab agreements are important the

935
00:41:35,309 --> 00:41:40,920
only licensed type in the entire supply

936
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,900
chain that the BCC and their infinite

937
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:49,500
wisdom has said does not need to carry

938
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:51,539
insurance is a testing lab so what is it

939
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,239
that you would advise your client to do

940
00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:58,079
and I'm gonna section you all if you

941
00:41:54,239 --> 00:42:00,809
were the testing if you were

942
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,449
representing the testing licensee if you

943
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:05,639
were representing the distributor or if

944
00:42:03,449 --> 00:42:08,009
you were representing a manufacturer or

945
00:42:05,639 --> 00:42:10,319
cultivator who had given their product

946
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:14,070
to a distributor so if anybody wants to

947
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:16,590
jump out first and say who they yes

948
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:18,360
we're gonna roleplay this who is who if

949
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:21,030
you want to represent one of these

950
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:26,250
clients raise your hand or I will assign

951
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:29,310
them I do it at random okay Michelle you

952
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:31,860
are going to represent the cultivator or

953
00:42:29,309 --> 00:42:34,500
the manufacturer Michael you're going to

954
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:38,190
represent the testing lab and J you're

955
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:41,579
going to represent the distributor what

956
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:45,119
do you advise your client once the bcc

957
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:49,049
has pulled your the testing labs ability

958
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:52,800
to issue any more cos and the product

959
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:54,300
has already been taken in do you if you

960
00:42:52,800 --> 00:43:00,390
guys agree to switch roles you can

961
00:42:54,300 --> 00:43:02,010
Michael who said I could issue it it's

962
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:04,170
already been done and we're gonna

963
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:07,470
highlight why you need to have a good

964
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:10,619
contract so what would you advise them

965
00:43:07,469 --> 00:43:13,289
if in the situation that we have now

966
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:15,570
where they have not contracted and what

967
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:19,289
would you have advised them originally

968
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:23,220
so we can see what this agree why

969
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:25,170
agreements are so important even though

970
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:27,868
as a testing lab maybe you're not

971
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:29,550
obligated to carry insurance you're I

972
00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:32,608
mean it would be it would be

973
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:34,680
unimaginable not to happen they would I

974
00:43:32,608 --> 00:43:37,108
can't imagine that they wouldn't have

975
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:40,949
insurance and and honestly like I think

976
00:43:37,108 --> 00:43:42,719
the magic that would happen here is in

977
00:43:40,949 --> 00:43:44,689
having an insurance policy that

978
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:47,358
contemplates this

979
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:49,700
kind of scenario like I give you I gave

980
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:52,429
you I give you amazing credit for having

981
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:54,618
thought this up because I don't think a

982
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:57,259
lot of people are at this level where

983
00:43:54,619 --> 00:44:00,230
they're thinking of this issue what

984
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:02,089
happens when you're the manufacturer and

985
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:04,190
you've entrusted your product to my

986
00:44:02,088 --> 00:44:07,759
client and my clot it my client

987
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:11,230
basically has a freeze order my client

988
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:14,540
is unable to continue doing operations

989
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:18,050
hopefully my client has insurance but

990
00:44:14,539 --> 00:44:21,099
really our hands are tied and the issue

991
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:23,450
I think has to do with hopefully

992
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:26,390
contemplating in advance what that this

993
00:44:23,449 --> 00:44:28,939
scenario and apportioning the risk of

994
00:44:26,389 --> 00:44:31,608
loss but I would imagine frankly that

995
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:33,380
everybody has insurance that would

996
00:44:31,608 --> 00:44:36,289
address what is amounts to a business

997
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:38,680
interruption situation that's my two

998
00:44:36,289 --> 00:44:38,679
cents

999
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:50,030
not that I wouldn't love to take credit

1000
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:53,269
for fully coming up with this

1001
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:57,170
hypothetical but it is in part based in

1002
00:44:53,269 --> 00:45:00,349
an actual client issue or issues that

1003
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:02,710
are occurring I would say and it is

1004
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:04,910
interesting to note that sometimes

1005
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:08,358
testing labs can actually be the most

1006
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:10,879
difficult to insure I'm sure that we

1007
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:12,619
will hear about that in our next panel

1008
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:17,210
where the operators are discussing it

1009
00:45:12,619 --> 00:45:19,280
but they are not always able to provide

1010
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:21,050
the level of insurance of these types of

1011
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,180
situations and business interruptions

1012
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:26,450
because this is what you're contracted

1013
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:28,489
to do so if your shut down by the BCC

1014
00:45:26,449 --> 00:45:31,250
and you've been potentially issued a

1015
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:33,618
prior warning about the situation and

1016
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:36,349
you're still in taking products how does

1017
00:45:33,619 --> 00:45:38,059
that affect your contract negotiations

1018
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:40,700
right because the BCC by the time

1019
00:45:38,059 --> 00:45:43,369
they're pulling your ability to issue a

1020
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:45,710
test there have been multiple steps

1021
00:45:43,369 --> 00:45:47,960
where they've intervened because they've

1022
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:50,900
seen an issue usually you're not having

1023
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,179
such a jarring circumstance where the

1024
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:56,329
BCC is coming in unannounced so at what

1025
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:58,639
point and have you previously contracted

1026
00:45:56,329 --> 00:46:02,119
for it if you are the distributor or

1027
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:04,038
the manufacturer cultivator to say you

1028
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:06,499
shouldn't be taking in any additional

1029
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:09,559
tests with this oversight that you are

1030
00:46:06,498 --> 00:46:12,738
not allowed to cure the issue on the

1031
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:13,700
back end once you take it in-house so I

1032
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:15,470
don't know if we want to look at it from

1033
00:46:13,699 --> 00:46:16,939
a distributors point of view I don't

1034
00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:19,730
know the answer to this question it's a

1035
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:24,349
strong question I what occurred to me

1036
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:26,420
was to say to some of my clients this is

1037
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:28,579
a good exercise for everyone ask your

1038
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:30,680
Lord here are the three things most

1039
00:46:28,579 --> 00:46:32,960
likely to go wrong here are the three

1040
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:35,389
things we know are going to go wrong in

1041
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,548
the next two years do our form

1042
00:46:35,389 --> 00:46:39,980
agreements provide for what to do in

1043
00:46:37,548 --> 00:46:42,288
that scenario you talked about risk

1044
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:43,818
factors a couple minutes ago the way

1045
00:46:42,289 --> 00:46:46,489
companies often come up with risk

1046
00:46:43,818 --> 00:46:50,480
factors is they sit in a room and say if

1047
00:46:46,489 --> 00:46:52,940
we miss next quarter what will have

1048
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,639
happened to cause that like what are our

1049
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:57,858
likely failure patterns basically I

1050
00:46:55,639 --> 00:47:00,199
didn't think of this failure pattern for

1051
00:46:57,858 --> 00:47:04,219
testing companies it seems like we

1052
00:47:00,199 --> 00:47:05,689
should think about it but if you ever do

1053
00:47:04,219 --> 00:47:07,459
sit in a room with your lawyers for

1054
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:10,970
three hours and say we want to come up

1055
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:12,619
with a really good form say to them at

1056
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:14,808
some point here are the three things

1057
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:17,630
that are going to go wrong in the next

1058
00:47:14,809 --> 00:47:19,430
four years they're going to happen at

1059
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:22,509
some point we want our agreements to

1060
00:47:19,429 --> 00:47:24,798
provide for some path out of that

1061
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:26,809
everything is a defect everything has

1062
00:47:24,798 --> 00:47:29,449
some failure rate and that's fine your

1063
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:33,589
agreements can provide for like a detour

1064
00:47:29,449 --> 00:47:36,169
for you know what's the I don't want to

1065
00:47:33,588 --> 00:47:39,199
see self-destruct button but alike happy

1066
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:41,989
route out of a jam a parachute that's

1067
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:43,939
great that's great that's great yep well

1068
00:47:41,989 --> 00:47:47,059
usually cultivators and manufacturers

1069
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:48,679
even now nowadays they very rarely are

1070
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:51,410
not gonna have a contract already in

1071
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:52,879
place so first things first let's take a

1072
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:54,828
look at the contract that's in place

1073
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,140
which hopefully is a good one hopefully

1074
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:59,119
it it it passed the buck off to the

1075
00:47:57,139 --> 00:48:01,578
distributor it's the distributor's

1076
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,608
problem hopefully there's

1077
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:08,298
indemnification clauses in there

1078
00:48:03,608 --> 00:48:10,518
protecting the cultivator and if it's a

1079
00:48:08,298 --> 00:48:12,650
really really bad contract and it

1080
00:48:10,518 --> 00:48:14,509
doesn't give you all those

1081
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:16,220
safety nets then we're still gonna

1082
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:19,400
analyze the contract which hopefully

1083
00:48:16,219 --> 00:48:22,939
exists for for at least breach breach

1084
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:24,318
causes of action and it's you know it

1085
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,028
also kind of depends whether or not

1086
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:27,739
there was a contract between just the

1087
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:30,159
cultivator and the distributor or also

1088
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:32,509
was the cultivator having a had a

1089
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:34,159
contract relationship with the testing

1090
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:36,289
laboratory then that's called privity by

1091
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:38,000
the way well do the contract who did the

1092
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:40,880
cultivator had privity with the

1093
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,480
distributor the lab everyone up the

1094
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,608
chain so you kind of need to assess

1095
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:48,400
who's liable to who who has a duty to

1096
00:48:46,608 --> 00:48:51,318
whom in this in this supply chain

1097
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:54,769
situation once you analyze the contract

1098
00:48:51,318 --> 00:48:56,659
and it kind of smells like good

1099
00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:58,489
old-fashioned litigation with the

1100
00:48:56,659 --> 00:49:01,848
testing lab that's how you're probably

1101
00:48:58,489 --> 00:49:03,588
gonna end up getting your money yeah so

1102
00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:09,410
we'll do though we'll do that we'll do

1103
00:49:03,588 --> 00:49:10,969
it that way I'm suing your lab my right

1104
00:49:09,409 --> 00:49:12,828
and whether you're doing it in concert

1105
00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:14,568
with the distributor or not or whether

1106
00:49:12,829 --> 00:49:17,630
you're suing your distributor because

1107
00:49:14,568 --> 00:49:20,538
remember when do you pay the money when

1108
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:23,568
have you contracted for that release of

1109
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:24,710
the money for the products because J and

1110
00:49:23,568 --> 00:49:26,750
I'm sure you're sitting in this

1111
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:29,358
situation is the distributor I don't

1112
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:31,219
want to pay the cultivator or the

1113
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:33,949
manufacturer until I get a clean CoA

1114
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:36,019
right because I can't resell it so if

1115
00:49:33,949 --> 00:49:37,548
you're taking it in at what point to

1116
00:49:36,019 --> 00:49:40,659
your point about the knobs and the

1117
00:49:37,548 --> 00:49:43,219
levers when is payment being released

1118
00:49:40,659 --> 00:49:46,159
and so there's a lot of different

1119
00:49:43,219 --> 00:49:47,899
nuances in this one fact pattern we

1120
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:50,778
started in one place and we're talking

1121
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:52,910
about 17 other different issues that

1122
00:49:50,778 --> 00:49:54,139
take you down a different path I think

1123
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:56,960
what you've heard and what you've

1124
00:49:54,139 --> 00:50:00,318
experienced with this exercise is that

1125
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:02,449
there is no one right way to do a

1126
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:04,190
contract and there are multiple

1127
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:08,048
different parties that are gonna

1128
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:11,869
experience different levels of

1129
00:50:08,048 --> 00:50:14,389
discomfort when things go wrong and they

1130
00:50:11,869 --> 00:50:16,700
do so to riff off of this example which

1131
00:50:14,389 --> 00:50:19,400
I also think is important is talking

1132
00:50:16,699 --> 00:50:21,139
about both recalls and defects because

1133
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:24,500
this is something that I'm sure if you

1134
00:50:21,139 --> 00:50:25,059
all of your operating is a big question

1135
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:27,429
I've been

1136
00:50:25,059 --> 00:50:29,739
this question by some of my operators

1137
00:50:27,429 --> 00:50:32,109
well if I don't like a product and I

1138
00:50:29,739 --> 00:50:33,969
take it in can I destroy it as defective

1139
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:37,269
it's not selling no you cannot

1140
00:50:33,969 --> 00:50:40,449
defective has a very specific reason it

1141
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:42,429
is already a term of art in what is it

1142
00:50:40,449 --> 00:50:44,859
California Code of regulations what is a

1143
00:50:42,429 --> 00:50:46,359
product defect it literally has to be

1144
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:48,519
defective that does not mean it doesn't

1145
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:51,039
move off your shelves that does not mean

1146
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:54,909
that people don't like it but what

1147
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:57,909
happens when there's truly a recall what

1148
00:50:54,909 --> 00:51:00,489
happens in an instance again with a

1149
00:50:57,909 --> 00:51:01,569
testing lab a CoA comes back and then

1150
00:51:00,489 --> 00:51:05,079
all of a sudden there's a discrepancy

1151
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:07,900
and after 24 hours or 48 hours and let

1152
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:10,989
me tell you once a CoA comes in product

1153
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:14,889
is moving right it's going from the

1154
00:51:10,989 --> 00:51:17,709
distributor to a retailer so within 48

1155
00:51:14,889 --> 00:51:21,069
hours even 24 hours sometimes product is

1156
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:23,949
on a shelf and so what happens and in

1157
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:27,670
how far can a testing lab if they have

1158
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:31,389
to start issuing a recall because there

1159
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:33,700
was an actual discrepancy in the CoA

1160
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:36,670
that was reported how is that

1161
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:39,129
manifesting itself and there are you

1162
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:41,619
know there are only specific required

1163
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:45,010
recall procedures for the Department of

1164
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:48,609
Public Health right although even though

1165
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:50,980
it doesn't say it for the BCC or for DFA

1166
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:52,960
they don't have specific outline recall

1167
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:56,110
procedures if you're a distributor your

1168
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:58,570
requirement for the BCC is to provide

1169
00:51:56,110 --> 00:52:01,300
inventory control and recall procedures

1170
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:02,860
so it doesn't necessarily matter where

1171
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,510
they are housed between the three

1172
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:06,730
agencies at the end of the day this is

1173
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:08,770
the distributor has to have this in

1174
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:11,829
their inventory control plan as does a

1175
00:52:08,769 --> 00:52:13,960
retailer how do you go about doing that

1176
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:16,420
and whose responsibility is that and

1177
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:18,250
where is it in your plan bringing it all

1178
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:20,940
the way back to what Michael originally

1179
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:23,860
said about either applications or

1180
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:26,320
licensing your product if you're you

1181
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:28,120
know advise clients as they move forward

1182
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:30,700
with this and you're doing a licensing

1183
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:33,159
agreement and your licensing agreement

1184
00:52:30,699 --> 00:52:37,119
with your brand also has to contemplate

1185
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:38,559
brand reputation what do you do in a

1186
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,299
recall procedure there is that

1187
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,670
something that you would negotiate

1188
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:44,320
between the in a white labeling

1189
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:46,690
agreement if you have to do that to

1190
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:47,410
protect that brand integrity where does

1191
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:49,119
that happen

1192
00:52:47,409 --> 00:52:50,409
does it happen with the distributor is

1193
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,509
that part of a distributor or

1194
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:55,539
conversation with the testing lab or a

1195
00:52:52,510 --> 00:53:00,610
distributor with manufacturer cultivator

1196
00:52:55,539 --> 00:53:05,619
I'll let you guys opine on that well in

1197
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:09,760
the case Michael and I have our my

1198
00:53:05,619 --> 00:53:11,710
client the brand is responsible for

1199
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:15,570
designing the product designing the

1200
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:15,570
packaging making it nice and pretty

1201
00:53:15,989 --> 00:53:21,250
Michael's distributor / manufacturer

1202
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:24,700
client is responsible for assembling at

1203
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:27,340
all making sure what my client prepared

1204
00:53:24,699 --> 00:53:30,730
is compliant with packaging and labeling

1205
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:33,010
etc making sure the product the actual

1206
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:35,079
extraction actual assembly is conducted

1207
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:39,730
by Michaels client so there's obviously

1208
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:41,440
two very distinct roles here kind of

1209
00:53:39,730 --> 00:53:44,650
some overlapping I guess in the

1210
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:47,740
packaging and labeling compliance area

1211
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:52,030
but in our situation you know we put

1212
00:53:47,739 --> 00:53:54,639
recalls you know who's responsible for

1213
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:56,830
recalls is depending on what the recall

1214
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:57,609
was for if it was packaging and

1215
00:53:56,829 --> 00:54:01,329
compliance

1216
00:53:57,610 --> 00:54:04,539
I am packaging and labeling I think we

1217
00:54:01,329 --> 00:54:07,119
slipped a baby on that because of our

1218
00:54:04,539 --> 00:54:10,449
our shared rules in it if it was due

1219
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:13,569
completely to product contamination or

1220
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:15,789
something that Michaels client did he

1221
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:19,930
was responsible for that so that's kind

1222
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:22,900
of the the fair approach that we took

1223
00:54:19,929 --> 00:54:28,750
with that at least does anyone still

1224
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:33,309
want to be in this business like so so

1225
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:35,769
so you know he listening to us talk Ike

1226
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:39,340
and imagining myself over there I would

1227
00:54:35,769 --> 00:54:42,579
imagine that this is distressing but

1228
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:44,410
there the reality is the good news is

1229
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:45,880
that there are lawyers out there that

1230
00:54:44,409 --> 00:54:48,789
and they don't even have to necessarily

1231
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,930
be cannabis lawyers but it's probably

1232
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:51,670
better that they are but there are

1233
00:54:49,929 --> 00:54:52,838
lawyers out there that can help you with

1234
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:55,358
these problems

1235
00:54:52,838 --> 00:54:57,849
like you make the stuff we hell it's

1236
00:54:55,358 --> 00:55:00,639
it's like what Jay said we we we

1237
00:54:57,849 --> 00:55:03,219
collaborate with one another so we get

1238
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:06,190
paid and we stay up late at night to

1239
00:55:03,219 --> 00:55:09,278
think about these issues so that you

1240
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:14,469
don't have to think about them the

1241
00:55:09,278 --> 00:55:18,099
reality is that that you could you'll

1242
00:55:14,469 --> 00:55:21,729
never anticipate in a contract all of

1243
00:55:18,099 --> 00:55:24,759
the things that can go sideways because

1244
00:55:21,728 --> 00:55:26,798
if you did then there wouldn't be a need

1245
00:55:24,759 --> 00:55:30,659
for litigators because what litigators

1246
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:35,679
do is they litigate the gray areas and

1247
00:55:30,659 --> 00:55:38,409
while as a former litigator it's you can

1248
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:40,690
reverse engineer where disputes have

1249
00:55:38,409 --> 00:55:42,098
happened in the past and try to keep

1250
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:44,349
them from happening in the future by

1251
00:55:42,099 --> 00:55:47,588
addressing them in better prepared

1252
00:55:44,349 --> 00:55:49,180
contracts you could have a contract

1253
00:55:47,588 --> 00:55:51,159
that's 100 pages long and you'll never

1254
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:55,598
anticipate things that you haven't

1255
00:55:51,159 --> 00:55:57,449
anticipated there you just can't so you

1256
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,829
can include in a contract

1257
00:55:57,449 --> 00:56:01,868
hopefully you'll address like as Jay

1258
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:04,390
said you'll identify the ten things that

1259
00:56:01,869 --> 00:56:06,068
really matter and you'll scope it out

1260
00:56:04,389 --> 00:56:08,048
what happens if somebody steals

1261
00:56:06,068 --> 00:56:10,509
something what happens if it fails a

1262
00:56:08,048 --> 00:56:11,920
test what happens if the product doesn't

1263
00:56:10,509 --> 00:56:14,228
taste the way it's supposed to taste

1264
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,430
who's responsible for that and then

1265
00:56:14,228 --> 00:56:17,498
there's like a bunch of stuff that no

1266
00:56:15,429 --> 00:56:20,469
one's thought of you can cut put in a

1267
00:56:17,498 --> 00:56:22,449
contract some catch-all provisions that

1268
00:56:20,469 --> 00:56:24,278
protect you and I think actually

1269
00:56:22,449 --> 00:56:27,548
Michelle in the contract that we did

1270
00:56:24,278 --> 00:56:29,409
added some language that I thought was

1271
00:56:27,548 --> 00:56:31,809
really great for her client and didn't

1272
00:56:29,409 --> 00:56:34,239
really rub me the wrong way and it it

1273
00:56:31,809 --> 00:56:37,059
was broad enough to kind of protect

1274
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:38,858
against an unanticipated situation it

1275
00:56:37,059 --> 00:56:41,410
was something like hey listen you're

1276
00:56:38,858 --> 00:56:43,598
making my company's product you know our

1277
00:56:41,409 --> 00:56:46,210
reputation our goodwill is on the line

1278
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:48,249
like carry yourself accordingly to

1279
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:50,739
protect us so it's sort of like a

1280
00:56:48,248 --> 00:56:51,909
provision that maybe if there's no other

1281
00:56:50,739 --> 00:56:54,179
provision in a contract that

1282
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:57,118
specifically addresses a situation

1283
00:56:54,179 --> 00:57:00,368
creates a duty on my client's part and

1284
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:02,079
that if I fail to do something that's

1285
00:57:00,369 --> 00:57:04,358
maybe not specifically or expressly

1286
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:06,548
addressed her client can rely on it to

1287
00:57:04,358 --> 00:57:06,940
say hey dude look you really knew better

1288
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:10,150
and you

1289
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:11,800
should have done that better so I guess

1290
00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:16,030
what I'm saying is don't don't be

1291
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:20,079
distressed and try to trust us to help

1292
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:22,390
you as far as the specific question that

1293
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:24,310
you were asking I honestly filibustered

1294
00:57:22,389 --> 00:57:27,868
and I don't remember what it was but I

1295
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:27,869
know I had a really good answer for it

1296
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:33,250
that's save for later so that everybody

1297
00:57:31,568 --> 00:57:38,559
stays he'll figure it out and come back

1298
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:41,469
at the end I'd open it up to everybody

1299
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:44,469
else's questions cuz you've listened you

1300
00:57:41,469 --> 00:57:46,059
I'm sure all understand that the devil

1301
00:57:44,469 --> 00:57:48,759
is in the details and you should what

1302
00:57:46,059 --> 00:57:51,670
love your lawyer it's like my new

1303
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:55,569
favorite saying but does anybody have

1304
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:58,300
any questions as we wrap up one into the

1305
00:57:55,568 --> 00:58:01,599
question was we've been focused on see

1306
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:05,050
corpse but what is the benefit or why

1307
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:07,630
how would you advise between a c-corp

1308
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:10,060
and LLC incorporation so at the point

1309
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:12,068
where you're selling your company you're

1310
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:14,920
probably either one or the other so you

1311
00:58:12,068 --> 00:58:16,719
wouldn't have the ability to change if

1312
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:28,210
you go from a corporation to an LLC

1313
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:30,279
you'll get a big tax basically when

1314
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:32,199
you're selling your company you want to

1315
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,019
get long-term capital gains you could

1316
00:58:32,199 --> 00:58:37,838
get that either as an LLC or as a

1317
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:39,730
corporation so from the sellers

1318
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:41,409
perspective it doesn't really matter

1319
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:43,800
because you want the same tax treatment

1320
00:58:41,409 --> 00:58:45,969
either way from the buyer's perspective

1321
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:46,900
there's a whole bunch of other factors

1322
00:58:45,969 --> 00:58:49,809
that go into it

1323
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:52,119
you can convert from an LLC to a Corp or

1324
00:58:49,809 --> 00:58:54,880
former Corp to an LLC one of those paths

1325
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:56,858
is expensive one of them is not but you

1326
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:00,460
wouldn't do that right before the

1327
00:58:56,858 --> 00:59:04,389
acquisition because you would kind of

1328
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:05,619
eliminate the goal long story short it

1329
00:59:04,389 --> 00:59:07,750
doesn't really matter if you're an al

1330
00:59:05,619 --> 00:59:10,329
Asiri corporation when you get sold for

1331
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:13,480
your personal tax consequence don't

1332
00:59:10,329 --> 00:59:15,460
worry about that the only thing I would

1333
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:18,068
add is that that that whole issue of

1334
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:20,440
what do we want to be and when it comes

1335
00:59:18,068 --> 00:59:20,920
up at the startup phase it's not one

1336
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:24,539
size

1337
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:27,760
it's all I mean personally I prefer

1338
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:30,699
using LLC's because I find them easier

1339
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,410
to work with in corporations but they

1340
00:59:30,699 --> 00:59:34,269
have different tax consequences there

1341
00:59:32,409 --> 00:59:36,809
are different there are ways of turning

1342
00:59:34,269 --> 00:59:39,610
LLC tax consequences into the same as

1343
00:59:36,809 --> 00:59:42,070
corporate tax consequences in terms of

1344
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:44,760
like using an S Corp or just having an

1345
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:47,470
LLC that's taxed like a corporation but

1346
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:49,450
corporations and LLC's have are taxed

1347
00:59:47,469 --> 00:59:52,299
very differently there are different

1348
00:59:49,449 --> 00:59:55,389
280e consequences especially from the

1349
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:57,130
purview of state law which is a

1350
00:59:55,389 --> 00:59:58,210
complicated issue I'm sorry I brought up

1351
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:00,400
but I can talk to you about it

1352
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:02,920
afterwards but it's definitely not

1353
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,210
one-size-fits-all and I don't mean J

1354
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:07,750
would know better than I but I don't

1355
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:09,940
think I don't think there's a straight

1356
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:11,889
answer for that it really depends on

1357
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,840
your own circumstances depends if you're

1358
01:00:11,889 --> 01:00:16,809
in retail are you on the production side

1359
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:23,470
what are your 280e consequences what's

1360
01:00:16,809 --> 01:00:27,070
your exposure to risk the question is

1361
01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:30,159
we're dealing with an industry that's

1362
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:33,850
legal under state law that's illegal

1363
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:36,879
under federal law and what's is there an

1364
01:00:33,849 --> 01:00:41,019
issue for enforceability of contracts is

1365
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:44,440
that more or less it so I think

1366
01:00:41,019 --> 01:00:48,280
historically there was a larger concern

1367
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:50,590
with contracts being invalidated both

1368
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:54,490
under state law or in state courts and

1369
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:56,440
in federal courts I'm not aware of since

1370
01:00:54,489 --> 01:00:59,019
the legalization effort I'm not aware of

1371
01:00:56,440 --> 01:01:02,440
any courts in California California

1372
01:00:59,019 --> 01:01:06,130
courts state courts refusing to enforce

1373
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:09,550
a contract that selected California

1374
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:13,000
courts as the forum I think a lot of

1375
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:16,210
people are fearful that federal courts

1376
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:19,389
will not enforce contracts and so they

1377
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:22,929
will put in a contract a forum selection

1378
01:01:19,389 --> 01:01:26,710
clause that requires you to litigate in

1379
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:30,219
federal court the thing I don't know is

1380
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:33,550
I don't know if you ended up in federal

1381
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:34,659
court if a federal court sitting in

1382
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:38,109
California

1383
01:01:34,659 --> 01:01:40,899
would refuse to enforce that contract I

1384
01:01:38,108 --> 01:01:43,960
am not aware of that situation I'm

1385
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:47,798
actually aware of some situations where

1386
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:50,009
federal courts have in fact enforced

1387
01:01:47,798 --> 01:01:52,538
contracts I'm not aware of situations

1388
01:01:50,009 --> 01:01:55,539
where federal courts except for

1389
01:01:52,539 --> 01:01:56,289
bankruptcy courts have said no can't

1390
01:01:55,539 --> 01:01:58,509
touch it

1391
01:01:56,289 --> 01:02:01,479
it's illegal federally because at the

1392
01:01:58,509 --> 01:02:04,599
end of the day whether you're in federal

1393
01:02:01,478 --> 01:02:07,139
court or state court and even if you're

1394
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:11,170
in federal court the federal court is

1395
01:02:07,139 --> 01:02:14,739
enforcing a contract that's governed by

1396
01:02:11,170 --> 01:02:18,670
state law and under state law it's

1397
01:02:14,739 --> 01:02:20,079
enforceable and it's legal but it's a

1398
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:23,380
great question I don't know if anyone

1399
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:26,200
else wants to chime in it's also

1400
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:28,150
assuming that your contract is legal and

1401
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:30,098
like it's between a legal licensed

1402
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:32,920
operator and another legal licensed

1403
01:02:30,099 --> 01:02:35,318
operator if you are one or both of you

1404
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:37,088
are in a legal business that probably

1405
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:40,710
will be held and enforceable if you try

1406
01:02:37,088 --> 01:02:40,710
to enforce that contract in state court

1407
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:48,430
there's a case called gullickson GU LOI

1408
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:51,278
C KS o n it's a Northern District of

1409
01:02:48,429 --> 01:02:55,179
California so federal court case I think

1410
01:02:51,278 --> 01:02:58,028
late 2016 but the northern district

1411
01:02:55,179 --> 01:03:00,219
court basically said cannabis contract

1412
01:02:58,028 --> 01:03:03,880
that's okay because it's based in

1413
01:03:00,219 --> 01:03:06,849
California law there's a new law a year

1414
01:03:03,880 --> 01:03:08,380
and a half cannabis contracts are lawful

1415
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:12,700
objects of Commerce in California

1416
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:14,259
they're like selling water in California

1417
01:03:12,699 --> 01:03:17,108
he's right you want to stay out of

1418
01:03:14,259 --> 01:03:19,509
federal court and just to correct the

1419
01:03:17,108 --> 01:03:22,509
record when a corporation converts to an

1420
01:03:19,509 --> 01:03:24,998
LLC that's when there's this asset sale

1421
01:03:22,509 --> 01:03:26,798
type tax when an LLC converts to a

1422
01:03:24,998 --> 01:03:29,368
corporation that's a smooth tax

1423
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:29,369
consequence

1424
01:03:30,358 --> 01:03:41,848
drop and drop the mic lawyer correction

1425
01:03:36,338 --> 01:03:45,489
disclaimer I would like to invite you to

1426
