2
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:32,969
good evening all welcome to what have

3
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:37,320
the regulations done to us

4
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:39,058
love your regulations I don't know so

5
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,558
where are we and why are we talking

6
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:47,479
today I and why is today the 11th most

7
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:50,909
important you've 11 important days left

8
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:53,038
last Friday the three regulatory

9
00:00:50,909 --> 00:00:55,578
agencies which I'm sure everybody in

10
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,760
this room is familiar with the Bureau of

11
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:02,219
that was ominous and true of cannabis

12
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,769
control the Department of Public Health

13
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:08,840
and the Department of Food and I've all

14
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:12,900
released their revised draft permanent

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:15,960
regulations they did so so nicely early

16
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,299
in the morning on Friday verses at 4:45

17
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:22,469
when I thought they were going to drop

18
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:25,970
Thank You BCC for hijacking my day and

19
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:29,819
what that means is it started a 15 day

20
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:33,959
countdown where we can provide public

21
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:37,438
comments that terminates on November 5th

22
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:41,339
at 5:00 p.m. you can provide comments to

23
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:43,258
the regulatory agencies via email snail

24
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,030
mail I think you can even call them and

25
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,950
harass them if you would like but in

26
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:51,118
some form or fashion you have to comment

27
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,990
by 5:00 p.m. now what can you comment on

28
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:57,540
during this period you can comment on

29
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:59,548
revisions and the rulemaking process you

30
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,320
can't just blanket lis comment on

31
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:04,680
anything you want that was during the

32
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:08,250
45-day comment period that ended earlier

33
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:10,289
in August and why should you comment why

34
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,389
is that effective I think we can start

35
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,318
there and that's pretty important we

36
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:15,419
were able

37
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:18,060
- and I think before we get into

38
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:20,119
ostracizing the agency's about what we'd

39
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:25,560
like to see changed there were positive

40
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:28,670
steps in the right direction we saw we

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,319
saw movement we saw developments and

42
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:33,688
therefore I think the big takeaway is

43
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:36,298
and why you all are sitting in this room

44
00:02:33,688 --> 00:02:39,090
tonight you can make a change and

45
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:40,950
together as an industry we can unite to

46
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,348
those things that are most concerning

47
00:02:40,949 --> 00:02:46,318
and the most problematic and before we

48
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:49,408
get there I'd like to invite my fellow

49
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:52,968
panelists to provide some of what they

50
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:56,608
think were wins in these last set of

51
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:58,259
updates to the regulations I'm gonna go

52
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:59,579
ahead and jump in but I hope I'm not

53
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,479
taking this but I know that we are

54
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:04,620
totally probably in line with this is

55
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,209
makes a huge difference in the long run

56
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,449
but that metric is now instead of

57
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:12,180
inventory every 14 days it's once a

58
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:14,340
month not like that should make any

59
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,389
difference to your SOPs not that that

60
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,239
should make any difference with that

61
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:21,629
also on that one tied in with that is

62
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,959
that it went from 2.5% of your inventory

63
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:29,638
or what's it $5,000 whichever one is

64
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:33,509
less - now 3% of your inventory and no

65
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:36,689
cap on the dollar amount however I don't

66
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:38,518
like that in my personal opinion but I

67
00:03:36,688 --> 00:03:38,870
like it that we only have to do it once

68
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,969
a month

69
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,519
nice Jackie order some of your big

70
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:47,280
exciting takeaways I think the Bureau

71
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,590
did an excellent job at finding some

72
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,169
middle ground based on our feedback in

73
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,819
our public comments during the 45-day

74
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:57,419
public comment period that we just

75
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:59,128
witnessed the Bureau only expected all

76
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:02,069
three agencies to get a thousand

77
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:04,978
comments altogether and they got 4,000

78
00:04:02,068 --> 00:04:07,978
half of those comments were a direct

79
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:12,479
result of some grassroots movement and

80
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:14,099
in particular related to 54:16 D which

81
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,199
allowed statewide delivery whether a

82
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:18,810
jurisdiction had a ban or not that was a

83
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:22,169
big one it's still a big one but we have

84
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:24,149
a letter of support to go that we're

85
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:25,740
gathering signatures for right now so

86
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:29,339
that we can make sure that that stays

87
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,050
in tact but we also saw really really

88
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:33,779
big wins and delivery across the board

89
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,978
in my opinion they're regulating

90
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:40,439
technology platforms now and requiring

91
00:04:36,978 --> 00:04:44,250
the big wins depends on what side of the

92
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,870
spectrum you're on on that one my firm

93
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,120
represents most of the delivery

94
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:52,038
associations in the state and so for us

95
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:57,509
those were really big wins that we the

96
00:04:52,038 --> 00:05:00,719
the restriction on when you can leave a

97
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:03,598
dispensary with a retail order or with a

98
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,650
delivery order now has to have you have

99
00:05:03,598 --> 00:05:09,918
to have $2,500 of orders before you can

100
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:13,348
disperse and then you can have up to

101
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:15,810
$5,000 worth of inventory in your car so

102
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:18,439
they tried there the bureau really did a

103
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:21,300
good job at listening to the industry

104
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:23,490
and and their concerns over the fact

105
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,038
that there was an unregulated a few

106
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,319
unregulated tech platforms that were

107
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:30,478
sort of gobbling up market share and not

108
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,069
necessarily playing by the same set of

109
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:36,538
rules that small delivery services have

110
00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:38,550
to have to play by so the fact that you

111
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:41,129
can they took the limit down from

112
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,770
$10,000 that you could carry in your car

113
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:46,079
down to five and then with that other

114
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:47,218
restriction requiring twenty five

115
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,800
hundred dollars worth of orders before

116
00:05:47,218 --> 00:05:53,098
you drive around what they're trying to

117
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,788
do is is prevent what our opposition it

118
00:05:53,098 --> 00:05:59,038
likes to call wandering wheat and they

119
00:05:56,788 --> 00:06:02,250
didn't want delivery services to turn

120
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:04,860
into ice cream trucks and our opposition

121
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:07,228
was actually the UFCW who sponsored a

122
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,750
campaign called stop the wandering weed

123
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:12,120
and they used cartoon figures to show us

124
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:15,538
driving up to schools and delivering to

125
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,399
children and it's just nothing that

126
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:19,370
makes me more angry than when anyone

127
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:22,888
uses the children against us especially

128
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:25,288
given how much we have to combat that

129
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:28,348
argument over and over again in every

130
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:30,240
single jurisdiction when I see a union

131
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:32,399
that's supposed to be our union

132
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,650
representing our interests use the

133
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,149
children against us that have just isn't

134
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:38,489
anything more offensive to me than that

135
00:06:36,149 --> 00:06:40,979
won't it be a wonderful day

136
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,360
when we can look back and remember when

137
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,509
we couldn't do some of these things

138
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,889
though and it's just like people are

139
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,019
gonna start waking up and understand oh

140
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:51,629
this this actually doesn't kill anybody

141
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:53,729
and wait this actually saves lives it

142
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:55,079
makes people's lives better I can't wait

143
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:57,500
till that time because some of the stuff

144
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,029
that we're gonna go over tonight is

145
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,209
ridiculous that we still are being

146
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:06,509
hindered by a plant that's never heard

147
00:07:03,209 --> 00:07:08,879
the child-resistant sea whiplash in an

148
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:12,209
alcohol bottle does not have

149
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:15,629
child-resistant C or your child can walk

150
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:18,239
into a convenience store and pick up an

151
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:21,029
alcohol bottle and nobody is there to

152
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,829
tell them no there is no security there

153
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:29,009
is no please stop present your ID let me

154
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:32,250
put it in an opaque exit bag before you

155
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:34,740
leave or that we are all up not we are

156
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,269
all but many people X are up in arms

157
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:41,460
about straws

158
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:45,089
I mean we're bitch about straws and then

159
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:46,979
we have bags and childproof mints in

160
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:48,899
their individual little packages unless

161
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,100
you and most things and we'll get there

162
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:52,139
we're supposed to be on wins right now

163
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:56,850
let's talk about our wins because

164
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:58,860
there's a fuel to the winds California

165
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:01,920
and cannabis companies are in fact

166
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:06,900
disruptive they are in fact incredibly

167
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:09,270
innovative and creative and with its

168
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:12,209
with that spirit that I want us to look

169
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:16,370
at the regulations and how we go about

170
00:08:12,209 --> 00:08:20,189
dealing with some of these more complex

171
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,990
nuanced issues so before we dive into

172
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:25,199
that some of the things that I think

173
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:27,629
we're successful and I'd like to Pat the

174
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,420
BCC on the back for cuz you got to

175
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:36,830
celebrate the wins before you discuss

176
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:41,460
the issues is that look now as a

177
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:44,700
retailer you're gonna be able to reject

178
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,590
shipments right this is huge before you

179
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,780
were gonna have to fully reject an

180
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:51,210
entire distribution shipment that came

181
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:54,120
to you if one SKU

182
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:56,399
had a labeling issue right now you don't

183
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,409
have to do that if there is a parts of

184
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,009
your order that are damaged in transit

185
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:04,289
you can specifically identify those on

186
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:07,799
the manifest and send them back that was

187
00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:10,379
not compliant operations previously I

188
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:12,689
think the BCC listened and they looked

189
00:09:10,379 --> 00:09:16,049
at the certificate of analysis that were

190
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:19,500
coming in where nearly what is it almost

191
00:09:16,049 --> 00:09:22,829
70% of the reasons that cos were failing

192
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,778
was because the THC in the CBD the the

193
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,700
cannabis content cannabis the

194
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:29,009
cannabinoid content was wrong label

195
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,570
through the label figures because it was

196
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:34,230
one of the four primary panel

197
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,850
requirements before manufactured goods

198
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,769
were allowed to leave they had to have

199
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,420
that cannabinoid content on them and it

200
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:41,669
was a guessing game and they were

201
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:44,579
failing so the BCC listened and now a

202
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:47,879
distributor can put that on after the

203
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:50,459
fact after the coa comes in um can i

204
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:54,588
interject real quick so i i went to

205
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:56,909
college for a few things multiple times

206
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:58,560
I went for psychology and English

207
00:09:56,909 --> 00:10:01,019
rhetoric and running and technical

208
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:04,409
writing was a huge aspect of what I had

209
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:05,838
to do and from a technical writing

210
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:07,980
standpoint I think there's an issue of

211
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,890
you oftentimes will write out an

212
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,000
instruction like a how-to and you do it

213
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:14,819
from your perspective with your

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,519
preconceived notions and I feel like

215
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:21,750
this is what the state blatantly showed

216
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:24,088
us is that they do not understand what

217
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:27,929
cannabis is what the cannabis industry

218
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:30,510
is and how to write regulations by it so

219
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:32,250
they wrote the most intense regulations

220
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:35,490
over something that they didn't even

221
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:37,649
understand it it drives me nuts it's

222
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,990
like they did not take the stakeholders

223
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:43,169
in this industry patients distributors

224
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:44,549
retailers cultivators into consideration

225
00:10:43,169 --> 00:10:45,899
when they wrote these regulations now

226
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:50,729
they keep coming back with these

227
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:53,069
whiplash regulations we talk about the I

228
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,589
think it's also important that we don't

229
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,600
forget about the forms right these are

230
00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:00,959
forms that you are going to have to

231
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,790
utilize and so when we comment on the

232
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:05,759
regulatory package

233
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:08,849
in what you are allowed to comment on

234
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:11,159
please let us not forget that the forms

235
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:14,730
because most of them are new are things

236
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:16,649
that you can comment on and so if they

237
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,840
don't make sense and in some of the

238
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:20,340
forms they were asking for things that

239
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:23,160
did not make sense and these were

240
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:26,940
blanketed forms to be used by every

241
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:29,459
license type that the BCC controls we've

242
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:32,280
now seen the BCC come out with specific

243
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:35,129
testing regarding forms and pulled that

244
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:37,529
from the regular inventory control forms

245
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:38,970
that they had previously the sequel

246
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:41,459
forms for those of you who don't know

247
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,170
what sequa is it is my favorite I was an

248
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:45,870
environmental attorney before I came to

249
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:48,419
cannabis but it's a you know three or

250
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,450
four letters that amount to the

251
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:53,819
California and Environmental Quality Act

252
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:56,759
sequa is the preeminent environmental

253
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,500
law in the country it is what it's

254
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,750
federal analogue the National

255
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,870
Environmental Policy Act or NEPA it was

256
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:06,240
really based upon and so when you are

257
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:09,389
thinking oh you know what my city or

258
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,820
county exempted the ordinance in

259
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:15,090
sequence this doesn't affect me I don't

260
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:17,240
have to worry about it you're wrong I'm

261
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:19,710
sorry the answer is just simply a no

262
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:24,240
Seco is triggered by a discretionary

263
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:28,200
action the Bureau issuing you a permit

264
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:32,970
is a discretionary action that limited

265
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:35,430
statutory exemption expires in July 1 of

266
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:37,110
2019 that most of these cities are some

267
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:39,539
of these cities specifically the city of

268
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:43,320
Los Angeles used to exempt their

269
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:45,209
ordinance only did that exempted the

270
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,720
ordinance it did not exempt your

271
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:51,480
individual projects if you are an

272
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,570
individual project and you are in an

273
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,580
existing building you may think notice

274
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,490
of exemption you may not but there's a

275
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:02,009
categorical exemption class that says

276
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:04,620
notice of exemption for an existing

277
00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:06,960
facility you are only an existing

278
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:10,529
facility if you do not change the use

279
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:14,970
and if you do not exceed the existing

280
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:15,519
footprint and so what the BCC did was it

281
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,670
made

282
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,279
you sequa forms not just one it said if

283
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:23,139
you think that you are exempt for any

284
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,480
particular reason and there are several

285
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:29,230
classes if anybody's interested we can

286
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,970
talk about it later but um there are an

287
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:33,279
exemption package and then there's a

288
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:35,680
package if you have to adjust your

289
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,750
project and you're not sequent exempt

290
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:40,719
and you have to go through it's four

291
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:42,610
pages and there are specific ways in

292
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,490
which you have to address sequa with

293
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:49,029
magic language that gets you to not have

294
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:51,279
to conduct a further environmental

295
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:53,289
review through an environmental impact

296
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:57,519
report or a mitigated negative

297
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:59,589
declaration these are pathways that

298
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,879
commercial in hundreds of thousands of

299
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:07,360
dollars and up to six nine twelve or

300
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:08,919
thirty six months to get through and if

301
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,620
you don't have a provisional license

302
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:13,509
which we'll talk about for the year that

303
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,879
means you can't operate until you go

304
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:18,549
through sequa so please take a look at

305
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:21,279
the forms and see if you have any

306
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:23,319
questions clarifications or wouldn't be

307
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,139
able to respond to them according to

308
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,810
your project so we can comment on forms

309
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:34,779
I didn't know that and because it's all

310
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:37,389
brand new so I do me want to jump into

311
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:39,549
regulatory whiplash or owner financial

312
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:41,949
interest wizard how many people in the

313
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:44,529

it

322
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:17,669
tepid annual white label white labeling

323
00:15:19,309 --> 00:15:23,750
you're asking for a ton of clarity on

324
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:24,799
this but there is clarity if you talk to

325
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:28,278
the right people that know the right

326
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:32,028
things in the right place so where we're

327
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:34,490
at right now is most people are still

328
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:36,950
rushing to get their temporary permits

329
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:40,190
in with whatever agency they're applying

330
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:43,520
with and at the beginning of the year

331
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:45,380
the bureau wanted major cities they

332
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,720
wanted everybody to start issuing these

333
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:49,100
temporary permits and cities were kind

334
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,200
of scratching the head going yeah but we

335
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,180
haven't really done any inspections on

336
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,640
them and you know if I made it through

337
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:58,219
code compliance and the fire department

338
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:59,778
but okay we're gonna trust you you we're

339
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,730
gonna give out these temporary permits

340
00:15:59,778 --> 00:16:04,039
and that's what happened so yet big

341
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:06,620
cities like Sacramento and Oakland and

342
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:10,240
San Francisco that were just kind of

343
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,960
giving out these temps in good faith and

344
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,700
thinking that they were gonna get

345
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:16,940
through the process of all those checks

346
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:19,520
and balances and what happened was they

347
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,870
all ran out of time so we are

348
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,230
approaching the end of the year we're

349
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:27,110
statutorily the temporary licenses are

350
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:29,930
not going to exist any they're not going

351
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:32,779
to be issued any more after December

352
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:35,269
31st but even trying to get your temp by

353
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:37,069
the December 31st is going to be more

354
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:38,779
challenging and the CDFA just released

355
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,370
today that they will no longer be

356
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:43,759
accepting any more temporary

357
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:46,339
applications at just by December 1st

358
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,110
okay so let's November they're back it

359
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,550
up a little bit okay does everybody

360
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,810
understand the difference between what

361
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:53,179
Jackie was talking about which is

362
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:55,639
fundamental your local permit and if

363
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:57,649
your local jurisdiction gave you a

364
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,659
temporary permit which then entitled you

365
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:02,208
to go get a state temporary permit so

366
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:04,099
there's there's two things happening one

367
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:07,068
in order to get your state temporary

368
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:08,779
permit you need to have a local permit

369
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:11,240
or you need to have local authorization

370
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:13,519
of some kind and so at the beginning or

371
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:18,170
late last year probably around this time

372
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:19,759
actually um the BCC was I we were all in

373
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,560
Vegas and they were coming out with the

374
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:24,410
emergency regulations so they were going

375
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:25,879
around talking to the cities saying you

376
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,650
have to get ready you have to give local

377
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,290
authorization so that we can start

378
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:32,080
issuing temporary permits before the end

379
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:34,690
of the year so Cara so to start

380
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:37,740
On January 1 when we turn on that lever

381
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:39,788
there's businesses that can conduct I

382
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,269
commercial legal commercial cannabis

383
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:45,730
activity under the implemented

384
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:48,460
regulations and what that transpired was

385
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:51,308
cities like Sacramento issuing these

386
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:54,069
temporary conditioned letters of

387
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:57,548
approval so that they could go to the

388
00:17:54,069 --> 00:17:59,439
BCC and obtain a temporary permit and

389
00:17:57,548 --> 00:18:01,750
we've been working under this state

390
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,278
temper or a structure for the better

391
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:08,859
part of ten months working on a year so

392
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:11,259
we're what was supposed to occur or what

393
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:13,178
did occurs you applied for your initial

394
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:15,730
temporary permit that entitled you to

395
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:18,700
operate for a hundred and twenty days at

396
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,069
which time you had to then apply for

397
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,980
your annual permit when you applied for

398
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:26,589
your annual permit you were granted

399
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:29,079
90-day extension so everybody in this

400
00:18:26,589 --> 00:18:31,509
room everybody in this state that is

401
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:34,388
operating in a state compliant fashion

402
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:37,359
is doing so under a temporary permit why

403
00:18:34,388 --> 00:18:41,288
do I say this because as of today

404
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:44,548
what is it the 25th of October all three

405
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:48,069
regulatory agencies have issued zero

406
00:18:44,548 --> 00:18:51,038
annual permits for any supply chain

407
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:53,678
actor continuous supply chain actor I

408
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:56,138
say that as an asterisk because to be

409
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,210
technical when you are an event

410
00:18:56,138 --> 00:19:00,069
organizer you were issued your full

411
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:03,269
event organiser license because there

412
00:19:00,069 --> 00:19:06,038
was no reason to issue you a temporary

413
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:08,169
because it's not tied to any particular

414
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:09,879
location or a building or continuous

415
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:12,070
commercial activity in fact it is

416
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,769
limited in the number of events you can

417
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:17,250
throw a year so as we're working on

418
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:21,669
these temporary permits we were

419
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:24,190
confronted when the new Pro Draft

420
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:26,889
permanent regulations came out that we

421
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:32,649
were reminded under 64 which when it was

422
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:35,109
brought in together with the MC RMC RSA

423
00:19:32,648 --> 00:19:39,939
before we were the ma you see RSA under

424
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:42,129
SB 94 that part of 64 came in and that

425
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,230
said regulatory agencies you were only

426
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,950
vested with the right to issue temporary

427
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:49,089
permits

428
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:51,970
until December 31st of 2018 that means

429
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:55,319
that in order to issue a permit by

430
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:57,759
December 31st of 2018 for any new

431
00:19:55,319 --> 00:20:00,159
temporary licensee that's seeking a

432
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:03,160
permit the agencies have to have enough

433
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,590
time to process these permits for CDFA

434
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:08,410
as jackie said they put the date as

435
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:11,409
December 1 why because when they did the

436
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:13,509
readapted regulations they escalated and

437
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,759
expanded what it is that you need to

438
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:17,470
provide in order to get a temporary

439
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,990
permit you now have to provide a

440
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:23,319
cultivation plan you never had to do

441
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:25,269
that before the readapted regulations so

442
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:28,299
instead of taking a week to two weeks to

443
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:31,480
process CDFA has been running a four to

444
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:33,430
six week delay from when you submit to

445
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,519
when you were issued a temporary permit

446
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:38,230
so them saying December 1 means that

447
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:41,619
they're gonna work nights and weekends

448
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:44,890
to process these applications heed the

449
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:47,199
warning know that they mean that if you

450
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:51,220
submit after December 1st

451
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,740
they cannot will not guarantee that even

452
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:57,519
if you put that my license in that you

453
00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:00,819
will be issued it by the 31st what why

454
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:03,970
is that so critical because in order to

455
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:06,549
get a provisional annual license which

456
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:09,759
is what happened at the end of the

457
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:12,129
legislative session in August I at the

458
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:19,000
11th hour they got it an amended a bill

459
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:21,580
SB 1415 59 Wow my thoughts are a little

460
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,039
out of my head 14:59

461
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:27,250
and that said you have to have or have

462
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:30,909
held interesting legal verbage there

463
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:33,369
have or had or have or held a temporary

464
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,380
permit in order to get a provisional

465
00:21:33,369 --> 00:21:37,919
annual what is a provisional get you it

466
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:43,840
means you can operate for an entire year

467
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:46,180
an entire year well you got your

468
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:49,449
application processed from the state and

469
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:52,420
deal with the local level if you do not

470
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:55,450
have a provisional what does that mean

471
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:58,300
it means that before you turn on your

472
00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:01,569
business before you do one

473
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:04,659
iota of commercial cannabis activity you

474
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:07,480
have to be issued a full annual permit

475
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:12,060
from one of the three agencies who have

476
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:14,950
issued no annual permits in ten months

477
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:17,349
so what I think it's quite interesting

478
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,789
here is that nobody's received their

479
00:22:17,349 --> 00:22:20,439
annual yes

480
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:22,779
nobody's receive their annual do you

481
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:27,460
feel the windows closing as to when you

482
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:29,769
oh yeah roll into a provisional so that

483
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,900
yeah that and we don't know what the new

484
00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:33,910
window is is going to entail when it

485
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,009
when it comes to you submitting a full

486
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,390
annual application we have no way to

487
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:39,279
quantify exactly how long it's gonna

488
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,680
take any of the agencies to process that

489
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,180
or if it's going to be a priority at all

490
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:48,340
oh yeah no way of knowing if it's gonna

491
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:51,279
be three months six months a year I find

492
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:52,990
it interesting that I feel like the

493
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:54,369
government again to that technical right

494
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,380
anything where they've put the cart

495
00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:58,059
before the horse so one reason why I

496
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:00,400
feel like they haven't given annual

497
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:02,529
licenses yet is because they're still

498
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,560
understanding what the hell metric is

499
00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:10,809
and they have not figured out that

500
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:13,179
metric itself is a system that has flaws

501
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:15,429
and issues and goes down when the state

502
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,950
of Maryland had to do their anti looping

503
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:21,570
protocol and it took out if Marilyn can

504
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:24,490
take down metric what the hell do you

505
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:27,759
get instead of data to be up yeah and

506
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:29,769
it's like when the city of Culver City

507
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:32,259
not even Los Angeles when we come on

508
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:34,960
board over here what is that gonna do to

509
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:36,849
this system that is riddled with issues

510
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,289
I find that it's quite interesting I

511
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:39,639
think that's why the state is now giving

512
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:41,319
extensions left and right because like

513
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,300
oh shit like right we've wiped her ass

514
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:45,490
before we should as soon as they issue a

515
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:47,740
provisional metric has to go online

516
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:50,200
because you have to do everything you're

517
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:52,210
entitled to do for an annual asterisks

518
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,340
without a vested right once you are

519
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,769
issued or provisional that means take a

520
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:58,389
look at that new licensing take a look

521
00:23:56,769 --> 00:24:00,039
at the new fee structure you want to

522
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:02,050
talk about a comment that I would wish

523
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:04,450
everybody in this room to make if you

524
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:06,639
are going to be an operator they gave us

525
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:09,910
better tiered systems thank you so much

526
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,130
VCC so they we know where you are in a

527
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,558
classification what they didn't do

528
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:18,220
would allow you based off of a business

529
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:20,558
that doesn't have a knowledgeable track

530
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:23,048
record of what your sales will be they

531
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:25,269
didn't give you the flexibility to say

532
00:24:23,048 --> 00:24:26,859
you know what BCC I'm six months in and

533
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:29,859
it looks like I'm gonna make more money

534
00:24:26,859 --> 00:24:31,629
than I thought great I see I was in a

535
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:33,490
special event and I served as the

536
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:36,820
retailer so all the sudden I had an

537
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:40,029
influx of income that I didn't expect

538
00:24:36,819 --> 00:24:43,058
I want to up my percentage I want to pay

539
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:45,308
you more of a fee so that at the end I

540
00:24:43,058 --> 00:24:48,009
don't get a penalty and have to pay half

541
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:51,190
the fee plus the other fee as it's

542
00:24:48,009 --> 00:24:54,490
currently drafted or I get a credit i

543
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:56,919
overshot some reason I had a recall I

544
00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:00,130
had an issue my business didn't do as

545
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:02,530
well should I then be able to roll that

546
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:05,140
money into next time is there any

547
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:07,210
flexibility in the licensing both as a

548
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:10,210
benefit or no penalty to run a business

549
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:12,970
that you have to forecast out an entire

550
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:15,490
year of your operation in a space that

551
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:18,269
is unknown and evolving without any

552
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:20,950
flexibility so this may be why the

553
00:25:18,269 --> 00:25:22,298
companies that luckily like that the

554
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,340
delivery and things like this are kind

555
00:25:22,298 --> 00:25:27,308
of trying to phase out is does it

556
00:25:24,339 --> 00:25:28,449
sometimes feel as it does to me but and

557
00:25:27,308 --> 00:25:31,569
I'm sure other people is that this is a

558
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:33,850
pay-to-play yes industry right now is

559
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:36,730
that we went from unregulated for 20

560
00:25:33,849 --> 00:25:38,918
years and now we are hyper regulated and

561
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:41,230
they are pushing out the people that

562
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:44,650
have fought for not just cannabis as

563
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:46,538
medicine but CBD genetics all of these

564
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:48,548
things that we are pushing these people

565
00:25:46,538 --> 00:25:51,279
out so that we can replace them with

566
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:53,408
people with big money you so comment

567
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:57,129
comment cuz that's a that's a legitimate

568
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:59,080
real world affecting your bottom line is

569
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:00,039
a business comment and it makes good

570
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:02,470
business sense

571
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:04,629
nobody's saying I don't want to pay and

572
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:08,288
nobody's saying I won't let you keep my

573
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:10,539
money but if you tell them within six

574
00:26:08,288 --> 00:26:13,658
months or within three months of your

575
00:26:10,538 --> 00:26:15,788
renewal look I got a pivot one way or

576
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:17,650
the other based on market considerations

577
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:19,960
and what has happened to my business

578
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:23,048
you're asking for something reasonable

579
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:26,470
and as my mother likes to say if the

580
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:30,220
the answer is no what's the harm in

581
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:35,200
asking the question so let's switch to

582
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:36,399
white hot white labeling disaster I know

583
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:42,129
that's what everybody wants to talk

584
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:44,589
about it's what 32b go ahead Pamela and

585
00:26:42,128 --> 00:26:48,579
we've all by the way just had a few days

586
00:26:44,589 --> 00:26:51,908
to digest hundreds of pages of documents

587
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:54,339
to refer back to and please understand

588
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:57,429
this is just my perspective and your

589
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:59,558
lawyer I'm not gonna make the good old

590
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:02,080
legal disclaimer that you should have

591
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:04,058
done at the beginning i none of this

592
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,460
advice should be used for your own

593
00:27:04,058 --> 00:27:09,220
individual businesses without seeking

594
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:12,028
the guidance of a knowledgeable attorney

595
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:14,889
or consultant for your particular needs

596
00:27:12,028 --> 00:27:18,579
we are expressing personal opinions and

597
00:27:14,888 --> 00:27:25,269
those alone so thank you very much for

598
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:27,339
that public service announcement the

599
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:29,769
change is verbatim because that may be

600
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:31,868
helpful the licensees shall not conduct

601
00:27:29,769 --> 00:27:35,230
commercial cannabis activities on behalf

602
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:39,099
of at the request a door pursuant to a

603
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:41,288
contract with any person and person also

604
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:44,319
includes entity because person under the

605
00:27:41,288 --> 00:27:46,419
law is both an individual and a entity

606
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:49,089
as acting as a person that is not

607
00:27:46,419 --> 00:27:51,788
licensed under the Act the act being the

608
00:27:49,089 --> 00:27:54,339
Mau CRS a such prohibited commercial

609
00:27:51,788 --> 00:27:57,999
activities include but are not limited

610
00:27:54,339 --> 00:28:00,730
to those commas are very important to

611
00:27:57,999 --> 00:28:02,288
the following procuring or purchasing

612
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:05,099
cannabis Goods from a licensed

613
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:07,298
cultivator or a licensed manufacturer

614
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:09,699
manufacturing cannabis goods according

615
00:28:07,298 --> 00:28:12,339
to specifications of a non licensee this

616
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:14,950
one is particularly troubling packaging

617
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:17,048
and labeling cannabis goods under a non

618
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:19,359
licensees brand or according to the

619
00:28:17,048 --> 00:28:21,730
specifications of a nine licensee again

620
00:28:19,358 --> 00:28:24,249
extremely troubling distributing

621
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:26,769
cannabis Goods for a non cannabis

622
00:28:24,249 --> 00:28:28,839
licensee which is sort of tethered to

623
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:31,329
were anchored to the technology platform

624
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:35,709
language in fifty four fourteen point

625
00:28:31,329 --> 00:28:36,168
one I think that that is so why is this

626
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:39,798
can

627
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:41,809
why why are we concerned about this

628
00:28:39,798 --> 00:28:44,450
particular provision for those of you

629
00:28:41,808 --> 00:28:46,548
who are at NCI AC CIA I thought it was

630
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,288
very interesting that from the

631
00:28:46,548 --> 00:28:50,839
regulator's point of view and from Laura

632
00:28:48,288 --> 00:28:53,239
herself she was quite surprised at the

633
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:56,599
reaction and the negative reaction of

634
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:58,999
the industry to this it is it was the

635
00:28:56,599 --> 00:29:03,558
BCC official opinion that this was

636
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:06,319
merely a clarification existing posting

637
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:08,690
policy I feel that it it was a

638
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:12,019
clarification in a lot of ways and as

639
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:16,669
somebody who has been a purchaser a sop

640
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:19,489
writer and run dispensaries I feel like

641
00:29:16,669 --> 00:29:21,470
this was a and I'm on both sides of this

642
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:24,200
I'm very neutral is because the fact is

643
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,759
is that if we did not have brands who

644
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,759
could not get their license due to the

645
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:30,919
rigidity of the regulations they had no

646
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:34,519
choice either watch their brand die or

647
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:37,159
get with a company that has a license

648
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:38,450
that has ability to manufacture but what

649
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:39,859
I'm understanding from is that you just

650
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,259
need to have some contracts in place

651
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:44,178
what I've been seeing and I can totally

652
00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:47,558
see why the state did this is we have

653
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:49,309
just like in July first when all sudden

654
00:29:47,558 --> 00:29:52,970
cannabis you couldn't find on the market

655
00:29:49,308 --> 00:29:55,878
oh it was there it just went from legal

656
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:57,739
dispensaries to illegal outlets and

657
00:29:55,878 --> 00:29:59,388
that's what I feel like what's happening

658
00:29:57,739 --> 00:30:01,100
here is that a lot of people with

659
00:29:59,388 --> 00:30:02,388
manufacturing license like oh yeah I

660
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:04,788
cultivated this because there's no

661
00:30:02,388 --> 00:30:08,388
metric track and trace in place so all

662
00:30:04,788 --> 00:30:12,288
sudden this you know 5,000 square foot

663
00:30:08,388 --> 00:30:15,138
10,000 square foot grow is pumping into

664
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:16,999
the market however it is meeting the

665
00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:18,709
needs and then providing tax dollars to

666
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:21,558
that I'm not judging anybody that's not

667
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:23,480
my job I do that so this is may have

668
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:24,858
been a clarification but the fact that

669
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,618
it was coupled with new language

670
00:30:24,858 --> 00:30:29,480
requiring disclosure of ownership and

671
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:34,099
that's what happens whenever you do this

672
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:37,009
illegal of it makes much more you don't

673
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:38,808
get nice things when one person does

674
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:40,819
something wrong most of you have heard

675
00:30:38,808 --> 00:30:42,829
me speak before I say that a lot and

676
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:44,658
because it is very true that's why we

677
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:46,668
can I think you made a very good point

678
00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:49,080
right it's for those operators that

679
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:51,120
could not find a home that tried but

680
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:53,309
know what this regulation is based off

681
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,829
of is the egregious behavior of those

682
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:58,619
who had the war chest and the money and

683
00:30:55,829 --> 00:31:01,230
the time and the knowledge to go out and

684
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:04,079
get a license and instead didn't and

685
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:07,230
kept walking and acting and being like a

686
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:09,750
duck in saying that they were overtly

687
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:11,819
having a brand and having a license and

688
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,960
go buy my products they weren't your

689
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:15,029
products anymore

690
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,160
they were products where you licensed

691
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:19,619
your brand name to another licensee and

692
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,060
they became a house of brands then

693
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:23,009
aren't you technically at that point I'm

694
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:24,869
just a marketing company you should be

695
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:26,789
but they would not hold themselves out

696
00:31:24,869 --> 00:31:28,679
to be I think we all in this room can

697
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:30,599
think of a few brands that if you looked

698
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,310
up whether they had a license and when

699
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:35,189
you read the eyesore or you read the

700
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:38,369
statement of reasons as to why the BCC

701
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:41,039
did this there are hallmarks in there if

702
00:31:38,369 --> 00:31:43,139
we see people acting out of school so

703
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,339
you from your point of view it's very

704
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:45,840
true you got to look at it from both

705
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:48,419
sides of the issue what are they trying

706
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:50,339
to prevent and what are people doing

707
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,380
coupled with what happened with the

708
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:55,619
Department of Public Health regulations

709
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:58,590
we have zero localities that have issued

710
00:31:55,619 --> 00:32:00,089
a type s license a type s license does

711
00:31:58,589 --> 00:32:03,379
anybody know what that is does anybody

712
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:06,769
concerned about that to talk about it

713
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:09,630
okay a type s license is a shared

714
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:12,119
facility a shared manufacturing facility

715
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:14,430
interestingly enough though it was

716
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:17,009
written that you have to have a share a

717
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:19,140
User Agreement so you have to have an

718
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:22,440
agreement the locality has to expressly

719
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:24,900
allow the type s facility and then the

720
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,400
landlord needs to be involved in that

721
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:28,320
too because you're now using your

722
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,080
business for multiple operators but each

723
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,059
operator in that scenario goes and gets

724
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:35,339
a permit what's interesting about that

725
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:37,679
and shows the clear indication that the

726
00:32:35,339 --> 00:32:39,449
agencies don't understand the true cost

727
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:43,410
of doing business in this space and it's

728
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:46,799
pay-to-play is that day and by the sheer

729
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:49,019
amount of grace did DPH do this they

730
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,109
originally said that you could only make

731
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:53,940
half a million dollars in profits and

732
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:57,089
that's all you could make as a Type S

733
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:59,549
licensee they upped it to a million

734
00:32:57,089 --> 00:33:01,609
dollars isn't that nice of them and by

735
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:03,289
the state

736
00:33:01,609 --> 00:33:04,819
men of reasons as to why they did that

737
00:33:03,289 --> 00:33:06,769
was because if you made a million

738
00:33:04,819 --> 00:33:09,649
dollars you should be able to go out and

739
00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:12,139
get your own license and let's just for

740
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:14,900
clarity on this one since there are

741
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:17,690
cannabis business they may have done a

742
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:19,970
million dollars but had 999 thousand

743
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:21,679
dollars worth of overhead and they could

744
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,509
not write that off so they can't show

745
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,790
that they have a thousand dollars worth

746
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:29,539
of profit they have a million dollars

747
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:31,099
exactly and I think it's important to

748
00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:32,690
know that every single thing that you're

749
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:34,699
wearing every single thing that you have

750
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:36,169
at your home was done by a manufacturer

751
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,210
that was probably a licensing agreement

752
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:39,590
and that the cannabis industry is just

753
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:42,230
learning how to survive while also

754
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:45,259
paying a hundred percent of tax with

755
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:48,500
zero write-off and wants to be a

756
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:51,529
business and Lori herself said I want to

757
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:54,230
help you operate your businesses you

758
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:56,690
know how you help operate our businesses

759
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:58,669
as a collective industry allowing us to

760
00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:01,070
take advantage of the business practices

761
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:04,160
that are available to us and white

762
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:06,168
labeling private labeling licensing

763
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,918
agreements these are traditional

764
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:11,059
cornerstones of any commodity

765
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:12,918
marketplace so let's talk about some of

766
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:15,679
the solutions that you and I know that

767
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:19,128
people are debating right now and some

768
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,019
that are being advised by attorneys and

769
00:34:19,128 --> 00:34:23,358
because I think that's what everyone is

770
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:25,039
most concerned about so that I do want

771
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,049
you guys to know that like the smartest

772
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,449
people I know are working on this and

773
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:31,690
have you know proposed solutions that

774
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:35,000
they're vetting amongst each other and

775
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:38,929
we're doing our everything that we can

776
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,300
do to try to find a path to make you

777
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:44,210
know white labeling still a thing

778
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:45,470
but if you are white labeling and you're

779
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,929
touching the product and you're not

780
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:50,418
licensed it's an issue you're not

781
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:52,760
supposed to be if you're just leasing

782
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:54,918
you're genetics and your plan and your

783
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,530
recipe to someone who is producing that

784
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:59,629
product for you that we can get we can

785
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:02,600
fix we can make sure that that can still

786
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:03,650
happen I'm pretty sure anyway and I mean

787
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:08,089
we're hearing that there might be

788
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:10,369
another draft after this this a public

789
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:12,050
comment period expires don't know if

790
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:14,150
that's true if there's not then there

791
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,210
might not be a pathway to fix this other

792
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:18,119
than through

793
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:21,269
state lobbying but right now we're

794
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:23,970
really focused on trying to to fix this

795
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:25,139
and family do you want to give up give

796
00:35:23,969 --> 00:35:28,108
them some of the solutions that you've

797
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:30,838
heard I can read Max's eye there's a

798
00:35:28,108 --> 00:35:33,049
plethora of solutions all the way from

799
00:35:30,838 --> 00:35:36,420
redrafting and reorganizing your

800
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:38,430
agreements such that specifications

801
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:41,068
right that language we don't want to

802
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:45,358
specify we want to give options at the

803
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:48,779
election of the manufacturer to take

804
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:51,299
that really on do you own a piece of the

805
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,670
licensee right are you well-liked do we

806
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,920
tie these agreements to if you are an

807
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:58,680
owner or a financial interest holder and

808
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,200
those have been I think imploded to

809
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:03,480
explode to include almost anybody and

810
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:06,500
anything fits into one of those two

811
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:10,079
categories so if we simply tack on

812
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:12,539
unless you are considered an owner or a

813
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,430
financial interest holder then you would

814
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:16,619
be able to do these things as long as

815
00:36:14,429 --> 00:36:18,690
the agreements were in place I think

816
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:21,660
that to me makes sense because if you

817
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:24,119
enjoy the rights and responsibilities

818
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:26,098
but you are also then incurring the

819
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:27,000
liabilities and the consequences of

820
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:29,220
those actions

821
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,619
if somebody's actions can cost you your

822
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:32,969
license then they are in an effect part

823
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:35,010
of that license so that would be

824
00:36:32,969 --> 00:36:37,769
licensees conducting business together

825
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:40,460
or internally through one license act

826
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:45,119
that would get you out of that contract

827
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:47,940
if you go about having your IP in a

828
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,030
separate multiple entity structure which

829
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:54,480
we've always done for 280e protection

830
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:57,450
and also so that you can license that

831
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,010
back to yourself you're in I have to

832
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:01,980
define those differently with different

833
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,690
classes and options and is that really a

834
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,699
function that works for your business

835
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:08,909
that all you also have to think about if

836
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:10,949
you are purely a licensing company or a

837
00:37:08,909 --> 00:37:13,230
company that says we are not plant

838
00:37:10,949 --> 00:37:15,838
touching if you expose yourself to being

839
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:17,849
an owner if you were to do something

840
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:20,159
where you were a branding entity and

841
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:22,410
we've heard going out and getting other

842
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:25,028
licenses think about what that means

843
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:27,759
once you are in fact a lie

844
00:37:25,028 --> 00:37:29,889
Cinci that you say I am an owner or a

845
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:32,168
financial interest holder what does that

846
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:34,778
do to your business what does that do to

847
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:38,318
financing and money that you've taken in

848
00:37:34,778 --> 00:37:40,599
under the color of not being having to

849
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:43,028
go through these disclosure requirements

850
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:44,769
so a lot of its gonna come down to and

851
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:48,309
unfortunately I'm gonna do the cagey

852
00:37:44,768 --> 00:37:50,918
lawyer thing those individual nuance

853
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:53,739
contracts of how you maneuver through

854
00:37:50,918 --> 00:37:56,528
this language and creatively carve

855
00:37:53,739 --> 00:38:00,969
yourselves out of what is a very

856
00:37:56,528 --> 00:38:04,900
expansive definition of white labeling

857
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:06,759
or entering into quasi commercial

858
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:12,400
cannabis activity I would call it into

859
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:14,998
the the gray area so I know that a lot

860
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,519
of people are talking about potentially

861
00:38:14,998 --> 00:38:20,078
proposing a new license type for a non

862
00:38:18,518 --> 00:38:24,129
plant touching you know just

863
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:26,079
administrative easy it it would be that

864
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:28,749
it would be a simple solution but we

865
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,519
would have you know a lot of departments

866
00:38:28,748 --> 00:38:40,928
debating that and then the cost of it

867
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:44,678
and you know but because that's what

868
00:38:40,929 --> 00:38:47,889
they do in the liquor industry and I

869
00:38:44,679 --> 00:38:51,309
know that another attorney I know is

870
00:38:47,889 --> 00:38:54,548
advising some of her clients to become

871
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:58,869
have the licensee become an employee of

872
00:38:54,548 --> 00:39:01,208
the white label er and and figuring out

873
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:02,619
a contract with that if you if you're in

874
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:04,478
this industry and you think that you're

875
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:07,329
gonna be able to do this by yourself

876
00:39:04,478 --> 00:39:09,668
you're not you're gonna have consultants

877
00:39:07,329 --> 00:39:12,969
and attorneys on your team for the

878
00:39:09,668 --> 00:39:16,208
longevity of your brand because your

879
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:21,729
brand is going to depend on it so max

880
00:39:16,208 --> 00:39:28,719
who is who I work with came up with this

881
00:39:21,728 --> 00:39:30,759
solution okay well I've just kind of

882
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:31,838
give like a few different answers

883
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:35,048
because I don't think that there's a

884
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:38,579
one-size-fits-all solution to this

885
00:39:35,048 --> 00:39:40,889
problem you've got IP people that

886
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:44,730
you know Colorado brands out-of-state

887
00:39:40,889 --> 00:39:46,949
brands and definitely being affected by

888
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:49,289
this but you have legacy operators being

889
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:51,659
affected by this you have people that

890
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:53,219
are touching the plant that are trying

891
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:54,599
to hide out and not get licenses that

892
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:57,000
are being affected by this and maybe

893
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:59,909
that's you know a good thing a bad thing

894
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,789
I don't know but we need solutions for

895
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:05,699
all of those so there isn't going to be

896
00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:08,659
one thing that the bureau can come up

897
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:12,569
with but yeah they're just talking about

898
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:15,719
Max's solution yeah be real cognizant of

899
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:18,720
what is a specification and how much

900
00:40:15,719 --> 00:40:20,549
direction you are giving I think if you

901
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:22,559
contract and say at the end of the day

902
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:25,710
the manufacturer has any and all rights

903
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:27,599
to ensure compliance there may be some

904
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:29,789
flexibility there because they're really

905
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,009
looking at who is controlling are you

906
00:40:29,789 --> 00:40:34,559
acting on their behalf or you're putting

907
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:36,480
that out into the marketplace and then

908
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,219
also you know it always comes down to

909
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:41,760
where is the money follow the money how

910
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:44,789
is the money being taken in why is the

911
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,550
money being taken in for what reason how

912
00:40:44,789 --> 00:40:49,529
you're drafting those terms I think it's

913
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:53,280
a very difficult thing for those that

914
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:54,060
are the non cannabis touching part of

915
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,360
this equation

916
00:40:54,059 --> 00:40:59,460
you're really flipping the script which

917
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,440
is what I find to be most interesting if

918
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:04,920
I'm looking at it from a 50,000 foot

919
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,690
level most of the time the non cannabis

920
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,000
plant touching businesses are in the

921
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:11,849
driver's seat they have more flexibility

922
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,820
they have more maneuverability they have

923
00:41:11,849 --> 00:41:18,139
more impact on creating what that cost

924
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:21,150
is between the the discussion points

925
00:41:18,139 --> 00:41:23,190
right you're taking my brand my brand

926
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:25,559
has a name I'm taking the risk you're

927
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:28,650
producing for me when you flip that

928
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:31,199
around and say you the the licensee

929
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:33,450
can't act on your behalf that they can't

930
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:36,750
be given your specifications you're

931
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:40,649
gonna see a different discourse in

932
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:43,739
negotiations because now the licensees

933
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:45,539
are in the driver's seat to say well how

934
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:49,109
are we gonna put this together because

935
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:51,719
now I'm taking more of the risk my

936
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,390
license is on the line you were worried

937
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:54,278
about entering

938
00:41:52,389 --> 00:41:56,288
to cannabis I'm worried about your

939
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:58,079
entrance into cannabis affecting my

940
00:41:56,289 --> 00:42:00,299
license so you're going to see different

941
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,170
conversation starting to emerge

942
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:05,288
something I would like to remind people

943
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:07,269
of is that many of us that are newer

944
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:09,069
into the industry or but in it that this

945
00:42:07,268 --> 00:42:13,058
is an industry that was founded on

946
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:16,869
innovation and surviving and that we are

947
00:42:13,059 --> 00:42:19,150
here to to continue this and that if you

948
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:22,028
don't know what to do then ask for help

949
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:24,400
and if you know what to do give help

950
00:42:22,028 --> 00:42:30,818
join my facebook group California City

951
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:34,599
and County regulation watch high tide

952
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:37,239
raises all ships we all want to survive

953
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:40,450
this industry is big enough for

954
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:42,548
everybody it was a collective good to be

955
00:42:40,449 --> 00:42:45,308
here we stand on the shoulders of those

956
00:42:42,548 --> 00:42:47,259
that went to jail so that we can sit up

957
00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:48,490
here and talk about this for the people

958
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,769
that have died because they couldn't

959
00:42:48,489 --> 00:42:52,598
have access to it and are continuing to

960
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:54,788
die because they do not have access to

961
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:55,359
it so when you feel like you can't do it

962
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:58,509
anymore

963
00:42:55,358 --> 00:43:01,028
remember how blessed you are so the last

964
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:02,349
one we wanted to talk about front which

965
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:07,719
was a request from the audience's

966
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:09,910
testing and phase three it's still on it

967
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:12,909
goes into effect December 31st which is

968
00:43:09,909 --> 00:43:15,098
going to require detection of heavy

969
00:43:12,909 --> 00:43:17,500
metals they did push back on the

970
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:20,190
terpenes I would have preferred to have

971
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,960
terpenes instead of heavy metals but I

972
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:24,818
this is my most concerning issue it's

973
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:28,329
been my most concerning issues since I

974
00:43:24,818 --> 00:43:32,440
saw how severe the product shortage

975
00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:37,869
issue caused some like dispensary cells

976
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:42,009
to be dry after July 1st I am terrified

977
00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:45,759
of the the phase 3 heavy metals going

978
00:43:42,009 --> 00:43:48,250
into effect for multiple reasons but the

979
00:43:45,759 --> 00:43:50,858
first reason being that there are only I

980
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,778
I know of two licensed labs in the state

981
00:43:50,858 --> 00:43:56,500
that are conducting Rd for Phase three

982
00:43:52,778 --> 00:43:59,858
right now and we need way more than that

983
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:03,250
to you know just get the process going

984
00:43:59,858 --> 00:44:04,230
but it's concerning that we we don't

985
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:09,809
know what's going to fail

986
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:12,449
right now if you're growing indoors and

987
00:44:09,809 --> 00:44:14,400
that wood that is on the floor is

988
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:17,789
treated with a chemical that chemical

989
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,369
could be causing your product to test

990
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:26,849
positive for heavy metals or your vapor

991
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:28,559
pens glass jars fail that are coming in

992
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:30,510
from China the product is not failing

993
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:33,599
but the glass jars are seeping into the

994
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:36,050
product in that case though now that's

995
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:38,730
not causing shears that's down the road

996
00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:41,039
failing if you're sourcing products that

997
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:43,710
have heavy metals in them even though

998
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:45,509
your product does not you are failing as

999
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:47,338
somebody who's fighting for consumer

1000
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:48,900
right so you should know your ship and

1001
00:44:47,338 --> 00:44:50,849
the hard part about this one is that

1002
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,260
this isn't a part of the public comment

1003
00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:54,359
process right now so this isn't

1004
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,550
something that we can submit to the

1005
00:44:54,358 --> 00:45:00,088
state and ask them to fix this is

1006
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:03,060
something that is a date that they chose

1007
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:06,449
to implement these new guidelines and so

1008
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:08,039
it may take a legislative fix but we

1009
00:45:06,449 --> 00:45:09,899
have to wait for a new governor to come

1010
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:11,690
in and we have to wait for a new session

1011
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,760
to start and that will be after the fact

1012
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:21,150
so this one is definitely the one that's

1013
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:24,660
gonna continue to keep me up at night we

1014
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:26,430
want to take some questions we do hello

1015
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:30,299
nice work up there my name is Adam from

1016
00:45:26,429 --> 00:45:32,669
Kiva I another question about testing

1017
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:35,280
the my request from the audience to talk

1018
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:36,838
about testing was part of the comment

1019
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,700
period something that came through that

1020
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:43,549
we noticed that affects us quite a bit

1021
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:47,460
is a plus or minus 10% THC and CBD

1022
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:48,930
variance but in this round they they put

1023
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,059
something else in there that said that

1024
00:45:48,929 --> 00:45:52,919
no way no how can anything be over a

1025
00:45:51,059 --> 00:45:55,078
hundred milligrams and it was curious if

1026
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:57,210
you guys know did you guys read that in

1027
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:59,970
the same way and do you guys have any

1028
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:01,260
idea why they would have put that in

1029
00:45:59,969 --> 00:46:04,379
because that'll cause most brands

1030
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:06,810
particularly edibles to so reformulate

1031
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:09,470
down to plus or minus 10% unless it's

1032
00:46:06,809 --> 00:46:09,469
plus

1033
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:15,710
that's ridiculous I to me that was them

1034
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:17,420
trying to do another point of

1035
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,338
clarification you were never supposed to

1036
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:26,210
have anything over a hundred milligrams

1037
00:46:19,338 --> 00:46:29,029
but every minus 10% I've seen it's not

1038
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:33,858
confused thing though because botanical

1039
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:36,769
medicine is regularly plus or minus 15%

1040
00:46:33,858 --> 00:46:39,289
right and let me remind you that we are

1041
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:43,670
a botanical medicine and that the only

1042
00:46:39,289 --> 00:46:45,949
way to dial in plus or minus 10% when

1043
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:47,420
you're dealing with 2.5% milligrams is

1044
00:46:45,949 --> 00:46:50,179
when you're dealing with isolates and

1045
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:52,250
isolates are truly just that they are

1046
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:54,289
isolating one chemical out of the

1047
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:55,909
hundreds if not thousands because we do

1048
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:57,858
not have the research yet that the

1049
00:46:55,909 --> 00:46:59,838
cannabis plant produces it helps to

1050
00:46:57,858 --> 00:47:01,699
regulate your endocannabinoids system so

1051
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:04,369
I think that's a wonderful thing that we

1052
00:47:01,699 --> 00:47:05,809
do it section that is a deal with I goes

1053
00:47:04,369 --> 00:47:07,309
back to your point of technically

1054
00:47:05,809 --> 00:47:09,049
writing something that they do not

1055
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:10,849
understand because I don't think it's

1056
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:13,010
confusing for us I think it was very

1057
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:16,849
confusing for the agency to interpret

1058
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:18,740
their mandate of where those criteria

1059
00:47:16,849 --> 00:47:20,359
and limits existed and I think we're

1060
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:23,059
seeing the reverberation of them

1061
00:47:20,358 --> 00:47:25,460
attempting to understand an area where

1062
00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:28,759
they are not scientists but are yet

1063
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:31,519
putting a scientific impact there so in

1064
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:33,950
order to comment on it talking somebody

1065
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:39,050
like Brad clearly understands what that

1066
00:47:33,949 --> 00:47:40,879
is and but like putting that data in so

1067
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:43,609
that they can make a better decision

1068
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:46,450
based on the information because what

1069
00:47:43,608 --> 00:47:48,769
they don't know they're gonna regulate

1070
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:50,419
they're gonna regulate in a vacuum and I

1071
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:55,579
think that's what really happened with

1072
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:56,809
that section in a and another way is I

1073
00:47:55,579 --> 00:47:59,030
feel like what we're dealing here is a

1074
00:47:56,809 --> 00:48:01,159
symptom of a bigger problem here is that

1075
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:04,400
we are not having community subject

1076
00:48:01,159 --> 00:48:07,489
matter experts recommending legislation

1077
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:10,430
and people that are not being paid for

1078
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:11,929
by cannabis committees themselves so we

1079
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:13,909
have our own lobbyists but the other

1080
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:16,940
lobbyists there we need to have legit

1081
00:48:13,909 --> 00:48:19,730
concerned citizens who have no stake and

1082
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:22,798
the plus or minus of whoever's industry

1083
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:24,329
just giving the honest feedback of

1084
00:48:22,798 --> 00:48:26,400
what they need and I feel like this is

1085
00:48:24,329 --> 00:48:29,369
situation here where they they're making

1086
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:35,219
regulations they don't we have the next

1087
00:48:29,369 --> 00:48:36,809
question from a brand IP owner hi there

1088
00:48:35,219 --> 00:48:38,068
I think thanks Peter for hosting thank

1089
00:48:36,809 --> 00:48:40,400
you all for spending your time with us

1090
00:48:38,068 --> 00:48:43,380
tonight this is a question regarding

1091
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,959
white label and you obviously gave a

1092
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:48,479
nice overview but it's a little bit more

1093
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:51,328
specific I'm the owner of a Kenneth's

1094
00:48:48,478 --> 00:48:53,728
brand that is working to be in market I

1095
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:56,400
have two partners want to manufacture

1096
00:48:53,728 --> 00:48:58,828
with a license one a distributor with a

1097
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:01,739
license we do not have a license so

1098
00:48:58,829 --> 00:49:05,309
based on kind of what you read on 503 2

1099
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:07,139
in that new language there's kind of

1100
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:08,789
concern on and we're not planning on

1101
00:49:07,139 --> 00:49:11,308
touching plant or anything but what

1102
00:49:08,789 --> 00:49:12,778
would be your advice on kind of moving

1103
00:49:11,309 --> 00:49:15,509
through these new regulations we've

1104
00:49:12,778 --> 00:49:18,298
heard I have had received already some

1105
00:49:15,509 --> 00:49:20,009
feedback on it but again I think as you

1106
00:49:18,298 --> 00:49:21,599
said it's people are still discussing it

1107
00:49:20,009 --> 00:49:26,099
I don't know if you had any specific

1108
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:29,309
feedback for people in that arena so

1109
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:31,199
just so I can clarify on your sensor you

1110
00:49:29,309 --> 00:49:33,420
said you have two partners one has a

1111
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:35,670
manufacturing license one has a

1112
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:39,838
distribution license correct okay you're

1113
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:40,889
not license holders what do you sound z'

1114
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:42,958
like when you say talking about

1115
00:49:40,889 --> 00:49:44,969
partnerships here is that we have a

1116
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:47,879
manufacturing license in we have a

1117
00:49:44,969 --> 00:49:50,969
distribution license or is it I don't

1118
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,349
have that and they do I don't and that's

1119
00:49:50,969 --> 00:49:53,969
where the clarity needs to happen it's

1120
00:49:52,349 --> 00:49:55,528
what the state is asking from my

1121
00:49:53,969 --> 00:49:57,509
understanding is that they're asking

1122
00:49:55,528 --> 00:49:58,949
that if you're gonna state we have a

1123
00:49:57,509 --> 00:50:01,829
manufacturing again we have a

1124
00:49:58,949 --> 00:50:03,150
distribution license then we are on a

1125
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:04,798
contract together and all they're asking

1126
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:06,959
for is a contract here to understand

1127
00:50:04,798 --> 00:50:09,599
where funds are going and if you're

1128
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:11,399
doing this to get out of paying the tax

1129
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,410
situation we all understand it but

1130
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,778
that's the pay-to-play portion here is

1131
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:18,208
what they're asking for and so in my

1132
00:50:15,778 --> 00:50:24,420
opinion from my understanding of not

1133
00:50:18,208 --> 00:50:25,798
sleeping for the past week implying now

1134
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:27,869
I'd have to understand more of the

1135
00:50:25,798 --> 00:50:32,509
dynamics of what you're doing and how

1136
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:35,278
exactly you're interfacing with that

1137
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:36,599
manufacturer and that distributor right

1138
00:50:35,278 --> 00:50:38,460
what here

1139
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:40,679
what are you actually telling them what

1140
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:42,990
money is coming to you what how are

1141
00:50:40,679 --> 00:50:45,599
those interplay and how are you

1142
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:47,699
interplaying in all of those sectors

1143
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,460
what are the Venn diagram right where do

1144
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:52,250
you overlap and control and management

1145
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:56,610
and dictation and again that word

1146
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:59,369
specification how how entrenched are you

1147
00:50:56,610 --> 00:51:01,260
right and so those are those are the

1148
00:50:59,369 --> 00:51:03,539
devil in the details and I will tell you

1149
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:10,610
that none of us up here can give you a

1150
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:13,529
blanket answer don't you we have partner

1151
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:15,360
working with other people one of them

1152
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:18,030
has a manufacturing license another one

1153
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:20,519
has a distribution we my brand does not

1154
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:23,400
and not because of not wanting to I'm

1155
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:25,259
happy to know anything I'm happy to we

1156
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:28,110
want to be regulated we want to pay

1157
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:30,840
taxes we want it set up correctly but

1158
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:32,550
there's just a lot of unclarity on we

1159
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:35,100
thought we were I thought I was clear

1160
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:37,410
right up until you're exchanging money

1161
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:39,509
between these three entities for

1162
00:51:37,409 --> 00:51:42,059
yourself and your manufacturer on your

1163
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:47,190
distributor and how much control do you

1164
00:51:42,059 --> 00:51:48,869
have over your brand that's gonna be

1165
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:51,480
your that's gonna be your concern point

1166
00:51:48,869 --> 00:51:54,750
right if you are the vehicle where you

1167
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:57,300
are saying manufacturer acts use this

1168
00:51:54,750 --> 00:52:00,599
hardware you this specification use

1169
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:02,760
these formulas do it this way this is my

1170
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:05,339
brand I all the way down to the font on

1171
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:08,670
the box of how you're gonna do this this

1172
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:12,720
is where the BCC is exerting concern at

1173
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:15,930
what point are you then functioning in

1174
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:18,869
the shoes of that licensee and so how

1175
00:52:15,929 --> 00:52:21,089
you articulate those terms in a contract

1176
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:23,670
that's where you're gonna start to see

1177
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:25,650
this engineer creativity innovation

1178
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:28,470
that's what this situation may

1179
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:31,470
ultimately demand I am very hopeful that

1180
00:52:28,469 --> 00:52:33,539
we see guidance on this because of the

1181
00:52:31,469 --> 00:52:36,750
reaction at NCI a where they were so

1182
00:52:33,539 --> 00:52:39,570
surprised it seemed like the industry

1183
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:41,730
was having an out crying and maybe not

1184
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:44,340
totally understanding where the

1185
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:46,980
regulator's were so I am hopeful that we

1186
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:47,650
will see something come out that we can

1187
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,059
comment

1188
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:50,469
well I think that they realize this is

1189
00:52:49,059 --> 00:52:52,210
an area where we do have legal

1190
00:52:50,469 --> 00:52:59,229
representation and obviously this has

1191
00:52:52,210 --> 00:53:00,579
never come up prior well I realize that

1192
00:52:59,228 --> 00:53:02,588
this is an area where we're hemorrhaging

1193
00:53:00,579 --> 00:53:04,869
money there's no tax documents that are

1194
00:53:02,588 --> 00:53:07,268
showing where money that is being paid

1195
00:53:04,869 --> 00:53:10,539
to you or vice versa is going so it's

1196
00:53:07,268 --> 00:53:12,818
ending into this abyss of taxes money is

1197
00:53:10,539 --> 00:53:15,729
missing here and they need to know where

1198
00:53:12,818 --> 00:53:17,679
the money is going and again like

1199
00:53:15,728 --> 00:53:23,468
consult with your attorney don't

1200
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:24,818
necessarily take this advice to know but

1201
00:53:23,469 --> 00:53:26,920
if you've already worked out the

1202
00:53:24,818 --> 00:53:28,838
monetary agreements between your

1203
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,940
manufacturer and your distributor and

1204
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:32,679
you've been doing this then what would

1205
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:37,559
prevent you from being an employee of

1206
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:37,558
those two companies so that you could

1207
00:53:37,768 --> 00:53:43,058
it's the brand it's how you what I'm

1208
00:53:41,409 --> 00:53:45,038
saying like if doing that would be the

1209
00:53:43,059 --> 00:53:47,528
simplest way right now without any

1210
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:49,539
waiting on a regulatory solution not if

1211
00:53:47,528 --> 00:54:02,440
he's still being paid he may be an

1212
00:53:49,539 --> 00:54:06,339
employee so that he can go in there to

1213
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:10,450
that extent let's say his brand brings

1214
00:54:06,338 --> 00:54:14,078
in 15% of the sales of that distributor

1215
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:20,498
of that of that manufacturer what's to

1216
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:23,739
stop his company his brand being a 15%

1217
00:54:20,498 --> 00:54:27,129
stake holder in that company variable

1218
00:54:23,739 --> 00:54:29,650
only to the sales associated with that

1219
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:31,269
brand and I've said and then and

1220
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:33,700
distributors don't like that response

1221
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:35,768
they don't know most most companies

1222
00:54:33,699 --> 00:54:38,139
don't like that response they don't want

1223
00:54:35,768 --> 00:54:40,718
to be forced to take on an equity owner

1224
00:54:38,139 --> 00:54:48,788
even though you know they're not they're

1225
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:51,809
not forced they have an option you don't

1226
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:54,130
have to sign over you don't have to do

1227
00:54:51,809 --> 00:54:56,528
anything this is where I worry that big

1228
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:59,829
companies that are big manufacturers and

1229
00:54:56,528 --> 00:55:01,210
distributors may have lobby behind some

1230
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:02,920
of this legislation right now

1231
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:04,389
we're still all very much of digesting

1232
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,740
this and we could totally be wrong about

1233
00:55:04,389 --> 00:55:07,089
so many of these things because it's

1234
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:08,949
been a minute I mean this is this is a

1235
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:10,510
structure they exist in lots of places

1236
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:12,730
film production companies that have

1237
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:16,450
directors that are DGA and I come from a

1238
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:18,849
background of that they have a portion

1239
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:21,250
of that company that is variable to the

1240
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:24,549
money that they bring into that company

1241
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:27,599
so they don't get 15 percent from total

1242
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:30,670
gross sales they get 15 percent of the

1243
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:32,619
what that brand brings in as a

1244
00:55:30,670 --> 00:55:35,950
proportion of ownership to that company

1245
00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:37,329
because it's less than 20 percent I

1246
00:55:35,949 --> 00:55:40,089
don't even think you might file

1247
00:55:37,329 --> 00:55:42,400
financials with the BCC or the city of

1248
00:55:40,090 --> 00:55:44,470
Los Angeles it's less than 20 percent

1249
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,210
that's your trigger that was your old

1250
00:55:44,469 --> 00:55:49,539
trigger for ownership but if we want to

1251
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:52,599
look at ownership in 5003 and financial

1252
00:55:49,539 --> 00:55:56,110
interest in 5004 as it stands currently

1253
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:58,750
in the in the presented redrafted

1254
00:55:56,110 --> 00:56:01,360
permanent regulations if he if that

1255
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:03,460
brand even if they're only taking 15% of

1256
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:06,220
the variable if they are then giving the

1257
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:09,039
specifications for how that product is

1258
00:56:06,219 --> 00:56:10,629
being made or branding and they're in

1259
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:12,340
giving branding direction even non

1260
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:13,630
cannabis branding direction we can look

1261
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:15,789
at the definition of the owner I can

1262
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:18,220
read it verbatim you're you're an owner

1263
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:22,239
don't matter if you have 20% or more you

1264
00:56:18,219 --> 00:56:23,469
are but as a less than 20% owner you

1265
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:25,889
don't even have to file for that's not

1266
00:56:23,469 --> 00:56:28,419
true it just changed it just changed

1267
00:56:25,889 --> 00:56:31,269
you're an owner the same as you would be

1268
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:33,550
it's a 20% if you are it's easier let's

1269
00:56:31,269 --> 00:56:36,789
read it

1270
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:38,680
because it used to be 20% you know it

1271
00:56:36,789 --> 00:56:42,340
you're now an owner if you are

1272
00:56:38,679 --> 00:56:44,379
controlling a brand if you are making

1273
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:47,320
executive decisions if you are

1274
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:50,110
negotiating the wholesale price of you

1275
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:52,930
know cannabis in some way but Pamela's

1276
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:55,870
gonna read the exact language basically

1277
00:56:52,929 --> 00:56:58,539
what they're doing is in and we want RIT

1278
00:56:55,869 --> 00:57:00,219
cause right oh ma Colorado is they're

1279
00:56:58,539 --> 00:57:02,139
gonna continue digging until they find

1280
00:57:00,219 --> 00:57:05,259
where is the money where is the money

1281
00:57:02,139 --> 00:57:07,449
going who are the owners okay I think

1282
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,530
that we think the state's actually a

1283
00:57:07,449 --> 00:57:10,779
little bit smarter than we gave them

1284
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:12,820
credit for and saw all these shell

1285
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:13,490
companies and Oh we'll just form a

1286
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:15,500
management come

1287
00:57:13,489 --> 00:57:17,299
well they want to know who the owners

1288
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,710
are in that management company now yeah

1289
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:22,090
yeah and they want to know everyone

1290
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:22,090
that's making an executive decision

1291
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:34,039
so here's nothing to do with percentages

1292
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:37,099
I know the idea that ownership is tied

1293
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:42,409
to the percentage of an owned company

1294
00:57:37,099 --> 00:57:47,150
now it's not that it thank you Peter

1295
00:57:42,409 --> 00:57:49,339
even sick it's not that they got I mean

1296
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:51,309
they did get smarter part of your annual

1297
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:53,600
application submission package is

1298
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:55,340
providing your operating agreements so

1299
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:58,210
if you are wholly owned by another

1300
00:57:55,340 --> 00:58:00,890
company and the the bureau uses

1301
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:03,590
multilayered company that's the language

1302
00:58:00,889 --> 00:58:06,650
they use they saw that you may have said

1303
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:09,200
that the lower entity was a manager but

1304
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:10,940
if you're a hundred percent owned then

1305
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:13,669
all those people have ownership in your

1306
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:17,119

1369
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:45,099
entities of persons holding financial

1370
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:47,659
interests until only individuals remain

1371
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:50,480
they want to know every one every about

1372
01:00:47,659 --> 01:00:53,179
every one yep and that was the

1373
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:55,579
definition of owner and then we also had

1374
01:00:53,179 --> 01:00:59,059
language change in the definition of

1375
01:00:55,579 --> 01:01:02,869
financial interest this part this part

1376
01:00:59,059 --> 01:01:04,880
actually kind of makes me smile no no

1377
01:01:02,869 --> 01:01:06,470
the financially this part makes me smile

1378
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,180
because I've witnessed a lot of

1379
01:01:06,469 --> 01:01:11,358
landlords really taking advantage of the

1380
01:01:08,179 --> 01:01:13,460
cannabis industry so the euro would like

1381
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:14,838
to know now if a landlord has entered

1382
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:16,608
into a lease agreement with a commercial

1383
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:19,338
cannabis business for a share of the

1384
01:01:16,608 --> 01:01:21,909
profits now mind you it says to receive

1385
01:01:19,338 --> 01:01:24,409
a portion of the profits but also but

1386
01:01:21,909 --> 01:01:26,059
includes B'nai it is limited to the

1387
01:01:24,409 --> 01:01:27,739
following meeting if you thought you

1388
01:01:26,059 --> 01:01:30,170
could get out of profits and only have

1389
01:01:27,739 --> 01:01:32,239
gross revenue because most cannabis

1390
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:34,820
businesses don't have profits with 280e

1391
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:36,919
when you get to the including but not

1392
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:38,490
limited to language they'll get there

1393
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:40,740
that's not going

1394
01:01:38,489 --> 01:01:43,409
we hide the bomber so then financial

1395
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:45,599
interest language in five zero zero four

1396
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:47,190
also they would like to know who if an

1397
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,900
employee is receiving profit-sharing

1398
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:50,639
they want to know if the consultant is

1399
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:54,150
receiving profit sharing they want to

1400
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:56,868
know if your attorney your CPA anyone in

1401
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:59,910
the cannabis business but also really

1402
01:01:56,869 --> 01:02:02,280
there's been such you know noise about

1403
01:01:59,909 --> 01:02:04,139
the white labeling thing that I think

1404
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:06,080
that I don't even think that brokers

1405
01:02:04,139 --> 01:02:09,029
realize that they got swept up in this

1406
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:11,400
and that is also under the new

1407
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:15,580
disclosure for financial interests is a

1408
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:17,690
salesperson who earns a commission so

1409
01:02:15,579 --> 01:02:19,380
[Laughter]

1410
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:29,670

1414
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:38,099
of an odd question but in the spirit of

1415
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:41,130
being disruptive you know some some

1416
01:02:38,099 --> 01:02:43,049
people have suggested to me that it may

1417
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:45,300
be possible for non licensed cannabis

1418
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:54,240

1426

license to entity like a company say a

1427
01:03:11,608 --> 01:03:15,929
marketing company that was trying to get

1428
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:18,570
around regulations to get consumer

1429
01:03:15,929 --> 01:03:20,669
cannabis products to consumers and try

1430
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:22,080
to give to them what is it so are you

1431
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:29,070

1436
01:03:43,889 --> 01:03:48,000
before you can walk walk before you can

1437
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:51,320
run learn how to run before you run a

1438
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,349
marathon this is really where where I am

1439
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:58,010
fortunately in disruption works good and

1440
01:03:54,349 --> 01:04:01,039
bad both ways we've had this events

1441
01:03:58,010 --> 01:04:04,970
pop-up culture that has occurred where

1442
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:07,009
if it's on none if it's on private land

1443
01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:09,079
all the sudden because metrics not there

1444
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:10,610
vendors are showing up manufacturers are

1445
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:13,460
showing up with product that's never

1446
01:04:10,610 --> 01:04:15,710
gone through a distributor or a retailer

1447
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:20,659
and it's getting to consumers because I

1448
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:25,190
you know it's not a licensed event no

1449
01:04:20,659 --> 01:04:27,139
they if you are a individual and you go

1450
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:29,750
into a dispensary and buy your allotted

1451
01:04:27,139 --> 01:04:33,589
amount and then you want to go and give

1452
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:36,710
it away to any you know over 21 year old

1453
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:39,260
not on Yosemite federal lam but square

1454
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:41,420
in the rights of California you go right

1455
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:44,660
ahead and do that if you start then

1456
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:47,059
advancing that you are marketing this

1457
01:04:44,659 --> 01:04:49,429
material and you're giving it away and a

1458
01:04:47,059 --> 01:04:51,619
consumer cuz remember I think it's

1459
01:04:49,429 --> 01:04:53,839
important that we discuss where is who

1460
01:04:51,619 --> 01:04:55,849
is the BCC housed under the Bureau of

1461
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:58,670
cannabis control does not exist as an

1462
01:04:55,849 --> 01:05:01,549
entity onto itself as a state agency it

1463
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:03,440
is housed under another state agency and

1464
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:05,930
that is the Department of Consumer

1465
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:09,050
Affairs the Department of Consumer

1466
01:05:05,929 --> 01:05:12,289
Affairs mission is to protect the

1467
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:14,510
citizens of California from fraud from

1468
01:05:12,289 --> 01:05:17,210
misleading marketing and advertising

1469
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:18,800
material so if you are trying to advance

1470
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:20,869
something that could be consistent

1471
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:23,990
construed by consumer that it's coming

1472
01:05:20,869 --> 01:05:26,659
from you and you're advancing that and

1473
01:05:23,989 --> 01:05:28,939
not from the licensee that's what

1474
01:05:26,659 --> 01:05:30,769
they're there to prevent and to protect

1475
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:33,440
and it's important to understand that

1476
01:05:30,769 --> 01:05:36,590
that's the lens that's coloring a lot of

1477
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:39,110
this regulation and if you start to

1478
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:42,110
confuse the consumer we saw it with the

1479
01:05:39,110 --> 01:05:43,910
alcohol in cannabis we're seeing it with

1480
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:46,070
the tech platforms that are out there

1481
01:05:43,909 --> 01:05:48,199
saying I'm gonna deliver you the product

1482
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:51,559
I don't have to say the name but if you

1483
01:05:48,199 --> 01:05:53,119
were to ask away in the general ordinary

1484
01:05:51,559 --> 01:05:56,719
course outside of people that know

1485
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:58,309
cannabis if X delivery service brings

1486
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:00,109
you their cannabis and it's their

1487
01:05:58,309 --> 01:06:03,389
cannabis that they're bringing you I

1488
01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:05,130
would argue that four times out of five

1489
01:06:03,389 --> 01:06:07,618
they're gonna say that that company that

1490
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:10,170
brought it to me that's their cannabis

1491
01:06:07,619 --> 01:06:15,630
and that is the exact scenario that is

1492
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:23,068
concerning to the BCC awesome thank you

1493
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:26,430
yeah I think we have one more question I

1494
01:06:23,068 --> 01:06:28,108
have a follow-up question to the gifting

1495
01:06:26,429 --> 01:06:35,960
and free and we shouldn't use those

1496
01:06:28,108 --> 01:06:39,568
words ERP but the question is around

1497
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:42,960
free and it is a bit of a limitation

1498
01:06:39,568 --> 01:06:47,099
when manufacturers brands distributors

1499
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:49,079
can't somehow give product to a business

1500
01:06:47,099 --> 01:06:52,410
partner and I'm curious what you guys

1501
01:06:49,079 --> 01:06:54,660
think the solve there could be and when

1502
01:06:52,409 --> 01:06:56,639
I say business partner I mean if you

1503
01:06:54,659 --> 01:06:59,578
launch a new item and a buyer at a

1504
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:02,338
dispensary wants to try it before they

1505
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:04,500
decide to shelve it or the press wants

1506
01:07:02,338 --> 01:07:07,380
to write an article about the new

1507
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:09,179
product but you can't give it to them or

1508
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:11,068
an influencer wants to write a review

1509
01:07:09,179 --> 01:07:13,139
but they want to try the product before

1510
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:14,548
those are all limitations and I would

1511
01:07:13,139 --> 01:07:16,230
call those business partners and I'm

1512
01:07:14,548 --> 01:07:21,298
curious what you guys think we could do

1513
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:23,338
- it breaks my little heart that we all

1514
01:07:21,298 --> 01:07:26,278
submitted so many comments about the

1515
01:07:23,338 --> 01:07:30,420
sampling issue and it just fell a little

1516
01:07:26,278 --> 01:07:32,969
bit on deaf ears at the BCC I will admit

1517
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:35,190
that I when I first saw the sampling

1518
01:07:32,969 --> 01:07:38,368
forms was super pumped and thought that

1519
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:42,690
they were sampling forms for how you do

1520
01:07:38,369 --> 01:07:44,730
a sample they are not I will I killed my

1521
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:47,369
own dream when I looked they were

1522
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:52,548
actually for how to take a batch sample

1523
01:07:47,369 --> 01:07:54,930
and I was like Oh BCC that hurts but

1524
01:07:52,548 --> 01:08:00,298
that's the issue and there are some

1525
01:07:54,929 --> 01:08:02,608
interesting workarounds to that are any

1526
01:08:00,298 --> 01:08:05,219
of them a hundred and ten percent fully

1527
01:08:02,608 --> 01:08:08,730
compliant I think that's that's the

1528
01:08:05,219 --> 01:08:10,980
question CD TFA says if you reduce to

1529
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:13,409
them below the 50 percent there's a

1530
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:16,260
whole different tax regime that takes

1531
01:08:13,409 --> 01:08:18,569
place do you do a heavily

1532
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:21,119
discounted box to a dispensary that's

1533
01:08:18,569 --> 01:08:23,189
trial that then you send the influencers

1534
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:25,859
to that dispensary they get it for a

1535
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:28,979
significantly discounted rate the excise

1536
01:08:25,859 --> 01:08:30,809
tax is paid there is a way mechanism

1537
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:32,939
potentially to do something not for

1538
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:35,280
resale and it has a different price but

1539
01:08:32,939 --> 01:08:38,069
it still is gonna have to go through all

1540
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:40,380
of those channels to be able to the

1541
01:08:38,069 --> 01:08:44,099
point of retail and then be able to do

1542
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:45,510
that if that is truly if you're gonna if

1543
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:47,940
you're gonna try to chart the most

1544
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:50,430
compliant way to get there it's gonna be

1545
01:08:47,939 --> 01:08:51,719
one of those really intricate ways and

1546
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:55,039
it's never gonna be that the

1547
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:58,890
manufacturer straight direct gives it to

1548
01:08:55,039 --> 01:09:04,260
any individual other than a distributor

1549
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:09,170
so let's say hypothetically Laurie Ajax

1550
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:14,010
actually washes this video hi Laurie

1551
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:16,350
so since Pam is a lawyer and maybe

1552
01:09:14,010 --> 01:09:22,050
cannot comment on this I'm gonna Brett

1553
01:09:16,350 --> 01:09:24,660
is very free with his Burbidge so from

1554
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:28,619
somebody who has been on the retail side

1555
01:09:24,659 --> 01:09:30,659
and on the brand side what language do

1556
01:09:28,619 --> 01:09:33,479
you think we could like what would you

1557
01:09:30,659 --> 01:09:35,789
propose to the BCC as language that

1558
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:38,399
would allow sort like okay we get you

1559
01:09:35,789 --> 01:09:41,460
don't want us to give consumers free

1560
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:47,009
samples but in the course of business of

1561
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:50,520
letting a prospective dispensary try our

1562
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:52,920
product and decide that they like it is

1563
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:56,190
that complicated and my personal opinion

1564
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:59,579
in that if distributors are able to

1565
01:09:56,189 --> 01:10:02,429
provide product to us and that we still

1566
01:09:59,579 --> 01:10:04,350
remain in under 3% variance of our

1567
01:10:02,430 --> 01:10:06,360
inventory loss that we are able to

1568
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:09,090
provide out for that they're able to

1569
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:11,009
give to us and it's part of like our 3%

1570
01:10:09,090 --> 01:10:12,659
so obviously we're not using this as

1571
01:10:11,010 --> 01:10:15,810
sampling because three percents not

1572
01:10:12,659 --> 01:10:17,789
gonna example people there and I think

1573
01:10:15,810 --> 01:10:19,530
as long as we stay with this 3% variance

1574
01:10:17,789 --> 01:10:22,619
here at adjuster writer as long as is

1575
01:10:19,529 --> 01:10:24,359
like the just you know the distributor's

1576
01:10:22,619 --> 01:10:26,460
are able to provide us with samples here

1577
01:10:24,359 --> 01:10:28,199
but also at the end of the day like if

1578
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:28,890
I'm wanting to build something new for

1579
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:30,960
my store

1580
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:32,820
wanting to invest in my store the key

1581
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:35,579
word there is invest so if I need to

1582
01:10:32,819 --> 01:10:38,130
really take my time and realize that you

1583
01:10:35,579 --> 01:10:40,590
know what this is a product that I want

1584
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:41,940
to have in my store and that I have to

1585
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:43,289
buy it and I'm sorry it just says the

1586
01:10:41,939 --> 01:10:44,669
sample why is there if that's what we

1587
01:10:43,289 --> 01:10:46,319
have to currently do right now I would

1588
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:47,670
recommend and my personal opinion

1589
01:10:46,319 --> 01:10:50,069
staying on the conservative side of

1590
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:53,850
things because they can go back for

1591
01:10:50,069 --> 01:10:58,829
seven years and so you may hear in six

1592
01:10:53,850 --> 01:11:00,450
years and 350 days mess up on something

1593
01:10:58,829 --> 01:11:02,789
and they can go back and do a full audit

1594
01:11:00,449 --> 01:11:05,579
of you and stuff that we were all under

1595
01:11:02,789 --> 01:11:08,189
this ambiguous cannabis regulation time

1596
01:11:05,579 --> 01:11:10,619
that they can be like pad the shit out

1597
01:11:08,189 --> 01:11:13,799
of it and if you're missing one document

1598
01:11:10,619 --> 01:11:17,489
that they're looking for that's $30,000

1599
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:19,050
I give you a big benefit it's - it's

1600
01:11:17,489 --> 01:11:21,090
seven years record retention that's five

1601
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:24,090
years that they can enforce you so you

1602
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:27,600
get - but what I like to tell people is

1603
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:30,539
the BCC DPH and DFA are not going to

1604
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:33,810
lose their allotted employment budget

1605
01:11:30,539 --> 01:11:36,090
right because they're like hiring like

1606
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:37,410
it's going out of style they're not

1607
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:38,760
gonna want to lose that budget they're

1608
01:11:37,409 --> 01:11:40,109
not gonna want to lose those employees

1609
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:42,690
know what's gonna happen and in about

1610
01:11:40,109 --> 01:11:45,839
three and a half four years when this is

1611
01:11:42,689 --> 01:11:47,819
what the dust has settled audits and

1612
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,199
they were gonna say I don't have to

1613
01:11:47,819 --> 01:11:51,269
license anybody today you know what I'm

1614
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:53,939
gonna do I'm gonna pick out of the pool

1615
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:56,160
of people that I have just gonna pluck

1616
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:58,619
it out and I'm gonna say show me

1617
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:59,279
everything and if I see something I

1618
01:11:58,619 --> 01:12:01,079
don't like

1619
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:03,149
I'll guess what I'm gonna get a gold

1620
01:12:01,079 --> 01:12:05,579
star I've done something today

1621
01:12:03,149 --> 01:12:08,069
I've audited and made this department

1622
01:12:05,579 --> 01:12:11,279
money and I think that's what we do not

1623
01:12:08,069 --> 01:12:13,889
think that what you do today does not

1624
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:16,409
have impact on your business and your

1625
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:18,420
business's livelihood in the future I

1626
01:12:16,409 --> 01:12:22,409
don't mean to come across sounding like

1627
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:24,690
my mother but it is very true and I

1628
01:12:22,409 --> 01:12:27,210
cannot say it enough in an error of

1629
01:12:24,689 --> 01:12:29,429
ambiguity and an error of well if my

1630
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:31,890
neighbors doing it I should be able to

1631
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:35,789
do it I'm not as being as egregious as

1632
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:37,170
they are life is not fair and those that

1633
01:12:35,789 --> 01:12:40,109
deserve to be punished

1634
01:12:37,170 --> 01:12:42,658
rarely often are and those that tried

1635
01:12:40,109 --> 01:12:44,698
their best but faltered and

1636
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:46,948
that nobody was gonna pay attention to

1637
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:50,339
them are the ones that are gonna be made

1638
01:12:46,948 --> 01:12:53,299
the example of so I implore you to treat

1639
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:56,400
your business today as if they are

1640
01:12:53,300 --> 01:13:00,119
scrutinizing you and you have to meet

1641
01:12:56,399 --> 01:13:02,339
the letter of the law it is just going

1642
01:13:00,118 --> 01:13:05,429
to be it's going to be an extinction

1643
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:08,279
event in five years at the same level as

1644
01:13:05,429 --> 01:13:10,109
it is today and the new players are

1645
01:13:08,279 --> 01:13:12,630
going to benefit because they don't know

1646
01:13:10,109 --> 01:13:17,458
any other way to operate and that is an

1647
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:20,998
unfortunate legacy operator issue and I

1648
01:13:17,458 --> 01:13:23,328
get it I get it it's hard to pivot it's

1649
01:13:20,998 --> 01:13:26,099
hard to see your bottom line numbers

1650
01:13:23,328 --> 01:13:30,569
bottom out and you're hemorrhaging money

1651
01:13:26,099 --> 01:13:33,300
on compliance it's not easy but with

1652
01:13:30,569 --> 01:13:36,029
that if you look at the regs and you use

1653
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:39,139
your creativity and if we all can

1654
01:13:36,029 --> 01:13:42,418
collaborate together really I do believe

1655
01:13:39,139 --> 01:13:44,849
the industry will survive and we can

1656
01:13:42,418 --> 01:13:47,099
help each other and really I mean you

1657
01:13:44,849 --> 01:13:52,769
can give samples away you just you owe

1658
01:13:47,099 --> 01:14:01,288
the tax liabilities on that product so

1659
01:13:52,769 --> 01:14:03,479
huh you're paying the excise taxes you

1660
01:14:01,288 --> 01:14:05,158
still can it's that act of giving away

1661
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:10,280
free product right a give away a

1662
01:14:05,158 --> 01:14:10,279
one-for-one if you're discounting it

1663
01:14:14,179 --> 01:14:20,158
we're doing it for a penny they're doing

1664
01:14:17,609 --> 01:14:22,438
it for a peppercorn look it's the law

1665
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:24,478
right payment if you see it if it goes

1666
01:14:22,439 --> 01:14:28,189
into metric me god put all this stuff in

1667
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:31,349
right like again the things you do today

1668
01:14:28,189 --> 01:14:33,780
have an impact so even if it's if it's

1669
01:14:31,349 --> 01:14:36,719
infant assimil if it's a five cents

1670
01:14:33,779 --> 01:14:38,788
right plus the full excise tax then

1671
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:41,969
you've charged something that isn't free

1672
01:14:38,788 --> 01:14:45,389
free means something free means there

1673
01:14:41,969 --> 01:14:47,908
was nothing of value exchange free means

1674
01:14:45,389 --> 01:14:54,779
that you didn't charge anything and a

1675
01:14:47,908 --> 01:14:56,219
penny is not free free is free and free

1676
01:14:54,779 --> 01:14:58,439
can be diversion

1677
01:14:56,220 --> 01:15:00,810
so that's probably why they're doing

1678
01:14:58,439 --> 01:15:03,809
away with that language but free

1679
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:05,130
giveaways are still happening the

1680
01:15:03,810 --> 01:15:11,880
companies are just responsible for the

1681
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:13,409
taxes on it right but every other supply

1682
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:15,659
chain actor shouldn't be giving away a

1683
01:15:13,409 --> 01:15:18,059
product they don't they don't go be to

1684
01:15:15,659 --> 01:15:20,399
anything they go B to B and buy B to B

1685
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:23,100
they mean licensee to licensee they

1686
01:15:20,399 --> 01:15:26,189
don't mean business to Google they mean

1687
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:28,850
business to cannabis business the only

1688
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:34,079
way you get B to C C includes customers

1689
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:35,520
influencers other entities retail and

1690
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:37,649
once we get track and trace up and

1691
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:39,150
running it will answer it to get a lot

1692
01:15:37,649 --> 01:15:40,889
of these questions because if somebody

1693
01:15:39,149 --> 01:15:44,909
has a product that was never tracked how

1694
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:46,740
the hell did it get there it'll be

1695
01:15:44,909 --> 01:15:49,079
sometime in January when the first

1696
01:15:46,739 --> 01:15:53,069
provisional zarur no they could be even

1697
01:15:49,079 --> 01:15:56,340
out six months or nine t I would say

1698
01:15:53,069 --> 01:15:57,779
within 90 days three months of the new

1699
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:59,400
year you're gonna really start to see

1700
01:15:57,779 --> 01:16:01,500
Provisionals and they're gonna come the

1701
01:15:59,399 --> 01:16:04,139
same way that the original temporaries

1702
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:06,989
came in batches right because they got

1703
01:16:04,140 --> 01:16:09,660
to get people go in so the first people

1704
01:16:06,989 --> 01:16:11,639
to get these extensions that expire

1705
01:16:09,659 --> 01:16:13,710
sometime in the new year

1706
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:15,810
that's gonna be your your pivot point

1707
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:22,020
once you start seeing your temporaries

1708
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:25,020
expire in 2019 let's talk about child

1709
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:31,800
resistant packaging which one July 1

1710
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:38,310
July 22 2008 when T 21 that on where did

1711
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:41,820
we settle shifting sands yeah I mean we

1712
01:16:38,310 --> 01:16:44,789
we wanted to go well some people wanted

1713
01:16:41,819 --> 01:16:47,399
to go and get away with the new way with

1714
01:16:44,789 --> 01:16:50,569
the exit bags and revert back to child

1715
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:53,009
resistant packaging at the product level

1716
01:16:50,569 --> 01:16:57,239
and I think that the state came up with

1717
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:59,730
a pretty good combination of the two and

1718
01:16:57,239 --> 01:17:02,159
they also gave us a grace period they're

1719
01:16:59,729 --> 01:17:04,529
giving us until 2020 to come into

1720
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:07,170
compliance with that so we shouldn't

1721
01:17:04,529 --> 01:17:08,578
have controlled resistant packaging on

1722
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:13,969
flour because

1723
01:17:08,578 --> 01:17:13,969
I can ingest flour and get high right so

1724
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:19,319
[Music]

1725
01:17:16,338 --> 01:17:22,588
buy flour the way you would buy any

1726
01:17:19,319 --> 01:17:25,469
edible or cultural product you go and

1727
01:17:22,588 --> 01:17:28,019
pick out apples they're not prepackaged

1728
01:17:25,469 --> 01:17:29,760
and child resistant you can see them if

1729
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:31,829
there's track and trace what is the

1730
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:34,168
difference of bringing in a pound of

1731
01:17:31,828 --> 01:17:35,849
cannabis measuring it out so people can

1732
01:17:34,168 --> 01:17:37,828
see it because there's usually quite a

1733
01:17:35,849 --> 01:17:41,279
bit of loss on that one she I mean I've

1734
01:17:37,828 --> 01:17:44,549
done both I've done where you're gonna

1735
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:45,688
have more than 3% loss on a pound of

1736
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:47,519
flour that's gonna come in from a

1737
01:17:45,689 --> 01:17:49,229
distributor if you take the pound you're

1738
01:17:47,519 --> 01:17:51,179
gonna have more than 3% with stems and

1739
01:17:49,229 --> 01:17:55,829
everything on there touching all the

1740
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:57,748
kief it's difficult I find child

1741
01:17:55,828 --> 01:18:05,759
resistant packaging to be adult

1742
01:17:57,748 --> 01:18:09,269
resistant yep I think grade products

1743
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:13,649
that come in easier to open containers

1744
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:17,189
for the elderly like we are protecting

1745
01:18:13,649 --> 01:18:20,189
one class at the detriment of others and

1746
01:18:17,189 --> 01:18:22,050
that is also not fair I think it's

1747
01:18:20,189 --> 01:18:24,418
interesting to see how they've

1748
01:18:22,050 --> 01:18:26,399
delineated all of the different uses

1749
01:18:24,418 --> 01:18:28,408
like you have to BTR for the life of the

1750
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:31,679
product or you have to individually wrap

1751
01:18:28,408 --> 01:18:33,719
what a hundred lay like 50 minutes I

1752
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:35,368
feel like I would like to follow the

1753
01:18:33,719 --> 01:18:37,859
money here like they're doing with us

1754
01:18:35,368 --> 01:18:39,569
and follow the packaging and the plastic

1755
01:18:37,859 --> 01:18:41,338
companies that are required that are

1756
01:18:39,569 --> 01:18:42,958
definitely wanting to fund this right

1757
01:18:41,338 --> 01:18:44,698
now the people that are lobbying for

1758
01:18:42,958 --> 01:18:46,498
this on the other side of the spectrum

1759
01:18:44,698 --> 01:18:47,848
just as much as we're lobbying as well

1760
01:18:46,498 --> 01:18:50,099
other people are lobbying for their

1761
01:18:47,849 --> 01:18:52,168
livelihood we just happen to be doing it

1762
01:18:50,099 --> 01:18:54,958
for you know something that helps me

1763
01:18:52,168 --> 01:18:56,849
vote yeah you know but I think the CRP

1764
01:18:54,958 --> 01:18:58,260
packaging is ridiculous and I think that

1765
01:18:56,849 --> 01:19:00,059
they changing it right now is all so

1766
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:02,550
ridiculous that throwing it back on the

1767
01:19:00,059 --> 01:19:05,038
retailer side who cannot be tapped any

1768
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:07,679
more they may have not been responsible

1769
01:19:05,038 --> 01:19:10,858
and put money aside for a rainy day and

1770
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:12,599
we're stood in a hurricane right now but

1771
01:19:10,859 --> 01:19:15,389
retailers really can't take much more of

1772
01:19:12,599 --> 01:19:17,550
a hit at this point in time with excise

1773
01:19:15,389 --> 01:19:18,750
tax taking a huge chunk of

1774
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:20,970
going on and trying to catch up with

1775
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:22,739
compliance I think the whole CRP thing

1776
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:25,230
is ridiculous and a waste of packaging

1777
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:27,599
if we're gonna bitch about straws and

1778
01:19:25,229 --> 01:19:31,379
our sodas and stuff that we're getting

1779
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:35,520
here it's environmentally egregious as

1780
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:39,480
an environmental attorney I am offended

1781
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:43,650
we live in a state that has a ban the

1782
01:19:39,479 --> 01:19:45,929
goddamn plastics back right like give me

1783
01:19:43,649 --> 01:19:50,639
a break when you look at how these

1784
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:53,880
things are packaged it is terrible we

1785
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:57,750
you an alcohol bottle that will kill you

1786
01:19:53,880 --> 01:20:02,220
dead before any marijuana ever will does

1787
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:04,770
not have a child resistant top it is

1788
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:06,780
tamper evident and that is about it it

1789
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:08,820
may be child resistant wallet it is at

1790
01:20:06,779 --> 01:20:10,289
the store and that is not to protect

1791
01:20:08,819 --> 01:20:12,210
from children it is to protect from

1792
01:20:10,289 --> 01:20:16,800
sneaky adults who want to drink it while

1793
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:19,079
they're in the store okay so we have

1794
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:22,020
eight minutes left and what I would love

1795
01:20:19,079 --> 01:20:25,529
to hear is either from panelists or the

1796
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:28,350
yeah I want more ranting panelists or

1797
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:31,920
the audience in specific license

1798
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:34,320
categories what's one recommendation

1799
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:36,510
that you want to make to the BCC that

1800
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:39,840
directly relates to your you know I'm a

1801
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:43,670
delivery company I'm a manufacturer I'm

1802
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:47,640
a dispensary / retail so anyone want to

1803
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:51,260
Europe brand you're a / manufacturer so

1804
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:51,260
what do you want to say to the BCC

1805
01:20:53,569 --> 01:20:57,868
let's say they should the issue that's

1806
01:20:55,769 --> 01:21:00,149
most important to us as a manufacturer

1807
01:20:57,868 --> 01:21:01,918
Kiva today and what we saw in the

1808
01:21:00,149 --> 01:21:04,260
regulations is these testing

1809
01:21:01,918 --> 01:21:07,800
requirements and to not be to be capped

1810
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:10,469
at a hundred milligrams and nothing over

1811
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:12,840
like you mentioned just scientifically

1812
01:21:10,469 --> 01:21:15,359
is impossible that needs to be reworked

1813
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:19,828
and the biggest issue for us is if this

1814
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:21,118
goes into place in 15 days we have three

1815
01:21:19,828 --> 01:21:23,609
months worth of inventory that would

1816
01:21:21,118 --> 01:21:25,498
immediately be obsolete and we couldn't

1817
01:21:23,609 --> 01:21:27,448
reel able and we couldn't use so are you

1818
01:21:25,498 --> 01:21:30,628
saying that you were allowed to go over

1819
01:21:27,448 --> 01:21:32,728
it with the 10% plus or minus variance

1820
01:21:30,628 --> 01:21:34,979
that was allowed prior that that is has

1821
01:21:32,729 --> 01:21:36,958
been stricken the way it reads now is it

1822
01:21:34,979 --> 01:21:38,610
used to be a 100 milligram if your

1823
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:41,188
product was 100 milligrams it was plus

1824
01:21:38,609 --> 01:21:42,868
or minus 10% right that's testing now

1825
01:21:41,189 --> 01:21:45,719
the way that it reads is if you're gonna

1826
01:21:42,868 --> 01:21:48,238
claim 100 milligrams it's only minus 10%

1827
01:21:45,719 --> 01:21:51,029
and so that so any of the bars that

1828
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:52,708
might go over a couple percents then

1829
01:21:51,029 --> 01:21:56,429
those are gonna have to be destroyed

1830
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:58,050
yeah and that's for us a large sum of

1831
01:21:56,429 --> 01:21:59,639
money that we have okay well we'll talk

1832
01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:03,288
after this cuz I'd like to push back on

1833
01:21:59,639 --> 01:22:03,288
that with you and come up with something

1834
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:15,800
I did hi Karen testing labs

1835
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:17,929
I'd really like to end the ambiguity

1836
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:23,989
between you know tests getting your

1837
01:22:17,929 --> 01:22:26,840
license and between the would be so much

1838
01:22:23,988 --> 01:22:29,000
better to have a clear path on what that

1839
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:33,829
all means and the time being involved in

1840
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:36,829
everything like that we're almost there

1841
01:22:33,829 --> 01:22:41,179
I think okay so we just had manufacture

1842
01:22:36,829 --> 01:22:45,260
we had testing lab how about event

1843
01:22:41,179 --> 01:22:52,159
organiser consumption event organiser do

1844
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:55,070
you have a word or two you can spare hi

1845
01:22:52,159 --> 01:22:58,809
I guess what I would say to the BCC

1846
01:22:55,069 --> 01:23:02,119
about events is that you know be

1847
01:22:58,810 --> 01:23:03,860
flexible with the municipalities as they

1848
01:23:02,119 --> 01:23:06,019
are working to develop their events

1849
01:23:03,859 --> 01:23:07,609
policies I think that that's you know we

1850
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:11,000
don't know what that's really gonna look

1851
01:23:07,609 --> 01:23:12,679
like yet so as far as how local areas

1852
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,710
are gonna decide to create that we want

1853
01:23:12,679 --> 01:23:18,170
to see support in that arena I guess on

1854
01:23:15,710 --> 01:23:21,649
the side how about the panelists so you

1855
01:23:18,170 --> 01:23:23,119
guys so we have covered manufacturers

1856
01:23:21,649 --> 01:23:27,049
we've covered events we've covered a

1857
01:23:23,119 --> 01:23:31,488
testing lab something you would like to

1858
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:33,739
say to the BCC I would like to say to

1859
01:23:31,488 --> 01:23:37,849
the BCC that I appreciate the hard work

1860
01:23:33,738 --> 01:23:41,329
I appreciate that you listened and

1861
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:43,969
looked at the industry and crafted some

1862
01:23:41,329 --> 01:23:46,850
good improvements I would ask you to

1863
01:23:43,969 --> 01:23:50,590
read the next set of comments you get

1864
01:23:46,850 --> 01:23:55,489
very critically as they are not

1865
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:57,679
critiques on unnecessarily your ability

1866
01:23:55,488 --> 01:24:00,738
but they are critiques on making sure

1867
01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:03,829
that these businesses survive and I

1868
01:24:00,738 --> 01:24:06,559
would ask if Laurie watched it to ring

1869
01:24:03,829 --> 01:24:09,229
true to what she said at NCI ACC ia

1870
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:12,800
which I truly appreciated which she said

1871
01:24:09,229 --> 01:24:16,339
I want these regulations to help you and

1872
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:19,039
your businesses be successful businesses

1873
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:22,440
so I would ask the BCC I would empower

1874
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:24,359
them to truly live up to that statement

1875
01:24:22,439 --> 01:24:28,079
and whereas there are some bad actors

1876
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:29,909
there are more good actors and don't get

1877
01:24:28,079 --> 01:24:33,988
the good actors caught in the crosshairs

1878
01:24:29,909 --> 01:24:36,988
give them the mechanisms specifically

1879
01:24:33,988 --> 01:24:39,269
with regard to the white labeling to be

1880
01:24:36,988 --> 01:24:42,000
able to operate in a compliant manner

1881
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:57,030
and the type s license just doesn't get

1882
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:59,698
us there thank you Peter no I so first

1883
01:24:57,029 --> 01:25:02,009
of all Pam was on her deathbed so give

1884
01:24:59,698 --> 01:25:09,629
her a round of applause and the

1885
01:25:02,010 --> 01:25:23,310
resurrection of Pamela Epstein say yeah

1886
01:25:09,630 --> 01:25:24,930
I'm gonna get this in front of the BC so

1887
01:25:23,310 --> 01:25:27,120
first of all can we just thank our

1888
01:25:24,930 --> 01:25:31,619
panelists and thank all of you this is

1889
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:36,469
sort of like a I put this together in

1890
01:25:31,619 --> 01:25:40,229
six days when I was like let's do this

1891
01:25:36,469 --> 01:25:43,770
the next event in this location is a

1892
01:25:40,229 --> 01:25:46,500
total curveball from this topic it's the

1893
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:54,270
pathway to legalization for psychedelics

1894
01:25:46,500 --> 01:26:01,649
yes thank you all for coming thank you

1895
01:25:54,270 --> 01:26:03,780
all what it's it's the Monday so

1896
01:26:01,649 --> 01:26:09,859
Thanksgivings on the Thursday Friday

1897
01:26:03,779 --> 01:26:09,859
Saturday Sunday Monday and Omar Figueroa

1898
01:26:11,020 --> 01:26:17,969
basically and see and then we're getting

1899
01:26:14,380 --> 01:26:20,739
someone from maps we're gonna get a

1900
01:26:17,969 --> 01:26:25,630
scientist / doctor who's researching

1901
01:26:20,738 --> 01:26:28,689
either MDMA or like like the one I want

1902
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:30,810
is someone who's at UCLA is doing MDMA

1903
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:34,118
research I'd love to get a patient who

1904
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:36,219
has used this stuff as micro dosing to

1905
01:26:34,118 --> 01:26:39,639
talk about their experience so so for me

1906
01:26:36,219 --> 01:26:43,510
my goal is basically to normalize this

1907
01:26:39,639 --> 01:26:49,900
and show the efficacy with scientific

1908
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:52,840
rigor and legal sort of you know lawyers

1909
01:26:49,899 --> 01:26:54,879
helping us craft a pathway towards

1910
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:59,739
legalization with cannabis sort of being

1911
01:26:54,880 --> 01:27:01,480
like what other drugs draft off of so

1912
01:26:59,738 --> 01:27:08,979
anyway it should be a very fun event

1913
01:27:01,479 --> 01:27:18,839
anyway panelists thank you Brett had no

1914
01:27:08,979 --> 01:27:18,839
idea he was right thank you very much

1915
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:48,930
