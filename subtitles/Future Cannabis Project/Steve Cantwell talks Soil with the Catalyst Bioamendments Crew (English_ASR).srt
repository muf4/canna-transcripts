1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,020
mm-hmm

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,638
[Music]

3
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:20,278
yeah that's how they describe it

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,080
uh well Bill from Logan Labs yesterday

5
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:23,519
and I've been here it's a new term

6
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,320
that's been thrown around like the last

7
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,460
year or so I saw I'm a little bit aware

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,420
of it so

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,820
um you know you can talk to an

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,279
agronomist about soil they're going to

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,380
relate to particle size sand silk clay

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,180
organic matter a few talks like an

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,399
Elaine income student that's the

14
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:41,299
definition of birth uh and then if you

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,100
add a biology to it now you have soil

16
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:46,078
but so now these are grown in this so

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,200
they're saying instead of using words

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,399
like engineered soil or or super soils

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,020
or all these old words that we used to

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,420
use or try to use the word soilless

21
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,460
medium based off of the lack of part of

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,600
certain particle sizes so that's

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,460
becoming a really common way well

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,079
yesterday bill is giving this dope ass

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,579
presentation on how to read a soil

26
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,500
report and he starts using the word

27
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,939
soilless medium and I said I'm sitting

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,840
in the back of the room and I just

29
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:08,839
watched half the room

30
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:15,379
and her soil is medium they're thinking

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,379
they're thinking core and yeah

32
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:22,978
but he wasn't the only one he was the

33
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:24,780
only one that spoke up

34
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:26,159
um I was watching the rest of the room

35
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,840
from the back and I'm telling you the

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,719
whole room kind of went like this yeah

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,700
for sure so I just had to say I went to

38
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,079
Tyler I was like hey man bill so I can

39
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,820
give him some valuable information he

40
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,920
just lost half the room by using the

41
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:39,118
word soilless medium and it's made in

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,320
Tyler real quick with a man I was like

43
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:41,819
if you want I can explain this real

44
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,258
quick and that's when Tyler got after

45
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:46,559
the break he's like Hey Stephen has to

46
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,560
explain something I'm glad I did

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,780
again uh yeah so if you add the soil

48
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,759
agronomist uh the definitions for our

49
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,859
soil acronyms will explain soil

50
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,780
depending on particle size sand silk

51
00:01:55,859 --> 00:02:00,359
clay and organic matter to them that is

52
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,978
soil to like a soil biologist that's the

53
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:03,420
definition of dirt

54
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:05,640
um so you take that dirt and you add

55
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,459
biology to it now you have soil now you

56
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,199
have an ecosystem uh so so when you talk

57
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,360
to an agronomist when they look at an

58
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:15,238
engineered soil uh they don't see sand

59
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,739
silk clay they see this repeat base

60
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:19,319
um to them that's not a soil that's a

61
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,819
soil-less medium um so yeah we might be

62
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:23,039
inoculating it with life we might be

63
00:02:20,818 --> 00:02:25,199
trying to do the muscle as much as we

64
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:27,060
can to replicate nature in that Medium

65
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,619
but to our garden is without those

66
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,020
without those mineral sizes it's not a

67
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,879
soil so when he said that well then like

68
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,700
indoor Growers are like Hydro Growers

69
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,318
soilless yeah so so yeah so exactly it's

70
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:38,759
what we just said so it's into on the

71
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,098
growing Community when we hear soil it's

72
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,318
medium we're thinking rock wool cocoa

73
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:44,878
core bottle nutrients so the whole

74
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:48,318
everybody's like look at it I'm like Hey

75
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,318
we're all living like a living

76
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,479
foreign

77
00:03:13,878 --> 00:03:19,620
I want the old school huge three-part

78
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,318
mix the 30 30 heavy compost if we didn't

79
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,140
use the Malibu compost we did a pumice

80
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,060
and then uh peat moss heavily amended we

81
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,919
use a clay I can't remember the exact

82
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,840
clay I looked the recipe a long time but

83
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,579
we did add the clay since then I've

84
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,019
added clay I've added Sands I've added

85
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,640
all these different photographer sizes

86
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:36,800
not just green sand but other Sands too

87
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:39,119
for drainage

88
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,860
when my first that's about five Cycles I

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,658
started a heavy layer of castings I got

90
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,280
real worried about it because I wasn't

91
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:46,199
getting the penetration the water as

92
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,539
fast as I wanted to to like top dressing

93
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,798
machine Rock uh I hadn't had a problem

94
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:51,539
ever since

95
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,000
um but anyway so I consider my

96
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:57,419
engineering soil a soil because I do

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,799
have those particles in my mix now I can

98
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:00,719
see again I see both sides of it though

99
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,159
so if someone wants to be like called a

100
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,459
Flawless medium or I'm going to shoot

101
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,459
you okay

102
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,040
just like vernacular it's like as long

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,019
as we both know what you mean by

104
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,419
whatever work you're saying like it's

105
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,280
okay and yesterday that was the

106
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,539
confusion yeah they weren't on the same

107
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,539
page there's times

108
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:27,560
yeah right exactly

109
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:35,159
even take it a step further though and

110
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,240
I'll probably hit this in my speech

111
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,620
tonight

112
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,180
um most people growing

113
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,220
most people growing in living solar for

114
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,379
being honest aren't growing and living

115
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,360
soil because they're only focused on

116
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:51,120
their cash crop the plant they're

117
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,120
growing in a dying soil using life

118
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,600
support to keep it alive

119
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,360
is the one getting us to come and beat

120
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,979
it right yeah so I think that's a big I

121
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,600
think until until producers start

122
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:05,060
focusing on the life of everything in

123
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,020
their ecosystem their their their

124
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:09,120
protozoa they're their fungi their

125
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:10,918
bacteria their companion plants if they

126
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,379
don't focus on the life cycle of all

127
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:16,978
those organisms again they're growing in

128
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:19,199
a dying a dying system a dying soil on

129
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:21,659
life support uh so in order to be a

130
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,520
living system you have to consider all

131
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,139
of those living organisms that make that

132
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,399
complete ecosystem like Elaine if you

133
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:28,740
don't have certain numbers of certain

134
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,579
organisms you need to consider it a a

135
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,918
full ecosystem you have dirt to her

136
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:37,639
so she has high standards before she

137
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,639
will yeah

138
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,660
well that's funny kind of on that topic

139
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:44,459
too though it's like a lot of people

140
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,500
like at the end of the season especially

141
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:48,599
outdoor will be like cut the plant down

142
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,699
and peace on the pots you know and it's

143
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,960
just like you take all year long you're

144
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:54,240
putting in compost you're doing your

145
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:56,038
extracts and then you just like walk

146
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,780
away from it at the end of the season

147
00:05:56,038 --> 00:06:01,740
and just like Let It rot to die yeah

148
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:03,418
and then it's like then you're gonna go

149
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,699
back next year and dump all that same

150
00:06:03,418 --> 00:06:07,439
energy back into it and then leave it

151
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,000
again it's it's insane it's like get

152
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,579
keep plants in that system keep things

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,060
growing so that your hard work is still

154
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:14,060
being used

155
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:25,620
yeah I love that conjure I think Elaine

156
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,620
was the one who really put that into

157
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,120
motion I I got word of it to Scott from

158
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,800
back in the day

159
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,199
um I made the base switch because I was

160
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,460
having trouble with the Cobra indoors it

161
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,978
was just harboring too much past that

162
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:39,478
high knife It's Too Tall sometimes it

163
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:40,800
was just it was just riding a fire on

164
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:42,779
any press that made into the building

165
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,180
they were on the Clover and they were

166
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:47,519
blowing up so it was causing more

167
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,600
problems and solutions so it would be

168
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:49,859
cold all the Clover and I was looking

169
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,539
for a new ground cover I want Brown most

170
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,819
for a while I literally backed off

171
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:55,079
companion plants like a cycle too that

172
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,300
was actually worse we had more pest

173
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:59,758
pressure down there at that time so all

174
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,139
right that backfired and then uh then we

175
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,340
learned about the dichondra so we

176
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,600
started pulling ticondra it doesn't

177
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,619
really serve much of a purpose other

178
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,020
than it's just a fucking ground cover

179
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,939
you know it's not really the hottest

180
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,379
plant in my bed as far as pest pressure

181
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:13,439
goes nothing really wants to eat that

182
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:15,060
konja the things will Linger on it if

183
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,860
it's their only option you know but at

184
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,600
the end of the day no one's excited

185
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,560
about that condo the test wise that I've

186
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,039
seen

187
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,839
um so it's a safe cover crop cover the

188
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,339
soil with a leading mold cutting roots

189
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:29,459
and she as well pumping sugars and

190
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:31,138
organic matter into the soil again if I

191
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:33,299
have I'm sending a lot more money on

192
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,860
light than the outdoor guys if my plant

193
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,720
doesn't catch that light I want to make

194
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,680
sure something does yeah I want to turn

195
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,060
that I want to transfer that in the

196
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,699
sugar I'm gonna put it back in my soil I

197
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,139
don't want to waste any money

198
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:44,939
dichondra also has established

199
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,918
connections with mycorrhizae fungi so

200
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:48,360
when you don't have plants in there it's

201
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:49,799
holding that mycorrhizae in the ground

202
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,860
so the next time you throw a plant in

203
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,699
there it can like start branching and

204
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,979
repairing with the plant you're putting

205
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:59,419
back

206
00:07:54,978 --> 00:07:59,418
at this level so if you have other stuff

207
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,599
but they're definitely more shallow than

208
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,639
some of the other Alpine grasses for

209
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:16,259
deeper roots and things like that um but

210
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,060
yeah considering root death I think is

211
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:20,220
definitely an occupying root space or

212
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,370
soil space where Roots is a key

213
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,950
component am I correct right of course

214
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:27,110
[Music]

215
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:27,110
[Applause]

216
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:58,939
my experience with uh cereal grass and

217
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:58,939
it's uh pest resistance

218
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:04,679
as far as like a trap plant

219
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,659
I'm not sure if I use that actual cereal

220
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:09,120
grass I know these uh like Rye these

221
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:11,939
barley uh I can't say I've ever used

222
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,519
that actual but that's pieces of grass

223
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,140
for that purpose though I use it more

224
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:17,879
just because it's a quick growing so

225
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,919
like if I if I have a really thick crop

226
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:21,539
and it knocks the back my dicondra and I

227
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:22,799
have exposed soil

228
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:24,719
um and certain times a year I will go

229
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,338
brown mulch heavy I like to try to keep

230
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,080
roots in my soil so I'll throw a grass

231
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:30,300
down to get deeper Roots really fast it

232
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,740
germines really fast so that's kind of

233
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:34,079
my thing and it dies off if it gets

234
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,899
shaded uh so but you got to be careful

235
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,580
so again God know what season

236
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:39,958
um like ganja Gill actually told me be

237
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,639
careful planting grasses because in his

238
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:44,639
farm his aphids he has a type of aphid

239
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:46,080
that tax grasses uh so I'm just keeping

240
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,159
a food resource around for the whole

241
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,160
year so you guys

242
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:56,458
[Music]

243
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,440
yeah exactly

244
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,699
um but no I try to mix it up their

245
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,440
companion plants we all put different

246
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,420
sugars in and attract different microbes

247
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,279
occupy that root space with as much

248
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:07,679
Foods or that soil space as much Roots

249
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,820
as we can it's kind of my my Approach I

250
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,278
do things a little bit different as far

251
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,959
as everything to me is a system uh you

252
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,399
see a beautiful garden you see plants

253
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,500
everywhere people just think I'm going

254
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,360
around just throwing seeds and we

255
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,059
haven't done it but no everything has a

256
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,639
place in and a reason it's like it's

257
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:25,679
like a Einstein so don't judge a fish on

258
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:27,240
how well it can climb a tree you gotta

259
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,719
put something in the proper spot in the

260
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,500
proper Bowl I think he said that

261
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,500
he's like don't quote me

262
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:38,219
well I'm pretty sure that said that and

263
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,620
that's what I'm saying so yeah I'm not

264
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,940
gonna put you know a cactus as a

265
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,860
companion plant and judge it as a

266
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,959
companion plants are bad because I put a

267
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,278
cactus in the wrong place yeah so I

268
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,838
think that really plays a role to make

269
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,939
sure that you're you're making these

270
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,920
systems efficient now if I have a mayor

271
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,839
goals for example I got them plants all

272
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:56,699
over my room Miracles can be a they can

273
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,320
be a banker or they can be a trap plan

274
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,600
for my case they're more of a trap plant

275
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,760
for trips so if I have Miracles all over

276
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,259
my grill I'm just feeding the enemy um

277
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,240
so what I do is I just place them in the

278
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:08,659
corner of my beds or I walk by them the

279
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,459
most now it's an easy to monitor system

280
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:12,480
it used to be in their own pots uh when

281
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,219
I put them in the middle of a room

282
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,759
that's Clover similar technique I like

283
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,759
you paying attention

284
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:25,559
by them you can't help us here if you

285
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,000
see a pest pressure on them cool cut it

286
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,679
down go torch it there's no trash can be

287
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,419
done with it but we don't want to create

288
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,799
systems that create more problems and

289
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:33,979
solutions you know but I don't want to

290
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:36,359
have a I want to do breeding

291
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,620
trips or whatever my the problem may be

292
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,959
I want to be controlling them you can't

293
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,560
control you just go ham again throwing

294
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,559
seeds everywhere

295
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,590
yes

296
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:49,590
[Music]

297
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:55,019
do you want to do you want to give us

298
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,720
like what we wanted people to take away

299
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:59,519
from your presentation and then these

300
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,500
guys can ask questions as if they were

301
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,278
there watching your presentation yeah I

302
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:08,600
did get to catch some of us yeah

303
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:08,600
I got to see the um

304
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,799
oh yeah like the large scale off Alpha

305
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Farm up in Montana

306
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,559
yeah

307
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,759
um I mean I honestly yeah like the big

308
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,739
takeaway

309
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,720
what we were trying to put out is you

310
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,000
know that there's a lot of different

311
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,220
ways to use the tools that we use when

312
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,039
we're Consulting so we are pretty heavy

313
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,860
on compost extracts compost teas

314
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:34,019
um solid amendments um but just showing

315
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,820
that there's such a broad way of using

316
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:37,860
all these tools and like getting that

317
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,540
extract out there and

318
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:44,879
I don't know it's like now I'm all

319
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:44,879
tongue-tied but trying to summarize

320
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:57,778
like kind of activating it before you're

321
00:12:56,039 --> 00:13:01,699
actually putting it out there yeah

322
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:05,659
that's something huge that we'd like

323
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,660
all right because he's not mics

324
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:14,220
yeah what did you say

325
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:16,500
talking talking Bavaria basiana

326
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,000
um yeah we kind of developed I don't

327
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,860
know if anybody else is doing it yet or

328
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,720
not but we use it because it is a Spore

329
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,100
when you buy it in a packaging it's

330
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,899
putting that into a tea and actually

331
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:27,839
waking it up before you put it out to

332
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,519
use it it just you can drastically

333
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,500
reduce the amount of it that you have to

334
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,299
use because it's you know when you're

335
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,559
using it in powdered form putting it in

336
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:37,019
liquid and spraying it out immediately

337
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,419
like a lot of that's it hasn't woken up

338
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:41,278
yet and so you're trying to over extend

339
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,719
this out there to make sure enough of it

340
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,120
wakes up that it deals with your pest

341
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,160
problems but by putting it in a t ahead

342
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,078
of time you're waking it up and so it's

343
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,278
already active when it goes out and

344
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,958
you're going to have a lot more success

345
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:53,458
rate so you can use a lot less of it in

346
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:56,179
that mix and save yourself a ton of

347
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,179
money in the process

348
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:04,200
for 250 gallons as opposed to like six

349
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:07,199
cups or something something

350
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,200
that's

351
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,519
ten times five times yeah

352
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,459
I think ten yeah and when you look under

353
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,079
the microscope when you see a a sport

354
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:23,578
that's germinating versus sport that's

355
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:24,719
not just look at the size difference now

356
00:14:23,578 --> 00:14:26,759
if you're throwing that say you're yeah

357
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,740
that's a bullet yeah you have a lot more

358
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:30,120
surface space to hit something too yeah

359
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,459
right instead of at a pinpoint then it's

360
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,339
got a web out like that it's like a like

361
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:37,439
a net yeah this is also just using the

362
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:40,680
microscope right so when we when we're

363
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,380
adding the very bassianas for to the

364
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,698
extracts we see them actually wake up we

365
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:46,559
know they're germinating into the

366
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:48,240
microscope and I think so much of what

367
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,578
we were trying to get across was when

368
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,740
we're talking about living soil everyone

369
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:55,259
uses living soil you know regenerative

370
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,639
practices permaculture all these terms

371
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:58,559
are pointing to the fact that we're

372
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,220
growing microbes that we're working with

373
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,838
microbes which are invisible and so the

374
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,699
fact that we have a microscope to check

375
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,779
ourselves like that is so much what

376
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:09,539
we're trying to help people understand

377
00:15:06,778 --> 00:15:12,000
is that you don't have to be a scientist

378
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:14,879
Master be highly trained to be able to

379
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,698
use a tool to check your own work and to

380
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:19,740
identify the different ecosystems that

381
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:21,719
are you know not available for us to

382
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,879
look at with our eyes and our growing

383
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,920
systems right so I mean you can you can

384
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:27,299
put your mulch underneath a microscope

385
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,698
to see if it's got good biological

386
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:32,578
activity your soil your extracts your

387
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:35,278
your biological innocuously people

388
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:38,698
brought you samples to look at here yeah

389
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:40,139
so we've been getting samples all day

390
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:44,399
interesting things

391
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:45,539
yeah okay I would say uh I have one

392
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,578
person I really want to go back and

393
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:49,500
speak to because I I just I was left

394
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:50,759
their sample within notes

395
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,820
um and they didn't tell me what the

396
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:55,620
sample is

397
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,660
this medium of some kind of the texture

398
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,299
I've never recognized before I believe

399
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:02,698
there's a high percentage of biochar in

400
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:04,679
it because when I um run it between my

401
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:06,719
fingers it's very gritty and it leaves a

402
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:07,319
little bit of a blast Trace

403
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,019
um

404
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,800
and it also has a bit of a wood like a

405
00:16:10,019 --> 00:16:15,778
wood dust to look to

406
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,819
it has very little life but it has all

407
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:20,759
the functional groups spread way out

408
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,100
which isn't typical usually when we see

409
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,259
a lot of um you know protozoa president

410
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,420
you're going to see bacterial bacteria

411
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:30,419
aggregating you're going to see you know

412
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:33,059
fungal hyphae around but in this sample

413
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:34,500
it's on the scissor somebody's spreads

414
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:36,599
everybody way out it looks like a

415
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,120
different kind of ecosystem yet there's

416
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:41,480
life throughout

417
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,278
exactly it's not typical of things

418
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,500
yeah yeah well I'm wondering I'm like is

419
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:48,480
this what uh you know active biochar

420
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,100
looks like it's not as active as a

421
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,699
typical soil or a compost that I would

422
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,899
look at more um just more space but uh

423
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:56,399
yeah and then we've had a lot of people

424
00:16:54,899 --> 00:17:00,440
bring in samples but they just

425
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,440
accidentally made fantastic compost

426
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:06,120
it's really rare rare it happens but uh

427
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,419
there's been you know three or four

428
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:10,678
different samples at this time yeah

429
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:12,299
exactly I just put some stuff together

430
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,880
in the backyard and it just turned out

431
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:16,379
good and it does happen for sure and

432
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,059
I've seen some soil samples that look

433
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,679
you know fantastic they look just like

434
00:17:18,058 --> 00:17:21,119
our compost test which is really the

435
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,679
goal right

436
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,359
um what we would like to do in our in

437
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:26,640
our living soil system they should look

438
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:28,859
far more rich and vital than any compost

439
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,480
products because you know the compost

440
00:17:28,859 --> 00:17:32,459
reality is like there's nothing growing

441
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,960
in it we're taking microorganisms we're

442
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,360
taking organic material we're mixing

443
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,279
them together they're growing but that

444
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:39,779
doesn't even touch what a plant can do

445
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:42,178
with a microwave they're taking the

446
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:44,279
sun's energy and feeding it specifically

447
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,660
to microbes so I'm excited for the day

448
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:48,200
when I start getting soil samples that

449
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,820
look better than our compost

450
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,500
in the future I use soil to make tea

451
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,839
sometimes like if I have a room that's

452
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,240
you know in an early stage of its life

453
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:59,220
the veg plants are pumping sugars brooms

454
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,980
nice and warm I'm seeing mushrooms

455
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,298
everywhere good looking soil I'll take a

456
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,099
handful of that I'll scope it first

457
00:18:03,298 --> 00:18:07,200
obviously I'll put a brew from that and

458
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:08,339
I have great results doing that yeah for

459
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,440
sure it's like you're re-inoculating

460
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:12,058
with what your plants have already grown

461
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,259
in that soil and then you're putting it

462
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,839
right over there so you should have an

463
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:17,519
easier

464
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:20,339
to a room that just is waking up you

465
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,720
know I'll use it to wake a room up yeah

466
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:23,459
well it's like what we do with our

467
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,380
compost as well like we keep a little

468
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,140
bit of every pile we've ever made on our

469
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,520
compost lot is in a pile and then we

470
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,320
take some of that pile we put that pile

471
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,480
back into every single pile we make and

472
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:35,779
so it's just like this endless back Loop

473
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,779
feed

474
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,859
actually the thought came from sourdough

475
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,140
bread yeah before before we found a lane

476
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:45,839
we were obsessed with uh you know

477
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,400
fermentation of of food products a lot

478
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,959
of people got in this industry where we

479
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,360
got started with bread I finally yeah

480
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,519
because it's yeast some other culture

481
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:55,678
man yeah yeah it's the idea of growing

482
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,940
out microbes to serve a function in our

483
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,220
in our lives to make something more

484
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,960
nutrient dense and easier to consume

485
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,660
more flavorful I didn't know you guys

486
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,419
were on the bridge

487
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:07,320
I mean

488
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:10,140
sometimes I'm not on the card train

489
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:13,519
right now I am you guys are kidding when

490
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,520
you said you got culture man

491
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,029
Ager eye products you're making yogurt

492
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,620
as well

00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:26,159
like I get five gallon buckets from them

495
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,500
to play with

496
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,600
yeah and I want to start introducing

497
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,220
that I mean like what would you do if

498
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:34,740
you had like a gallon and away I would

499
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,339
make some lacto fermented soda for

500
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,339
myself to

501
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,759
benefit to the Garden that that could

502
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,860
create I mean I lack the bacillus is

503
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,319
like a great facultative anaerobe right

504
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:49,918
like it's really good at mitigating

505
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:51,298
uh anaerobic environments right

506
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,740
like Iron Chef or they're like the

507
00:19:51,298 --> 00:19:55,879
secret ingredient yeah like this is what

508
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:59,038
you have I'm gonna throw kombucha

509
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,559
and the way from yogurt bacon is your

510
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:03,000
two secret ingredients and you're out

511
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:04,918
there on a grow side what are you gonna

512
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,019
do with it you could use it for powder

513
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:08,400
mildew the way it would be you know you

514
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:09,779
could mitigate powder mildew with whey

515
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,798
they use milk all the time it doesn't

516
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:15,119
hold for a long periods

517
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:17,639
and if you have enough of it you know

518
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,819
you have plenty since you got these Five

519
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,820
Guys

520
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:27,360
you're from Maine

521
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:30,079
[Laughter]

522
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,079
is

523
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,379
it'd also be you could use the the way

524
00:20:32,819 --> 00:20:35,879
if you had a compost pile that it went

525
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:37,620
you know horribly awkward or maybe

526
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,240
you've got your your recipe smelling

527
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:40,199
really bad spraying it with a lot I

528
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,419
imagine you could do the same thing with

529
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,819
the soil too just preventing a soil with

530
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:46,320
some whey might bring an aneurope smile

531
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:47,879
back I haven't heard anybody like

532
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,200
including way in their gardening

533
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,600
practices so when you said that I was

534
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,100
like where's he going with this kombucha

535
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,259
though on the other hand I have no idea

536
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:57,139
it might be a little bit risky spraying

537
00:20:55,259 --> 00:21:00,319
kombucha

538
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,320
for sure

539
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:13,220
and I'll add like a schmill from a

540
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:13,220
little like beer if I can get it um

541
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:19,798
I'll take the kombucha mother and I'll

542
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:21,660
dilute it a little bit even like some

543
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:24,240
raw apple cider vinegar the mother from

544
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,519
that too and that'll end up in my bucket

545
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,440
and like these buckets can sit weeks

546
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:32,819
months you know they're fine and you can

547
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:35,179
if you put kombucha and apple mother or

548
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:37,259
yeah

549
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:39,360
but if you put them in the same

550
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:40,859
container one would eventually I'll

551
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,538
compete the other you would imagine so

552
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:44,579
yeah because they're both super strong

553
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:46,319
they both are like two things that like

554
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:48,558
to dominate their environment right so

555
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:51,240
yeah you're basically like good luck

556
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:53,519
yeah the same with the beer too like

557
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,759
like thick thick ale or something like

558
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,759
that yeah

559
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,239
[Music]

560
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,298
because I've seen some success

561
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:34,200
that is interesting even when you're

562
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:37,019
looking at these different k f preps and

563
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,779
compost a lot of these microorganisms

564
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:41,759
although the the way that we make the

565
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:43,200
preps or the complex can be very

566
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,079
different the organisms that come out on

567
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,279
the other side can be quite similar

568
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:49,079
especially when you're looking at you

569
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:50,460
know the DNA of the compost you can

570
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:52,798
actually suss out everything that's in

571
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,079
it you can see that we do have a lot of

572
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:57,418
the lactic acid bacteria in the compost

573
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:59,119
and under the microscope you see it when

574
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:01,860
you actually drive the compost sample

575
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,599
anaerobic so if I put our compost in a

576
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:05,639
test tube and then let it sit for a

577
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,719
couple days or I put it in a jar and add

578
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,120
some food resource and let it sit

579
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:13,259
overnight the next day I'll see those

580
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:15,119
you know big rectangle uh bacillus rods

581
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:18,740
you know soaring through the sample and

582
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:21,239
you can see them in great diversity

583
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:23,279
right so they have they when they move

584
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,659
they Bend like this so they look like if

585
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,899
you've ever seen a little kid draw a

586
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:30,059
bird

587
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:32,538
oh yeah those are the coolest

588
00:23:30,058 --> 00:23:32,538
like

589
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:38,879
a windmill

590
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:42,539
so do you see them like different

591
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,159
if you took different soil samples from

592
00:23:42,538 --> 00:23:46,558
all the people who brought stuff and

593
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,380
then you let them all go anaerobic

594
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,720
you'd see like different starting

595
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,820
faculty

596
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,880
microbes definitely based on like what

597
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:58,619
exists in that yeah soil yeah I spend a

598
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,200
lot of time driving soils and aerobic to

599
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:03,719
understand you know both sides of of the

600
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,880
reality and um the thing that always

601
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,558
blows my mind is the more Arabs I see

602
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,080
the more diversity of arrows the more

603
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:13,079
diversity of anaerobes so as like it is

604
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:15,538
our goal to grow aerobic microorganisms

605
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:17,819
on our compost at the same time I would

606
00:24:15,538 --> 00:24:19,379
somehow seemingly like magic on the

607
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:21,720
other side of things there's anaerobes

608
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:24,000
there present too and so as soon as it

609
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,339
gets uh you know overloaded with food

610
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,038
resource or a lack of oxygen what's

611
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:31,918
trippy is that those are like actual

612
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:33,599
parallel universes yeah like you know we

613
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,640
talk about parallel universes and it's

614
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:38,759
like those microbes in certain

615
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:40,860
situations these ones are all alive yeah

616
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,720
right and it switches and like they may

617
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:46,798
go dead for a thousand years but like

618
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:48,659
these ones have like four years

619
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:49,859
yeah however long yeah and where you

620
00:24:48,659 --> 00:24:50,820
have to be I just spoke to us actually

621
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:51,899
you don't want to hear anybody talk

622
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:53,099
about this this is something from

623
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,298
personal experience but where you have

624
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:55,619
to be careful because like she said

625
00:24:54,298 --> 00:24:57,179
there's faculty at microbes everywhere

626
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,279
then they serve a purpose they're it's

627
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:01,080
not like they're back even anaerobes

628
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,038
they serve a purpose

629
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:04,678
um

630
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:07,200
but the problem with facultatives is

631
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:08,759
that facultatives have enzymes that both

632
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,140
work and oxygen rich environments or

633
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:11,640
oxygen reduce environments and obviously

634
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,140
Rich environments okay so they go both

635
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,600
ways we know that I'm just for people

636
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:18,360
who didn't now but why that's a problem

637
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,740
in the regulated cannabis industry uh

638
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:20,759
and we're in where a lot of the knife

639
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,519
bags are going to struggles because we

640
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:25,798
all know KF is heavily not all but there

641
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,599
is a lot of facultative microbes used in

642
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:30,480
their preps and all that stuff okay so

643
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:32,278
you get a faculty microbe it can survive

644
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,778
on a leaf surface really well because it

645
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:36,119
does have the enzymes for the oxygen

646
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:37,619
environment it could also survive but

647
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:39,839
what I'm getting at is you cut that

648
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,339
plant off you take that for testing okay

649
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,798
they're going to take that plant they're

650
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:45,658
going to put it in a Petri dish you know

651
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:47,879
what a petri dish is that is an

652
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:49,620
anaerobic environment with a lot of

653
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,419
sugar and they're not they're not

654
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:53,099
counting they're not looking for for

655
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:54,778
Arabs they look for an air robes and

656
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:56,759
when that facultative micro grows inside

657
00:25:54,778 --> 00:25:58,798
that petri dish you're gonna get a fail

658
00:25:56,759 --> 00:26:00,419
now even if you try to then fight that

659
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:04,139
feeling hey I want to retest as a false

660
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:05,580
positive doing some whatever qpcr I want

661
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,960
to see the DNA

662
00:26:05,579 --> 00:26:08,819
um that still costs you extra money per

663
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,679
per pack you know like in Nevada we have

664
00:26:08,819 --> 00:26:13,319
five pounds per lot so if I have the

665
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:15,000
percentage of 500 pounds to get a lot

666
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:16,859
tested that's a hundred dollars I just

667
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,720
took a hit on it per pack

668
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:21,058
um so even if this is something you were

669
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,159
talking about years ago so this is still

670
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:25,278
an issue it's got worse though what

671
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:28,080
people don't understand is

672
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:29,819
we're growing cash crops now okay so

673
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,339
like if you if you're using knf to grow

674
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:33,359
almonds and whatever walnuts and all

675
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:34,500
that stuff cool great if you're having a

676
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,319
good success and this isn't a desert

677
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:40,319
work versus doesn't it work this is a

678
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:42,899
is it USDA validated processes because

679
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,460
if you're using knf and I I there might

680
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,960
be so someone out there can correct me

681
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,640
and help me find this please I have

682
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,558
friends who need the information

683
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:51,299
um if there's UFC validated K net

684
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:52,980
processes please let me know

685
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:55,019
um because if there's not people can't

686
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,640
do them yeah okay because you can grow

687
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:58,440
whatever little regular coffee you want

688
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,360
I have a produce Farm I don't get

689
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,460
regulated at all I had I had the

690
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:03,658
Department of Agriculture out one time

691
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,640
and they didn't ask a whole lot of

692
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:09,260
questions not like cannabis they don't

693
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,259
care but if you're going in

694
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:15,960
okay and if you if you're showing them

695
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,940
hey I'm making whatever even if you're

696
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,620
making a compost right you can make you

697
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,419
can make a compost whatever type of

698
00:27:19,619 --> 00:27:22,918
technique you want to do

699
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:25,380
um if you don't show that your compost

700
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:27,360
was made using a validated USDA method

701
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:28,679
if you don't track every parameter of

702
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,500
that pile

703
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:34,320
you're using death to grow stuff and now

704
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,859
it's a consumer making your compost a

705
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,859
lot less fun

706
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:47,339
we have like books of records and every

707
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:48,359
single day what the temperature was what

708
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:49,918
the moisture was with the outside

709
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:51,240
regular you know and then how much

710
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,740
compost leaves are a lot how much

711
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,480
compost you know what I mean like it's

712
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,798
insane the like regulations we have to

713
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,058
go through just for and I can imagine

714
00:27:55,798 --> 00:27:59,220
that's why we called you guys when we

715
00:27:57,058 --> 00:28:00,658
started going through yeah we're here

716
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,740
we're local to the Grass Valley we're

717
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,480
just like right up we're the only

718
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,019
permanent composting facility in Nevada

719
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,640
County Nevada County doesn't even happen

720
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:10,440
we are highly and we are like Mom and

721
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,778
Pop size too like we're not one of these

722
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,700
Mega industrial spaces I've even receive

723
00:28:12,778 --> 00:28:18,259
waste like we buy all of our ingredients

724
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,259
more heavily heavily regulated

725
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:27,778
let's have those big gang fight about it

726
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:31,038
arguing about it and let's quit arguing

727
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:34,019
about it and listen be more proactive

728
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:35,038
the knife guys got things at work and we

729
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:36,359
need to work to make sure that those

730
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:39,000
things get validated if they want to use

731
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:40,798
them it just isn't a hybridization that

732
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,599
can go on there and again I couldn't

733
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,519
find anything spray biology on your

734
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:46,379
flowers by any means yeah right but

735
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,418
perhaps what is your opinion just

736
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,340
through a vegetation so just quickly you

737
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,200
guys can all smoke right now right yeah

738
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:54,418
yeah

739
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,980
again my problem isn't even it with knef

740
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:57,240
doesn't work doesn't it work I've seen

741
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,058
beautiful plants around can never

742
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,859
actually yeah my thing is more or less

743
00:29:00,058 --> 00:29:03,359
can it work in a regular Market is it

744
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:04,379
more risk than reward

745
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:05,639
um are you thinking in trouble if you

746
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,500
use the non-validated process because

747
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,140
like every single thing I do I have to

748
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:12,900
have the SOP for my cover crop plants I

749
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,460
have Sops for cleaning my floor cleaning

750
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,200
my Brewer cleaning every single thing

751
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,880
that we do we have to have an sop for

752
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,740
and I don't think people realize that

753
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,059
they see this beautiful thing and the

754
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,099
thing is just happens to be like that

755
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:24,658
every single thing has a piece of paper

756
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:26,158
behind it and it's tracked and that's

757
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:28,320
what they want to see if you can't show

758
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,880
them every single little everything they

759
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:30,839
want they want quantitative not

760
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,419
qualitative

761
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:35,038
um data you know

762
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:36,720
yeah some of their rules are just rules

763
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:38,759
to be rules too they don't even

764
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,380
understand like The Faculty at anaerub

765
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:42,658
it just happened to be on a list of a

766
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,860
DNA sample or something like that that

767
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:45,000
they don't even understand if it

768
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:48,058
actually is going to do anything wrong

769
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,980
they think it could be and so they're

770
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:53,158
like okay that's excluded and now you

771
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:55,319
fail yeah 100 100

772
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:57,539
yeah how is that not happening with the

773
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:59,519
compost extracts and teas because if I

774
00:29:57,538 --> 00:30:02,099
if I were to say take the compost tea

775
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,139
that we make and to put it in an

776
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:06,119
anaerobic environment and feed it those

777
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:09,299
anaerobes would wake up like our tea

778
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:11,579
isn't exclusively just Arabs right it's

779
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:12,599
just the condition so how do you how do

780
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:14,460
you deal with that with your current

781
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:15,778
processes have you failed or had issues

782
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,220
with that at all no I've never had any

783
00:30:15,778 --> 00:30:18,659
issues I try to make sure I grew

784
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,500
everything keep it as aerobic as

785
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:21,539
possible

786
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,619
um I would acknowledging with what you

787
00:30:21,538 --> 00:30:24,058
just said

788
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:25,918
um but I gotta be very careful you know

789
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:29,038
I drenched the soil I spray it in veg

790
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:31,380
foliar uh you don't spray a flower yeah

791
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:32,460
well I'll fail for Good Guys well back

792
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,960
in the day when we first started They

793
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,579
removed this test they used to be it was

794
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,500
a Tac total aerobic count or something

795
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:39,778
like that oh yeah they literally counted

796
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,480
any microbe like it was good but they

797
00:30:39,778 --> 00:30:43,859
wanted sterile yeah so I I the first

798
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,980
couple years of me growing and living

799
00:30:43,859 --> 00:30:49,859
soil I got prepared for that test uh so

800
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:52,200
that it's a trip

801
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:54,298
first week or week and a half you could

802
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,798
get away with well the first flower

803
00:30:54,298 --> 00:30:58,639
development the first two weeks the

804
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:58,639
first ten yeah

805
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:01,559
yeah but pretty much before the pistol

806
00:31:00,538 --> 00:31:04,019
show up

807
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:05,759
um but yeah for my homegirl that's how I

808
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:07,798
go but I'm thinking for production too

809
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,480
look at the facility I work at usually

810
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:11,099
as 10 to 14 days is a cut off Mark

811
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,079
certain strange systems changing start

812
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:14,939
to piss a lot of 10 days most of them

813
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,960
because that first two weeks is a

814
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:18,298
stretch period they're still in the

815
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:19,740
vegetative stage they're transitioning

816
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:20,759
to a flowering stage they're not there

817
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,960
yet

818
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:24,179
um they're stretching so I would say

819
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:27,079
anytime between 10 to 14 days is where

820
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:27,080
your cutoff is going to be

821
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:31,620
and then how you keep them from from

822
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,599
feeling the test is you set the stage so

823
00:31:31,619 --> 00:31:35,519
if I have high humidity if I have my

824
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:37,319
temperatures are off now I'm setting the

825
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,179
stage for whatever God knows but if I

826
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:43,339
keep the that sweet spot I'm setting the

827
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:43,340
stage for the sweet stuff yeah

828
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:47,298
I'm good sure

829
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:52,200
that was very very good to have your

830
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,700
point of view on that it's just the

831
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,259
concerns I hear people so arguing does

832
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,759
it work that's not even like that's not

833
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:58,019
the question anymore it's just if you

834
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:58,980
want it to work we got to be proactive

835
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:01,740
you guys gotta make sure you're talking

836
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:03,419
to USA Regulators um and just making

837
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,359
this an official thing but how about

838
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:08,700
this in a world where The Regulators had

839
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:11,750
sensible regulations as they relate to

840
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:16,890
the microbes and which world is that

841
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:16,890
[Laughter]

842
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,940
completely I mean there's there's some I

843
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,100
think um similar to like using an

844
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,240
extract versus tea a tea is a little bit

845
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:28,980
more dangerous a little more volatile

846
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,599
it's a little more hard it's harder to

847
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,278
repeat over and over again versus an

848
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:33,658
extract I feel like there's certain

849
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:36,000
things in the USD where they are looking

850
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:38,100
out for our best extracts now yeah I do

851
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,619
way more extra absentee's um but similar

852
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:44,778
to way back if you do more teas oh Jesus

853
00:32:40,619 --> 00:32:44,778
yeah oh my gosh

854
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:54,079
started from the bottom now we're here

855
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:59,398
I can't remember where I was going but

856
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,278
uh yeah that crashed I don't even smoke

857
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:04,579
yeah that's why I don't smoke he's in

858
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:04,579
the test

859
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,940
oh it was are you using more extracts

860
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,278
and teas uh oh no and then can have

861
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:15,058
inputs

862
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:17,759
I'm not again I'm not hating on the

863
00:33:15,058 --> 00:33:20,278
impulse um but my thing is like I say

864
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:22,980
thermophilic composting is a safer way

865
00:33:20,278 --> 00:33:26,640
to mitigate the the risk of pathogens

866
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,980
versus other non-usa validated processes

867
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,140
knife type stuff so I would tend to use

868
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:33,538
I'm thermophilic junkie too I I think

869
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,038
it's there's a reason that's selected by

870
00:33:33,538 --> 00:33:36,599
the scientific Community as the way to

871
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:38,700
compost I think it's the safest way to

872
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:40,500
go so I'm going to probably always stay

873
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:44,100
heavy on that side regardless of what

874
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:47,419
other preps or or jadam this uh whatever

875
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:49,798
that I might use yeah

876
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:51,480
I would say my Foundation is going to be

877
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:52,798
thermophilic compost always like there

878
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,360
might be some other cool things I could

879
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,940
do if I was on Mars and I needed to

880
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:59,879
bring dirt and Mars to life yeah it was

881
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,919
a Matt Damon movie with it yeah I think

882
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,200
about like food it's like I cook most of

883
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,399
my food but I do pickle some of it you

884
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,140
know what I mean but the majority of

885
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:09,259
what I eat is cooked you know what I

886
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,260
mean

887
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:14,819
exactly not everything yeah I don't

888
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,280
ferment mistakes in my chicken

889
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,659
but yeah no I think kf's cool man I I

890
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,700
know people who are really successful

891
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:22,679
with It Outdoors I haven't seen too many

892
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:24,779
people successful at the indoors I need

893
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,918
people who do hybrid versions of it um

894
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:30,000
you know there's a soil food web

895
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,799
approach with some candy crush whatever

896
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,300
um but yeah it's it's we're all still

897
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,280
learning asking in 10 years I'll

898
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,940
probably have different yes yeah it'd be

899
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,940
pickle on everything

900
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,599
to changing your opinion when I'm

901
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,399
presented with new information

902
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:49,379
absolutely man I'm not I think it's kind

903
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:51,179
of it's a bad idea to be stuck in one

904
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:52,759
area

905
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:55,619
especially in the industry something new

906
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,639
for sure

907
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:58,639
you guys are just like

908
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,280
shit

909
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,380
I usually you're just in a little box

910
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:09,379
smoking by yourself

911
00:35:15,949 --> 00:35:22,078
[Laughter]

912
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:25,078
you want down

913
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,079
yeah

914
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:30,739
which which can

915
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:35,579
no down

916
00:35:32,838 --> 00:35:38,539
down yeah

917
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,539
yes it is

918
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:45,380
yeah yeah

919
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,099
he's got like four alpaca on farms so

920
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:50,940
he's always right okay yeah I was

921
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:53,640
talking to him about it I didn't

922
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,900
actually get to smoke as herb though now

923
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:57,659
you get to smoke this pie but we did

924
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,000
talk no we just oh you didn't smoke oh

925
00:35:57,659 --> 00:36:01,279
yeah it's in the air that's when we were

926
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,440
smoking

927
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,440
farms uh what was it oh

928
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:14,578
great stopper was it grape stomper crust

929
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:17,880
I love it it's like my favorite well

930
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:19,800
we'll find out when he comes back

931
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,740
it was right in front of you it was very

932
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,320
good I liked it a lot

933
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:26,819
did you guys like it it's tasty yeah

934
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,140
we've actually held some like workshops

935
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:30,420
and stuff at Daniel's Farm because he's

936
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:33,420
local to here too it's nice

937
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:36,260
that's awesome so all right so fun

938
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,700
things you've seen under microscopes

939
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,320
so many fun things I think my favorite

940
00:36:38,699 --> 00:36:42,480
thing that I've seen under a microscope

941
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,460
is we're showing you the nematodes which

942
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,079
are you know round worms in the soil and

943
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:48,119
I started to observe

944
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,099
um it looked like the nematodes were

945
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,079
tied together by their tails so a Medusa

946
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:54,599
head so it would be a ball of living

947
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,519
nematodes writhing through the soil and

948
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,200
so each one of them like a snake is just

949
00:36:56,519 --> 00:37:00,900
pulling the ball around thrashing

950
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:03,118
through the sample and and they're all

951
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,160
tied together by the Tails and every

952
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,400
single nematode is a different species

953
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:10,319
so some of them were predatory some of

954
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,539
them were never seen this bacterial some

955
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,180
of them were fungal feeders and then I I

956
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:16,500
asked Elaine uh Ingham what it was and

957
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:18,239
she said I've observed this a lot of

958
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,800
times I've asked plenty of nematologists

959
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,319
what it is nobody really knows what it

960
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:24,300
is so it's an unknown

961
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,220
it's an unknown happening in the soil

962
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:28,980
and we don't know what makes this occur

963
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:31,679
so I've shared over and over and over

964
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:34,099
and over again these images online and

965
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:36,719
somebody told me about a rat king

966
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:37,920
yeah so and that's another and they

967
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,419
don't really know how it happens or if

968
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,039
it's real but these Rats end up with

969
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,900
their tails knotted tied together like

970
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,759
20 rats all their tails are knotted

971
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,200
together um

972
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,000
super weird look at that it's called

973
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:50,358
stumble across it's called a rat king

974
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,579
yeah

975
00:37:50,358 --> 00:37:55,679
exactly so I started just it

976
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:58,380
reinvigorated me to start researching

977
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:01,078
again and just with some clever

978
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:03,720
Google search I realized that it is

979
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:05,700
actually a bacterium that lives in the

980
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:07,199
soil uh it lives in the soil all the

981
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:09,299
time and it's activated and woken up

982
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:10,618
whenever it's flooding and what happens

983
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:12,660
is it makes the very tip of the

984
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:13,800
nematode's tail sticky and so when

985
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:16,259
there's swimming through solution and

986
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,260
they touch and then they try to get away

987
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:21,240
right so it makes the ball move and so

988
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:23,480
you have these writhing nematodes that

989
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:23,479
are alive

990
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:28,259
against the other ones

991
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,820
and that bacteria really likes to be

992
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,510
imitate so at something and eventually

993
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:36,960
it dissolves them and eats them yeah

994
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:39,720
[Laughter]

995
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,280
yeah it'll be a ball like that and

996
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:42,480
there'll be like 50 nematodes and

997
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,800
they're all facing out trying to get

998
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,639
away from it and they just can't yeah

999
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:50,039
super nice and then this this microbe

1000
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:51,779
like majorly comes over and just starts

1001
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:54,059
yeah it basically starts multiplying and

1002
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:57,060
eating all of them yeah

1003
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:57,059
yep

1004
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:03,360
[Music]

1005
00:39:04,139 --> 00:39:08,098
commentary

1006
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,920
I know that Steve's going to talk later

1007
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:12,079
about the bottom spots

1008
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,460
yeah

1009
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,460
you had just finished your presentation

1010
00:39:22,338 --> 00:39:28,858
tonight so as I was as I was just saying

1011
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:32,640
the bottomless pots yeah yeah I would

1012
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:32,639
just smoke about uh

1013
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:44,880
at work because

1014
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,320
they're watching they're still they're

1015
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,640
seeing what you're up to high Striker

1016
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,640
Farms has also been doing it

1017
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,659
he's been using the Grassroots beds in

1018
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:55,618
the bottom of the spot cool cool on

1019
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:59,460
their living soil they had some

1020
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:02,760
custom-made soil biochar added to it and

1021
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:04,559
I was excited to hear you speak and hear

1022
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,099
what you were going to talk about in

1023
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:09,960
regards to their successes

1024
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:12,359
yeah it started off by just trying to

1025
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:14,820
save labor you know um it was kind of an

1026
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:16,500
accident I had a overgrown plant a seed

1027
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,180
plant and then in a black pot it's a

1028
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,980
regular standard you know veg pot with

1029
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:21,779
some holes in the bottom and I meant to

1030
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,500
plant it I said on a bed

1031
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:24,480
um

1032
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,980
got busy forgot about it came back a

1033
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,260
week later and that yellow plant was

1034
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:30,539
green as can be and I went to grab it to

1035
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,820
transplant it it was stuck all right I

1036
00:40:30,539 --> 00:40:34,858
was like that's kind of cool I was like

1037
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:36,180
just I immediately pictured a rock whole

1038
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:37,619
cube with a with a Little Rock little

1039
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:39,239
cube a big Rocco Cube the Little Rocker

1040
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:40,380
Cube on top of it I was like all right

1041
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:42,479
this could work I said the gear is

1042
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,980
rolling uh so I started doing it uh one

1043
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,838
bed at a time in the room I didn't say

1044
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,099
nothing for a year because uh people

1045
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:48,960
look at me and I might do something

1046
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:51,359
people tend to follow sometimes so I was

1047
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,980
really hesitant to like introduce this

1048
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:55,940
new technique and have everybody in the

1049
00:40:52,980 --> 00:41:00,480
industry bomb doing it yeah

1050
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:01,679
yeah not yet so I did it happen I did it

1051
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,420
for a minute I started off with just the

1052
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:05,519
black pots which is I literally just cut

1053
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,200
the bottoms off um and yeah you said on

1054
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:08,519
a saucer you filled up with soil you

1055
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,838
plant your plant in there um once you

1056
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:11,940
give your plant two to three weeks to

1057
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:13,440
filter fill that soil space um this

1058
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,059
usually like a nice little crown on the

1059
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,740
bottom of roots uh you can just easily

1060
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:18,719
pick up that pot without you know any

1061
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:21,838
soil dropping out and you just set it on

1062
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:23,939
top of your soil so we did it again it

1063
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:26,279
was more labor this is more first uh for

1064
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,900
scale because digging a hole while

1065
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,060
you're disturbing the soil that's that's

1066
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:32,519
kind of not really our deal I'm trying

1067
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:34,199
to avoid that as much as possible

1068
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:35,400
um so you're not streaming the soil but

1069
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:37,439
you're not digging holes and making a

1070
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,880
mess either digging pulling that dirt

1071
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,380
out and if I can do whatever you're

1072
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,579
gonna do with it then transplant then

1073
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,500
you gotta refill all that and then you

1074
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:45,359
gotta clean the mess up you just made it

1075
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:48,838
usually take us about two days to plant

1076
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:51,179
a room uh now it takes us to to my uh

1077
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:52,980
Growers half a day because you're just

1078
00:41:51,179 --> 00:41:54,838
moving pot yeah they just you just said

1079
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,940
and they're done

1080
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:58,259
um but so it was originally

1081
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:01,858
thought out they were just gonna save

1082
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:04,079
time in labor but then we end up seeing

1083
00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:05,460
it over time was that they're growing

1084
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,740
faster now because there's no

1085
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,240
transparents transparent again we're

1086
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:10,919
just setting them down they're just

1087
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:14,039
continuing to grow

1088
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,300
um so we we had way faster growth rates

1089
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:16,858
um one thing you'll notice when you

1090
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,180
switch over to bottomless pots is your

1091
00:42:16,858 --> 00:42:20,098
plants are going to be six inches bigger

1092
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:21,838
day one yeah right because they're in a

1093
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:24,059
pot

1094
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:26,039
so uh so like for the vertical guys it

1095
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:27,779
might not work um that's the only time I

1096
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:29,400
tell people to be hesitant if they are

1097
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:31,200
running a vertical system and they are a

1098
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,940
little tight on Space it probably isn't

1099
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,379
the best setup for them um but if you

1100
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,960
got the Headroom space and you're on a

1101
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:38,940
commercial scale I can't find a single

1102
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,619
reason why you shouldn't do it uh it's

1103
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,179
lit you might need to buy some old soil

1104
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:43,680
or some more soil because you know

1105
00:42:42,179 --> 00:42:45,539
you're not replacing that soil no more

1106
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:46,919
you have to actually have to buy some

1107
00:42:45,539 --> 00:42:48,358
more soil to get the assist of this

1108
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,760
style started

1109
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:54,000
um but it's it's a game changer it's a

1110
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,200
year ago less labor more yields game

1111
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,800
over

1112
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:57,799
you can say

1113
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,440
you can sing good on yeah and we had one

1114
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:06,179
row at the very end and a few cells were

1115
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,000
not the best plants that ended up in

1116
00:43:06,179 --> 00:43:11,838
there and two weeks later they're on par

1117
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,838
with the rest of the room

1118
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:16,920
that Tech is definitely I'm super stoked

1119
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,480
to see people use it because they're

1120
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,039
gonna make I've seen like

1121
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,659
people make their own little tweaks to

1122
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:22,559
the system to their little styles to it

1123
00:43:21,659 --> 00:43:23,879
it's like oh that's kind of interesting

1124
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:26,219
I'm curious how that turns out you know

1125
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,338
and sometimes it's like tried that you

1126
00:43:26,219 --> 00:43:32,039
can like that but it's better

1127
00:43:28,338 --> 00:43:34,078
nice dude thank you so they're small

1128
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:36,119
um now but as they're learning their

1129
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,560
startup that's sick they're gonna be

1130
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:39,000
getting their Cuts better and better and

1131
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:41,039
better but I love seeing it that's what

1132
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,179
you showed me before right yeah that's

1133
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,179
cool that's awesome yeah

1134
00:43:46,818 --> 00:43:51,239
I heard you guys got some pretty

1135
00:43:48,539 --> 00:43:53,159
straight ones out there so uh there's

1136
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:55,019
medical and Rec and it's

1137
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:56,759
backwards to

1138
00:43:55,019 --> 00:43:59,699
I think that

1139
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,500
um recreational has a lot more

1140
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:05,399
um stricter testing than the medical

1141
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:07,679
Market requires that is that's crazy

1142
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,358
that is crazy and that's how it's been

1143
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:13,078
but uh

1144
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:14,338
so then that's not necessarily a problem

1145
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,519
for

1146
00:44:14,338 --> 00:44:20,338
that but we do do the testing regardless

1147
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,539
for the medical guard and you know we

1148
00:44:20,338 --> 00:44:22,799
make sure that we're doing good with

1149
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:25,500
that we're working with Coastal Maine

1150
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,839
soil company um

1151
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,699
numbers beforehand and they work with us

1152
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,639
for what's going to happen after each

1153
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:35,779
run we can send our soil for testing um

1154
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,779
and for Reinventing

1155
00:44:36,858 --> 00:44:42,078
so what was your favorite part of it

1156
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:46,920
really think about it the honestly the

1157
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:50,480
bottomless pot

1158
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,480
got it right off the top of my head

1159
00:44:52,338 --> 00:44:57,838
the most influential thing he said

1160
00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:01,079
well that's what I can remember

1161
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:03,719
those spots yeah so far yeah

1162
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:05,818
can I ask you guys a question

1163
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:07,259
um just being you know uh onto the

1164
00:45:05,818 --> 00:45:09,358
microbes what is your guys's stance on

1165
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,040
my aspergillus testing um on flower

1166
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:12,719
because to me I think it's the most

1167
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,400
stupidest thing if there's no Rhyme or

1168
00:45:12,719 --> 00:45:16,739
Reason behind it um

1169
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,960
like if I felt like because yeah if I

1170
00:45:16,739 --> 00:45:19,858
put 10 lots and I had a 99 password so I

1171
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,659
have no problem feeling I just want to

1172
00:45:19,858 --> 00:45:23,338
throw that out there um if I take 10

1173
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:24,838
flower samples from 10 different lives

1174
00:45:23,338 --> 00:45:28,500
I'll go to the same room save my Miss X

1175
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:31,139
I'll get a 50 pounds test at 10 Lots I

1176
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,880
will have one pot for aspergillus and

1177
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:36,598
none of them will and there's no Rhyme

1178
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,858
or Reason for it uh and so then it goes

1179
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:39,359
both ways so no no I'm gonna take it

1180
00:45:37,858 --> 00:45:40,980
back I'll have three pops just for

1181
00:45:39,358 --> 00:45:42,900
example I have three pop for aspergillus

1182
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,699
they test for four aspergillus strains

1183
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,380
seven of them will come back squeaky

1184
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:48,118
clean and then three of them will fail

1185
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:49,800
for three different aspergilluses well

1186
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:50,760
think about the way Spore works like

1187
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,619
there's aspirin where you're probably

1188
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,240
breathing it in right now you know what

1189
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:56,640
I mean it's everywhere and these guys

1190
00:45:54,239 --> 00:45:58,139
are testing for a potentiality so

1191
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:59,639
they're like if they happen to capture a

1192
00:45:58,139 --> 00:46:00,900
Spore on that one leaf that you have and

1193
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:02,338
they put it in that petri dish and now

1194
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,200
it grows out yeah you know what I mean

1195
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:06,139
they're literally farming aspergillus at

1196
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:08,699
that point right you know so it's like

1197
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:10,920
it doesn't really make sense you know in

1198
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:12,118
that term because spores are abound

1199
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,440
they're everywhere that's why you find

1200
00:46:12,119 --> 00:46:14,818
similar mushrooms on every single

1201
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,960
continent you know what I mean it's

1202
00:46:14,818 --> 00:46:17,400
because those things can get into the

1203
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:19,139
atmosphere and travel around so I don't

1204
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,579
think there's unless you're operating in

1205
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:22,559
a sterile environment I think there's

1206
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:23,640
always going to be that one off where

1207
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:24,838
you're going to fail for it even though

1208
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:26,098
you're never seeing signs of it you're

1209
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:29,838
never having issue with it you know what

1210
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:29,838
I mean do you think it's a public safety

1211
00:46:33,739 --> 00:46:38,519
your crop is going and you walk into a

1212
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,659
room and everything is covered in it

1213
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:41,759
yeah it's probably not very good for you

1214
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:43,618
but I think that's something interesting

1215
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,940
to focus on right now too is this we

1216
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:46,858
need to

1217
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,480
just get rid of that we all need to kind

1218
00:46:46,858 --> 00:46:51,900
of just together just agree that it's

1219
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,280
stupid to get rid of it well the issue

1220
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,780
yeah I mean you probably have companies

1221
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,640
like medicinal genomics that are putting

1222
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,359
out these essays that for after jealous

1223
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:58,618
and they're trying to sell they're

1224
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:00,299
trying to make money and they're the

1225
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:02,338
ones not just them but there's other

1226
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,920
groups like that that are really the the

1227
00:47:02,338 --> 00:47:06,420
pushers above this and they're scaring

1228
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,099
people they're they're get boosted get

1229
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:10,019
this yeah they're the ones pushing the

1230
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:13,200
heart on it so I just feel like we need

1231
00:47:10,019 --> 00:47:14,818
people educated people to that know the

1232
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:16,019
system that don't understand micros and

1233
00:47:14,818 --> 00:47:17,639
start pushing back and letting people

1234
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:19,619
know that hey you're not gonna get sick

1235
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:21,900
like an example I can fail for

1236
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:23,880
aspergillus in Nevada and they will

1237
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:26,099
allow me and I don't but they will allow

1238
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:28,579
cultivators to radiate their cannabis

1239
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:32,039
because it's a live or dead test okay so

1240
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:34,859
yeah yeah yeah yeah so so there's toxins

1241
00:47:32,039 --> 00:47:37,019
left behind but check it but here's the

1242
00:47:34,858 --> 00:47:39,480
point what's the worst so what they're

1243
00:47:37,019 --> 00:47:41,460
saying is it's okay to smoke dead ass

1244
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:44,099
fragilis if it was killed by radiation

1245
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:46,318
but I can't light it on fire and kill it

1246
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:47,640
as I smoke it so there's really no Rhyme

1247
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:49,318
or Reason behind their thought process

1248
00:47:47,639 --> 00:47:50,699
and I just think you know like we're

1249
00:47:49,318 --> 00:47:53,338
trying to fix things like Hey how do I

1250
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:55,139
pass aspergillus testing how how do I

1251
00:47:53,338 --> 00:47:56,639
pass heavy metal testing the problem

1252
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:58,259
isn't how do you pass the problem is how

1253
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:59,578
do we fix this stupid testing and these

1254
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,619
stupid regulators and have them better

1255
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:03,240
understand what's going on so we could

1256
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:05,099
actually all have you know sustainable

1257
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:06,419
business models because if I'm running a

1258
00:48:05,099 --> 00:48:09,318
business plan and I got to account for

1259
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:11,940
you know an accountable

1260
00:48:09,318 --> 00:48:14,400
draw that into my to my uh to my

1261
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:15,960
finances that's not really an ideal

1262
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,539
situation you know the public health

1263
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:20,639
officials who know what's detrimental to

1264
00:48:18,539 --> 00:48:23,639
for the biology detrimental to human

1265
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:26,159
health to have that and not what's not

1266
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:28,379
on there right like well like how about

1267
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:30,480
some smoking but arthritis don't ever

1268
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:32,099
fucking smoke or try to spot I'm not

1269
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,980
saying do it but it's not detrimental to

1270
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:36,960
yeah like human health yeah so it's like

1271
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:39,179
put the things on the right lists and

1272
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,818
include things it's unfortunate because

1273
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:44,039
most of these Rags come from people like

1274
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:46,019
you know like who just like dipped their

1275
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:47,279
powdery mildew weed in water and then

1276
00:48:46,019 --> 00:48:49,139
try to sell it you know what I mean it's

1277
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,160
like so you don't see it and so it's

1278
00:48:49,139 --> 00:48:51,719
like a lot of this stuff is in place

1279
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,219
because of that but then they don't they

1280
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:54,959
don't ever go back to like reassess

1281
00:48:53,219 --> 00:48:57,239
these things and be like okay did we

1282
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,740
step over too far or is this actually

1283
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:00,179
something that this test is actually

1284
00:48:58,739 --> 00:49:01,799
valid even you know what I mean like

1285
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:03,419
once it's in place going back to it is

1286
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:05,220
not something they're gonna do without

1287
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,079
like a heavy pushback

1288
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:09,118
you guys think that for the most part

1289
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:10,859
like what you're saying that you could

1290
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,338
be killing the spores and who you light

1291
00:49:10,858 --> 00:49:18,838
them on fire and that most you know

1292
00:49:14,338 --> 00:49:18,838
small amounts of fungus

1293
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,659
well I would say too though like you're

1294
00:49:22,019 --> 00:49:26,159
smoking a joint you're gonna be pulling

1295
00:49:24,659 --> 00:49:27,960
a bunch of that Spore in like through

1296
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:29,578
the entirety of the joint you know so if

1297
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,559
there's a bunch of it in the ground yeah

1298
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:33,000
yeah stuff that's not being combustible

1299
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:34,380
yeah exactly because the stuff at the

1300
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,639
tip is getting burnt but all the extra

1301
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:37,559
stuff that's getting pulled through

1302
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:39,480
there probably not so it's like depends

1303
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:40,920
on the molds you're talking about and

1304
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,358
the quantities right that's what it all

1305
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,579
comes down to because quite literally

1306
00:49:42,358 --> 00:49:46,679
right now you have probably inhaled some

1307
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:48,000
type of aspergillus in the last hour

1308
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:50,219
well you've been out here you know what

1309
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,480
I mean like the likelihood is that

1310
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:53,338
you've inhaled one of these things but

1311
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,920
it's just not in an amount or in a form

1312
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:57,779
that's actually going to affect you

1313
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,818
certain different roles different forms

1314
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:01,140
yeah I mean you get to the point where

1315
00:49:59,818 --> 00:50:02,940
you're touching it and it's spoiling

1316
00:50:01,139 --> 00:50:04,440
like you can step back for sure because

1317
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:07,220
that's quantity right because now you're

1318
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:10,980
being overrun with it yeah

1319
00:50:07,219 --> 00:50:12,879
tapping it out yeah yeah I definitely

1320
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:15,500
don't recognize

1321
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,599
[Laughter]

1322
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:21,239
wait guys wait but but let's also look

1323
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:24,800
at the the history of cannabis so we've

1324
00:50:21,239 --> 00:50:24,799
all smoked moldy weed yeah

1325
00:50:26,659 --> 00:50:32,219
that's what it was

1326
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:32,219
[Music]

1327
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:38,119
unless it's like

1328
00:50:39,239 --> 00:50:44,419
moldy weed

1329
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:47,220
stuff on shelves

1330
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:48,900
I've seen people look at powdery and be

1331
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:52,759
like how much crystals on here and

1332
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,760
you're like that's powdery mildew

1333
00:50:55,639 --> 00:51:00,618
it's either fentanyl it's a great white

1334
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:00,619
yeah

1335
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:06,960
the not so great white

1336
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:09,239
I mean but but that would be like a

1337
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:12,659
state by state battle like does Maine

1338
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:15,838
have the same they're all state they're

1339
00:51:12,659 --> 00:51:17,879
all aligning they're also States who are

1340
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:19,259
adopting kind of I mean it's not like

1341
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,940
they're all going over tomorrow night

1342
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,920
and having the same exact relations but

1343
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:25,400
there's an under there's like a group do

1344
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,400
you know what's called

1345
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:30,239
yeah there's a there's a where all these

1346
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,800
all these State officials there there is

1347
00:51:30,239 --> 00:51:32,699
this little group where they all get

1348
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,680
together and they start to talk about

1349
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:38,098
these regulations

1350
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:41,879
the Nevada guys so and what what's his

1351
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:43,980
position in Nevada he's a director of

1352
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,858
the cannabis

1353
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:48,539
okay so the California equivalent would

1354
00:51:46,858 --> 00:51:51,199
be the department of cannabis control

1355
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:51,199
yes right

1356
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:56,279
so he's your equivalent of whoever runs

1357
00:51:54,599 --> 00:51:58,140
the department of cannabis yeah so

1358
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:59,400
you're saying all those people are

1359
00:51:58,139 --> 00:52:01,199
talking to each other well the big thing

1360
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,818
is they write these huge bills and in

1361
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:04,439
order to save time they'll just grab the

1362
00:52:02,818 --> 00:52:05,940
other states and then they go through it

1363
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,740
and they kind of form fit a little bit

1364
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:09,960
change a little bit of verbiage so they

1365
00:52:07,739 --> 00:52:13,078
don't have to pay somebody a million

1366
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,659
dollars to rewrite a 150 page doctor

1367
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:16,619
you're talking to those people

1368
00:52:14,659 --> 00:52:18,659
the thing yeah we just need to start

1369
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:21,180
making changes at a political level now

1370
00:52:18,659 --> 00:52:22,799
because again none of us like to go and

1371
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:24,299
talk to these type of people we want to

1372
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,940
be our hands in the soil we don't want

1373
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,830
to put ourselves position that's why I

1374
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:30,980
love like

1375
00:52:27,829 --> 00:52:30,980
[Music]

1376
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:37,260
come they kind of want to like the like

1377
00:52:34,679 --> 00:52:39,719
hippie Camp events like and she'd be

1378
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:42,000
sitting there with farmers and like

1379
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:43,980
hearing directly what their issues are

1380
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,500
like that's what we need stuff like that

1381
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:48,420
where that person is like those people

1382
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:51,719
are like looking around here these are

1383
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:54,300
pretty like good people like what like I

1384
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:56,159
could help them by doing well it is one

1385
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,420
simple thing is this industry that we

1386
00:52:56,159 --> 00:52:58,980
don't like to put ourselves in positions

1387
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,119
where we're not comfortable we'd make

1388
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:02,039
this comfortable we don't like to be

1389
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:03,300
uncomfortable let's be honest uh and

1390
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:04,679
sometimes we got to put ourselves into

1391
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:06,359
those uncomfortable positions we got to

1392
00:53:04,679 --> 00:53:08,219
put our rooms our position ourselves in

1393
00:53:06,358 --> 00:53:10,139
those rooms full of politicians who

1394
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:11,759
don't know this industry um that those

1395
00:53:10,139 --> 00:53:13,318
Regulators who don't know those names we

1396
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,559
can't just sit back just don't get high

1397
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:15,558
first

1398
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:29,760
but we can't just sit back and expect

1399
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,859
them to do to do what we do to know what

1400
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,420
we do without us you know working being

1401
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:34,380
in the room you got to be in the room

1402
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,460
you got to put yourself as an

1403
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,920
uncomfortable spot if we want to make

1404
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:39,780
positive change in the story

1405
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,539
I'm down with that that's what I try

1406
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:43,740
like on a Friday morning we had uh know

1407
00:53:42,539 --> 00:53:45,838
any better so they're going to go with

1408
00:53:43,739 --> 00:53:47,639
whoever's telling them it's not it's

1409
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:49,799
what are they going off of they're going

1410
00:53:47,639 --> 00:53:51,539
off of the existing business model or

1411
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,579
existing model so the big one that they

1412
00:53:51,539 --> 00:53:54,659
go off of isn't alcohol and tobacco it's

1413
00:53:53,579 --> 00:53:56,160
actually the food industry like what's

1414
00:53:54,659 --> 00:53:57,358
regulation so like when you walk into

1415
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:59,519
from there walking through your facility

1416
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:01,858
you have someone who's working in the

1417
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:03,179
restaurant facility or uh industry for

1418
00:54:01,858 --> 00:54:05,098
20 years that's just walking through

1419
00:54:03,179 --> 00:54:06,779
your facility so they're six inches off

1420
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:09,240
the ground you got hot water um your

1421
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:12,059
appliances working so that's the minimum

1422
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:14,098
you have to be ready for because that's

1423
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:15,599
really the the primary inspectors that's

1424
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:17,720
where they come from primarily I would

1425
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,720
say

1426
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,579
I like like guns yeah and if your

1427
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:25,440
water's not hot enough they'll shut you

1428
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:28,980
down for a week or until you get your

1429
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:31,818
water so you go and turn up your fucking

1430
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:31,818
hot water heater

1431
00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:41,338
but yeah this is a problem again it's

1432
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:42,959
people aren't talking so like we think

1433
00:54:41,338 --> 00:54:44,578
that like it's oh it's his problem or

1434
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,079
it's my problems I want people to know

1435
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:47,220
my problem it's all of our problems if

1436
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,740
you don't start talking and getting on

1437
00:54:47,219 --> 00:54:52,199
the same page like no that's why I love

1438
00:54:49,739 --> 00:54:54,959
kind of breaking silos that like you

1439
00:54:52,199 --> 00:54:56,699
live in a Nevada bubble of like shit you

1440
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:59,519
have to deal with whereas like someone

1441
00:54:56,699 --> 00:55:02,639
else lives in Maine or wherever and then

1442
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:06,119
like you guys talking to each other and

1443
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:09,719
then talking to like I tried to get

1444
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:12,119
Nicole Elliott who is governor newsom's

1445
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:13,578
cannabis Czar I don't know what the

1446
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:16,760
actual place is

1447
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:18,500
that's probably not what it's called

1448
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:21,900
uh

1449
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:24,059
she she's come on the YouTube like on a

1450
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:25,858
lot not even like let's pre-record it

1451
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:27,540
and then if I say anything I don't want

1452
00:55:25,858 --> 00:55:28,920
to say like you can edit that part out

1453
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:30,779
she was like I'll come on a live show

1454
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:33,900
she's come on live shows and I wanted to

1455
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:35,579
connect her with like the Mendocino

1456
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:37,318
people who are dealing with the issues

1457
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:39,420
they're like for her to hear from their

1458
00:55:37,318 --> 00:55:41,759
mouths

1459
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:44,220
this is what we're dealing with you need

1460
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:49,160
to notice and like start working with us

1461
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:49,159
to make it sensible and uh

1462
00:55:49,318 --> 00:55:54,079
I think like because we're all in Cal

1463
00:55:51,239 --> 00:55:54,078
well we're in California

1464
00:55:55,460 --> 00:56:00,139
but like Nevada I mean whatever

1465
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:05,159
it's Unique in Maine we have a real

1466
00:56:02,039 --> 00:56:07,318
Grassroots medical community it's all

1467
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:09,000
caregivers small mom and pop caregivers

1468
00:56:07,318 --> 00:56:11,400
and we have allowed I think eight

1469
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,440
dispensaries and three or four of them

1470
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,660
are you know you know like like big

1471
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,179
money

1472
00:56:14,659 --> 00:56:20,460
the green Tank's awesome he's so he's uh

1473
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:22,259
his story is a recreational store but I

1474
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:24,240
think he's getting a cultivation in

1475
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:26,579
Medical Group oh you're talking about

1476
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:29,759
eight medical stores are open in Maine

1477
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:32,280
like medical office okay so like a 55

1478
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,200
maybe 10 years ago I can't remember they

1479
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,720
allowed anybody who's a main medical

1480
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:38,759
caregiver to like develop a business and

1481
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:40,980
get a storefront or be a dispensary

1482
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:45,200
without having to obtain a dispensary

1483
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:47,699
license that's awesome um yeah it's

1484
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:49,919
amazing and the caregiver Community is

1485
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:52,259
allowed to do business with all of each

1486
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,300
other too and collaborate on projects

1487
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:55,800
and Gardens and you know

1488
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,059
put each other's products in each

1489
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,940
other's stores without commercial

1490
00:56:57,059 --> 00:57:02,700
loopholes which is great so I think

1491
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:04,079
there's like 3 000 registered caregivers

1492
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:06,480
in Maine

1493
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:09,480
um and like only eight of the dispensary

1494
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:11,639
storefronts are like the dispensary

1495
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,920
licenses that were grandfathered in from

1496
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:15,539
a while ago and then the hundreds of

1497
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,059
other stores are really like Mom and Pop

1498
00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:19,259
shops

1499
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:21,000
the way it should be yeah the

1500
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:23,339
recreational marketing is a little bit

1501
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:26,099
more difficult and pricier to get into

1502
00:57:23,338 --> 00:57:29,099
because of the testing restrictions and

1503
00:57:26,099 --> 00:57:31,920
the loopholes to jump through more

1504
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:33,539
recently they've allowed it now anybody

1505
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,460
can really get a main caregiver license

1506
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:37,318
wherever you live like you could live in

1507
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:41,519
Hawaii and be a main caregiver and be

1508
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:43,800
involved in a company and they also

1509
00:57:41,519 --> 00:57:45,300
recently I believe the canopy

1510
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:48,660
restriction

1511
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:50,760
like a collective can be like an

1512
00:57:48,659 --> 00:57:54,679
unlimited canopy depending on different

1513
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:57,559
caregivers that are under one LLC

1514
00:57:54,679 --> 00:58:00,000
they can instead of have like limited

1515
00:57:57,559 --> 00:58:01,460
canopy from like either 500 to a

1516
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,400
thousand square feet

1517
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:07,260
it can be like a team of like-minded

1518
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:08,818
individuals that have like a farm or

1519
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,920
something like that you know which is

1520
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:13,400
really cool

1521
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,400
definitely letting

1522
00:58:20,059 --> 00:58:27,119
caregivers Association that they all

1523
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:28,679
they meet with patients there's a couple

1524
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,200
of patients a couple of doctors a couple

1525
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:33,000
of caregivers I think someone else

1526
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:36,419
dispensary might be on it and

1527
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,280
yeah they have constituents just like

1528
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:40,920
representatives and I guess throughout

1529
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:42,180
the main community and issues are

1530
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:44,280
brought to them and they're talked about

1531
00:58:42,179 --> 00:58:46,199
and and like they try to have a

1532
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:53,059
legislative session that works with

1533
00:58:46,199 --> 00:58:53,058
this uh Team I guess so Hawaii uh Jason

1534
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:58,079
last uh

1535
00:58:56,338 --> 00:59:00,358
September I think and he kind of

1536
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:03,180
developed a few relationships with some

1537
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:04,139
of the people in this Association and

1538
00:59:03,179 --> 00:59:05,578
they're trying to model what they're

1539
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:07,558
doing out there in Hawaii and off of

1540
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:10,079
main site medical systems are having

1541
00:59:07,559 --> 00:59:11,460
trouble right now due to the things that

1542
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,160
we're talking about with like heavy

1543
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:17,159
metals and microbiology and I like the

1544
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:19,980
legislative process not

1545
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:22,798
really knowing what to do and just like

1546
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:26,219
their constituents would maybe money

1547
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:30,838
coming in and having their Consultants

1548
00:59:26,219 --> 00:59:33,539
kind of drive driving away so let's uh

1549
00:59:30,838 --> 00:59:36,058
do you have a resale trick like can you

1550
00:59:33,539 --> 00:59:39,539
sell retail in Nevada or do you are you

1551
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:41,400
working just through retail Nevada is

1552
00:59:39,539 --> 00:59:43,858
very different man they they protect

1553
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:46,139
their dispensaries like no other

1554
00:59:43,858 --> 00:59:48,779
um they they can't home grow within like

1555
00:59:46,139 --> 00:59:49,920
25 miles yeah every single law that gets

1556
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:51,599
free and you can tell that they're

1557
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,858
dispensaries they know how they know how

1558
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:54,298
to play it again they're they're getting

1559
00:59:52,858 --> 00:59:55,500
things written in their favor they have

1560
00:59:54,298 --> 00:59:56,940
lobbyists that they're doing their job

1561
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,798
and they're good at it they're they're

1562
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:01,798
to be honest I think Nevada has the best

1563
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:03,659
industry I'm not saying it's perfect but

1564
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:05,460
I think if looking at all the other

1565
01:00:03,659 --> 01:00:06,838
models I definitely think Nevada has the

1566
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:09,420
best one I'm not the biggest fan of the

1567
01:00:06,838 --> 01:00:11,578
CCB style of Regulation right now but I

1568
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:14,159
still think the industry is holding it

1569
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:14,818
down pretty damn well

1570
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:16,679
um

1571
01:00:14,818 --> 01:00:19,019
but again it could always be better be

1572
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:22,019
regulations could be better

1573
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:25,139
so you're I mean the only like Nevada

1574
01:00:22,019 --> 01:00:26,420
dispenser I know it was 2013. as far as

1575
01:00:25,139 --> 01:00:29,460
guns

1576
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:31,880
as far as retail goes plugging them

1577
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,880
right now

1578
01:00:32,659 --> 01:00:36,298
I'm gonna be honest I love playing 13

1579
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:39,240
man nobody moves more weight than

1580
01:00:36,298 --> 01:00:40,500
playing 13 years of your stuff I'm just

1581
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:43,318
anybody stuff they move a lot of weight

1582
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:46,079
they did Vegas big they did uh the Vegas

1583
01:00:43,318 --> 01:00:49,039
has a style Vegas you do Vegas it's very

1584
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,039
Vegas yeah

1585
01:00:52,699 --> 01:00:55,919
they're definitely one of our favorite

1586
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,298
dispensary Partners

1587
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,798
um they they do really good deals during

1588
01:00:57,298 --> 01:01:00,780
the week for locals and stuff like that

1589
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:02,219
so um they move a lot of weight

1590
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:04,559
um I was back to do we have retail store

1591
01:01:02,219 --> 01:01:06,480
no uh they do not give out retail stores

1592
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:09,420
very easily in Nevada

1593
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,980
um they they limited what are the retail

1594
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:13,200
stores that exist are they allowed to

1595
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:15,000
cultivate it yeah they're they're fully

1596
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:17,399
vertical most of them so they have

1597
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:19,260
retail production uh and then dispensary

1598
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:21,180
they won't give out any more production

1599
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:23,640
or dispensary licenses or any license

1600
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:26,039
for that matter so so does that imply

1601
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:28,699
that their ultimate goals would be to

1602
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:28,699
grow enough in

1603
01:01:31,579 --> 01:01:35,220
I think that's what a lot of them were

1604
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:37,019
hoping to do um but I think that's not

1605
01:01:35,219 --> 01:01:40,019
how this community or this this industry

1606
01:01:37,019 --> 01:01:41,699
really works you know I mean uh I know

1607
01:01:40,019 --> 01:01:43,440
like when we were first opened up again

1608
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:45,239
we're just a cultivator and we just got

1609
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,099
a lounge license to be clear so we have

1610
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:48,959
kind of a distance yeah they just gave

1611
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:53,298
up Lounge licenses that's like the best

1612
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,298
kind of license it's just it gets better

1613
01:01:53,338 --> 01:01:56,460
uh it means it depends what the

1614
01:01:55,139 --> 01:01:59,539
regulations look like and they can make

1615
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:02,880
like yeah yeah

1616
01:01:59,539 --> 01:02:05,099
but that's a single service a single

1617
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:07,460
serving Direct customer in your building

1618
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:07,460
yeah

1619
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:24,119
oh you can go back and finish it yeah

1620
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:25,679
all those are great questions and all

1621
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:28,200
those are the reason I don't want to be

1622
01:02:25,679 --> 01:02:30,239
first because right right we were the

1623
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:31,679
first cultivator and we paid a tax it

1624
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:33,659
was good because we got the exposure of

1625
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,699
being first but we also had to pay to

1626
01:02:33,659 --> 01:02:36,960
train the state to do their job and have

1627
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:38,699
all these jump through all these

1628
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,079
loopholes that after we jump through

1629
01:02:38,699 --> 01:02:41,639
them the state realized that's a really

1630
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:43,798
dumb loophole or a really dumb he'll

1631
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:45,000
start another one let's get rid of that

1632
01:02:43,798 --> 01:02:46,079
Loop and now everybody else didn't have

1633
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,219
to jump through it but we jumped through

1634
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:49,140
and spent a lot of money jumping through

1635
01:02:47,219 --> 01:02:51,659
it because we were first so as far as

1636
01:02:49,139 --> 01:02:53,639
the rounds go I want to be last I want

1637
01:02:51,659 --> 01:02:55,679
everybody to figure it out I want to see

1638
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:58,139
good models bad models honestly the big

1639
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:59,639
race has changed yeah so I'm not serious

1640
01:02:58,139 --> 01:03:01,739
but you know that doesn't mean you need

1641
01:02:59,639 --> 01:03:03,058
to open it didn't give us timelines

1642
01:03:01,739 --> 01:03:04,679
didn't give us timelines so we're gonna

1643
01:03:03,059 --> 01:03:06,480
have to play it smart and in geography

1644
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:07,980
as we can and get extensions after

1645
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:10,019
exchange tax extensions until they say I

1646
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:11,639
can't have any more statins yeah

1647
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:12,900
we're looking we're currently we have a

1648
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:14,279
bunch of ideas I want to do because I

1649
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:16,318
have the cannabis farm we have the

1650
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:18,420
produce Farm um it perhaps a small town

1651
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:19,619
so it by itself won't really generate a

1652
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:20,880
lot of profit so I want to create a

1653
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:22,559
destination spot because we're between

1654
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,579
Vegas and Death Valley we get a lot of

1655
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,780
traffic

1656
01:03:23,579 --> 01:03:27,480
um so I'm trying to do a Farm to Table

1657
01:03:24,780 --> 01:03:29,640
restaurant lounge so where you can eat

1658
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:31,019
it's organically grown food on site and

1659
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:33,000
then smoke flour going from the same

1660
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:33,900
process yeah oh yeah yeah so to me that

1661
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,579
that's the thing so I'm trying to get

1662
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:37,740
the property right next to my my produce

1663
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:39,839
farm so it would be a new property yes

1664
01:03:37,739 --> 01:03:41,459
oh yes got it because I'll be honest my

1665
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:42,900
grow is in the middle of the Town

1666
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:45,000
there's nothing there's it's not a

1667
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:47,780
destination no one from Vegas is gonna

1668
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,780
stop at my warehouse

1669
01:03:50,219 --> 01:03:53,939
restaurant right off the side of the

1670
01:03:52,019 --> 01:03:55,920
highway so I live on one of there's

1671
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:58,500
three main roads in Pahrump the Highway

1672
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,940
160 there's 372 and arguably the third

1673
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,559
biggest road feeds us outside is

1674
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:03,298
Homestead that's where I live on it

1675
01:04:01,559 --> 01:04:04,920
happens to be the cool kid Street that's

1676
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:06,480
where the winery is that's where the

1677
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,798
dispensary is that's where one of the

1678
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,440
main casinos are and that's where the

1679
01:04:07,798 --> 01:04:12,619
two poor houses are so it just makes

1680
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,619
sense

1681
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:19,880
so we've got a lot of supporting

1682
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,880
businesses

1683
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:26,369
pahrump's going vertical

1684
01:04:22,389 --> 01:04:26,369
[Laughter]

1685
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:34,858
this guy was starting one of those hemp

1686
01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:36,000
fire I forget who I could dig up his

1687
01:04:34,858 --> 01:04:37,858
name but uh

1688
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,838
evidently he's not doing Hunter anymore

1689
01:04:37,858 --> 01:04:41,519
no I don't know anybody who is yeah the

1690
01:04:39,838 --> 01:04:43,699
one who did the best I would say is

1691
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:46,079
dangerous was it just that it was

1692
01:04:43,699 --> 01:04:47,460
competitively cheaper to grow I think I

1693
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:48,900
think it was a combination of things I

1694
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:51,599
think China from what I heard China

1695
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:54,200
dumped a bunch of uh like CBD crew type

1696
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:57,960
stuff on which dropped the price

1697
01:04:54,199 --> 01:05:01,919
I I don't don't know

1698
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:03,480
[Laughter]

1699
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,298
if I heard from people in the industry

1700
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:08,519
but my opinion is is a combination of

1701
01:05:06,298 --> 01:05:09,960
that and then did everybody see what

1702
01:05:08,519 --> 01:05:11,039
ninety percent of the hen farmers were

1703
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:14,400
doing

1704
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:16,558
yeah it was just Poor Dad it was just

1705
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:19,559
horrible practices I've seen people

1706
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:22,099
planting 100 Acre fields in early

1707
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:25,140
September

1708
01:05:22,099 --> 01:05:28,940
they grew little popsicles with Bloods a

1709
01:05:25,139 --> 01:05:28,940
hundred acres of hemps

1710
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:41,460
then they had people out there hand

1711
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:44,400
harvesting and hand trimming this

1712
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:47,579
popsicles

1713
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:49,079
okay and I watched all of this there's a

1714
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:51,480
block away from my house I'm like oh my

1715
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:53,700
god dude popcorn every day I remember in

1716
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:55,798
Ventura County someone came to me being

1717
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:57,419
like and this was probably in like

1718
01:05:55,798 --> 01:06:00,119
September

1719
01:05:57,420 --> 01:06:03,358
that they planted a ton of Acres of him

1720
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:06,240
and there were like do you know any like

1721
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:07,739
big warehousey spaces we could try all

1722
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:10,858
this stuff and I'm like

1723
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:12,118
you guys in September are just asking if

1724
01:06:10,858 --> 01:06:13,699
you're just thinking about what you're

1725
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:17,338
gonna do next

1726
01:06:13,699 --> 01:06:18,598
oh God I don't have a spot to harvest

1727
01:06:17,338 --> 01:06:19,619
and dry all this and then you got the

1728
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:21,660
stories like you're saying the web

1729
01:06:19,619 --> 01:06:23,700
bailing yeah shoot yourself Farmers that

1730
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:25,259
they grow hey just wet baling hemp and

1731
01:06:23,699 --> 01:06:26,578
then molds out and now they don't have a

1732
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:29,099
single Castle what's funny is there are

1733
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:30,660
farmers but of other crops well it's not

1734
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:32,400
like even like hay Farmers they have

1735
01:06:30,659 --> 01:06:34,798
chemicals they can spray two Bale wet

1736
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:36,119
which would never pass a hemp rig so

1737
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:38,460
they probably just did their same thing

1738
01:06:36,119 --> 01:06:39,780
that they do with hay but usually when

1739
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:41,460
they're pale and hey like they can spray

1740
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:42,780
chemicals on it it's an issue we run

1741
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:44,699
against when we compost we can't buy

1742
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:46,019
that kind of hay see I don't even know

1743
01:06:44,699 --> 01:06:47,818
this I should be looking out for that if

1744
01:06:46,019 --> 01:06:49,619
I find most I don't use it really most

1745
01:06:47,818 --> 01:06:51,000
of my indoor but on my outdoor we'll buy

1746
01:06:49,619 --> 01:06:52,380
like a sudan grass or something like

1747
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,818
that yeah they can spray preservatives

1748
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:55,519
on that shit to keep it from molding

1749
01:06:53,818 --> 01:06:57,900
that test I didn't even know that yeah

1750
01:06:55,519 --> 01:07:01,639
are you putting seeds down or what are

1751
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:04,619
you putting down for mulch I think

1752
01:07:01,639 --> 01:07:06,480
yeah so yeah you talk about a bale taste

1753
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:08,338
I like we have I think the couple months

1754
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,199
ago we scored some Sudan have some big

1755
01:07:08,338 --> 01:07:11,818
bales of Sudan grass it looked really

1756
01:07:10,199 --> 01:07:14,058
good so we got it but I didn't know that

1757
01:07:11,818 --> 01:07:14,058
yeah

1758
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:19,440
I I imagine it was growing there I can't

1759
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:22,440
imagine anybody trapping that she was

1760
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,338
Heavy it was a big round yeah no they

1761
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:25,159
weren't around they're actually square

1762
01:07:23,338 --> 01:07:30,699
but the Giants yeah

1763
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:30,699
[Laughter]

1764
01:07:38,119 --> 01:07:42,660
but uh just like are you guys exploring

1765
01:07:41,219 --> 01:07:44,098
stuff that's kind of more drought

1766
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:47,219
resistant

1767
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:49,200
as like climates change in California

1768
01:07:47,219 --> 01:07:51,659
well bikers have you guys seen that more

1769
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:53,279
drought resistant like the microbes are

1770
01:07:51,659 --> 01:07:54,598
they able to operate in there yeah so

1771
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:56,940
when we when we're actually looking at

1772
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:59,099
DNA analysis biomeakers from time to

1773
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:00,539
time and

1774
01:07:59,099 --> 01:08:02,280
they'll tell us of the known

1775
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:04,440
microorganisms the species that they

1776
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:06,539
have information on what percentage are

1777
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:09,240
drought tolerant what percentage or you

1778
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:11,579
know salt tolerance

1779
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:13,798
see that underneath the microscope and

1780
01:08:11,579 --> 01:08:15,480
as far as growing you know greens for

1781
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:17,819
our compost we use you know whatever's

1782
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,380
going in the pasture so we're not

1783
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:21,298
um it's not really economical to come

1784
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:24,480
and fill up the perennial pastures and

1785
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:26,159
put in new seeds so it's kind of the uh

1786
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:28,798
we're letting whatever grows each year

1787
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:30,479
just grow and we do see it change just

1788
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:32,219
the natural seed bank is popping up with

1789
01:08:30,479 --> 01:08:35,818
different plants all the time as we're

1790
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:38,640
getting more or less rain I

1791
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:39,859
barley and buckwheat growing in my yard

01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:44,880
where are you at

1794
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:47,000
you're done you're down in L.A where

1795
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:51,560
it's warm and cozy yeah

1796
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,560
I don't know about Cozy yeah

1797

1798
01:08:59,939 --> 01:09:03,899
for cannabis flour I know in Nevada it's

1799
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:05,939
really easy it's just a regular it's

1800
01:09:03,899 --> 01:09:07,500
like a business license I know you have

1801
01:09:05,939 --> 01:09:10,579
to have water rights out in Nevada

1802
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,579
that's the only thing you have to prove

1803
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:16,380
so as long as you show water rides for

1804
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:17,278

down by San Diego

1811
01:09:31,798 --> 01:09:36,060

01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:39,420
their own

1813
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:41,460
