1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,099
I think of it as like nutrients and

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:08,480
microbes and stuff like that like Scott

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:12,629
I think of you as someone who like eats

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:16,920
books and does research and then you

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:20,010
poop out digestible intelligent coherent

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,199
thought bites for the community yes

7
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:26,250
that's actually been my role the entire

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,170
time people I think the and shockingly a

9
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,390
lot of people don't want to eat your poo

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,640
but I've been eating that since day one

11
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,859
there's no let's just clarify there's no

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,329
faeces involved but no that's totally

13
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:38,210
what happened like you know I come from

14
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,890
Southern California from a pretty

15
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,420
diverse neighborhood and you know some

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,049
of the homies from high school went

17
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,800
really hard on the indoor og cultivation

18
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:51,269
and so I used to come along and check it

19
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,578
out and it would be me and like a bunch

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,760
of homies and I'd be like well why is

21
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:58,799
that happy and someone be like the

22
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:00,269
plants need the proteins a and I'd be

23
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,698
like the plants need the proteins like

24
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,260
the plants need the proteins a I'm like

25
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:04,890
why are we doing this plants need the

26
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,510
brokens

27
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,450
and I'm like none of you motherfuckers

28
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:12,868
know any reason why we're doing stuff

29
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,430
and so I know no disrespect but like

30
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:17,519
they were doing a great job but like

31
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,368
nobody knew why and my compulsion and

32
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,719
obsession was the why like I have to

33
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:23,129
know why I'm doing something if I'm

34
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:25,709
gonna tinker with it or else it's not

35
00:01:23,129 --> 00:01:27,750
worth my effort and so I would just

36
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:30,000
think works yeah that's the work so I

37
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,790
just would you know try to figure out

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,469
why something was happening or what was

39
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,570
the new like what did the nutrient even

40
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:39,810
do what does Nitra didn't even do what

41
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:42,539
is potassium even do and how do we solve

42
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,180
these problems and that just carrying on

43
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,329
that same energy brought me here I guess

44
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,270
trying to figure out and I jest

45
00:01:47,328 --> 00:01:53,368
complicated I loved learning about the

46
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:56,099
minerals and the spray the minerals from

47
00:01:53,368 --> 00:01:58,259
you and Sam from soil scape like that

48
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,179
whole mineral attitude or doing that

49
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,259
spraying is often like you were doing

50
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,118
down at that nursery like I mean if more

51
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,189
people would do that and like even the

52
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:09,610
big facilities I'd like to somehow like

53
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:15,639
slide that in

54
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:18,430
you know you know yeah yeah no man he

55
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:20,529
check it out too and I needed it for my

56
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,500
Hill because I have such an aggressive

57
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:25,659
wind that I theorized that I wasn't

58
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,979
getting calcium transport adequately

59
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:28,930
through the roots because the

60
00:02:26,979 --> 00:02:30,969
environment was so aggressive and I was

61
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,939
just like you know what I said I think I

62
00:02:30,969 --> 00:02:37,330
really have to run a foliar program to

63
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:38,889
offset my environmental issues and I

64
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,600
talked to Sammy's I can I got this

65
00:02:38,889 --> 00:02:42,669
killer program I want you to run it

66
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,859
and so Irena last year and I mean the

67
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:48,309
the plants have never looked so good I

68
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,860
had so few issues it just kept them on

69
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,810
point you know and it is it's a it's a

70
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,550
gift to be able to be around people who

71
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,750
are working on all the fringes that's

72
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,580
why I always love hanging out with you

73
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,560
because I'm like you you've been

74
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,920
touching the hook the hoops since before

75
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,560
people knew what hoops were well sit so

76
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:12,849
can we stand this as kind of a coherent

77
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:16,870
topic which is spraying minerals final

78
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:17,379
escape program is a soil skate bot of

79
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,700
Arcada

80
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:20,799
and it's just really a good

81
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:25,030
comprehensive mineral nutrient spray

82
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,650
program and what I went into it for is

83
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,659
that you know my situation is I have

84
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:30,700
such a rough environment up the hill

85
00:03:28,659 --> 00:03:32,829
that the finished product is excellent

86
00:03:30,699 --> 00:03:34,988
but I never get the growth out of the

87
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,910
plants that I wanted because they're

88
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:39,459
working so hard to work in that

89
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:42,629
environment and so I theorized that I

90
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:45,129
needed to go into leaf foliar

91
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:46,750
development so that I could get around

92
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:48,699
having to have the plant go through the

93
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,659
metabolic process from the root zone up

94
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:54,280
and one day Sam gives me a call says hey

95
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:55,780
we have this beautiful program coming

96
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,099
out I'd love to talk to you so I went

97
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,199
down the shop I took a look at an

98
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:01,419
operation that he had been using it on

99
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,669
and the quality of that it was it on an

100
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:05,619
indoor that he was shooting and he was

101
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:07,389
stunning and so I said look let me let

102
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,539
me run it on my Hill so I picked the

103
00:04:07,389 --> 00:04:12,759
program up and I had the best run last

104
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:15,489
year and like I said when I ran those

105
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:17,620
varieties on that white label there was

106
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:20,819
at least 25 farms that ran the same

107
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,579
exact plants that I ran and I had

108
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:24,560
overall any

109
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:26,959
California using those varieties I had

110
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,959
the highest Terp levels and highest

111
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:32,000
cannabinoid levels and I had zero

112
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:34,098
problems with the plants growing and I

113
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,550
used beneficial insects in terms of

114
00:04:34,098 --> 00:04:39,288
inoculation so that I had releases

115
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,900
throughout the season so that if I had

116
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:44,060
any problems come in I would have a bank

117
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:46,008
of beneficials to do the job for me

118
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,889
because I didn't I don't like to use any

119
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:51,199
kind of spray especially in tough

120
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:52,759
environments sprays are tough on leaf

121
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,050
surface and if the Leafs are going

122
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,569
through the beat and they take up on the

123
00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:00,199
hill the plant stresses out because of

124
00:04:56,569 --> 00:05:02,750
it and that foliar program gave me

125
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,610
incredible growth the end product came

126
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,620
out beautifully it came out so good that

127
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:11,060
I picked up enough to do the 18,000

128
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:12,889
square foot this year so I'm gonna run

129
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,129
in the second season because I had such

130
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:17,598
success with that foliar program I

131
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:19,729
believe in it because Scott turned me on

132
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:21,649
to it and I got some clones that had a

133
00:05:19,728 --> 00:05:23,449
little spider mites or whatever issue

134
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:24,948
and the first you know like we were

135
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:26,870
talking about earlier we're really

136
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,840
spraying for war all the time but if

137
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:31,639
more people were spraying for health

138
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:33,589
they would actually see a better result

139
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,120
in the plant health and secondly the

140
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:36,918
bugs don't like getting sprayed with

141
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,259
just plain water anyway if you do it

142
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:41,060
every day and there was a certain point

143
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:42,680
where I was trying to mimic what Scott

144
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,139
was doing it at nursery where in the

145
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,088
evening time I was spraying like five

146
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,400
six nights a week with a different

147
00:05:47,088 --> 00:05:52,338
mineral throughout those whole programs

148
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:54,228
you know I hadn't done any soil analysis

149
00:05:52,338 --> 00:05:56,598
or water tests I just said fucking I'm

150
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:58,610
gonna spray minerals and have fun with

151
00:05:56,598 --> 00:06:01,098
it and one of them was just one of the

152
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:04,129
things he had me spraying was cocoa and

153
00:06:01,098 --> 00:06:05,628
aloe and so I mean the plants just loved

154
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:08,718
it and the bugs hated it and they went

155
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:10,699
away so I never sprayed any type of you

156
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:12,769
know pesticide I just sprayed through

157
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:14,689
the whole time and the plants got better

158
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:17,389
the bugs didn't like it was just this

159
00:06:14,689 --> 00:06:20,000
win-win situation and I feel like that

160
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:22,009
can be done more at scale it's just hard

161
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,769
to implement and get people to jump on

162
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:27,259
to that you know swallow that pill

163
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:31,579
because we're so forced into the IPM

164
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:33,588
program of actually the warpath and you

165
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:36,199
know the health has to be part you know

166
00:06:33,588 --> 00:06:37,610
has to be there too obviously but

167
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,589
you know I think we could make a big

168
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,840
turn in some of these you know bigger

169
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:44,929
facilities if we could incorporate some

170
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:47,239
more health sprays Oh

171
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,040
guaranteed I fully agree you have to be

172
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:51,620
proactive and for me it was ever he was

173
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,650
three times a week so Monday Wednesday

174
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,300
and Friday and I would either get in at

175
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:58,399
4 o'clock in the morning or I could

176
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:03,620
shoot the evening too so it had time to

177
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:05,689
penetrate in and it it made such a

178
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,610
difference that the people who've been

179
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:09,920
up the hill prior and saw the plants

180
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,750
using that treatment couldn't believe it

181
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,150
because we've always historically had

182
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,860
transplant issues in terms of just

183
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:17,779
slower growth and I know that I'll never

184
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,360
get giant plants up there because I have

185
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:24,229
such a wind load all the time that when

186
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,629
I run my test crops down low say it 550

187
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:29,240
feet at my spot or I run it up at my

188
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:30,699
farm at you know 23 under feet I get you

189
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,970
know two to three times bigger plant

190
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:37,909
down below same mix same media same

191
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:41,060
operator same cultivar only difference

192
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:43,490
environment so I know that that

193
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:47,240
particular place has an impact on the

194
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:50,900
plant but when we utilized that foliar

195
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,699
nutrition program to to just assist with

196
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:54,589
the plants uptake so it didn't have to

197
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:58,370
work so hard to pull it through the

198
00:07:54,589 --> 00:08:01,279
vascular system from blow up the plants

199
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,569
just exploded and and my friends that

200
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:06,019
came up and saw it they were just like

201
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:08,599
what did you do and I mean it was so

202
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:10,519
dramatic and then the quality the flower

203
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,110
was phenomenal and when I got that when

204
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:13,939
I got hit up by the company and I said

205
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,530
hey they said you just clean house on

206
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:19,219
you Terps in you Canada near the

207
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:20,989
cannabinoids and I said well nice so not

208
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,490
only was the plant healthy but because

209
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,530
of his healthier it was able to actually

210
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,720
go through its chemical process and

211
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:31,069
generate what we want which is those

212
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:35,930
desirable chemicals yeah for sure I mean

213
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:38,059
that's what we want so just quickly

214
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:40,579
Kevin you mentioned frequency which is

215
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:44,000
three times a week Scott can you talk

216
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:46,280
about kind of what minerals are in the

217
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,940
mixes that you're recommending and then

218
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:51,709
do those does do that

219
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,570
do you change it based on different

220
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,480
stages of plant growth like you'd have

221
00:08:53,570 --> 00:09:02,060
different mixes during the early stages

222
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,590
veg and so on yeah so I guess the

223
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:05,659
further clarify the kit that they're

224
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,190
talking about is yeah it's defined as

225
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:09,289
the file escape that's the name of the

226
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:11,420
product and there's like 11 or 12

227
00:09:09,289 --> 00:09:13,610
bottles in the kit some powders some

228
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:17,389
liquids it's made by soil scape

229
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:19,100
solutions out in Arcada which I'm you

230
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:21,830
know one of the things that I say is

231
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,350
like this kit that Sam came out with I

232
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,800
will say we'll look back in history and

233
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:31,070
say this was one of the more dramatic

234
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:32,870
impacts on the organic sector he assures

235
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:35,210
me that everything in there except for

236
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:37,340
one product is all organic and it's used

237
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,930
with amino acids it does look like

238
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,330
chemicals you know some of the stuff's

239
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:43,849
blue because coppers blue and so it does

240
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:46,370
look like chemical nutrients but I trust

241
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,110
a trust Sam that all of them except just

242
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:51,590
the nitrogen phosphate product are

243
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:53,750
organic but it gives you the flexibility

244
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:57,560
of hydroponics which is what I like and

245
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:59,240
so a standard kit has two recipes that

246
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:02,029
you do three times a week and alternate

247
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,950
it that has worked everywhere we've used

248
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:06,980
it I use the kit in a little bit

249
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:09,879
different way I personally use it as a

250
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,649
toolkit for hitting ideal math numbers

251
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:16,309
and that does change slightly by the

252
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:18,769
farm I also don't use every product in

253
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:20,659
the kit because we have some other

254
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:24,500
products that I use in substitution but

255
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:27,829
in essence what Sam's kit allows me to

256
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:32,240
do is you can formulate a full-year

257
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:36,440
nutrient that has ideal values of almost

258
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,049
every main nutrient and I have not seen

259
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,170
anything else that compares to that case

260
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:43,219
at all there's nothing on the planet

261
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:45,979
that I think gives you those

262
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,600
capabilities and so I mean everywhere we

263
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,509
use them with the hydroponic farms we

264
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,730
using at the leading soil farms I think

265
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:55,789
every single commercial farm I work with

266
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:58,399
at least gets a sample kit

267
00:10:55,789 --> 00:11:00,019
and so which is a funny deal I think it

268
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,980
shows how much I believe in that product

269
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:03,990
is that by definition Sam

270
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,779
is an exact competitor me we both make

271
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,460
soil we both do consulting with both the

272
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:11,579
mineral analysis and we both do

273
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,530
biological analysis and I enjoy that kit

274
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:16,200
so much that I send my competitors to

275
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:17,850
his office to order products like you

276
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,310
know and that's I think that's more I

277
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:21,960
think that speaks to Sam as well you

278
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:25,259
know I don't feel threatened by him and

279
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,509
I trust him and I respect him so so far

280
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:30,269
nothing's good from turning our clients

281
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:33,600
into him as well so which i think is

282
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:36,299
rare in the industry good products that

283
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,779
support this industry and what we do

284
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:40,379
energy yeah exactly that kids extremely

285
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:43,829
powerful

286
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:47,039
so I guess to more clearly define you

287
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,900
know I'm more go for a full fertility

288
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:51,599
approach every chance I get because I'm

289
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:54,240
trying to be simple and scalable most

290
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,720
farms that hire us have an ultimate goal

291
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,539
of allowing to cross state lines whether

292
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,000
that means they invest further in their

293
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:05,099
own business and go across the states or

294
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,649
they find outside investment they create

295
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,930
set whatever that means to them most

296
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:12,750
farms that we work with are ultimately

297
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:14,939
looking to expand and take advantage of

298
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:17,190
the open market they're the open borders

299
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:20,280
when that comes in the United States and

300
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:23,220
in order to do that you need to have

301
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:26,039
scalable techniques and so far most

302
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,720
farms that we've worked with there's you

303
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,659
know one two or three key components

304
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,940
that makes that system work and you

305
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:34,949
can't scale yourself you need to scale

306
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,950
processes that are repeatable and easy

307
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:41,040
and predictable and so you know we take

308
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:45,330
an extremely simplified approach to

309
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:48,539
cultivation and try to just provide full

310
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:51,150
fertility at each step that we can while

311
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:54,329
monitoring biological activity in the

312
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:56,189
soil and when we do that then your

313
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:59,639
cultivation experience is actually

314
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:02,550
scalable and so what it's what it starts

315
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:05,189
to do is it simplifies the process so

316
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:07,199
that any employee can execute it and it

317
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:10,320
and we choose process that have really

318
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:13,379
low volatility and really low chances of

319
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,510
going haywire so that it keeps it within

320
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:18,269
the comfort of Health

321
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:20,429
and then you know the way that you can

322
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:23,370
then scale that to multiple properties

323
00:13:20,429 --> 00:13:26,609
is that the initial analysis is being

324
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:29,279
moved to a data point if we take all the

325
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:30,870
data points of a farm I can sit down and

326
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,659
aggregate all the information of

327
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,820
multiple facilities and identify where

328
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:38,819
the problems will be that's the biggest

329
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:40,860
obstacle to scale right now is if your

330
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,170
strategy for cultivation is spraying

331
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,970
everything three times a week and you

332
00:13:43,169 --> 00:13:47,309
keep adding more square footage how many

333
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:50,370
you know at what point does that become

334
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:53,099
the breaking point and so Sara and I

335
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:56,909
have learned to take key data points of

336
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,889
soil nutrition you know the nutrition of

337
00:13:56,909 --> 00:14:00,980
the feeds and foliar and then the

338
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:03,809
populations of the organisms in the soil

339
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:06,629
and by taking a look at those data sets

340
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:08,819
you can make very clear correlations as

341
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:11,009
to where the problems will be and you

342
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,980
can focus those efforts and then you can

343
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:16,169
either determine is the reason for the

344
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,670
distant dysfunction of cultural practice

345
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:19,469
like our employees doing something

346
00:14:17,669 --> 00:14:20,789
that's leading to problems or is there

347
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,580
an imbalance problem that we need to

348
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:27,049
correct and still that allows you to

349
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:30,600
then maintain those one two or three key

350
00:14:27,049 --> 00:14:33,779
key employees that make the facility run

351
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,930
but they can then scale their focus and

352
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:38,789
I based on what I've seen from you know

353
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:40,979
very intensely watching cannabis

354
00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:43,620
operations because even from the first

355
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,990
day I went into a cannabis growing

356
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,820
facility I was watching it in extreme

357
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,250
interest of how to make it successful

358
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:52,200
and so I've kind of watched these

359
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,090
obstacles of scale and even in those

360
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:57,030
early black market days of buddies

361
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:59,009
trying to scale the same problems that

362
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:01,319
my buddies ran into going from a couple

363
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:03,419
houses to a 20,000 square-foot building

364
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,070
are the same obstacles that every

365
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:08,579
cultivator everywhere is running into

366
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:11,250
and you there just becomes a certain

367
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,009
point where you can't do everything the

368
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:15,779
way that you've always done it and

369
00:15:13,009 --> 00:15:17,639
that's tripping up anybody that's going

370
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:20,579
up in any scale whether that's from four

371
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:23,699
to twelve lights or from four facilities

372
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:26,400
- 26 facilities you know Sarah and I

373
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,200
have you know provided advice and

374
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,319
consulting to

375
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:35,670
arms with as many as I think the largest

376
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,470
group was 26 different properties and we

377
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:39,990
have we have to provide solutions that

378
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,029
can be emailed to 26 properties and come

379
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,399
up with something that will work and

380
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:46,889
those same strategies apply to a tenth

381
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:50,340
grower it's the same systemic imbalances

382
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:53,370
that lead to headaches you know that's

383
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:55,050
just moving the ball to prevention you

384
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,000
know and getting to the cause of things

385
00:15:55,049 --> 00:16:00,299
when we talk about these IPM strategies

386
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,700
versus you know always chasing your tail

387
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:05,219
and spraying spring to kill we always

388
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:08,840
say sprayed a hill not to kill if you

389
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,129
can have if you can help it at all yeah

390
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,050
which is what Eric was talking about

391
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:14,639
like and that's what Eric's really

392
00:16:13,049 --> 00:16:16,949
champion that phrase and that's the

393
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,870
thing it's like everybody's mindset is

394
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:21,480
what do I do to kill these aphids and

395
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:23,490
you know from our standpoint now that

396
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,350
accountants are involved counting

397
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,480
everything about our process and

398
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,149
everything that the cultivator does the

399
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,560
determine if it's financially viable

400
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:34,559
well one of those things is sending

401
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:36,269
employees to spray something and so

402
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,239
those employees can either spray a

403
00:16:36,269 --> 00:16:41,309
pesticide or like in Kevin's experience

404
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,889
he sprayed a foliar nutrient that led to

405
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:45,659
more terpenes more potency more

406
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:48,360
saleability higher velocity in the

407
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:54,019
market all those things like you know I

408
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,019
hated the bugs don't like they don't

409
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:01,860
water even exactly yeah it's like what

410
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,780
how do you how do you tornadoes affect

411
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:06,449
reproduction reproduction rates of

412
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:09,539
humans how do you hurricanes affect

413
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:11,400
reproduction rates of humans like we can

414
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:13,049
see it in our own life like you know

415
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,060
babies slow down a little bit when

416
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:17,639
there's a major catastrophe and a wave

417
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:19,289
coming over the shore and it's like I

418
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,390
can only imagine that the same thing is

419
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:23,578
happening to a bug like if you go in

420
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:26,459
there three four times a week and spray

421
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:28,259
anything you're at least pissing them

422
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,420
off and killing a couple eggs you know

423
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:32,369
like you might as well spray something

424
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,620
that can increase yield spray something

425
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:37,769
that can increase health spray something

426
00:17:34,619 --> 00:17:40,259
that can increase quality markers that

427
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:41,819
will ease your product selling on the

428
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:44,069
market you know

429
00:17:41,819 --> 00:17:45,539
Oregon and Washington all these markets

430
00:17:44,069 --> 00:17:47,519
that are completely destroyed by

431
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:50,099
percentage points is really unfortunate

432
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:52,940
but it's really shown us a lot about our

433
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:55,259
process and what leads to higher numbers

434
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,269
because of that it's the focus that's

435
00:17:55,259 --> 00:18:00,390
what we're being put to work on like how

436
00:17:57,269 --> 00:18:02,220
do we increase potency numbers well you

437
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:05,160
definitely have to decrease a fat

438
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:07,140
problem x' that's the first step you

439
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:22,080
know and then provide supplement that

440
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:23,910
increases those numbers invested in you

441
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,819
know the bugs are doing their job you

442
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:28,500
know the insects and diseases are there

443
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:30,480
to break down that plant material that's

444
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,819
not thriving that's the purpose and

445
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,849
that's why those things occur in the

446
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:38,399
first place as we all agree and so

447
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:39,959
watching watching that develop and as

448
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,610
the industry moves more towards a

449
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,470
greater understanding of what's going on

450
00:18:41,609 --> 00:18:48,889
on leaf surfaces around roots you know

451
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:51,509
understanding how to that the process of

452
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:54,150
you know individually picking out a

453
00:18:51,509 --> 00:18:56,849
specific you know indirect Oh

454
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:58,470
mycorrhizal fungi and and choosing

455
00:18:56,849 --> 00:19:01,589
whether or not you know your company is

456
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:04,019
able to grow all that up and of that and

457
00:19:01,589 --> 00:19:05,939
make it into a you know a uniform

458
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:07,619
product that people can apply that's a

459
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,670
completely different type of system than

460
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:12,659
understanding the the minutiae of of

461
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:15,450
being able to figure out your own

462
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,820
compost pile right and knowing like the

463
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,470
conditions of the place where you're at

464
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:23,700
and the different materials that you

465
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:25,650
have to create you know new soil new

466
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,539
materials to be able to feed the plan is

467
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,620
sure surely it does take longer and

468
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:30,690
surely there are different types of

469
00:19:28,619 --> 00:19:33,449
facilities than others but you know if

470
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,730
you're dealing with plants that are not

471
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,559
healthy or sick you know or they don't

472
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:39,089
have fans you know they don't have the

473
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:41,129
right amount of air circulation there's

474
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:42,959
like a very there's lots of things going

475
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,460
on that can be causing these issues in

476
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,690
the first place each one will watch out

477
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,690
before they get started
