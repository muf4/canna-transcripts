so this is all the early stuff like all

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,279
the nasty nasty nasties are coming down

3
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,919
this week yeah they're they're either

4
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:14,079
just harvested or coming down this

5
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:16,559
week where are you where are you are you

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,760

00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:22,358
this year this is some of the outdoor

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,080
under Nets no sprays or no no just full

9
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,400
sign this was just harvested just

10
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,639
harvested got it got it like this was uh

11
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,759
starting the third week of September the

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,280
you know second week of September yeah

13
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:37,200
somewhere along yeah first week hubbles

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,520
came down first week second week Pam and

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,280
stuff started coming down dog dog

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,960
beaches but yeah see you just and like

17
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,399
there's dog beach tear into one of those

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,558
I mean you can mutilate whatever you

19
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,280
want brother like there's plenty of this

20
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:53,839
I just grabbed handful of something that

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,239
was that was there I'm um break open

22
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,719
that bud break it out and touch that

23
00:00:55,238 --> 00:01:01,119
sucker so we have Pam what's the there's

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,518
a that's a Pam F2 that's a W's dog

25
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,518
walker this is dog beach number that's

26
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:07,399
dog beach what was that dog beach number

27
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,200
two that's dog beach number

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,000
three um what the difference they're

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,359
different phenotypes from the same seed

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,519
lot so uh those are the dog beach BX so

31
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,200
it's a backcross dog beach so it's a Pam

32
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:23,640
and a dog walker there's a mega babe

33
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,719
here there's oh there's the there's the

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,079
gas right here so those are the gases

35
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:33,000
right there they're early gases so like

36
00:01:29,078 --> 00:01:37,559
I said you time get bacon bacon bacon

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:40,118
grease and pandemic are extreme gas

38
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,640
nastiness uh those are look I cannot

39
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:43,560
those are my seed releases for the end

40
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,040
of the year those are going to be out of

41
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,680
smoking device yeah yeah yeah so yeah do

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,200
whatever you want to do man just help

43
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,880
yourself with all your whatever you want

44
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,719
I brought this for you guys to play

45
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:58,239
with so I also brought you guys I didn't

46
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:01,679
have a whole bunch of stuff packed up

47
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,599
but I brought some seeds amazing like

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,840
Christmas in

49
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:09,079
October yeah oh where's your little Ste

50
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,719
at so there's a couple seed packs right

51
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,160
here for you so I didn't have everything

52
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,000
packed up my wife one of those some

53
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:17,598
awesome stuff that are really cool we

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,280
can pop some of these yes and so what do

55
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:21,318
you think of the concept of just out

56
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,959
here so we have autos and stuff that I

57
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:24,958
just want to keep throwing out here but

58
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,560
then I was thinking of just like if we

59
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,159
pop some seeds do a little bit of

60
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,680
supplemental Lighting in the morning and

61
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:33,120
at night just to keep them in veg

62
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:38,159
so I'm going to move this I want to I'm

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,879
going to move prob move it's too close

64
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,318
over to that it should actually be we

65
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,079
just put it here and that's where we set

66
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:47,839
up you get all the plants out here move

67
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,840
is probably like right like here this

68
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,759
one I don't know you know how much so

69
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,439
Sun so how much is your sun rotating I

70
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:56,439
mean if you put it right here like now

71
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,759
it's in the shade what's your rationale

72
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:59,039
for wanting to move it in the first

73
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:00,560
place move it in the middle yeah it

74
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:02,239
needs to be in the sunniest spot

75
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,959
especially going into the fall because

76
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,519
we're losing Sun as as it as it goes so

77
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,799
if you have to move it over there or

78
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,360
someplace else if this is going to get

79
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,400
shaded out during the winter you want it

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,799
in the hottest sunniest spot

81
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:19,200
possible but what's your big ration out

82
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,959
like the wall got it okay so would like

83
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,359
five more feet away from the wall be

84
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,239
good okay that's all so really then it

85
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,120
can just like yeah why why not just put

86
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,438
it right where this one is and just move

87
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,680
this one over one way or turn this one

88
00:03:30,438 --> 00:03:35,120
sideways exactly that's what I want turn

89
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,599
they're like Legos right yeah basically

90
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,120
you slide it over a few feet in a

91
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:40,280
different way you know but yeah throw in

92
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,920
Autos would be suggestion for like how

93
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,479
close they should be to one another you

94
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:48,119
know it depends on the way you want to

95
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,959
do your your protection setup right so

96
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,560
like either a you want to do a

97
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:52,840
protection like you just want to isolate

98
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,318
this one little thing we put a little

99
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,120
protection like over this thing which is

100
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,798
a good example we should probably do um

101
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,719
yes cuz it's small and easy right now

102
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,760
you know what I mean protection I set

103
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,359
all my all my bamboos up as they were

104
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:07,719
growing I put a little cover over it and

105
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,239
so so I want to do that but of course

106
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:12,799
now I know I need so so shade is the

107
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,759
enemy for the most part right so if

108
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,040
they're too close together you're going

109
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:16,839
to get too much shade right so if

110
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,959
they're too far apart they get more but

111
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,279
then again like your soil temperature

112
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,560
and like them being able to like you

113
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,839
know co-mingle and all that stuff

114
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,478
there's less important cuz you're in

115
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,560
boxes but this particular thing you you

116
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:31,120
know you're pretty much maxed out on you

117
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,560
know three big bigger plants this winter

118
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,918
you could probably do four to six in

119
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,079
here double the amount because they'll

120
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:38,839
only get they won't the size they won't

121
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,439
have the light even from seed even from

122
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:43,000
seed so a you could do one thing you

123
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:45,360
could go directly seed get your

124
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,720
seedlings started put them out here let

125
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,960
them in the natural light and your

126
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,800
seedlings will grow until they're up to

127
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,918
a little bit more maturity it'll be like

128
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,560
6 to 10 6 to 12 in depending on it Pudo

129
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,120
Auto and then yeah and then they flower

130
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,079
immediately they don't you're already in

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,800
that 12 12 so you don't have to add any

132
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:04,478
extra light or any of that stuff but if

133
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,240
you want them to be bigger and you

134
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,680
really want to want to do that then

135
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,519
adding the supplemental light but then

136
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,720
you got to deal with the cold too so

137
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,918
like autof flowers they don't like being

138
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,960
cold and they'll be really in La yeah

139
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,240
but we'll still be like 40 you know what

140
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,839
I mean for a couple you know in the

141
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,879
night and stuff like that I mean it'll

142
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:26,038
be 38 40 you know I mean Autos are more

143
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:27,918
prone to like stall out when they're

144
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:29,038
cold when their root systems are cold

145
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:30,719
they do better when they're nice and

146
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,519
warm they're be to be planted in the in

147
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,000
the ground or in in something big from

148
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,079
the start and they're able to shoot up

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,600
and use the warmth in the season you can

150
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,719
do Autos they're just not going to be as

151
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,520
as big right you know um some might do

152
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,280
okay depending on their lineage and

153
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:47,680
where they were put together but in

154
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:49,758
general a colder like root system is is

155
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,959
a slower Auto in a lot of cases they'll

156
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,919
usually go a lot you know I always

157
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:57,239
thinking the opposite appear to put the

158
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:59,439
Autos inside where they'll be warmer

159
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,759
doing yeah I mean that's yeah you throw

160
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,199
those goes under a lot of light right

161
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,120
you put an auto under 18 hours or 16

162
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,879
hours of light I just feel like it's a

163
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,360
waste of the light to use I mean he we

164
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:12,598
we we we have a we have a 2x4 tent in

165
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,319
there so I was like we put two plants in

166
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:17,639
there yeah and uh that's just two little

167
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:19,840
plants you know yeah what do you do with

168
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,639
Autos in Winter I mean is that just

169
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,399
that's what you got yeah you either like

170
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,840
usually autos for me if I'm going to run

171
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:27,478
a bunch of Autos I'll just run them in

172
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:28,918
my veg area during my regular veg stuff

173
00:06:27,478 --> 00:06:30,719
if you're running inside stuff and you

174
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:32,198
got veg so just like in the corner of

175
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,479
the veg area because they're getting the

176
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,038
veg light right taking up some space

177
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,839
there and you're getting budding plants

178
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:39,918
in the veg space you know what I mean so

179
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:44,839
that's kind of the way that I use Autos

180
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:47,598
or you plant them like late summer like

181
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:49,119
June you know June July from seed you

182
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:51,918
know what I mean August from seed and

183
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,918
that way by the time October and

184
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:58,159
November get here they're ready you know

185
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,439
is this ground soft like to where we can

186
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,360
like like just stick this in the ground

187
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:05,800
for a second just to kind of show

188
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,360
it all right so wait everyone come over

189
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,360
here for a second huddle up Tom you're

190
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,360
our official Clapper can we get a Tom

191
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:18,680
clap perfect excellent

192
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,360
clap yeah we can set it up over there

193
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,639
yeah just to show something you know I

194
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,879
mean if you want me to put it over on

195
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:24,120
there I mean we could put it over the

196
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,400
top of those plants well for the

197
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:31,240
purposes of the

198
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:33,719
demo soft is here yeah um what is how

199
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,160
high can you go as high as you really

200
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,479
want so I brought the extra Tom where's

201
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,439
the camera yeah I'll talk let me know

202
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,439
any go over there go over

203
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,639
there right

204
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,560
so theoretically you can

205
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,680
go small in the winter

206
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,519
time the smaller is more doable because

207
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,879
you're in the winter

208
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:01,240
right this mosquito

209
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:05,800
netting you can order in any size

210
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:08,680
almost from frakin any fabric store

211
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,759
Amazon what have you sometimes uh here

212
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,800
let me throw up a third one in the

213
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,439
middle just to make it nice and

214
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,439
perfect cuz we like

215
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:22,839
perfect they're cheap we have an extra

216
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:25,439
one of these lying around too that we

217
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:28,279
can use it's dark like it's sitting

218
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:31,560
right in there Laura had suggested would

219
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:34,799
definitely keep bugs out so basically

220
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,479
like our enemy are

221
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,679
moths

222
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,320
that show up late

223
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:44,919
evening and early

224
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,440
morning um they look for the scented

225
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:48,559
they like sweet plants but they like all

226
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,240
plants but they're looking for that

227
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:54,199
scent they love the buds they'll lay

228
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,200
their they'll lay their eggs right on

229
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,800
the little the little bud points you can

230
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,680
see them actually and I've got pictures

231
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:01,799
on my Instagram with like a little egg

232
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,439
on a little leaflet that the the dude

233
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,679
has left from the the morning before um

234
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,839
but ultimately a bunch will hatch from

235
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:11,919
their little egg

236
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,720
sack usually somewhere in the middle to

237
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,199
lower range of the plant and they always

238
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,278
make their way North you know what I

239
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,640
mean upward you know what I mean so when

240
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,039
you cut down your plants a lot of time

241
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,838
if you have Bud worms and you hang them

242
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,399
upside down you usually see the bud

243
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,720
worms up at the top you know hanging on

244
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,240
the stems looking for the top cuz

245
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,000
they're always trying to make their way

246
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,759
you know up uh they like to hang out

247
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,839
especially when they're really small

248
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,838
causing the most damage inside the bud

249
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,399
along the stem you actually have to peel

250
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,519
open the bud and kind of look at the

251
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:44,039
stem to see if it's any discoloration or

252
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,200
anything like that if you don't see

253
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:47,120
because early on you won't see the

254
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,920
droppings you know they're so small and

255
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,039
they're just getting started and they're

256
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:52,559
almost invisible to the naked eye if

257
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,879
you're not really looking for it you

258
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:58,479
know so if even one gets through are are

259
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:01,078
you done like because they because the

260
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,079
eggs contain so many so if you if you

261
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:04,759
catch so chances are right if you have

262
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:07,120
if you set up something like this and

263
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:09,240
you throw it over and I got pictures as

264
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,078
long as you don't have any holes in it

265
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,959
and it goes to the ground I usually

266
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:15,439
throw some dirt or a couple rocks on the

267
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,879
underside to hold it nice and tight and

268
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
pretty right you know what I mean so

269
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:22,200
it's nice and taut and as soon I grow

270
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,720
them without the I grow them without the

271
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,278
the net until they're right before they

272
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,839
go to bloom so you know how big to make

273
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:33,120
your Chambers properly you know

274
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:36,160
does this treatment plus the uh the what

275
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,159
is it BT yeah yes no you don't need so

276
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,480
so my whole thing is I don't ever spray

277
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,120
my flowers with anything period I don't

278
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,759
if I put two flowers on the table and I

279
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,120
told you that this one was sprayed and

280
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,519
this one was not you probably would

281
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,399
choose the one that wasn't sprayed with

282
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:52,600
something first in general right just as

283
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,799
a natural you know that's that's what we

284
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,519
want we don't want something that's been

285
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:58,199
sprayed or or or toxified in some way

286
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,399
some of those bacteria like BTS

287
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,200
technically I guess consider safe but

288
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,278
some of the bacterias like spinosad and

289
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,600
other things and BT for that for that

290
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:10,360
matter I don't know how much studies

291
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:12,480
going on with um smoking it so it's not

292
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,919
I would never I'm saying spray it up

293
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,800
during veg yeah during so during Veg

294
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:19,919
it's you're not even all so they're so

295
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:21,479
the the the budworms aren't even present

296
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,958
during veg for the most part they're not

297
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:28,039
showing up told you use it the second

298
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:29,679
you see any uh AES or any indication at

299
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:32,399
the earliest you're not allowed to use

300
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:34,719
it later on anyway yeah so so what I do

301
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,759
is I send all my plants into flower as

302
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,920
healthy as possible so before there's

303
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:41,799
any sign of of anything that grown up

304
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:44,799
you you can use BT you can use spinosad

305
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:46,359
you can use sulfur you can use a variety

306
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:48,078
of things oils different things will

307
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,079
suffocate eggs and stuff like that but

308
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:54,278
just have you heard so so Delano uh who

309
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:56,919
we did the soil fundraiser for he

310
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:58,720
mentioned uh corn starch like dilute it

311
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:00,958
in water and spray it on your plants cuz

312
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,720
they hate it and then he also talking

313
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:06,759
papra and cumin they so yeah I always

314
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,120
have people like uh use like cayenne

315
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:11,000
pepper or paprika or or those different

316
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,560
types of peppers and you can soak it in

317
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,278
the water and make a little you know

318
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:18,479
your preferred method is profac exactly

319
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:20,439
so the deal is is you you can spray

320
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,560
beforehand make sure they're healthy and

321
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,240
ready to rock and roll for Bloom but as

322
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:28,239
soon as they start going into bloom in

323
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,240
my world I'm done you're done I'm 100%

324
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,278
that

325
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,039
everyone is on that same so you so for

326
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:38,519

330
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:48,078
anybody to say like oh well I have I

331
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:49,799
have you know 10t 12T plants well so do

332
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,759
I I grow a lot of sativas mine are all

333
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:54,439
9ot 10t 12T as it is let's get a little

334
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:57,519
C coup you don't want anyone to think

335
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,680
you're only growing like exact exactly

336
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:02,278
you can go let's put this in a look at

337
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,000
it yeah I have I have I have three of

338
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:05,759
these across and kind of put together

339
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,078
with no here we got to jam it in cuz I

340
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,879
got dirt on there didn't want to go in

341
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:11,559
all the

342
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:14,000
way yeah basically Tom we we can cut to

343
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:16,159
size cut to size yep oh we love working

344
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,440
with p cut to size right there boom

345
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:20,278
you're walking in there don't we love

346
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,560
working with PVC right super

347
00:13:20,278 --> 00:13:24,639
easy you make you make sure you get the

348
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:27,000
bigger roll and you can go three four

349
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,480
five at at my place I've got five or six

350
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,839
deep right and you fill that puppy up

351
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,159
with your six and you you're touching

352
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,720
the ceiling and everything that the

353
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,719
trick with this so it's

354
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,519
downfall is so it doesn't have a lot of

355
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,759
downfalls okay number one it rips easy

356
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,959
that's a that's a problem you got to be

357
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:45,600
really careful when you're strapping it

358
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:47,759
down or moving it cuz it does teares you

359
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,159
don't want any tears but if you're in a

360
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,519
heavy fog

361
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:54,439
area this will collect moisture yeah and

362
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:56,000
and hold for you w't have the

363
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,240
caterpillars you just have the powder

364
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,720
you don't necessarily have the Milo per

365
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,440
se as long as it

366
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:03,680
like if like at my place right we have

367
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,720
lots of heavy fog live near the ocean

368
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:10,319
comes through during that September that

369
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,120
that late Bud finish it fills up with a

370
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,560
little bit of moisture but within an

371
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,000
hour or two as soon as that sun comes

372
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:18,638
down it's all gone and it has no problem

373
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,440
I have never had Bud rot or powdery

374
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,278
mildew because of the net caused ever

375
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,920
it's never caused me a problem the one

376
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:28,320
problem I had was when the buds grew up

377
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,439
and touched the net and then the net got

378
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,240
wet and that that area can get burned or

379
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,680
damaged but as long as you got plenty of

380
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,320
air and space it's no problem that's the

381
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:39,719
only thing that I wouldn't recommend it

382
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:44,278
if you're in a really wet or moist area

383
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:46,480
but Arizona Nevada SoCal noral uh any

384
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:48,958
Dyer so by the way just quickly you're

385
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,600
you're in Northern San Diego County yeah

386
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:52,439
okay I'm in avocado country over there

387
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,320
and you said a lot of your friends who

388
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,920
are growing at home this year saw

389
00:14:54,320 --> 00:15:00,278
caterpillar so at my place uh I mean I'm

390
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:02,599
sure everywhere kind P we have more

391
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:04,519
caterpillars that's like the top problem

392
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,040
okay okay so so budworms Tom you're not

393
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:09,159
alone budworms are the worst pest they

394
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,439
will decimate crops I've

395
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:13,600
lost countless amounts of pounds I've

396
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,759
thrown hundreds of pounds in the trash

397
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,199
over the years we're not just talking

398
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:19,159
weed figure what are the fruit other fru

399
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,198
and crops that you deal with so they're

400
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:22,679
less damaging to other things like they

401
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,399
chew up leaves and things but these

402
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:27,958
particular ones are are budworm like

403
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,639
like Seekers they seek this

404
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:32,159
particular that one that we want and

405
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,959
because it's such a delicate plant and

406
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,559
because they're inside on the stem as

407
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,559
soon as they start causing damage on the

408
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:40,039
inside that's when the rot starts to

409
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,000
happen it's not it's not because of

410
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:44,399
weather it's not because it's because of

411
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,399
the caterpillars causing damage that's

412
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,799
oxidizing stuff's getting messed up

413
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,240
they're pooping in there there's lots of

414
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:51,519
bacteria and it just starts rotting the

415
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,039
Bud from the inside out so the only way

416
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,240
to do it is to stop them from being able

417
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:58,039
to lay their eggs and I've got pictures

418
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,600
of Mo stuck up against the side here

419
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:02,078
trying to get through I can't get

420
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,360
through is this the desired size netting

421
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:07,638
and what is and is like if it was a open

422
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,278
if you had a window screen right okay

423
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,839
you could use stuff like this if you had

424
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:14,198
to I like using this it's lighter easier

425
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,199
to work with is there is it a size

426
00:16:14,198 --> 00:16:19,240
difference is how do you how do you uh

427
00:16:16,198 --> 00:16:21,399
so it's a mesh size so just Google

428
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,799
Google it's a it's a regular it's it's

429
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:24,039
mosquito netting is what you want to

430
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,599
Google you know what I mean you Google

431
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:28,278
mosquito netting you can order it uh or

432
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:31,040
fabric there's fabric meshes it like if

433
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:33,360
you go to a Joanne fck here's my

434
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:36,318
question about this is that do you have

435
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,159
like zero room for error this is a great

436
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:40,559
method prophylactic but you have zero

437
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:43,360
room for eror error in case like if one

438
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:47,399
moth gets in you're in big trouble no no

439
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,399
no so so um I've had one moth get

440
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,639
through a hole I've had a couple things

441
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,639
and you see him floating around on the

442
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,240
inside there like you little fuck you

443
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,000
know what I mean or what whatnot and

444
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,799
damage is so minimalized it's not even

445
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,600
funny and also there if there's if you

446
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,359
what I found is I netted too late a

447
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,360
couple times in years past right so like

448
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:08,159
I got them growing they started a bud

449
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,798
and like they had already had Ms laid on

450
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,439
them before I had netted I didn't

451
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:16,078
couldn't get the net in time and the

452
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:18,038
eggs hatched inside the inside the tent

453
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,720
or inside the little the little thing

454
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:23,679
but I think that like mating and

455
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,640
pollenization and things like that is is

456
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,319
is a factor and they didn't have enough

457
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,080
time to actually cause a problem because

458
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,279
it was before so I've never had a

459
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,480
problem even if one snuck through you

460
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:35,160
might have a section where you have a

461
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,960
little piece as long as you're but you

462
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,759
can the cool thing is you see it in the

463
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,319
morning or the next day and you can

464
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:42,240
catch them because they can't go away

465
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,359
you know what I mean but the idea is if

466
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,440
you don't have any

467
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:48,199
holes exactly like he there like next

468
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,600
season you're going to be hyper Vigilant

469
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,600
as soon as if you see if you see if you

470
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:55,719
see droppings you're too late your

471
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:58,079
season's done you're you're already so

472
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,839
far behind it's not even funny you know

473
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:03,480
so the the you have to stop it before

474
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:04,918
also also getting a dino light or a bug

475
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,679
zapper light one of those Dino lights

476
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,280
that zap different mods and things like

477
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:11,960
that you can get them anywhere we also

478
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,839
it was suggested that we get the uh that

479
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:18,079
special corn that had the BT the genetic

480
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:20,959
B corn and grow some of that the idea

481
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:24,240
was to as as grow up for them over

482
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:28,000
there to kill to kill the lure them yeah

483
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,798
a lure you know and Monsanto it's not so

484
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,880
doing that and not being able to cover

485
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:34,480
or would you'd still lose you would

some of their own cannabis too so once

648
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,798
they figure out that you know we're

649
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:50,798
friends on that on that regard then they

650
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:52,798
can usually get their you know garden

651
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:55,798
set up with some of my genetics so I

652
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:59,079
oversee those for yes yes well I don't

653
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:01,038
yeah so like I mean some I do so you

654
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:03,000
come in selling them your fruit tree

655
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,480
services and you walk out selling them

656
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,558
your your genetics well yeah in some

657
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,880
cases but it's but it's they get both

658
00:25:07,558 --> 00:25:11,798
because it's like it's it's a it's a

659
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,360
thing so like my fruit thing is um like

660
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:18,200
in the fruit world like I I mean I teach

661
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,278
everywhere I do all kinds of funny stuff

662
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,519
like I'm the fruit I'm the fruit guy

663
00:25:20,278 --> 00:25:23,640
dude like that my my license plate

664
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:27,519
doesn't save Mr trees for nothing

665
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,960
question not other props in Fr yeah I

666
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,158
know I know about all all kinds of stuff

667
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,278
I work my life nurs so you just

668
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:36,559
mentioned a specific Plum cultivar what

669
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:38,200
was it that's a Hollywood Plum yeah but

670
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:41,599
you it had like a number oh that's the

671
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:44,240
Tangerine the 88-2 so okay so the tan

672
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:47,678
like is that like who was that like Brad

673
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,759
at UC Davis and can you talk about like

674
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,798
what you've seen in Fruit breeding

675
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:54,640
versus like your experiences in cannabis

676
00:25:51,798 --> 00:25:57,038
breeding it's uh so like every year I

677
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,200
get a shipment of trees like a little

678
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:02,240
bundle of like test out or

679
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,159
something yeah exactly so like you get

680
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:09,038
Ghost apple or PLU Aries or like you

681
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:11,640
know neck yeah like the whole apricot

682
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,798
Peach well mostly apricot there's so

683
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,679
many at the farmers market there's

684
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:18,038
apriums too like all these new hybrid

685
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,559
fruits like apricot Plum crosses and

686
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:21,599
like these are pollen crosses so they're

687
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:24,798
not the explanation would that be like

688
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,000
if a dog in a person like had sex and

689
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:29,240
had

690
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
like make it into so like peaches Plum

691
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,240
apricots yeah nectarines they're all

692
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,038
part of the same family is this

693
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,159
commercial breeding or all just like

694
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:37,919
individuals doing it uh well in a

695
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,480
commercials the ones that I'm talking

696
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,159
about are commercial like there's a

697
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,558
there's a family like the um Dave Wilson

698
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,600
Nursery is a good thing it's like the

699
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:46,879
zigger family does a lot of things uh

700
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:48,959
there's a bunch of different families

701
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,080
that are commercial breeders that create

702
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,798
most of the modern fruit trees and grow

703
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:54,960
all the traditional fruit trees that

704
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,398
sell to all the nurseries around so all

705
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,200
every time you go to like a nursery to

706
00:26:56,398 --> 00:27:01,079
buy whatever you know all the fruit

707
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,080
fruit trees they stock there came from

708
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:06,398
you know what I mean Dave Wilson Nursery

709
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:08,879
or Ellie csy cre fruit hybrid will that

710
00:27:06,398 --> 00:27:10,479
make its way into the it does so the F

711
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,720
the difference between fruit hybrids and

712
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,679
cannabis hybrids is it takes like

713
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,798
somewhere between eight and 10 years

714
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:18,360
eight and 12 years to create a new fruit

715
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,038
variety to make sure that it's good it

716
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:22,519
takes you a long time CU basically

717
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:25,158
you're taking a you're taking a plum a

718
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:27,359
plum flour you know pollen and a peach

719
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:28,360
flour and you're going to take rub those

720
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:29,558
together and you're going to that

721
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:31,000
fruit's going to grow you're going to

722
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:32,918
plant the seed from that from that

723
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,519
mother plant you know fruit you're going

724
00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:36,480
to grow out a bunch of those and then

725
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:38,319
out of that you do the feno selection

726
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,120
which one turns out to be delicious

727
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,839
which one and this isn't all of the same

728
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:45,278
season you plant all the same how long

729
00:27:42,839 --> 00:27:49,359
does it take a plum tree to start fruit

730
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:52,319
in uh somewhere around you know five to

731
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:54,839
10 years depending on variety if they

732
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,639
grafted do they need to be aware of

733
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:59,480
whose uh seeds they're using or whatever

734
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,200
cuz they're treading on someone patented

735
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,120
so yeah they do a lot of the patenting

736
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,319
of their of their variety so they do a

737
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:07,479
lot of those own so all those like like

738
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:10,678
the neck the neck the plum or it's

739
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,839
highly IP they they start patting those

740
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:15,038
yeah um which is cool like one of my

741
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:18,038
favorite things is uh like the plue

742
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:19,720
Aries they're they're just they're to

743
00:28:18,038 --> 00:28:21,798
die for plums and blueberries plums and

744
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,200
cherries cherries so like it's like a

745
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:26,000
plum it's like a gigantic fraking Cherry

746
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,000
with like that cherry Crunch and like

747
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,038
that cherry texture with like the

748
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,640
plum complexity and juice and like all

749
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:35,240
that extra stuff the plum brings right

750
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,840
and they hold on the tree for a long

751
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,919
freaking time compared to all the other

752
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:40,879
stuff too and then can you breed that

753
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:42,600
slightly in the direction of one or the

754
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,840
other like if you're like I like this

755
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:46,319
it's a 50/50 but I'd love it if it were

756
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:48,678
like 80

757
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:50,278
Cherry so they so out of that seed lot

758
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:52,759
when they made that initial cross right

759
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,759
or whatever out of that seed lot there's

760
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:56,240
one that leans more this way there's one

761
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:57,640
that leans more this way and then there

762
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,720
are other varieties so there's like

763
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:03,240
candy heart plary there's like uh Sugar

764
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,000
Twist there's flavor punch there's all

765
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,679
these other varieties of plary and those

766
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,278
are just variations of in the grape

767
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:13,798
world my mind is blown by the cotton

768
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:16,159
candy grape it'sa my my daughter's just

769
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:17,480
and I'm like sitting there like this is

770
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,159
really fucking good and that's what they

771
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,720
do they come out with these new cool

772
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:22,440
varieties like the the cool grape that

773
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,159
I'm growing this year that's kind of new

774
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,919
is like the the finger grape they're

775
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,278
like these they look like little fingers

776
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,440
hang they're long and skinny you know

777
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:31,200
the lady fingers or fingerling or I

778
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,880
forget what they're called exactly but

779
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,120
uh the finger grapes are pretty cool um

780
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,679
but yeah so

781
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:41,278
like we all every one of those types of

782
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:43,679
trees has a certain growth requirement

783
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:46,200
certain amount of cold that it needs

784
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,880
every type of like a like a a fig tree

785
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,399
fruits on New Growth or Pimon fruits on

786
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,360
only the new stuff that's grown out that

787
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,558
year a peach fruits on last year's

788
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:56,038
growth you know and and that that second

789
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,079
year growth is where your fruit is and

790
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:59,359
like apples fruit on Spurs so you got

791
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:00,599
got to know which type of tree you're

792
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,398
dealing with and where the fruit

793
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:04,519
production is going to happen in order

794
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:06,278
to not screw up your season and like uh

795
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:07,519
cut off your you know your productivity

796
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:10,519
and stuff like that but it's like more

797
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,558
of a you know a lifelong thing it's

798
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:14,399
going to be you're in the game for so

799
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:17,240
it's interesting because it seems like

800
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:20,918
those fruits are much more microclimate

801
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:23,079
sensitive than like if I took your seeds

802
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:28,000
I could plant them in a bunch of micr

803
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:29,879
like Oregon Maine down here in LA

804
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,558
outdoor and it be like I'm going to

805
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,760
express myself differently but I will

806
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:37,879
still make it what's the hardiest

807
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:41,519
fruit oh that's tough man um does

808
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:45,519
cannabis count it's a fruit it's you

809
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:47,798
know lemons limes grapefruits right are

810
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,480
all pretty pretty tough those those

811
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:51,079
origin fruits you know Pelos you know

812
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,000
what I mean well but a lemon could grow

813
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:53,960
in New England so so do you mean Hardy

814
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,558
by

815
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,440
like or like their environment you know

816
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:01,960
what I mean yeah those like so whenever

817
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:04,519
I go investigate an orchard like say

818
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,600
somebody has a a house has an orchard on

819
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:10,319
the property the person dies the house

820
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,839
sits Barren for a few years you know

821
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:13,480
what I mean they turn off the water the

822
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,720
orchard it just kind of runs downhill

823
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,319
and then somebody buys the house right

824
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,639
then my phone rings you're like yo we

825
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:20,200
just bought this house it's got an

826
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:22,599
orchard here A bunch of the trees are

827
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,200
sick can you come help us you know the

828
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:25,759
trees are still alive they're just some

829
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,960
of them are some of them aren't when I

830
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:32,519
get to this place 90% of the time

831
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,960
the Bear's lime is alive like a low quat

832
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:35,880
is alive you know there are certain

833
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,519
trees that are always like you know

834
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,880
among it all they're like fuck and

835
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,599
they're not happy they're like the

836
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,880
microbes that can go does that mean

837
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:46,558
fruit trees don't survive unless they're

838
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:47,919
cared for most of them don't really uh I

839
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:49,558
mean unless they're a wild fruit tree

840
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,120
but most of our modern varieties they're

841
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:52,759
going to need you know they're going to

842
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,119
need water they're going to need you

843
00:31:52,759 --> 00:31:57,319
know the appropriate amount of cold or

844
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:59,239
chuah yeah we've been we've been you

845
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:01,439
know these are these are cultivated

846
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,399
fruits they're not they domesticated

847
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,679
yeah they're very domesticated so I mean

848
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:07,518
you can plant things and not do a lot to

849
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,519
them and that's what my whole trip is is

850
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:12,278
like set it up so that it is a natural

851
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,359
natural system so that all you have to

852
00:32:12,278 --> 00:32:15,679
do is just kind of be that that shadow

853
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:17,398
kind of watching out and do a couple

854
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,200
things here there what are some of the

855
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:23,839
thing like on those properties you're

856
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:26,000
like okay I can save about 40% of these

857
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:28,079
trees what are you doing now like are

858
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,240
you just literally being like let's turn

859
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,119
the the irrigation system back on but

860
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,919
like yeah pretty much what are some

861
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:36,479
other things that you're typically doing

862
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:39,799
like so yeah so we we look at like the

863
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,639
conditions like is it are they desolate

864
00:32:39,798 --> 00:32:44,720
desert conditions you know what are the

865
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:46,119
soil temperatures like what uh how do

866
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,240
they even have water there is it

867
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:49,719
completely broken uh how hard is it

868
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,038
going to be to remediate but basically

869
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,798
essentially it's get a bunch of crap

870
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:55,960
that's going to cover your ground put

871
00:32:53,798 --> 00:32:57,839
some clothes over your skin you know

872
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,798
some sort of debris some mulch some

873
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:01,599
plants some forest floor I call it the

874
00:32:59,798 --> 00:33:03,558
forest floor let's get a forest floor

875
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:06,240
going and then we need to turn the

876
00:33:03,558 --> 00:33:08,240
irrigation on and I usually you know I

877
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,880
usually recommend like you know a

878
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,000
topical spray type irrigation or some

879
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,639
sprayers of some sort so that we we

880
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,240
complete the circle of life like rain

881
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:19,638
falls from the sky hits the surface like

882
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,159
drip emitters or or like a like a

883
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:24,918
sprinkler sprink yeah like sprinklers

884
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,240
are my my so so during the drought and

885
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:27,919
like the crisis and all these things

886
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,038
like we all these commercial Orchards

887
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,960
all these people shifted to drip right

888
00:33:30,038 --> 00:33:33,440
and they have these little drip rings

889
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,200
and stuff that go to tree rings or

890
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,919
whatever I call those tree Killers you

891
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,679
know what I mean

892
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:41,080
so in a perfect world like I have my my

893
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,519
thermometer and we can do a test and

894
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:44,960
I'll show you when you when you shoot

895
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:46,638
the ground right like number one in

896
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,558
nature where plants grow on their own

897
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:51,398
and we're not you know you'll always see

898
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:53,000
a forest floor or a covering you know

899
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:55,000
some sort of Duff that that regulates

900
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,638
the temperature the moisture levels all

901
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,880
those things the nutritional the the

902
00:33:56,638 --> 00:34:00,038
life levels all those things are

903
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,320
regulated by this Forest material of

904
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:04,960
accumulation of stuff so when we have it

905
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:06,398
all cleaned out like this or we have

906
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,440
that stuff and we're just using a drip

907
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:10,878
emitter right next to that drip emitter

908
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,358
it's dripping and it's watering next to

909
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:15,679
there it's not as wet or it's dry next

910
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:17,878
to it's skips places and then beyond it

911
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,159
and in between it you're skipping places

912
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:21,519
where the water isn't evenly kind of

913
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,000
coating and you think about like a

914
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:25,519
rainstorm right she rains everything

915
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,039
gets wet for the most part you know what

916
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,440
I mean it's raining where the tree is

917
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:32,320
where the tree is not not and Beyond and

918
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,760
and Beyond and that is that's the trick

919
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,240
in order to kind of flush out the

920
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,200
contaminants that have been collected on

921
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:40,398
the surface push down the the

922
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,960
fertilizers or animal poop hydrate that

923
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:44,598
stuff to keep that first layer you know

924
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,878
evenly moist so that when you scratch in

925
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:50,879
the soil here it's moist and 75° and you

926
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:52,398
scratch over here it's moist and 75° but

927
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:55,239
when it's uncovered the temperatures

928
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:58,679
fluctuate so drastically from like 60 to

929
00:34:55,239 --> 00:35:00,759
like 140 60 to 140 nothing wants to live

930
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:03,719
there nothing wants to live without that

931
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:07,040
AC or that irregularity and then there's

932
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:08,399
no nutritional elements or homes or

933
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,400
anything like that on the surface of the

934
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,720
soil to protect any of those things that

935
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,119
would be you know wanting to live there

936
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:16,480
which the plants need to get their

937
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:17,480
nutrition to cycle nutrients to kind of

938
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,079
keep them together because they can't

939
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,119
freaking move so they need as many

940
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:23,599
friends and family as they can you know

941
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,800
what I mean around them as best possible

942
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,720
to bringing the party to his house that

943
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,079
I that that was always my power move is

944
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:31,439
like why don't I just have everybody

945
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,440
come to my house and then I don't have

946
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,838
to move I get to see all my friends and

947
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,960
Y and you're just and you just you know

948
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:38,320
and that's a plants world you know

949
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,880
you're just trying to accumulate as many

950
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,880
cats over here that can help you out and

951
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,280
do different things and the only way

952
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:46,599
that's going to happen is if the soil

953
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,519
temperatures don't jump around like an

954
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:51,960
sob and there's material there that's

955
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:54,000
going to keep it moist and even and

956
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,880
there's food for fungi and you know that

957
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,079
carbon is returned so should we send Tom

958
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,119
out there with the thermometer to yeah

959
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,960
we can we can test we can test all of

960
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:06,800
that we can play around but you know um

961
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:09,039
Tom in a couple months you'll be wearing

962
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,119
some sort of like Tom will have his tool

963
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:14,519
belt yeah man walk around brother his

964
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:18,039
tools of the trade ready to I mean these

965
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:21,039
are these are soil Pro it's my

966
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:23,199
my it tells me you know inches and

967
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,920
shovels I can take you know dep what

968
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:29,000
about like other pasts like to also like

969
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,680
keep an eye out for you know pasts and

970
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,960
worms that you might not and obviously

971
00:36:30,679 --> 00:36:35,799
there's a point where like we had I had

972
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,599
several very hungry praying mantises but

973
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,800
they didn't do their

974
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,800
job some will not let it go he will not

975
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,560
forgive the praying man I'm okay I'm

976
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:49,119
okay they were Ming things I'm I'm okay

977
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:51,159
with like beneficial Predators more so

978
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,880
like indoors I'll rely on them more so

979
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:55,440
on an indoor environment like I'll rely

980
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,599
on you more indoors right I want you to

981
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,440
be here in the outdoor environment to

982
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,880
help out on whatever I'm missing but

983
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:03,159
there's no way to rely on that like when

984
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,800
people say order you know tro or

985
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:06,318
whatever the WASP is that gets the worms

986
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,760
and stuff I me for outdoor I mean unless

987
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:11,239
you're that was my question Fly Away F

988
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,000
away that's what I my question is like

989
00:37:11,239 --> 00:37:14,838
some might and it might do some good and

990
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,920
I'm not saying it won't but if you had a

991
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:19,440
place to like trap them in a greenhouse

992
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:21,119
or or even just the even something along

993
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,039
those lines you're going be unstoppable

994
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,800
you kind of ensure that you don't have

995
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:28,639
any of those let me ask you do you ever

996
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,920
do that do you ever like toss a was I so

997
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,759
so like I'll throw a Praying Manis or

998
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:36,119
two in I catch them at my house all the

999
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:38,200
time got if like early early in veg if I

1000
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,920
have a a greenhouse or a tent set up

1001
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:42,439
I'll throw some ladybugs in there you

1002
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,720
know what I mean and it's not for like a

1003
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,358
guarantee it's just to increase the my

1004
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:48,919
my my help when I'm not my eyes aren't

1005
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:50,559
on the game and like I said I'm not

1006
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:53,480
going to rely on that when it comes but

1007
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:55,480
I I like I like using I like using oil

1008
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:59,719
sprays like there's like different you

1009
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:02,358
know doctor neem doct makes an oil where

1010
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:04,639
it's like peppermint and Thyme and you

1011
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:06,239
know Rosemary and clove and it's like

1012
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:08,519
this little assortment that works pretty

1013
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:09,719
good and that actually messes with cells

1014
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,480
that's what I'm wondering there's got to

1015
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:13,959
be some homemade something that like

1016
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:15,358
with a Pepper or something any harm but

1017
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,119
they don't like it sulfur does

1018
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,318
everything like if I ever have like a

1019
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,318
problem like if I have thrips thrips and

1020
00:38:19,318 --> 00:38:23,119
budworms are my two biggest enemies

1021
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:24,880
right thrips are my enemies indoors

1022
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,880
budworms are my enemies Outdoors you

1023
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,559
know for the most part I don't really

1024
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,119
care so much about the the thrips

1025
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:30,679
Outdoors cuz my plants are growing so

1026
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,358
healthfully and everything's doing fine

1027
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:35,039
it's not the end of the world but

1028
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:37,159
indoors it can make things you know

1029
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:38,440
pissed off so like sulfur is one of my

1030
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:40,879
favorite things and you can just use

1031
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,119
sulfur and it's tough and it's not the

1032
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,800
funnest to mix but it works really good

1033
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:46,880
and as long as you're using it in Tom

1034
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,720
show them your sprayer you're good to go

1035
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,559
but sulfur oil you know spin aad is fine

1036
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:54,318
I know that spin aan when you if you

1037
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:55,880
ever use it in flower and stuff I know

1038
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:57,920
that it's it's Pro I think it's on the

1039
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,358
band list for California still and and

1040
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,920
it's because it comes we've all already

1041
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:02,679
agreed we're not spraying anything

1042
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,519
during flour you know but yeah that's

1043
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:07,318
the thing but you can use spin aad not

1044
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:10,199
in flour and it's a bacteria that kills

1045
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:11,519
thrips mites worms aluan insects and

1046
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:13,118
things like that so if you use it

1047
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,800
appropriately I think that that one is

1048
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,599
okay uh in oh sorry Tom I wanted to

1049
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,640
where's your little thing of worms I

1050
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,039
mean you just want to like like I said

1051
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:22,440
you just want to make sure that you're

1052
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:24,719
you're you're clean and if you just did

1053
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,400
like a once a week oil spray you know

1054
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:27,879
and then you change it maybe once a week

1055
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,000
you did oil once a week could did some

1056
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,079
soap and then once a week you could keep

1057
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,239
everybody kind of at Bay for the most

1058
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,079
part you can make garlic sprays you can

1059
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:37,559
make pepper sprays you can do stuff like

1060
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,560
that but none of that is going to stop

1061
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:43,639
that Tom I like your collection

1062
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:47,960
ofs yeah all right so so these are the

1063
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:51,400

1065
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,240

00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,000

1067
00:39:55,239 --> 00:40:01,118

1069
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:05,440
so many different mods and so many

1070
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:07,318
varieties this one's darker and they all

1071
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,480
well depending on what they eat

1072
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:10,719
depending on what they eat they'll be

1073
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,280
different colors W that's much darker

1074
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:14,118
you know they can be different colors

1075
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,800
just by what they're you how they're

1076
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:17,280
cycling or where they're involved what

Nets and I kind of you know I didn't

1102
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,720
really push for him to put up the Nets

1103
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:29,078
cuz you won't really know unless you you

give him a learning experience I didn't

1106
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:33,719
want to be like a dick but I didn't want

1107
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,559
to be like you know like you have to do

1108

1110
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:42,759

1111
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,000

1113
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,400
what we do I told ready to listen and he

1114
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,760

1115
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,599
Chambers man and he like put these and

1116
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:56,040

1117
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,359
just just arms are just dangling in

1118
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:59,920

1119
00:41:58,358 --> 00:42:00,880
with anything you know what I mean he's

1120
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,240
like sitting there he's like I don't

1121
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:04,559

1122
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:06,919
stuff and he had nothing last year he

1123
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:09,159
was completely without spending money

1124
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,000
and it was all because of that $20 net

1125
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:13,639
you know what I mean like all because of

1126
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,119
that Tom's emotions have gone like from

1127
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:18,440
the highest highs to lowest lows so Tom

1128
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:22,838
next year when you have those 15 foot

1129
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:24,559
tall plants with massive Thor dude yes I

1130
00:42:22,838 --> 00:42:27,719
promise you I'm not even bullshitting

1131
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:30,119
like it's been over

1132
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:31,639
you will appreciate it had we done it

1133
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:33,000
this year you wouldn't have appreciated

1134
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:34,639
it as much that's what I mean you have

1135
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,280
to go through it man you really have to

1136
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,679
get kicked in the freaking gut dude well

1137
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,480
I did everybody has to I have a feeling

1138
00:42:38,679 --> 00:42:42,960
I have a funny feeling that even if we

1139
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,880
had gotten our IPM guy here when we

1140
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,358
wanted to he wouldn't have done that no

1141
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,318
it might have even been too late yeah

1142
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:50,639
because I have a funny feeling that we

1143
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:52,719
you know I was in as soon as you start

1144
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,598
seeing Palm Pals and and hair start

1145
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:57,199
getting thrown that's when I put up the

1146
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:58,920
net that's right I mean even maybe even

1147
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:00,318
a week before that you know what I'm

1148
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,519
saying you know so that you're a little

1149
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:04,838
bit more proactive but they usually

1150
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:09,358
don't seek out those little tiny pom

1151
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:12,039
poms they wait for you to get something

1152
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:14,239
sub for yourself you don't go like okay

1153
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:16,199
week nine they go up you do it by

1154
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:18,399
observation observation and I never put

1155
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:20,639
them up before I'm ready to go into

1156
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,760
flower because I've put them up before

1157
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:24,400
early and then they grow into the thing

1158
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,040
and then like trying to redo it you

1159
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,559
couldn't get the net in time for the

1160
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:29,519
right size you know you're like oh shit

1161
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:30,839
I need six more feet and you're like

1162
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:32,358
then you can't get it you know what I

1163
00:43:30,838 --> 00:43:33,920
mean and then you're missing time and

1164
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:37,400
things are messed up and then you you

1165
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:40,400
lose so if you if you wait until like

1166
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:43,559
it's like get that to do like a

1167
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,838
TW Vegas you know to just for a few days

1168
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:50,440
just really just overnight to shoot this

1169
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:52,199
indoor living soil grow in parump really

1170
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:55,480
beautiful I was

1171
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:57,399
there Steve Kell's place and in fact you

1172
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:00,719
were mentioning this if you look and he

1173
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,960
uses these pots he has this beautiful uh

1174
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:05,159
underbrush for the entire length of it

1175
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,159
it's total consistency even though it's

1176
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:09,159
inside with the lights just what you're

1177
00:44:07,159 --> 00:44:11,318
talking about I we have to look at it

1178
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:13,118
again to see exactly what that plant is

1179
00:44:11,318 --> 00:44:14,599
but it's yeah no I yeah anything that

1180
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:16,760
covers I don't care if it's if it's

1181
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:19,400
living or if it's a

1182
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:21,920
car yeah getting getting back to the

1183
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,240
fruit trees so so when you all right you

1184
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,760
you like start Reviving but then you

1185
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,519
want to bring in that cover layer what

1186
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,520
are you bringing in for like someone's 2

1187
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:33,280
acre property that yeah so it depends on

1188
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:35,519
their budget like what do you want to do

1189
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,280
is this property like surrounded by big

1190
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,880
ass trees that we can use bud were not

1191
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,599
an issue what would you want to bring in

1192
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,318
bring in a few truckloads of some sort

1193
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,920
of bark chips that are good quality you

1194
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:48,480
know bark chip mulch mulch is a touchy

1195
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,400
word cuz sometimes like mulch is like

1196
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,838
half compost half bark or there it's

1197
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,838
like a yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's

1198
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:57,039
like more people get offended I just

1199
00:44:54,838 --> 00:44:59,119
want I just want some chunks I want some

1200
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:02,318
I want I want a variety of particle

1201
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,680
sizes just a chopped up tree of the Bark

1202
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:06,599
for the carbon source and I want the

1203
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:08,598
bark that's what I want I want that

1204
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:12,240
actual carbon that that bark and that

1205
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:14,519
shredded material to actually last a

1206
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:16,598
long time create I thought the but I

1207
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:18,838
thought the bark doesn't absorb water

1208
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:20,519
like the wood on the inside it will over

1209
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:23,000
a period of time once once you walk

1210
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:24,719
through like so if you had like a nice

1211
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,519
little bark layer of something that was

1212
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:29,239
a couple inches thick and you're

1213
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:30,440
watering it topically you know the first

1214
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:31,598
thing we always do when we put out Bark

1215
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,880
I always tell people go out there and

1216
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,318
really overhydrate the area like so that

1217
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:38,039
we can saturate the bark really well so

1218
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:40,358
that the bark can kind of absorb as much

1219
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:41,838
water as it can and then it really start

1220
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:44,119
releasing into the ground and then once

1221
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:47,239
you do that like we start the regulation

1222
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:49,160
train down the hill because it's covered

1223
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:50,759
properly it's not fluctuating in

1224
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:52,358
temperature it's everything's kind of

1225
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,680
starting to work work where it is and

1226
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:55,558
the water's actually getting through the

1227
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:57,399
bark and into the into the soil air so

1228
00:45:55,559 --> 00:45:59,839
you start really rejuvenating does the

1229
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:03,760
bark take longer to decom uh to

1230
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:05,279
decompose than uh like the inner wood uh

1231
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,440
yeah I mean that's what I would that

1232
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,640
yeah I mean it takes I mean there's a

1233
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,720
there's that sheath and it takes a

1234
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,199
little bit of time and you can use the

1235
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:11,679
innerwood you can use the outerwood and

1236
00:46:10,199 --> 00:46:14,399
there's no magic thing like I wouldn't

1237
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:16,159
say bu this one particular bark I would

1238
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,559
actually prefer a multitude of different

1239
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:20,399
things like ask you wouldn't just want

1240
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:22,440
the bark you'd also want some in

1241
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,680
innerwood pie yeah innerwood and i' want

1242
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,480
leaves and I'd want some twigs and I'd

1243
00:46:24,679 --> 00:46:28,440
want some some different things like

1244
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,280
that that were so pretty much everything

1245
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,358
you would find on a forest floor exactly

1246
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,880
that's why I take the forest floor and

1247
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:36,639
pretty much we want to create a freaking

1248
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:38,119
forest floor and and and if you and I

1249
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:40,000
always tell people too like if if you

1250
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:41,480
have a tree like here and then like six

1251
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,199
or eight feet away from it you have

1252
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,838
another tree right I tried to tell

1253
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:47,558
people to stop treating the trees as

1254
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:49,519
they're individuals and start watering

1255
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:51,079
that entire space like it's one living

1256
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:52,679
thing like care for the soil like it's

1257
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:55,318
one living thing and if you have a

1258
00:46:52,679 --> 00:46:57,759
problem watering where there's no plants

1259
00:46:55,318 --> 00:46:59,719
or no trees put a plant there so that

1260
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,440
you are forced to water this area so

1261
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:04,480
that you keep that even moisture and

1262
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:06,159
temperature level consistent so that

1263
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,519
over time your soil actually becomes

1264
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:10,679
alive and then once it becomes alive

1265
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:12,400
you're stocked with dead bodies and

1266
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:14,799
moisture and all of a sudden it's

1267
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,559
holding water water is traveling farther

1268
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,440
it's absorbing more like a sponge and

1269
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:19,760
you're using less you can back off on

1270
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:23,159
your water when you make your soil

1271
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,960
actually a living thing instead of alive

1272
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:28,199
Dead Alive dead and you lose

1273
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,639
communication you lose all these

1274
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:31,838
different benefits that you can have so

1275
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:34,679
it's like retraining people to care for

1276
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:36,078
the ground first and then whatever trees

1277
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:38,000
we we have and whatever trees we're

1278
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,200
going to put in are going to jump out of

1279
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,318
their skin because they're going to be

1280
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:44,480
able to to fall right into a good place

1281
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:46,639
where they want to be and then also

1282
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,318
planting new trees planting them high

1283
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:49,920
instead of planting them down in pits

1284
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:52,639
you know for the most part I mean that's

1285
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,400
I'm a big I'm a big believer and pl it

1286
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:55,838
high and it will and it will Thrive and

1287
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,880
plant it low it won't grow and if you

1288
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:58,199
look at any like tree that's it's

1289
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,400
growing 100t in the air and we can go

1290
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:00,639
out there to that front tree I didn't

1291
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,559
see any of those trees out there but

1292
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:03,679
they're big giant trees we can look

1293
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,079
right where they meet the ground and

1294
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:07,919
you'll see two things one it'll be up on

1295
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,839
a little bit of a mound kind of just

1296
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,358
slightly up in a mound and two as soon

1297
00:48:09,838 --> 00:48:13,519
as the trunk hits the ground you'll see

1298
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:14,880
the main root crown of the soil right at

1299
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:16,880
the surface of the soil it'll be busting

1300
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,119
up the sidewalk it'll be right there at

1301
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,559
the surface right where the trunk meets

1302
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:21,440
the ground and a lot of people will

1303
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:24,040
plant a tree too deeply to where you'll

1304
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:27,119
have to scratch next to the trunk of the

1305
00:48:24,039 --> 00:48:29,400
tree for a couple inches before you can

1306
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:30,920
find that main root hand and you got a

1307
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,440
couple inches of bark that's under the

1308
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,680
ground or under the mulch and then that

1309
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,480
bark becomes soft and you start rotten

1310
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:38,480
out that cambium and all kinds of

1311
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,679
problems start right cuz the bark itself

1312
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,358
isn't supposed to be under the ground

1313
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,719
that way the root system is but once you

1314
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:46,239
start you're like a slow strangle slow

1315
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:47,919
kill and it can take years it can take

1316
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:50,199
months but you're You're really hurting

1317
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,760
your tree uh on on that level so a lot

1318
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:53,358
of people dig them in these big pits

1319
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,319
well so if you were on a property

1320
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:57,400
wanting to plant a new tree you'd build

1321
00:48:55,318 --> 00:48:59,079
an area up a little bit a little bit I

1322
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,318
just wouldn't dig as deep of a hole is

1323
00:48:59,079 --> 00:49:03,480
what I would do so I would dig a I would

1324
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:05,480
however big the plant it root ball that

1325
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,639
I was planting I would dig it a little

1326
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:10,119
bit more like an inch or two more

1327
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:12,480
shallow and I would dig it a lot wider

1328
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:14,519
so width is more important than depth

1329
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,480
but like you're happy with that plant

1330
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:18,639
it's better off there than than another

1331
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,000
way that the one thing that I would do

1332
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:21,440
like on like one of those instead of

1333
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,440
just having a mound where the water and

1334
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,599
everything can just run off in a way

1335
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,318
like you plant it up on on a on a little

1336
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:30,000
crown and then three to four feet from

1337
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:31,558
the trunk of the tree I kind of build a

1338
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,440
little bit of a basin or a little bit of

1339
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:35,960
a BM just to kind of focus a little bit

1340
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,880
of that water at a young age so that

1341
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,440
when it's a young plant you catch in

1342
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,200
that water and it's not running away you

1343
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,000
got a little bit of a burm but it's

1344
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:44,639
actually sitting in a little island like

1345
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,199
in that BM and you can fill they did

1346
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:49,920
that they I didn't put that in actually

1347
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:52,199
um uh uh a gardener did not the regular

1348
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,000
Gardener but a guy who who knows trees

1349
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:57,399
the landlord over and there was like a

1350
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
little M and over time it'll wear down

1351
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,680
and that's fine after it's done that

1352
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,480
because Focus your water in here so it's

1353
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:05,239
going down and yeah yeah yeah as long as

1354
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:07,000
it's not a pit you know a lot of things

1355
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:08,318
and and that's perfect when you're up on

1356
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,318
the crown like that that's perfect but

1357
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:12,039
like I said every time you see a tree

1358
00:50:10,318 --> 00:50:14,199
that's like out out front there that's

1359
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:16,798
doing really well at any park at any

1360
00:50:14,199 --> 00:50:19,759
place you'll take notice like you'll

1361
00:50:16,798 --> 00:50:21,679
notice that those two things for sure

1362
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:24,319
and then that third thing is the cover

1363
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:26,318
on the ground is it in a forest lore

1364
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:28,358
situation is there a lawn there's some

1365
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:31,119
sort of regulation of the temperature or

1366
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:32,358
it's extremely thick and was allowed to

1367
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,079
get that way cuz there once was

1368
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:35,880
something under it and then that canopy

1369
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,960
is now shaved that soil so it's okay

1370
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,318
there and then they're able to kind of

1371
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,798
get away with murder you know what I

1372
00:50:38,318 --> 00:50:41,558
mean but that's like that's how that

1373
00:50:39,798 --> 00:50:43,318
gets to that point but it's really

1374
00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:45,599
important like just planting your trees

1375
00:50:43,318 --> 00:50:48,279
at the right level and then actually

1376
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,119
caring for the environment around them

1377
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:52,559
as opposed to them per se you know what

1378
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:53,798
I mean first then you'll have a lot more

1379
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,160
success and they'll start doing things

1380
00:50:53,798 --> 00:50:56,159
then you got to learn about your tree

1381
00:50:55,159 --> 00:50:57,879
then you got to figure out what the hell

1382
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:59,679
kind of tree is is when you should when

1383
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,280
you when should you prune it you know

1384
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:02,480
what what's going to pick on it you know

1385
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,400
stuff like that but if you've got a

1386
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,079
healthy environment and you've got cover

1387
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,119
and it's even temperatures aren't

1388
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:11,318
fluctuating around all of a sudden

1389
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,440
you've got organisms and micro rolin and

1390
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:15,719
all kinds of things that are protecting

1391
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,519
that tree actually sitting on the roots

1392
00:51:15,719 --> 00:51:19,959
around the rizosphere things like that

1393
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:21,639
defending you know pathogens because

1394
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,960
they're able to and they have those

1395
00:51:21,639 --> 00:51:25,679
things and then you have a whole system

1396
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,760
of you know microbes that are on the

1397
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:29,598
surface of the soil taking up space so

1398
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,680
that when that powdery mildew Spore

1399
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:33,440
shows up or whatever shows up it's

1400
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:34,960
consumed by the other organisms around

1401
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,400
it or it's not allowed to take Pur

1402
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:38,199
There's No Vacancy and no sugars for

1403
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,599
them it's like the shitty new surfer

1404
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:42,480
trying to show up in a spot and all thef

1405
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:44,480
water like too many stuff like no bro

1406
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:48,798
There's No Vacancy and it it's harder

1407
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:50,880
for it to do so plus by having like a

1408
00:51:48,798 --> 00:51:52,880
microbial relationship and having all

1409
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,000
those parameters set just in the soil

1410
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,240
level all of a sudden the plant's

1411
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,599
getting the nutrients that needs at the

1412
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,399
right levels that it needs by the right

1413
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:03,200
organisms feeding it instead of us

1414
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,880
trying to kind of cut through the system

1415
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:07,279
and then the cell walls of those cells

1416
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:10,838
that build that fraking plant are harder

1417
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:12,319
stronger and you know almost impen to to

1418
00:52:10,838 --> 00:52:14,440
insects and things like that plus it's

1419
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:16,199
cycling the sap so it's not having an

1420
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,720
overabundance in nitrogen which is

1421
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:19,838
causing the sap suckers there's a

1422
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:22,000
million things that that'll just like

1423
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:26,000
can talk about that a little bit like

1424
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:28,159
the sap going through the plants what do

1425
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,358
you call it like a not a vascular system

1426
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:32,480
but a it's uh what do you call that

1427
00:52:30,358 --> 00:52:36,440
system they call them sap test basically

1428
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:38,280
so it's like a the xylm the cambium the

1429
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,720
flum all those all that stuff like that

1430
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:43,400
is is is just their vascular system of

1431
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:44,838
of the plant itself but so vascular

1432
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,920
would be the correct word to use yeah

1433
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:47,920
that's what I would that's what I would

1434
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,559
use I mean that's what I was struggling

1435
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,159
for vascular I know we have a vascular

1436
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,640
try to relate things as much to us as

1437
00:52:53,159 --> 00:52:57,639
possible so that we can kind of

1438
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:59,598
understand it cuz we are all the same

1439
00:52:57,639 --> 00:53:01,759
system the only difference between their

1440
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,160
their their chlorophyll and our blood is

1441
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,599
the molecule iron and nitrogen you know

1442
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:07,279
what I mean so they're we're these are

1443
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:09,119
our brothers you know what I mean really

1444
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,359
we're all doing the same thing have the

1445
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,000
same functions have the same goals just

1446
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:14,719
in a slightly different you know

1447
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,960
slightly different things and they

1448
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:20,039
protect us too don't they you often yeah

1449
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:22,519
yeah wait they're what protect us yeah I

1450
00:53:20,039 --> 00:53:24,558
mean without it so it's like the sap

1451
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:26,159
tests like they do these sap tests

1452
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,079
commercially like you can test the sap

1453
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:30,679
flow and things at different points in

1454
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:33,359
the plant and it will tell you the

1455
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:35,399
amount of nitrogen there's nitrate

1456
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:38,078
nitrogen ammonal nitrogen different

1457
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:40,519
things like that uh and sugars and these

1458
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:43,318
other things and plants that are overfed

1459
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:45,159
especially like chemical fertilizers or

1460
00:53:43,318 --> 00:53:47,798
there's an abundance of nitrogen in the

1461
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:49,639
in the system they can't metabolize it

1462
00:53:47,798 --> 00:53:51,480
quick enough so they start storing stuff

1463
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:54,358
into their sap which makes their sap

1464
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:55,960
really rich and really delectable to all

1465
00:53:54,358 --> 00:53:58,639
kinds of sap sucking insects so you've

1466
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:00,199
got scale and aphids and mites and all

1467
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:02,318
those things start coming to that plant

1468
00:54:00,199 --> 00:54:05,039
because it's it's it's over it's

1469
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:07,358
overabundant in these in these nitrogen

1470
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:08,920
and sugars that that are in this plant

1471
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:11,119
but that's why isn't that why cannabis

1472
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,880
Farmers like pump the nitrogen it level

1473
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,838
it because they want that sap but they

1474
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,200
want to find that balance you know so

1475
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:18,519
that's yeah I think that's where they go

1476
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:21,199
wrong honestly I think that that's where

1477
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:23,679
you go wrong as a as as any farmer not

1478
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:26,078
just a cannabis farmer is pumping it too

1479
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:27,480
hard because if you look at any natural

1480
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:30,400
system and the way that plants are

1481
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:34,559
eating normally they're not fed large

1482
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:37,240
amounts in short periods of time FR it's

1483
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:39,000
little fattening up a calf or something

1484
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:40,798
it is different it is different but then

1485
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,000
with fattening up the calf you comes

1486
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:45,000
other problems like can like certain

1487
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,400
chickens you they can't get up cuz their

1488
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,639
breasts are too big or like there's

1489
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:51,200
different things you'll you'll cost

1490
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:52,920
Yourself by doing it in that in that

1491
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:55,039
regard you know um like any of those

1492
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,798
flowers right there never had any type

1493
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:59,798
of fertilizer on it it was planted in in

1494
00:54:57,798 --> 00:55:03,920
the food forest floor there was some

1495
00:54:59,798 --> 00:55:06,199
compost initially put out uh that's

1496
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,960
pretty much it it got water uh to the

1497
00:55:06,199 --> 00:55:09,919
end you know what I mean and I'm and

1498
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:12,880
there's donkey dicks and junk you're

1499
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:15,039
making you're not making teas not no not

1500
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,798
really sometimes sometimes we'll do like

1501
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:20,400
a little bit of calcium like a little

1502
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:22,599
calcium supp I make uh WCA out of

1503
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,280
eggshells which is like Korean natural

1504
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:25,680
farming calcium it's just plant

1505
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,200
available calcium with eggshells and

1506
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:29,440
vinegar I was going to say you put it in

1507
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:30,919
vinegar and vinegar yeah for a couple

1508
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:32,519
days you you you cook up the the

1509
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:35,400
eggshells and you brown them and then

1510
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:38,239
you mix it with vinegar at like a 1 to

1511
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:41,480
10 ratio and then Bubbles and then what

1512
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:43,479
eventually are are you then sifting out

1513
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:45,920
solid material or you you don't want to

1514
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,199
pour the vinegar on I I yeah you sift it

1515
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,000
out you pour it into a little strainer

1516
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:51,318
or whatever you keep the liquid that's

1517
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,119
your that's your calcium stuff and then

1518
00:55:51,318 --> 00:55:54,798
the the eggshells always just go into

1519
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,599
the compost pow into the garden sorry

1520
00:55:54,798 --> 00:55:59,639
but the liquid is like mostly vinegar

1521
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,000
it's pretty much vinegar but it has

1522
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:04,118
extracted the calcium all out of and

1523
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,480
changed the molecule to make it in a

1524
00:56:04,119 --> 00:56:09,559
plant available form but but you dilute

1525
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:12,480
that a t dute that one to a thousand

1526
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:14,680
okay that that so like yeah so yeah it's

1527
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,960
1 to a thousand and I even I even go a

1528
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:19,199
little bit less in some cases just to be

1529
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:22,960
cuz I'm not measuring it perect a squirt

1530
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:24,960
of vinegar exactly but it's so powerful

1531
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,798
that it's and it's and it's absolutely

1532
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:28,519
PL available like this so you can kind

1533
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:32,400
of you can fix those you do that

1534
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:33,880
frequently like I I do that usually like

1535
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,039
in the beginning when things are getting

1536
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:37,960
rolling and then right before I go into

1537
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:40,200
flow usually I'll give them a good good

1538
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:44,559
calcium you know and usually sometimes

1539
00:56:40,199 --> 00:56:46,719
they'll a couple applications or one big

1540
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:49,798
like I usually make up one big like

1541
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:52,000
trash can of like seaweed and like

1542
00:56:49,798 --> 00:56:53,798
calcium and maybe I'll throw a handful

1543
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,440
of worm castings for my worm bin you

1544
00:56:53,798 --> 00:56:57,000
know what I mean just make this like you

1545
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,159
know gangster little extract you know

1546
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,199
what I mean literally it doesn't sit in

1547
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:02,558
there for more than you know a few

1548
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:04,439
minutes and then I take that and I I

1549
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:06,240
start using that into the garden and I

1550
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,440
usually do that like twice in the season

1551
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:10,159
I'll do it right sometime in the

1552
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:11,599
beginning of the year and then sometime

1553
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:14,558
right when I'm like in the start of

1554
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,440
Bloom or right before Bloom I have no

1555
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,720
parameter on exactly what week I'm going

1556
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,318
to do it because every year is different

1557
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,480
especially on like the outdoor thing and

1558
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:24,798
every and are the eggs just like eggs

1559
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:27,240
that you've eaten over the past month or

1560
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:30,400
two yeah yeah IAT organic eggs I have

1561
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:32,598
have yeah I I always uh cook them up and

1562
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,838
then like crush them into the worm bin

1563
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:36,119
yeah so yeah once they pass through the

1564
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:37,599
worm bin you can kind of get some

1565
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,519
benefit that way but they're they'll

1566
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:40,680
last for years just sitting in the soil

1567
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:42,599
or in those things unless they're

1568
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:46,000
getting processed can you over cuz I get

1569
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:48,880
so much leachate from my worms uh can

1570
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,760
you overuse that yeah okay I burnt the I

1571
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,240
burnt the shit out of my plants slow

1572
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:54,960
down so with my leate like with my leate

1573
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:57,279
I always like I mean I dilute it in

1574
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,358
water I it like one to one to 500 or one

1575
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,319
to a th I really don't use a ton when I

1576
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:04,440
mix M into something CU I always air on

1577
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:06,159
the side little more aggressive because

1578
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,079
I I yeah I know some people can be

1579
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:09,838
really and I've been aggressive but I've

1580
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:12,400
also had some negative reactions from

1581
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:14,519
being too aggressive and then using that

1582
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,318
too early in the worm bin cycle so if

1583
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:19,719
you just got a fresh worm bin right and

1584
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:21,079
you just made it like a month ago all

1585
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:22,558
that leachy that's coming out of there

1586
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:24,880
or whatever the liquid that coming out

1587
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:27,319
of there it's really hot and it's much

1588
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,920
more strong than usual so I usually

1589
00:58:27,318 --> 00:58:31,239
that's what I've been pouring in high

1590
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:32,760
doses on my plants but they look great

1591
00:58:31,239 --> 00:58:33,798
care okay good well that's good so I

1592
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:37,000
mean that's not the end of the world I

1593
00:58:33,798 --> 00:58:39,519
would I would get more out of it by down

1594
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,280
just I will dial it back a little bit I

1595
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:42,719
mean and you shouldn't get like tons

1596
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,079
coming out you don't need to water it

1597
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:48,078
every day my worm bin I water like once

1598
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:50,160
a month maybe in the hot months you know

1599
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:52,559
what I mean and it stays I I would like

1600
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:54,838
missed the top a little bit but now I

1601
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:57,079
don't yeah I don't I as long it's

1602
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:58,759
covered in the my if it Mes in the shade

1603
00:58:57,079 --> 00:59:00,760
and it's and and it's just it's

1604
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:03,240
basically just this big wagon that sits

1605
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:04,880
on Center blocks with a freaking boogie

1606
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:07,879
board or a piece of wood that sits on

1607
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:10,318
top uh red wigglers and other compost

1608
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,440
worms that's I I don't know I don't know

1609
00:59:10,318 --> 00:59:13,199
the other ones I know there's no

1610
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:15,798
nightcrawlers but I know that they're uh

1611
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:17,558
is that for a reason nightcrawlers

1612
00:59:15,798 --> 00:59:19,239
usually I have those in my worm bit

1613
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:22,039
right so nightcrawlers usually don't

1614
00:59:19,239 --> 00:59:23,318
they're not compost worms so they're

1615
00:59:22,039 --> 00:59:26,480
they're they do a little bit they're not

1616
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:27,960
as good at composting I guess as I think

1617
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,240
they're they usually hang out in the

1618
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:32,720
soil system and those they're better

1619
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:35,759
don't they come up at night to feed and

1620
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:37,919
then yeah but like on like a breakdown

1621
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:40,680
like feeding on like the the kitchen

1622
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,680
scraps and like on a rapid Pace they're

1623
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:44,639
just not that's not their Duty as much

1624
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:46,399
they're more soil dwellers they'll do it

1625
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:49,279
well fortunately the black soldier fly

1626
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,240
also found the worm bin so it's like

1627
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:53,640
it's like tons of black and the the

1628
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:55,639
worms are annoyed yeah you can tell

1629
00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:56,558
they're like cuz they're they're just

1630
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:57,798
like

1631
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,960
yeah they're dominant they start

1632
00:59:57,798 --> 01:00:01,038
sometimes the ants will get in there and

1633
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:02,240
start attacking attacking worms

1634
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:03,640
sometimes you can sprinkle some Diet

1635
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:05,679
tenacious Earth in there and that'll

1636
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:07,759
help knock off the ants or the topal

1637
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:10,960
bugs War it's war in there but what I

1638
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:13,079
use also is my old mosquito Nets from

1639
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:15,079
the Hoops that I make are used in my

1640
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:17,359
worm bin so I make my worm bin I line

1641
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:19,720
the bottom with a mosquito net and then

1642
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:21,279
I put the stuff in and then I either

1643
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:22,959
wrap the top with the rest of the

1644
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,440
mosquito net or put another mosquito net

1645
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,159
over the top of it so how do you do it

1646
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,599
and then they can't get in no flies no

1647
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:29,279
ants no nothing it's just they're

1648
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,798
completely sealed in that and it can

1649
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:33,359
breathe and everything how many plants

1650
01:00:30,798 --> 01:00:35,798
are at your place do you wrap is it like

1651
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:37,719
like netting for one or for a few or for

1652
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:40,280
depending on how large depend it depends

1653
01:00:37,719 --> 01:00:42,000
so like I do like what's the most plants

1654
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:44,680
that are under one

1655
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,760
hoop well legally

1656
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:51,199

1657
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:52,640
someone's house what would be the most

1658

1672
01:01:16,838 --> 01:01:22,038

1673
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:25,400
bro never talked to them uh but uh yeah

1674
01:01:22,039 --> 01:01:26,799
so like you know you in like the tall

1675
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:30,119
hoop right there

1676
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:34,838
I've made them 12 by 12 like you know a

1677
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:37,440
12T long you know not 12T wide but 12

1678
01:01:34,838 --> 01:01:39,798
12T long by a little bit wider than that

1679
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,920
you know uh probably 10t wide you know

1680
01:01:39,798 --> 01:01:43,759
what I mean and then you can do anything

1681
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,880
from like a whole bunch of little plants

1682
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:48,000
in pots a whole bunch of little plants

1683
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:50,960
in the ground you walk a couple of big

1684
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,880
you do walk in there absolutely you do

1685
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,400
let's go big so we can walk inside yeah

1686
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,318
you get an extra flap right you get a

1687
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,960
little extra so you can fold the flap

1688
01:01:56,318 --> 01:01:59,440
and you put ACK on it to how would you

1689
01:01:57,960 --> 01:02:02,119
set one of these up and then add some

1690
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,318
supplemental lighting like you couldn't

1691
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:05,880
well you could with with that well you

1692
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:07,199
don't you you you're pulling the

1693
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,000
supplemental lighting when you go into

1694
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:10,639
flower anyway so you don't need it you

1695
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,559
don't need it when you're flowering so

1696
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:14,960
you wouldn't need to have like the N

1697
01:02:13,559 --> 01:02:16,359
while you're doing it unless you really

1698
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:18,159
wanted extra protection all the time

1699
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:19,480
from everything which net isn't bad all

1700
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:20,358
the time in the winter you can have nets

1701
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,519
all the time cuz they're not going to

1702
01:02:20,358 --> 01:02:23,838
get as big right you can you know that

1703
01:02:22,519 --> 01:02:25,278
they're going to stay pretty small and

1704
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:26,480
it's going to be more cold and stuff so

1705
01:02:25,278 --> 01:02:28,960
you can get away with setting them up

1706
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:31,880
early but uh supplemental light then you

1707
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:34,639
get like a like a couple of like 2x4s or

1708
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:36,039
a couple pieces of wood and you you you

1709
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:38,679
stick some of that and then build a

1710
01:02:36,039 --> 01:02:41,640
little do the Sun On Demand lights out

1711
01:02:38,679 --> 01:02:44,078
here you know you get a little

1712
01:02:41,639 --> 01:02:45,639
LED that much you can get like two

1713
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:47,318
little cheap LEDs you could even

1714
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:49,440
probably get some solar like that's

1715
01:02:47,318 --> 01:02:50,679
those solar ones yeah Cheo little things

1716
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,278
that would just light up a little bit

1717
01:02:50,679 --> 01:02:53,960
and that's you need a little bit you

1718
01:02:52,278 --> 01:02:56,358
know close to them and on them to keep

1719
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:59,400
them but in the winter I really I don't

1720
01:02:56,358 --> 01:03:01,679
ever do the supplemental I just I try to

1721
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:05,599
run them inside like if you have if you

1722
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:07,440
have a little space inside I do then you

1723
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,720
plant a bunch of seeds in the winter

1724
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,798
starting now this is when you know every

1725
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:12,679
you know I start doing some of the

1726
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:14,599
winter looks and some of the looks of

1727
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:16,798
things you plant seeds now you grow them

1728
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:20,079
up inside until they're like you know a

1729
01:03:16,798 --> 01:03:22,559
foot tall maybe less 8 in a foot tall

1730
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:24,599
right before they sex you just take them

1731
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,359
outside and you put them and set them up

1732
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:28,079
in there and then you can pull to sex or

1733
01:03:26,358 --> 01:03:29,759
before you know you can you can clone

1734
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:30,960
them and sex them but I don't even do

1735
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,799
that I get them up to where they're

1736
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,639
about ready to start showing maturity

1737
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:36,278
like they can kind you know like you

1738
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:38,118
should transplant them you know like

1739
01:03:36,278 --> 01:03:39,599
fuck I should transplant this you're

1740
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:41,039
going outside you know what I mean so

1741
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:42,720
then they you you get your space back

1742
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,400
and you can take those outside and then

1743
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:45,798
you they go into flower and then you get

1744
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,240
another six inches they'll double in

1745
01:03:45,798 --> 01:03:51,159
size sometimes cuz they're going to

1746
01:03:47,239 --> 01:03:53,558
stretch you know a third to you know

1747
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:55,000
double depending on what you're growing

1748
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:56,519
and you get a you know getting a foot

1749
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:58,719
and a half tall

1750
01:03:56,519 --> 01:03:59,960
plant with a couple good branches and

1751
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:01,278
then you don't have to have supplemental

1752
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,240
light other than like starting them

1753
01:04:01,278 --> 01:04:05,278
inside go from 8 foot to a foot and a

1754
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:08,719
half yeah Tom you're you're going to go

1755
01:04:05,278 --> 01:04:11,838
from having a uh failed small hom grow

1756
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:15,118
to having the the biggest operation of

1757
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:16,639
fir producing weed that yeah and the

1758
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:19,440
thing is you're not get shipped to New

1759
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:21,000
York Don't Spray anything like people

1760
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,639
like

1761
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:25,358
90% of the fraking outdoor weed you're

1762
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:27,278
going to smoke has got sprayed with

1763
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:28,558
something to they springing with

1764
01:04:27,278 --> 01:04:29,920
something I mean budw worms are

1765
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:31,480
everywhere I mean I don't know I don't

1766
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:34,200
know how a lot of these get away with

1767
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:37,318
and it's end world let's talk about like

1768
01:04:34,199 --> 01:04:39,318
a hemp farm at scale and moths like

1769
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:41,278
what's going what's go what's going like

1770
01:04:39,318 --> 01:04:43,358
you got to spray them yeah you don't you

1771
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:44,960
either got so much to lose and there's

1772
01:04:43,358 --> 01:04:49,358
not enough so they spray what are they

1773
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:52,199
spraying a BT probably probably flower

1774
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:54,078
yeah I most people are like okay with it

1775
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:56,199
yeah they yeah you have to you don't

1776
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:58,760
have protection you have to but on like

1777
01:04:56,199 --> 01:05:01,399
scale on like hectors and shit I mean

1778
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:03,240
I'm sure that like I mean you're you're

1779
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,519
going to concede part of it you're

1780
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:06,639
you're going to have too many plants for

1781
01:05:04,519 --> 01:05:08,079
the population right but then you have

1782
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:09,879
lights I think that there would be good

1783
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:11,760
light control like those Dino trap

1784
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:12,760
lights those electric lights you don't

1785
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,720
want them hanging like right next to

1786
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:16,359
your plants to where it's going to like

1787
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:17,480
fiddle with your I don't think that they

1788
01:05:16,358 --> 01:05:20,000
would anyway yeah I don't think they

1789
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:22,240
would anyway but they you start hanging

1790
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,519
them in the early spring as things are

1791
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:26,479
vegging and you start killing all the

1792
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:28,199
population early so there's less

1793
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,079
breeding going on so by the time you go

1794
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:32,199
into summer and you're going in you're

1795
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:35,160
going into flower you've already kind of

1796
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:37,399
dented the local population in your Zone

1797
01:05:35,159 --> 01:05:39,480
on like not as much predicated breeding

1798
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:42,200
you know all this stuff going on that

1799
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:43,960
now you've got less to deal with and you

1800
01:05:42,199 --> 01:05:45,838
can run it through the through the

1801
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:47,720
cycles like over there and draw most of

1802
01:05:45,838 --> 01:05:49,440
them to that instead of right here cuz

1803
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:51,399
they'll be drawn to that light your

1804
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:52,760
neighbor property and then you can kind

1805
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,639
of yeah exactly then you can kind of

1806
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:56,559
light them up on that on that regard too

1807
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:59,038
so you don't have to do do as much

1808
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:02,160
spraying and and you

1809
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:04,960
cowers have like those lights like I bet

1810
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:06,278
you they mean I've seen some that did

1811
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,240
that actually had little towers with

1812
01:06:06,278 --> 01:06:09,559
some zapper lights on and and things

1813
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:12,000
like I've seen some that did I don't

1814
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:13,278
know what a lot of them do do I mean

1815
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,199
here we don't have a lot of huge hemp

1816
01:06:13,278 --> 01:06:17,599
Farms that I can go to and see you know

1817
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:20,879
there's more you know other places you

1818
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:22,480
know this the East and you know Colorado

1819
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,640
and places like that so I don't see as

1820
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:26,480
many of the hemp hemp Farms but man I

1821
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:28,278
know that like

1822
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,318
a lot of people in Humble use the dino

1823
01:06:28,278 --> 01:06:32,239
traps for like the big trees and you

1824
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:34,558
know a lot of different types of I have

1825
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:38,038
a question for you do you recommend

1826
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:41,319
mosquito netting for like L like large

1827
01:06:38,039 --> 01:06:44,720
commercial grows do you I mean is it

1828
01:06:41,318 --> 01:06:46,199
doable so in so in in perum Las Vegas

1829
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:50,838
and

1830
01:06:46,199 --> 01:06:52,558
Arizona like during like cool season you

1831
01:06:50,838 --> 01:06:54,239
can kind of get away with little little

1832
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:56,278
open Hoops like this it's not 10 and

1833
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:59,558
whatever you know what I mean and we've

1834
01:06:56,278 --> 01:07:01,278
we've set up big you know I mean big big

1835
01:06:59,559 --> 01:07:04,400
Hoops like that with that and you just

1836
01:07:01,278 --> 01:07:06,559
order big big rolls and yeah I mean it

1837
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,358
it works it doesn't last as as long as

1838
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:09,760
some things and it's easily torn so like

1839
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:11,719
you buy this big thing and you tear it

1840
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,359
at a hole in there it's like fuck you

1841
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:16,399
got to like you know you got to do some

1842
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:17,679
you know but yeah for a cheap like way

1843
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,240
to like do it and then as long as you're

1844
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:21,199
reusing it for something else like I use

1845
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:23,000
it for my worm bins or I use it for

1846
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:24,598
blueberry coverage and once it gets tore

1847
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,760
somewhere else I change it to some other

1848
01:07:24,599 --> 01:07:27,278
type of function you you know what I

1849
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,599
mean I try to use the shit out of it

1850
01:07:27,278 --> 01:07:34,440
where do you get mosquito netting large

1851
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:36,559
swats of it you can get um well Amazon

1852
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:38,559
Depot Amazon you can at Home Depot which

1853
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:40,839
is crazy yeah you can't you cannot get

1854
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:42,640
it at Home Depot you might be able to

1855
01:07:40,838 --> 01:07:43,838
order it on a Home Depot online store

1856
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:45,519
and like order it somewhere and they

1857
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:47,239
might be able to sell it but I've never

1858
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:50,559
you can't go someplace and actually buy

1859
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:52,479
it uh a fabric store stock it yeah like

1860
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:54,839
like Joanne fabric stores like is what

1861
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:57,679
we have around here they fabric stores

1862
01:07:54,838 --> 01:08:00,000
they have it sometimes gotcha but

1863
01:07:57,679 --> 01:08:01,519
sometimes the amount that I need or what

1864
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,679
are they are they calling it mosquito

1865
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:05,239
Char too much at those stores yeah and

1866
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:07,000
they don't have that on hand you know

1867
01:08:05,239 --> 01:08:09,519
but I found that Amazon you can order it

1868
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,599
on Amazon you can order it uh from fab

1869
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:13,639
fabric stores like fabric should

1870
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,278
shouldn't hydro stores and those Grow

1871
01:08:13,639 --> 01:08:18,318
shops have it because that's where I go

1872
01:08:15,278 --> 01:08:20,560
to get the netting they were smart yeah

1873
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:22,520
you know honestly like it's really weird

1874
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,719
like I so the reason why I use the

1875
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,679
netting in the first place is I'm a

1876
01:08:23,719 --> 01:08:29,198
fruit tree guy right I I'm constantly

1877
01:08:26,679 --> 01:08:30,960
constantly over here right there I had

1878
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:33,678
yeah yeah I mean we're constantly

1879
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:36,920
putting stuff over like crops to protect

1880
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:38,719
them Frost blankets uh like blueberries

1881
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:40,158
are a big thing where I use those for

1882
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:42,000
blueberry bushes they're small we can

1883
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:43,719
build a little PVC thing blueberries

1884
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,960
bird control like nobody's business it's

1885
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:48,239
great so basically the birds are

1886
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:50,759
swarming above yeah exactly and like

1887
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:52,798
peaches and like you got you got you got

1888
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:54,439
you got june beetles attacking the figs

1889
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:56,359
and the soft flesh fruits the peaches

1890
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:57,879
and the nectarines and big old green you

1891
01:08:56,359 --> 01:08:59,838
know Jee bug beetles floating around the

1892
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:01,640
Japanese beetles or whatever uh there's

1893
01:08:59,838 --> 01:09:03,399
all kinds so we've always used stuff

1894
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:05,759
like this just to cover fruit trees and

1895
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:08,358
stuff so like years ago like I mean I

1896
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:10,119
planted the greatest crop I've ever seen

1897
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:11,880
I was so proud it was like I don't know

1898
01:09:10,119 --> 01:09:14,519
it's like almost 10 years ago or

1899
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:17,600
whatever and and basically I didn't get

1900
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:19,880
any of it it all was budw wormed to

1901
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,319
death and this is at a point where you

1902
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:23,119
would have done it if it was a blueberry

1903
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:24,560
tree if I wouldn't I didn't even think

1904
01:09:23,119 --> 01:09:26,920
that I was like yeah I'll spray it with

1905
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:28,798
BT or like didn't think about the I

1906
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:30,920
didn't have that problem I never planted

1907
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:33,359
such a big crop the way that I did

1908
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:35,119
outdoors and that was the first time

1909
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,079
that I really got kicked in the stomach

1910
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:38,759
and I was like everybody has to go

1911
01:09:37,079 --> 01:09:40,399
through that you got you got to be like

1912
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:42,000
fuck and then I'm like I'm going to pull

1913
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:44,238
out the mosquito netting and I've never

1914
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,279
looked back ever every year you pulling

1915
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:48,198
you're pulling the the freaking donkeys

1916
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:50,279
that you have you know are you

1917
01:09:48,198 --> 01:09:52,198
sold it's all good but I'm just trying

1918
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:53,719
to like to understand kind of the time

1919
01:09:52,198 --> 01:09:56,559
frame it's

1920
01:09:53,719 --> 01:09:59,760
like kind of trying to go back in time

1921
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:03,520
with the the negative

1922
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:06,360
tests I feel when I let you know that we

1923
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,640
have a problem we it was probably too

1924
01:10:06,359 --> 01:10:11,158
late I even told him with the first text

1925
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:14,000
I go oh I have a problem and I think the

1926
01:10:11,158 --> 01:10:15,559
entire caterpillar and took it off when

1927
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:18,679
I was I bet you you were what like week

1928
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:20,880
three of flower right it was was like

1929
01:10:18,679 --> 01:10:22,440
maybe May so that's my question to you

1930
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:25,119
it's like we're already two or three

1931
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:26,759
weeks too late yeah okay well no so like

1932
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:28,800
I said before like they're not really

1933
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:30,480
going after the really small flowering

1934
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,920
plants right they wait for them to get a

1935
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:33,799
little bit more robust cuz the the

1936
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:36,158
stench is a little bit more there's more

1937
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,840
for their offspring to to consume

1938
01:10:36,158 --> 01:10:40,399
there's a place for them to hide I don't

1939
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:42,520
know the exact reason of why but usually

1940
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:44,198
about week as soon as you start getting

1941
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:46,120
some substantial little pom poms on

1942
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:47,839
there you know what I mean like we three

1943
01:10:46,119 --> 01:10:50,399
the second you can smell

1944
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:52,719
it that's when it's that's when that's

1945
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:54,719
when they're already ahead of you you

1946
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:56,000
know what I mean so you got a weak you

1947
01:10:54,719 --> 01:11:00,239
got a we

1948
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:03,359
of that you know so like I usually like

1949
01:11:00,238 --> 01:11:06,198
June like late June in like the first

1950
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:07,920
week of July maybe you know this year I

1951
01:11:06,198 --> 01:11:08,960
was a little bit later when do you when

1952
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:11,480
do you

1953
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:13,600
plant I plant from inside and everything

1954
01:11:11,479 --> 01:11:16,158
comes outside when it's time like in in

1955
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:18,039
late May early June the things come out

1956
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:20,960
but by the end of June and like the

1957
01:11:18,039 --> 01:11:22,600
first two weeks of July where we are

1958
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,679
like we already have only like 15 hours

1959
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:26,560
of Sun like Max in the summer you know

1960
01:11:24,679 --> 01:11:28,279
what I mean like like some of my stuff

1961
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,440
will trigger earlier than that like it's

1962
01:11:28,279 --> 01:11:31,679
very light sensitive and Trigger so I

1963
01:11:30,439 --> 01:11:33,759
have to cover my stuff a little bit

1964
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:35,199
earlier than some you know where I grew

1965
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,520
a bunch of stuff from my buddy this year

1966
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:39,279
and all of this stuff like it's it's

1967
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:41,280
like still going because it's you know

1968
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:44,039
it's so late you know compared to my

1969
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:45,479
stuff you know so um it's it just

1970
01:11:44,039 --> 01:11:48,039
depends on what you're growing but you

1971
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:50,279
want to get it like a week or two before

1972
01:11:48,039 --> 01:11:52,600
you go into flow right when you're T

1973
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:54,359
usually right when I'm taking clones for

1974
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,960
the for the select stuff that I want to

1975
01:11:54,359 --> 01:11:58,479
look at the ones that have the best stem

1976
01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:00,119
rub the best ones or my mother plants

1977
01:11:58,479 --> 01:12:01,959
that I keep every year anyway you know

1978
01:12:00,119 --> 01:12:03,359
what I mean as soon as they grow up I

1979
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:05,239
always put those outside in the ground

1980
01:12:03,359 --> 01:12:07,079
so they can tap into the Earth and

1981
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:10,359
regenerate I take clones I cover them

1982
01:12:07,079 --> 01:12:12,399
the mothers Corner the on those Gardia

1983
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:14,279
or what what are those in the corner

1984
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:16,479
back there a Bogan via the ban via so

1985
01:12:14,279 --> 01:12:17,880
don't those attract um aren't those

1986
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:20,759
don't those so they have a Bogan via

1987
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:22,359
Looper it's a different worm okay it's a

1988
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:24,400
different interesting that another worm

1989
01:12:22,359 --> 01:12:27,039
will have no interest no interest yeah

1990
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:28,279
it's a different thing

1991
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:29,679
I believe yeah I think you guys are

1992
01:12:28,279 --> 01:12:31,800
right like it is the corn worm or it's

1993
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:34,719
an earworm it's a worm that wants to be

1994
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:38,400
inside of a bud it's an actual bud worm

1995
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:41,439
they'll get into flowers or corn things

1996
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:43,638
that roses like like different types

1997
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:44,919
spot to hang out like tight buted areas

1998
01:12:43,639 --> 01:12:48,440
that's where they they snuggle right up

1999
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:51,560
in thereal for them yeah I mean they're

2000
01:12:48,439 --> 01:12:53,198

2017
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:30,679
like the and they put them up too late

2018
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:33,399
and it was like it like once it's too

2019
01:13:30,679 --> 01:13:36,079
late it's too late and when it went B it

2020
01:13:33,399 --> 01:13:38,679
was so fast CU it's been happening for

2021
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:41,119
two weeks before exactly so that weekend

2022
01:13:38,679 --> 01:13:42,520
when we found that that one caterpillar

2023
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:44,158
yeah there was already 30 of them on

2024
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:46,040
there no I know but it was so beautiful

2025
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:47,960
the plants like they were they had were

2026
01:13:46,039 --> 01:13:49,359
looking good they were looking really

2027
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:52,600
good there was a lot of Happiness there

2028
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:54,399
was so much sap so you know they I was

2029
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,800
like and they thought that too though

2030
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:57,359
you know that's what they're looking for

2031
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:59,800
so the Cannabis guards really fuck with

2032
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:02,599
your head because they make it like it's

2033
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:04,440
already ruin ruin but you don't know it

2034
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:07,480
you don't know it yeah the way that I

2035
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:09,119
notice it like nine times out of 10 the

2036
01:14:07,479 --> 01:14:10,718
way that I'll notice it before anything

2037
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:14,439
if you don't see the droppings and it's

2038
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:17,880
early one of the little leaflets that's

2039
01:14:14,439 --> 01:14:21,599
coming out of the bud will be brown one

2040
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:23,239
little leaflet or one little area right

2041
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,639
there will just be slightly discolored

2042
01:14:23,238 --> 01:14:26,158
and it's not even something that's like

2043
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:28,239
whoo that's messed up it's like that's

2044
01:14:26,158 --> 01:14:29,719
just slightly different you know I mean

2045
01:14:28,238 --> 01:14:31,519
and then you open that up and then it's

2046
01:14:29,719 --> 01:14:34,119
completely rotten

2047
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,960
behind is it is are new are new

2048
01:14:34,119 --> 01:14:37,840
Expressions coming in cuz sometimes

2049
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:39,079
they'll look cuz they look yeah and

2050
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:42,039
sometimes that's just like maybe the

2051
01:14:39,079 --> 01:14:43,639
triones have gone Amber on there maybe

2052
01:14:42,039 --> 01:14:45,359
it's something you know maybe it just

2053
01:14:43,639 --> 01:14:48,079
got hot it was really hot maybe this

2054
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:49,839
Leaf just got burnt a little bit or but

2055
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:51,679
no as soon as you touch that leaf that

2056
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,639
thing will pull right out of there and

2057
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:55,639
then you'll see you can your that bud

2058
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:57,400
will just disintegrate in your hand like

2059
01:14:55,639 --> 01:14:59,119
a perfect looking Bud will just like

2060
01:14:57,399 --> 01:15:00,759
disintegrate you look inside it'll be

2061
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:02,679
all poop on the inside that's what we

2062
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:04,199
did I mean one of those first on I oh

2063
01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:05,960
it's too late and and you're and you're

2064
01:15:04,198 --> 01:15:07,399
too late you really are I mean you can

2065
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,520
spray at that point and save what you

2066
01:15:07,399 --> 01:15:11,439
can but you're you're already sprayed

2067
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:13,239
that sucks I mean is what it is we've

2068
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:15,000
all smoked that for years I mean I'm not

2069
01:15:13,238 --> 01:15:16,238
you know I'm not it you know I'm not

2070
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,800
better than some kind of bud that's been

2071
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:19,599
sprayed every once in a while but if I

2072
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:22,320
have the choice it's going to be as

2073
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:25,520
clean as fraking that's right you know

2074
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:27,479
yeah you know it's it can be so wow you

2075
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,080
know the key is keep it off of the

2076
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:31,359
plants don't let the mosquito netting

2077
01:15:29,079 --> 01:15:33,439
touch the plants give yourself some room

2078
01:15:31,359 --> 01:15:35,119
always make it a little bigger than your

2079
01:15:33,439 --> 01:15:37,759
plants and know that your plants are

2080
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:39,960
going to stretch so don't build it to

2081
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,960
like your plant size right near the flow

2082
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:44,198
and then they're going to stretch right

2083
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:47,359
into the son of a bitch always give I

2084
01:15:44,198 --> 01:15:51,359
buy when you say little bigger you want

2085
01:15:47,359 --> 01:15:52,719
a couple of couple of feet for sure yeah

2086
01:15:51,359 --> 01:15:53,960
always get a little more than you should

2087
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:55,840
and if you have a little extra on the

2088
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,119
ground that you got to throw rocks on I

2089
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,440
always put soil on mine so it really

2090
01:15:57,119 --> 01:16:01,439
stays nice you know or whatever but or

2091
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:03,479
mulch or whatever's you know on the you

2092
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:05,399
know but you want you want some extra

2093
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:06,439
lay on the ground to keep rodents out

2094
01:16:05,399 --> 01:16:07,679
cuz not only is it going to keep

2095
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:09,238
budworms out but you're going to keep

2096
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:10,679
squirrels you're going to keep rats

2097
01:16:09,238 --> 01:16:13,879
you're going to keep rabbits you're

2098
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:15,520
going to keep all kinds of stuff on the

2099
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:17,639
ground traffic from coming in and

2100
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:19,960
chewing on your stems or causing a

2101
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:21,920
ruckus and on a small scale this is the

2102
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:23,560
way to do like that's like you got six

2103
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:25,679
plants you can freaking protect the shit

2104
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:29,520
out of those six plants abs like awesome

2105
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:32,158
right I mean resin stud is the note that

2106
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:34,600
goes along with us right you're making

2107
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:37,158
hash that one no that one that one's dad

2108
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:39,639
the dad of that was a resin stud oh got

2109
01:16:37,158 --> 01:16:42,198
it got it got it so that was a plant his

2110
01:16:39,639 --> 01:16:43,960
daddy was came out of a out of a big

2111
01:16:42,198 --> 01:16:45,719
sword a big population I went through a

2112
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:48,960
bunch of plants with me and my couple of

2113
01:16:45,719 --> 01:16:51,279
my buddies and we pulled out this male

2114
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:54,359
that had visible resin dripping all over

2115
01:16:51,279 --> 01:16:56,079
him and had awesome stank and stickiness

2116
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:58,439
to him and then that mail hit a bunch of

2117
01:16:56,079 --> 01:17:00,039
my stuff and that's the that's that's

2118
01:16:58,439 --> 01:17:01,439
just one of the things that's the or I

2119
01:17:00,039 --> 01:17:03,119
think that's the what the orchard lady

yeah so there's yeah so you've got two

2122
01:17:05,238 --> 01:17:10,879
resin studs going there so bacon grease

2123
01:17:08,039 --> 01:17:14,479
wicked witch so sorry bacon grease is

2124
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:16,960
Pam one cross with doyo so that's V

2125
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:19,238
that's version two sorry V2 yeah yeah so

2126
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:22,560
do we have the V1 like uh everything

2127
01:17:19,238 --> 01:17:25,439
that I do goes through P every mail that

2128
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:29,159
I collect and and find goes to to Pam

2129
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:32,519
first Pam one first a female yeah my

2130
01:17:29,158 --> 01:17:34,879
female my Pam one lady every male that I

2131
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:36,080
find always breeds with Pam one in

2132
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:38,679
addition to everybody else is that your

2133
01:17:36,079 --> 01:17:40,319
stable that's your stable every male

2134
01:17:38,679 --> 01:17:42,600
that's coming from outside that's not a

2135
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:44,158
Pam that's not every male that I select

2136
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:46,719
yeah that's not a Pam that's anything

2137
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:48,799
that I need to learn about I breed a Pam

2138
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:50,439
one because Pam one doing that because I

2139
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,880
know Pam so well yeah it will tell me

2140
01:17:50,439 --> 01:17:53,839
everything that that male does right

2141
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:55,760
they'll tell me oh he he passes

2142
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:58,760
structure or he passes is this this

2143
01:17:55,760 --> 01:18:00,320
smell or he he gives Frost or he changes

2144
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:02,400
the bud structure or whatever cuz he'll

2145
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:03,840
tell me right away what the hell what

2146
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:05,359
the hell he does CU I've grown so many

2147
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:07,440
different types of Pam and so many

2148
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:10,880
different how did variabl why why were

2149
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:13,519
you drawn to that well Pam is an old bag

2150
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:16,319
seed Pam Anderson yeah it's like she's

2151
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:19,080
like old B seed from the late 90s um

2152
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:22,880
early 2000s kind of old school funky

2153
01:18:19,079 --> 01:18:25,960
sativa stuff um that I just had

2154
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:29,560
collected and and when I grew Pam's

2155
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:33,239
mother from that Original

2156
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:34,880
Seed she was really special and she was

2157
01:18:33,238 --> 01:18:36,319
awesome and she was Heavy producing and

2158
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,520
I was like man I want to keep this plant

2159
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:39,840
around for a little while so I kept it

2160
01:18:37,520 --> 01:18:41,400
around for a little while and then I had

2161
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:43,960
it tested matter what environment you

2162
01:18:41,399 --> 01:18:46,759
were in or did she just do she's tough

2163
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:48,880
she's colorful she's pretty she's heavy

2164
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:50,400
that's why you like her like so she's

2165
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,600
yeah and I mean she does everything that

2166
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:54,879
I need her to do it's the same story

2167
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:57,239
with this other breeder who uses this

2168
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:59,440
black in everything everybody has like

2169
01:18:57,238 --> 01:19:01,439
this one thing that you know if you got

2170
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:05,599
something that's that you know that you

2171
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:07,638
use that that teach but the way you're

2172
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,280
describing it right now is that you use

2173
01:19:07,639 --> 01:19:11,079
it because you know it so well so it

2174
01:19:09,279 --> 01:19:13,279
teaches you what the other thing is

2175
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:14,639
doing but then do you then eventually

2176
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:17,359
cross the other thing with something

2177
01:19:14,639 --> 01:19:19,440
that's not Pam or you always always yeah

2178
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:21,880
that's they have to test with Pam first

2179
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:23,238
so you're not like fixated on Pam for

2180
01:19:21,880 --> 01:19:25,639
smoking and

2181
01:19:23,238 --> 01:19:27,519
growing you're using you love it but

2182
01:19:25,639 --> 01:19:29,480
you're also using it so it can tell you

2183
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:31,679
about other she's my bar that I can yeah

2184
01:19:29,479 --> 01:19:33,599
I can tell cuz she she's so strong like

2185
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:35,639
you're calibrated to her as your Zer

2186
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:38,039
everything that she usually touches she

2187
01:19:35,639 --> 01:19:40,039
dominates like in the genetic pool right

2188
01:19:38,039 --> 01:19:41,399
she's a dominator literally like

2189
01:19:40,039 --> 01:19:43,000
literally a dominates it like she'll

2190
01:19:41,399 --> 01:19:44,479
turn everything like like to her

2191
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,319
morphological character she really

2192
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:47,879
dominates over fruit I mean she'll

2193
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:50,198
really take over so if you find

2194
01:19:47,880 --> 01:19:53,359
something that dominates her that's

2195
01:19:50,198 --> 01:19:56,599
something that I like I want told that

2196
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:59,119
that I have dominant totally

2197
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:00,639
domination my daughters look exactly

2198
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:02,119
like me and sometimes you don't want

2199
01:20:00,639 --> 01:20:04,319
something that dominates her right you

2200
01:20:02,119 --> 01:20:05,840
want a male that like if you want so say

2201
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:08,359
I want to cross this mail with something

2202
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:10,079
that's not pan that is perfect like say

2203
01:20:08,359 --> 01:20:12,319
say dog walker and I want to make dog

2204
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:14,079
walker exactly right so I'll cross this

2205
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:16,000
male and if this male doesn't really do

2206
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:18,880
anything and Pam completely dominates

2207
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,359
this male and it's pretty much that then

2208
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:22,520
maybe I'll use that mail and that dog

2209
01:20:20,359 --> 01:20:24,920
walker because maybe the dog walker will

2210
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:26,639
dominate it too and I'll get what I want

2211
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:29,399
quicker you know what I mean to look at

2212
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:31,039
me mediate kind of just depends on what

2213
01:20:29,399 --> 01:20:33,319
you what you want I just want to find

2214
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:34,960
out what the male does and then I can

2215
01:20:33,319 --> 01:20:36,880
use him accordingly if I want to use

2216
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:39,359
them you know me so talk about something

2217
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:42,039
recent where you uh so bacon grease that

2218
01:20:39,359 --> 01:20:43,839
that's V this nobody has this okay one

2219
01:20:42,039 --> 01:20:46,039
other person a guy that lives in Jamaica

2220
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:49,079
my boy uh Rasta Bob he's the only other

2221
01:20:46,039 --> 01:20:52,359
person that has that version that is

2222
01:20:49,079 --> 01:20:54,439
V2 uh the V1 the real bacon grease is my

2223
01:20:52,359 --> 01:20:55,158
pan you have confidence of it doing well

2224
01:20:54,439 --> 01:20:56,799
this

2225
01:20:55,158 --> 01:20:57,879
I wanted you to get something that was

2226
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,360
good that was different I don't know

2227
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:01,159
it's not nervous because I want you to

2228
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:02,880
have fun and that's those seeds are in

2229
01:21:01,158 --> 01:21:05,799
good hands I'm not worried about it yeah

2230
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,840
F I got plans the stakes are high but

2231
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,400
it's just something that's just

2232
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:12,000
different that you can like you know he

2233
01:21:08,399 --> 01:21:15,079
could be I so in the breeding of this

2234
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,800
the Pam was the so the one I wanted the

2235
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:19,519
bacon grease that I wanted to create and

2236
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:22,480
call bacon grease was with my Pam 15

2237
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:24,320
yeah and that same dad but that was the

2238
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:25,079
byproduct of the project the dad was the

2239
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:26,439
do

2240
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:27,639
yes that's a resin dad cuz I went

2241
01:21:26,439 --> 01:21:31,238
through a bunch of plants and found a

2242
01:21:27,639 --> 01:21:33,079
resin dad Dosey Do and I wanted to know

2243
01:21:31,238 --> 01:21:35,198
you know what he did so but I wanted to

2244
01:21:33,079 --> 01:21:37,158
breed him with my pan 15 because my pan

2245
01:21:35,198 --> 01:21:39,079
15 is this crazy tall Haze thing that's

2246
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:41,079
just a resin dripper and I wanted to

2247
01:21:39,079 --> 01:21:43,840
give it a resin mail to this other resin

2248
01:21:41,079 --> 01:21:46,359
thing but in doing that project I had to

2249
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,639
hit it to the Pam one in order to figure

2250
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:49,039
out kind of what she did and I grew a

2251
01:21:47,639 --> 01:21:50,319
bunch of those out and it's awesome it's

2252
01:21:49,039 --> 01:21:52,359
awesome as hell too it's like hard to

2253
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:54,399
tell the difference but that's just a

2254
01:21:52,359 --> 01:21:56,198
different mom than my traditional one so

2255
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:57,920
it's version two and then version one's

2256
01:21:56,198 --> 01:22:00,079
with the 15 but then once you know what

2257
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:02,560
the dosido male does would you then

2258
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:04,800
cross it with for example a cherrygasm

2259
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:06,719
which you also now know what and for

2260
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,719
both of these you know what the males do

2261
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:10,198
yeah and you can justly what would

2262
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:11,719
happen with the females do something

2263
01:22:10,198 --> 01:22:14,479
that I want to do yeah I can apply it to

2264
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:17,198
whatever female that I want yeah of

2265
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:19,678
something that's not a cam in our in our

2266
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:20,879
triangle cush got it got it gator bait

2267
01:22:19,679 --> 01:22:26,158
all

2268
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:28,400
right so from this project you'll now

2269
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:31,559
breed the Dosey dough with like one of

2270
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:33,559
these other so that Dosey dough fed a

2271
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:35,199
couple things that I'm that that are

2272
01:22:33,560 --> 01:22:37,239
going into testing at the end of this

2273
01:22:35,198 --> 01:22:39,238
year and what did the do what did Pam

2274
01:22:37,238 --> 01:22:43,559
tell you about the Dosey Do mail so that

2275
01:22:39,238 --> 01:22:46,439
Dosey Do mail has a more upright cush

2276
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:48,480
structure with more of my cushy leaves

2277
01:22:46,439 --> 01:22:50,678
which is what I wanted which right now

2278
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:53,158
they're all in flour they're still fruit

2279
01:22:50,679 --> 01:22:55,600
fruit dominant but it has Sparkle it

2280
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:57,920
added resin and it add a little bit of a

2281
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:00,440
of a shorter stature with more of like

2282
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:02,119
the branches are more upright instead of

2283
01:23:00,439 --> 01:23:04,359
Christmas tree you know it has this more

2284
01:23:02,119 --> 01:23:06,760
I call it the Kush a Kush stature and it

2285
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:09,880
has this more more of a and that's the

2286
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:11,840
OG Kush um version do Dosey Do it's the

2287
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:17,159
Dosey Do

2288
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:20,119
18on cuz it was greasy as hell um I I I

2289
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:23,000
was pushing it up against

2290
01:23:20,119 --> 01:23:25,079
the um mosquito netting you know what I

2291
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:28,079
mean moving some stuff around

2292
01:23:25,079 --> 01:23:29,920
and it it left such a nasty smear on the

2293
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:31,960
side when I when I pulled it aside and

2294
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,560
it was just greasy as fuck I'm like man

2295
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:35,239
that's greasy that's like that's some

2296
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:36,760
greasy that's some greasy you know like

2297
01:23:35,238 --> 01:23:38,039
I was thinking about it like it's bacon

2298
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:39,840
grease man that's what it is and old

2299
01:23:38,039 --> 01:23:42,238
bacon grease is all white in the pan

2300
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,440
just like just greasy and you know once

2301
01:23:42,238 --> 01:23:44,959
you get it on there you're never getting

2302
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:46,158
it off it pretty much you know it is

2303
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,439
what it is so I just call it bacon

2304
01:23:46,158 --> 01:23:51,879
grease doesn't smell like bacon grease

2305
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:54,839
or anything it's very floral very spicy

2306
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:56,480
very I call it I call it smoke shop like

2307
01:23:54,840 --> 01:24:00,800
you walk into a smoke shop and there's

2308
01:23:56,479 --> 01:24:03,319
like incense and funky things smelling

2309
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:05,159
and kind of this musty dude with Bo and

2310
01:24:03,319 --> 01:24:07,439
just this weird

2311
01:24:05,158 --> 01:24:12,479
collection yeah a weird smoke shop kind

2312
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:16,039
of smell um very very very very good

2313
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:19,039
uh okay but so as a contrasts this is

2314
01:24:16,039 --> 01:24:22,399
the orchard lady which is also a Pam one

2315
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:24,600
cross with Citrus farmer resin resin so

2316
01:24:22,399 --> 01:24:27,238
what did the Pam one tell you about the

2317
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:29,719
Citrus farmer so Pam one dominates that

2318
01:24:27,238 --> 01:24:32,079
cross okay okay so so it's a submissive

2319
01:24:29,719 --> 01:24:33,840
male that yeah he's more he added Frost

2320
01:24:32,079 --> 01:24:36,198
like a mofo though so in the cactus

2321
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:38,119
fruit like there's a there's cactus

2322
01:24:36,198 --> 01:24:40,118
fruit or Cactus cam some people call it

2323
01:24:38,119 --> 01:24:41,800
Cactus cam a bunch of Veteran groups

2324
01:24:40,118 --> 01:24:45,158
grow it a couple people around town grow

2325
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:47,880
it um there's several people that have

2326
01:24:45,158 --> 01:24:50,118
found Keepers in the cactus Cam and it's

2327
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:52,800
just it looks kind of like the Mac with

2328
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:56,079
the resin uh it really has got this

2329
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:59,679
grapefruit citrus sharpness with this

2330
01:24:56,079 --> 01:25:02,238
Mac kind of resin you know profile uh

2331
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:04,880
but to the orchard lady it it doesn't

2332
01:25:02,238 --> 01:25:07,319
have that I haven't found any of those

2333
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:09,520
Mac resin characteristics you got the

2334
01:25:07,319 --> 01:25:12,079
Pam characteristics in there which is

2335
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:14,800
purples and pinks and swirls of color

2336
01:25:12,079 --> 01:25:18,719
and it's got uh more of a Sandy resin

2337
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:20,000
type like like Pam um and she's this

2338
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:22,960
really

2339
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:27,560
grapy um most of the phenotypes are very

2340
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:28,920
grape Bubblegum and sugary and colorful

2341
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:31,239
they're really cool and the branches are

2342
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:32,880
really Stout like you don't need caging

2343
01:25:31,238 --> 01:25:34,319
and stuff for most of the orchard unless

2344
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,920
you're Lear to let it get 10 or 12 feet

2345
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:38,158
which they will and and there's several

2346
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:41,319
people that grew 10 foot Orchard ladies

2347
01:25:38,158 --> 01:25:44,079
this year which is killer um but they

2348
01:25:41,319 --> 01:25:47,559
are really firm fibrous branches man and

2349
01:25:44,079 --> 01:25:49,359
it's fullon like candleabra manipulate

2350
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:51,039
them do you B you can but you should do

2351
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:53,960
it early with the orchard lady cuz they

2352
01:25:51,039 --> 01:25:55,319
firm up pretty but do you do you no I

2353
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:56,399
don't

2354
01:25:55,319 --> 01:25:58,000
do you let your plants just do what

2355
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:01,158
they're going to do yeah unless they're

2356
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,840
like coming into contact with danger

2357
01:26:01,158 --> 01:26:05,079
like if if they're in a smaller space

2358
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:07,239
and I need to manipulate them to keep

2359
01:26:05,079 --> 01:26:09,960
them out of trouble then I will do so

2360
01:26:07,238 --> 01:26:13,399
but if I have Val was jumping up down on

2361
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:16,359
the couch yet last night yeah outside

2362
01:26:13,399 --> 01:26:18,599
over the concrete and I was like let me

2363
01:26:16,359 --> 01:26:20,719
so do you top your so you top I do a top

2364
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,840
right in the beginning um and then

2365
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:23,800
usually that's when you say the

2366
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:26,639
beginning so like when they get like

2367
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:29,199
three or Four Leaf sets soon as I get

2368
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:31,400
like 6 in or so you know they got a

2369
01:26:29,198 --> 01:26:33,479
couple good Leaf sets I'll top it then

2370
01:26:31,399 --> 01:26:34,839
so you have a nice low branching not too

2371
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:38,279
low because I don't want it branching on

2372
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:40,920
the ground so you know I usually you

2373
01:26:38,279 --> 01:26:42,399
know you know 6 in 7 inches I'll do a

2374
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:43,920
top right there and then I don't do

2375
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:45,719
another one and most of the strains that

2376
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:47,480
I grow are really branchy strains anyway

2377
01:26:45,719 --> 01:26:50,000
so just that one top just sends it on

2378
01:26:47,479 --> 01:26:51,439
its way to a really nice height is

2379
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,238
whatever it's going to whatever you want

2380
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:55,799
it to be like the Pam and like the dog

2381
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:57,439
once it gets say to eight and you don't

2382
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:59,440
you go I don't want any what how do you

2383
01:26:57,439 --> 01:27:02,919
keep it from growing bend that sucker

2384
01:26:59,439 --> 01:27:04,879
down prune it or bend it so I'm not I'm

2385
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:06,760
a fan of both so but so like if you

2386
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,800
prune it aren't you like create creating

2387
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:10,760
a potential opening for something to get

2388
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:12,520
like is it better to bend if you do if

2389
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:15,079
you're pruning it I would say prune

2390
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:16,840
early don't prune late because later you

2391
01:27:15,079 --> 01:27:18,679
prune the less activities happening with

2392
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:20,079
your plant the less it's feeding itself

2393
01:27:18,679 --> 01:27:21,199
the less it's doing the more it's foot

2394
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:22,479
heal you know the less it's going to be

2395
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:24,960
able to take care of that wound and it's

2396
01:27:22,479 --> 01:27:26,319
got too much other 6 Fe that's too late

2397
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,719
you got to bend you got to bend it at

2398
01:27:26,319 --> 01:27:29,920
that point you know and you can bend it

2399
01:27:27,719 --> 01:27:32,960
and you know flop it or whatever no

2400
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:35,118
problem man or weave it you know um I've

2401
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:37,158
put in I've put in trellis Nets way too

2402
01:27:35,118 --> 01:27:38,679
late and fully made it work you know

2403
01:27:37,158 --> 01:27:40,359
what I mean you know even if you you

2404
01:27:38,679 --> 01:27:42,319
know it's not and they like a little bit

2405
01:27:40,359 --> 01:27:44,039
of stress yeah but the yeah I mean a

2406
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:46,000
little bit I mean the best honestly the

2407
01:27:44,039 --> 01:27:47,800
best the best plants I think you know

2408
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,158
just like the best best people in this

2409
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:50,880
world man they didn't come from like

2410
01:27:49,158 --> 01:27:52,879
perfect situations right we all came

2411
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:54,400
from torment and struggle in some way or

2412
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:56,039
not I don't say struggle you're playing

2413
01:27:54,399 --> 01:27:58,000
but like in some way you have to work

2414
01:27:56,039 --> 01:28:00,439
for what you have you

2415
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,719
know like if you're like listening

2416
01:28:00,439 --> 01:28:05,079
talking to people reading if you don't

2417
01:28:02,719 --> 01:28:07,960
have your hands-on experience people's

2418
01:28:05,079 --> 01:28:10,198
beliefs you know like about philosophies

2419
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:12,679
about that are all over the map you know

2420
01:28:10,198 --> 01:28:14,279
in terms of and so you know at the end

2421
01:28:12,679 --> 01:28:16,880
of the day you kind of find have to find

2422
01:28:14,279 --> 01:28:18,359
your own way yeah I think you have to

2423
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:21,079
yeah because you can't listen to

2424
01:28:18,359 --> 01:28:22,399
everyone man is the rice just a des for

2425
01:28:21,079 --> 01:28:24,760
me going to work for you all the time

2426
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:26,158
you know what is the rice just that's my

2427
01:28:24,760 --> 01:28:27,960
cheap little one usually there's cotton

2428
01:28:26,158 --> 01:28:31,719
or something or usually use cotton or

2429
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:34,960
rice in there so you could put like some

2430
01:28:31,719 --> 01:28:38,198
can FY microbes on the rice it's clean

2431
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:40,079
good organic rice you know my celium

2432
01:28:38,198 --> 01:28:42,118
yeah yeah yeah throw a bunch of that

2433
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:44,600
random stuff or random seeds use cheese

2434
01:28:42,118 --> 01:28:47,599
seeds so which one would you

2435
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:49,119
recommend out here next cuz I think

2436
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:51,960
basically with all we should just chop

2437
01:28:49,118 --> 01:28:53,479
all like everything yeah Salvage

2438
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:56,279
whatever you can yeah you're you're

2439
01:28:53,479 --> 01:28:58,118
you're yeah you're you're you're hurting

2440
01:28:56,279 --> 01:29:00,800
um you don't want to like ingest

2441
01:28:58,118 --> 01:29:02,439
anything that actually you know has

2442
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:04,279
molded or got a bunch of the stuff on

2443
01:29:02,439 --> 01:29:05,839
there if you got a clean spot or a clean

2444
01:29:04,279 --> 01:29:08,238
bud that's not touched I think there are

2445
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:09,560
like just a couple then go for it but

2446
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:11,039
really you're going to have a meager

2447
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:12,800
situation the best thing to do is use

2448
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:14,639
that because it's a bio accumulator so

2449
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:16,639
all that good soil and all that good

2450
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:19,199
stuff that you put fed into it right

2451
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:21,079
it's at least inside of it right so you

2452
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:23,599
can chop that up and use it as mulch or

2453
01:29:21,079 --> 01:29:25,800
throw it someplace or you know compost

2454
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:29,840
it son we should we should we should go

2455
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:32,199
to Home Depot and get like a a home uh

2456
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:34,719
like composter no what you need to do

2457
01:29:32,198 --> 01:29:36,879
those don't work um what you got to do

2458
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:39,198
like those little T things the thing

2459
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:42,520
with compost man is you got to have like

2460
01:29:39,198 --> 01:29:45,039
a you got to have at least a 3X3 3ot

2461
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:46,760
wide 3ft tall pile like Mass right in

2462
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:49,719
order to generate enough heat to start

2463
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:51,639
cooking the stuff to to really do break

2464
01:29:49,719 --> 01:29:53,760
it down and sterilize all that good

2465
01:29:51,639 --> 01:29:55,359
stuff but if you only build it 3ft tall

2466
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,880
and 3 foot wide then after like the

2467
01:29:55,359 --> 01:29:59,559
first day or two it runs out of steam

2468
01:29:57,880 --> 01:30:01,359
and stops cooking and then you get a

2469
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:03,119
half ass pile that never finishes and

2470
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:04,679
just kind of sits there and that's where

2471
01:30:03,118 --> 01:30:07,118
everybody gives up you know in their in

2472
01:30:04,679 --> 01:30:10,520
their compost pile so if you build it 5

2473
01:30:07,118 --> 01:30:12,759
foot tall and you know 3 foot or five

2474
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:15,040
foot tall what what I do is I got three

2475
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:17,079
pallets or six pallets from Home Depot

2476
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:18,679
right and I put one pallet on its side

2477
01:30:17,079 --> 01:30:20,238
one pallet in the back and one pallet on

2478
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:22,600
the side and create a little cubby and

2479
01:30:20,238 --> 01:30:24,839
then I make an an identical one on on

2480
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:27,119
this side right and then you pile your

2481
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:28,639
stuff to the top of that you know pallet

2482
01:30:27,118 --> 01:30:31,079
it's like four four and a half feet or

2483
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:32,560
whatever and with one side open the

2484
01:30:31,079 --> 01:30:33,880
front side open yeah with the front side

2485
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:35,320
open so you can kind of shovel stuff in

2486
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:38,400
there or whatever and you just pile it

2487
01:30:35,319 --> 01:30:40,439
up as best you can as it you go green or

2488
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:42,599
you go brown brown and dead green and

2489
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:45,678
wet Brown and dead green and wet so it's

2490
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:48,679
like brown stuff wood and brown Dead

2491
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:50,679
Leaves Brown dead stuff and then like

2492
01:30:48,679 --> 01:30:53,719
green is like green leaves or grass

2493
01:30:50,679 --> 01:30:55,279
clippings or chicken manure stuff or

2494
01:30:53,719 --> 01:30:57,520
what ever you're using that's green and

2495
01:30:55,279 --> 01:31:00,439
wet and you know and you do brown and

2496
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:01,960
brown and green and brown and green soak

2497
01:31:00,439 --> 01:31:03,638
all that down as you're building the

2498
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:07,000
pile and as long as you get it 5 foot

2499
01:31:03,639 --> 01:31:08,639
tall and you know that pallet size wide

2500
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:11,560
it'll start cooking and that thing will

2501
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:14,359
start fraking just over the next two

2502
01:31:11,560 --> 01:31:16,920
days or so will just heat up to like 160

2503
01:31:14,359 --> 01:31:18,920
180 140 somewhere in there depending on

2504
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:20,800
your time of year and it will just start

2505
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:22,440
cooking that stuff and then you after 2

2506
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:24,000
or 3 days then you take your your fork

2507
01:31:22,439 --> 01:31:25,359
and you freaking rotate it over into to

2508
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,158
the next bin that you made and that's

2509
01:31:25,359 --> 01:31:28,839
the sucky thing about compost is cuz the

2510
01:31:27,158 --> 01:31:31,198
only way to actually do it to where

2511
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:32,840
you're not getting Anor robic crap and

2512
01:31:31,198 --> 01:31:34,719
like stuff that you can jam your hand in

2513
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:36,400
and like smear on your face because it

2514
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:37,520
smells like Good Earth and is beautiful

2515
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:39,559
the only way to do it is to do it the

2516
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:41,199
right way those tumblers they don't have

2517
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:42,719
enough mass and you have to like add

2518
01:31:41,198 --> 01:31:44,559
stuff and they're always this sludge

2519
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:45,760
that like you never want to do it

2520
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:48,440
although I have those tumblers and

2521
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,880
they're actually pretty awesome I I I

2522
01:31:48,439 --> 01:31:52,000
you have huge ones yeah you get enough

2523
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:55,279
mass and if you add the compost St each

2524
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:57,238
drum is 55 gallons and it's a dual if

2525
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:59,559
you get them the big yeah if you just

2526
01:31:57,238 --> 01:32:01,759
have the small the small area and never

2527
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:03,039
heats up and I've been to gets so hot

2528
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,679
that's why I love it yeah I've been to

2529
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:05,960
thousands of places and like they have

2530
01:32:04,679 --> 01:32:07,560
these things and they just they just

2531
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:08,560
never break down it's just this nasty

2532
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:10,039
Sledge where you don't want to like

2533
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:13,800
stick your hand in if you don't want to

2534
01:32:10,039 --> 01:32:16,279
stick your hand in it then it ain't comp

2535
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:18,199
I'll bring it's good I'll bring some uh

2536
01:32:16,279 --> 01:32:19,880
next time that's like my judge if it if

2537
01:32:18,198 --> 01:32:22,359
you don't want to like jam your hand in

2538
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:25,159
it and like you know then then you're

2539
01:32:22,359 --> 01:32:26,599
not doing it right so that's the B

2540
01:32:25,158 --> 01:32:28,920
that's the bomb but nine times out of 10

2541
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:30,920
you need that mass and if you do it like

2542
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:32,760
that it cooks really quick you can do it

2543
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:34,199
no matter of what I thought we were

2544
01:32:32,760 --> 01:32:35,760
talking about was just like cutting it

2545
01:32:34,198 --> 01:32:37,678
and just laying it on there but you're

2546
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:39,560
talking about compost but then it

2547
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:41,158
wouldn't thermophilically well if you if

2548
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:42,400
you turned it into the soil you have to

2549
01:32:41,158 --> 01:32:44,719
color you have it's not going to

2550
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:46,238
thermophilic anything no matter what if

2551
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:48,239
you just cut it and lay it down it's

2552
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:49,479
just going to oxidize or break down if

2553
01:32:48,238 --> 01:32:51,399
you just leave it on the surface then

2554
01:32:49,479 --> 01:32:52,638
the sun will be down lose a lot your

2555
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:55,479
you're saying that's okay even though

2556
01:32:52,639 --> 01:32:58,319
you just got hammered with

2557
01:32:55,479 --> 01:32:59,319
is you it's okay no matter what cuz

2558
01:32:58,319 --> 01:33:01,000
you're not you know you don't got

2559
01:32:59,319 --> 01:33:02,719
nothing else you're you're not trying to

2560
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,359
save anything jum on anything new right

2561
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:06,000
yeah you don't have anything left and

2562
01:33:04,359 --> 01:33:07,920
you know those worms are just protein

2563
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,719
and vitamins and minerals and water

2564
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:11,480
anyway so compost the shit out of them

2565
01:33:09,719 --> 01:33:14,039
or bury them and throw them in the soil

2566
01:33:11,479 --> 01:33:15,559
or yeah chop it up I'd be ascy to keep

2567
01:33:14,039 --> 01:33:18,439
cuz I was going to potentially bring

2568
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:19,960
them throw them in my composter at home

2569
01:33:18,439 --> 01:33:21,399
yeah for sure dude and then like I said

2570
01:33:19,960 --> 01:33:22,920
you got all that good stuff that was in

2571
01:33:21,399 --> 01:33:24,559
that soil I'm sure you guys use awesome

2572
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:27,279
stuff right and I mean they they just

2573
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:29,080
loaded themselves up with at least well

2574
01:33:27,279 --> 01:33:30,880
I would want to keep i' want to keep the

2575
01:33:29,079 --> 01:33:32,760
root systems they just plant right next

2576
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:36,279
to them yeah you could so cut it at the

2577
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:38,679
base y yep um and you just read yeah

2578
01:33:36,279 --> 01:33:40,479

Hubble and the wicked witch will have a

2589
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:11,159
tiny bit of CBD on board so you'll have

01:34:19,639 --> 01:34:24,400
that's cool next time there'll be that

2595
01:34:22,158 --> 01:34:27,279
that CBD the 3D

2596
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:29,879
skunk Afghan and then the hubbles the

2597
01:34:27,279 --> 01:34:31,719
flamingo Ringo so you'll get some pinks

2598
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:34,600
uh pink pistol action in that Hubble

2599
01:34:31,719 --> 01:34:38,118
plus that hubbles dog walker so it's gas

2600
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:40,239
with a little bit of this pink CBD

2601
01:34:38,118 --> 01:34:41,839
characteristic so you've got you know it

2602
01:34:40,238 --> 01:34:43,678
dominates on the THC so it gets you

2603
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:45,079
wasted man and actually it has Long

2604
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:48,000
Carry because you have a little bit of

2605
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:50,198
CBD in there you actually that's Hubble

2606
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:53,039
Hubble's the one that people fall in

2607
01:34:50,198 --> 01:34:54,439
love with all the time it's uh one of

2608
01:34:53,039 --> 01:34:56,319
the

2609
01:34:54,439 --> 01:34:58,279
what I love Hubble man I think that's a

2610
01:34:56,319 --> 01:34:59,880
killer one they are the they are the

2611
01:34:58,279 --> 01:35:01,319
most they're like the honory ones like

2612
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:02,920
to get going like they're the ones that

2613
01:35:01,319 --> 01:35:04,519
are like slower growth at the beginning

2614
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:06,679
you know what I mean but they're

2615
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:09,320
Superior you get a good if you get

2616
01:35:06,679 --> 01:35:11,679
phenotype number one I call pheno one of

2617
01:35:09,319 --> 01:35:13,799
the Hubble that's a good dog walker D

2618
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:15,399
with some oh my God it's the F1 well

2619
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:17,279
yeah but no you got to you got to grow

2620
01:35:15,399 --> 01:35:18,879
them in the phenotypes that'll come out

2621
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:20,079
of that F1 you'll have a couple

2622
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,239
different ones you'll have a CBD

2623
01:35:20,079 --> 01:35:24,719
dominant one it'll have CBD and like

2624
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:27,158
pink neon pink hairs and it'll be mostly

2625
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:29,560
CBD dominant you know or one to one you

2626
01:35:27,158 --> 01:35:33,079
know a one to one and it'll have this

2627
01:35:29,560 --> 01:35:36,760
funky papaya Grandma's perfume smell to

2628
01:35:33,079 --> 01:35:38,800
it and then like phenotype one is dog

2629
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:41,920
walker dominant which is the gas and

2630
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:43,360
like the chem res in and you get color

2631
01:35:41,920 --> 01:35:44,960
sometimes you get pink in there too but

2632
01:35:43,359 --> 01:35:48,559
you'll get this extra color but that's

2633
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:50,639
the grease the gas with a little bit of

2634
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:52,199
you know the the pink and a teeny bit of

2635
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:53,920
CBD is in there and that's my favorite

2636
01:35:52,198 --> 01:35:56,359
one to find it's like dog walker with a

2637
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:58,600
smidge of CBD and some some color and

2638
01:35:56,359 --> 01:36:01,599
it's like it's a it's excellent freaking

2639
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:03,159
Plant Man excellent plant and then there

2640
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:05,800

2641
01:36:03,158 --> 01:36:07,839
now I mean yeah that's I thought that

2642
01:36:05,800 --> 01:36:11,400
was a part of what we were doing we just

2643
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:13,039

2647
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:21,238

2648
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:23,880
cuz your voice go you you get a little

2649
01:36:21,238 --> 01:36:25,479
excited I like gas man like that's one

2650
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:28,079
thing like the cool thing about Pam is

2651
01:36:25,479 --> 01:36:30,319
she's not gas like she is she's got tons

2652
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:32,960
of sentimentals she's really rare she

2653
01:36:30,319 --> 01:36:34,840
like phos is garbage but she tested like

2654
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:36,600
kind of unique in the in the scale of

2655
01:36:34,840 --> 01:36:38,039
things in their Galaxy so that's why

2656
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:41,960
I've kept her for so long I worked with

2657
01:36:38,039 --> 01:36:44,238
her which is funny but who knows what's

2658
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:46,800
real and what's not so I don't have any

2659
01:36:44,238 --> 01:36:48,439
like like definitive information on what

2660
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:50,920
she is or where she came from and the

2661
01:36:48,439 --> 01:36:52,678
information that I did get was like

2662
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:55,079
there not there's not a lot she's rare

2663
01:36:52,679 --> 01:36:56,639
you know so I was like okay good to know

2664
01:36:55,079 --> 01:36:58,118
because they yeah yeah so I'm good with

2665
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:00,600
I'm good with that so I've kept her and

2666
01:36:58,118 --> 01:37:02,960
she's she's tough she's resilient she's

2667
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:04,199
huge she's resinous she's pretty she

2668
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:05,639
just doesn't have gas but that's

2669
01:37:04,198 --> 01:37:08,039
interesting that she's something that

2670
01:37:05,639 --> 01:37:09,800
you're not that's not like so so what my

2671
01:37:08,039 --> 01:37:15,279
whole goal in life is is like I need to

2672
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:17,880
put gas into Pam but but Pam dominates

2673
01:37:15,279 --> 01:37:21,198
everything especially gas which is like

2674
01:37:17,880 --> 01:37:23,920
my life's like you

2675
01:37:21,198 --> 01:37:25,879
know it's kind of like you know when

2676
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:27,600
like their parents and family know they

2677
01:37:25,880 --> 01:37:29,960
have a certain type and then like the

2678
01:37:27,600 --> 01:37:32,600
woman they marry is completely off type

2679
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:34,158
that's like you and P but now you have a

2680
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:36,159
mission your mission you're trying to

2681
01:37:34,158 --> 01:37:38,000
turn Pam into your exactly so like she

2682
01:37:36,158 --> 01:37:40,879
is my type you're trying to force Pam to

2683
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:43,679
be something she out of but like when

2684
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:45,719
she'll appreciate it one said but if I'm

2685
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:48,359
if I had a choice and I could get like I

2686

01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:26,599
is like dog walker

2759
01:40:24,319 --> 01:40:30,039
uh there's a triangle cushion Cham 91

2760
01:40:26,599 --> 01:40:33,279
there's by the way I just ordered one of

2761
01:40:30,039 --> 01:40:36,920
these I I ordered the Amazon knockoff of

2762
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:38,599
the Camco uh carbon water hose filter oh

2763
01:40:36,920 --> 01:40:40,560
sweet no that's what I I use those bro

2764
01:40:38,599 --> 01:40:43,119
you do yeah yeah for sure I was like I

2765
01:40:40,560 --> 01:40:46,000
think I'd be happy having cuz I I'm what

2766
01:40:43,118 --> 01:40:47,920
I always have to do every day is I fill

2767
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,520
everything up that I'm going to use the

2768
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:51,480
next day cuz I want to let the water sit

2769
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:53,440
for 24 hours that's great dude I use

2770
01:40:51,479 --> 01:40:55,319
those all the time there's a there's 50

2771
01:40:53,439 --> 01:40:56,598
different manufacturers of the thing

2772
01:40:55,319 --> 01:40:58,559
there's 10 different people that make

2773
01:40:56,599 --> 01:41:00,520
them you can buy them it clearly sells

2774
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:03,039
because Amazon has the Amazon branded

2775
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:06,239
one sure they only do that yeah only

2776
01:41:03,039 --> 01:41:09,000
stuff like my mic stands I have every I

2777
01:41:06,238 --> 01:41:11,238
I have uh light stands they're Amazon

2778
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:12,639
Basics Li and it's interesting to think

2779
01:41:11,238 --> 01:41:15,479
that they just see what sells and

2780
01:41:12,639 --> 01:41:17,920
they're like let's make that let's make

2781
01:41:15,479 --> 01:41:19,399
that it's cheating man that's a way to

2782
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:22,760
do it though I

2783
01:41:19,399 --> 01:41:23,920
guess it's like SP that brands in to

2784
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:25,560
fuck them

2785
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:27,520
I know they're like we're going to I

2786
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:29,840
hate saying buy that on Amazon you know

2787
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:31,719
but I seriously went to camping stores I

2788
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:34,599
went to fabric stores I went to every

2789
01:41:31,719 --> 01:41:36,679
box store I went to every lumber store

2790
01:41:34,599 --> 01:41:38,039
nobody freaking carries like a roll of

2791
01:41:36,679 --> 01:41:39,920
that stuff and if anybody knows of a

2792
01:41:38,039 --> 01:41:41,399
place let me know but I've I've went

2793
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:43,639
through hell over the last year so I

2794
01:41:41,399 --> 01:41:45,638
just find it on Amazon you can find

2795
01:41:43,639 --> 01:41:48,239
shade cloth and stuff at uh some of

2796
01:41:45,639 --> 01:41:50,400
these but not mosquito net that's weird

2797
01:41:48,238 --> 01:41:52,198
so weird dude so weird I bet you in

2798
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:53,879
Florida it's different they probably

2799
01:41:52,198 --> 01:41:55,759
have mosquito netting more places there

2800
01:41:53,880 --> 01:41:58,800
cuz they got mosquitoes know more

2801
01:41:55,760 --> 01:42:00,400
prevalently you say oh no it was Pedro

2802
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:02,119
this morning who said he has mosquitoes

2803
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:04,158
down in Orange County and I was like

2804
01:42:02,118 --> 01:42:05,598
really cuz I never see we got tons of

2805
01:42:04,158 --> 01:42:06,839
them in my house man I got tons of them

2806
01:42:05,599 --> 01:42:08,199
yeah they're 30 ft from their water

2807
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:09,760
source so if you got water standing

2808
01:42:08,198 --> 01:42:12,158
somewhere there's mosquitoes there but

2809
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:15,560
do you notice that in La there aren't

2810
01:42:12,158 --> 01:42:18,399
really yeah there's not a lot of life in

2811
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:19,880
La mosquitoes need plants and soil no

2812
01:42:18,399 --> 01:42:21,759
but I mean it's amazing cuz I I come

2813
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:24,599
from the East Coast where like every

2814
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:26,960
summer every summer you're just like my

2815
01:42:24,599 --> 01:42:29,920
wife my wife from Rochester New York

2816
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:31,439
yeah I know about that yeah it's like I

2817
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:34,319
couldn't believe that man like you guys

2818
01:42:31,439 --> 01:42:36,319
live like this no it's not as bad here

2819
01:42:34,319 --> 01:42:38,519
there's not as many but in my house man

2820
01:42:36,319 --> 01:42:40,158
I mean I got tons of mosquitoes if

2821
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:42,040
especially if I let drains and stuff

2822
01:42:40,158 --> 01:42:44,519
fill up you know I got to use little

2823
01:42:42,039 --> 01:42:47,439
it's interesting when it rains here and

2824
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:51,679
just the life that explodes like up in

2825
01:42:47,439 --> 01:42:56,759
Tanga where it's just like Aid

2826
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:58,800
vicious eco system and then the r in and

2827
01:42:56,760 --> 01:43:00,039
like think about like that though you

2828
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:01,440
look at all the hillsides right and

2829
01:43:00,039 --> 01:43:03,519
they're all covered with that native

2830
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:05,000
Shrubbery right that shrubs and all

2831
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:08,119
those little dead plants and like the

2832
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:10,118
native like stuff the native crap

2833
01:43:08,118 --> 01:43:12,039
basically that's your soil regulator and

2834
01:43:10,118 --> 01:43:13,679
that just sits there with the with

2835
01:43:12,039 --> 01:43:15,479
protects the biology gives it that

2836
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:17,000
buffer zone and you look at any Hillside

2837
01:43:15,479 --> 01:43:18,638
you drive on any freeway you look at any

2838
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,399
Hillside that we're not watering you'll

2839
01:43:18,639 --> 01:43:23,520
never see bare ground it'll always be

2840
01:43:20,399 --> 01:43:25,118
like native Shrubbery or like weeds or

2841
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:26,719
something will cover that land because

2842
01:43:25,118 --> 01:43:29,000
Mother Nature won't allow that to happen

2843
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:30,639
so it's like as soon as it rains all

2844
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,479
that biology has been temperature

2845
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:33,960
regulated and protected and it's just

2846
01:43:32,479 --> 01:43:35,839
lying dormant waiting for the rain to

2847
01:43:33,960 --> 01:43:37,719
happen so it happens like instantly cuz

2848
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:40,319
it's it's fully alive and then you water

2849
01:43:37,719 --> 01:43:41,920
it evenly and temperatures and moisture

2850
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:44,359
levels are all even and it shit just

2851
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:46,560
comes alive like this and then death

2852
01:43:44,359 --> 01:43:49,519
comes back two month no water and then

2853
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:52,000
everybody goes dormant but all that crap

2854
01:43:49,520 --> 01:43:54,400
goes dormant and returns those nutrients

2855
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,880
to the surface and protects everything

2856
01:43:54,399 --> 01:43:58,598
until the next rain comes and it's just

2857
01:43:55,880 --> 01:44:00,400
trippy just to when you just it's so

2858
01:43:58,599 --> 01:44:02,840
weird you just you'll never see it the

2859
01:44:00,399 --> 01:44:05,638

long so you what's your like drying

2895
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:33,639
curing

2896
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:35,520
process um since you just finished it

2897
01:45:33,639 --> 01:45:37,960
with this well I wouldn't call that

2898
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:39,400
finished I'd say it's in process it's

2899
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:43,880
what we're smoking because that's what

2900
01:45:39,399 --> 01:45:46,439
we're smoking um but I like to hang it

2901
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:48,118
pretty much full plant hang you know if

2902
01:45:46,439 --> 01:45:51,039
if they're 7f Footers I got to cut it

2903
01:45:48,118 --> 01:45:53,118
into three sections because I can't hang

2904
01:45:51,039 --> 01:45:55,158
you know seven eight Footers like is

2905
01:45:53,118 --> 01:45:56,719
easy with the floor space and stuff so

2906
01:45:55,158 --> 01:45:59,679
you got to cut it into like pieces a

2907
01:45:56,719 --> 01:46:02,239
couple of pieces but fewer pieces the

2908
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:04,639
better I think keeping the bigger stems

2909
01:46:02,238 --> 01:46:08,198
and stuff on there is what I do and then

2910
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:10,079
I hang them I have a couple of big tents

2911
01:46:08,198 --> 01:46:12,158
that sit empty that I don't use anymore

2912
01:46:10,079 --> 01:46:15,719
that I use big tents big old

2913
01:46:12,158 --> 01:46:17,598
oldfashioned like there like a 5x5 a 6

2914
01:46:15,719 --> 01:46:19,198
by something just a couple old tents

2915
01:46:17,599 --> 01:46:22,440
that I just don't use anymore so I set

2916
01:46:19,198 --> 01:46:24,359
them up about you know a month ago and I

2917
01:46:22,439 --> 01:46:26,598
start hanging H and stuff in the tents

2918
01:46:24,359 --> 01:46:28,880
and they sit in there there's no fan

2919
01:46:26,599 --> 01:46:30,560
they sit open and then they're in a

2920
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:34,960
temperature controlled room so like the

2921
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:36,639
room itself is like 60 68° you know it

2922
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:38,480
doesn't get like it doesn't get I would

2923
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:41,760
love to have it at 55 you know and

2924
01:46:38,479 --> 01:46:43,079
colder heated by the sun huh by the sun

2925
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:45,000
no I have a little little air

2926
01:46:43,079 --> 01:46:46,599
conditioning in this particular space

2927
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:49,118
it's nothing crazy and I can only get it

2928
01:46:46,599 --> 01:46:52,199
to about 68° is like the coldest without

2929
01:46:49,118 --> 01:46:54,519
causing a problem um so that's where

2930
01:46:52,198 --> 01:46:56,960
they sit for

2931
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:58,199
7 to 10 days s to you know something

2932
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:00,719
like that depending on the year if it's

2933
01:46:58,198 --> 01:47:02,399
Santa Anna like it was when those came

2934
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:04,239
down I mean it was like it was harder to

2935
01:47:02,399 --> 01:47:06,198
keep it you know the the more leaves you

2936
01:47:04,238 --> 01:47:07,678
keep on there the more stuff you keep on

2937
01:47:06,198 --> 01:47:09,638
there the the the more you can slow it

2938
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:12,520
down so I left more foliage on there you

2939
01:47:09,639 --> 01:47:14,239
know during that time uh but yeah you're

2940
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:16,560
yeah s to 10 days they're hanging there

2941
01:47:14,238 --> 01:47:19,079
and then they come out they go into bins

2942
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:21,520
big plastic bins and they kind of sit

2943
01:47:19,079 --> 01:47:23,079
there and the bins the tops don't go on

2944
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:24,639
the bins but they're on the bins you

2945
01:47:23,079 --> 01:47:26,039
know cuz kind of air can kind of get in

2946
01:47:24,639 --> 01:47:27,199
there but then they kind of rehydrate a

2947
01:47:26,039 --> 01:47:28,439
little bit you know by sitting in the

2948
01:47:27,198 --> 01:47:31,638
bins for a little bit and they're in

2949
01:47:28,439 --> 01:47:34,719
that same room same temperature and then

2950
01:47:31,639 --> 01:47:39,800
I start you know when everybody's asleep

2951
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:43,039
and I'm not too dead I go to trim jail

2952
01:47:39,800 --> 01:47:45,119
and I I break out the trim bins and I

2953
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:47,000
set up all my stuff and I get the the

2954
01:47:45,118 --> 01:47:48,639
things going and we you know we go to

2955
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:51,118
town and I usually trim for freaking

2956
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:52,679
months man because and I don't trim very

2957
01:47:51,118 --> 01:47:54,759
much I mean this is the most trimmed you

2958
01:47:52,679 --> 01:47:56,800
ow see it and I just kind of like I even

2959
01:47:54,760 --> 01:47:58,480
like Hal trimmed part of it just to make

2960
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:01,119
them you know not look all leafy in the

2961
01:47:58,479 --> 01:48:02,919
bag you know but I try to keep stuff on

2962
01:48:01,118 --> 01:48:06,880
it through time because I can't get to

2963
01:48:02,920 --> 01:48:09,000
it all myself yeah you know has you know

2964
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:10,840
I have you know all kinds of stuff I run

2965
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,639
all kinds of businesses I got kids I got

2966
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:14,960
yeah I got to do it and so it takes me a

2967
01:48:12,639 --> 01:48:15,880
while to get the trim stuff done so but

2968
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:19,000
whatever

2969
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:20,880
you are you is it you're not do you have

2970
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:22,920
a light you're not putting it out into

2971
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:25,599
no no yeah no so every summer I'll grow

2972
01:48:22,920 --> 01:48:28,679
enough like so last summer is like my

2973
01:48:25,599 --> 01:48:31,360
seed summer I made all seed and all my

2974
01:48:28,679 --> 01:48:34,520
stuff was in the ground big plants for

2975
01:48:31,359 --> 01:48:37,279
seed and that that stocks up my seed you

2976
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:39,320
know uh my coolers for my seed and then

2977
01:48:37,279 --> 01:48:41,719
that that hurt my productivity for last

2978
01:48:39,319 --> 01:48:43,479
year because 90% of my crop was for seed

2979
01:48:41,719 --> 01:48:45,560
and then I had to rely on my indoor crop

2980
01:48:43,479 --> 01:48:48,598
you know to pull my my smoke you know

2981
01:48:45,560 --> 01:48:51,840
what I mean but yeah so this year was

2982
01:48:48,599 --> 01:48:54,159
the crop for for setting up the setting

2983
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:56,679
up the season and then now I'll go into

2984
01:48:54,158 --> 01:48:59,118
seed and I'll do seed through the rest

2985
01:48:56,679 --> 01:49:00,840
of this season and then the winter and

2986
01:48:59,118 --> 01:49:02,158
stuff like that I'll go work on my seed

2987
01:49:00,840 --> 01:49:03,639
stuff but basically afterwards you're

2988
01:49:02,158 --> 01:49:05,319
going to keep it on the vine for as long

2989
01:49:03,639 --> 01:49:07,239
as possible yeah on the vine as long as

2990
01:49:05,319 --> 01:49:09,880
possible and uh cuz we've seen that even

2991
01:49:07,238 --> 01:49:13,039
commercially people are getting into

2992
01:49:09,880 --> 01:49:15,599
like selling it yeah yeah on the vine

2993
01:49:13,039 --> 01:49:17,960

3017
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:04,359
that thing yeah this is the Falco 820

3018
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:08,599
wouldn't go anywhere without

3019
01:50:04,359 --> 01:50:10,279
it wow thing is a wow thing is a beast

3020
01:50:08,599 --> 01:50:11,960
don't put your finger I could yeah I

3021
01:50:10,279 --> 01:50:13,399
always I always wished for a daughter so

3022
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:14,639
that I could strap her boyfriend down

3023
01:50:13,399 --> 01:50:16,519
and then take him into the garage and

3024
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:18,239
just start hacking on freaking things

3025
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:19,880
you know cuz I can cut through I mean I

3026
01:50:18,238 --> 01:50:21,359
can cut through all this stuff I mean I

3027
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:24,239
can cut through this trunk of this tree

3028
01:50:21,359 --> 01:50:28,719
with one one swoop and it it it'll go

3029
01:50:24,238 --> 01:50:30,439
through 3 in like cheddar um one of the

3030
01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:31,960
coolest plants on planet Earth I mean

3031
01:50:30,439 --> 01:50:33,479
planet tools on planet Earth and it

3032
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:36,158
saves my life too cuz I do tons of

3033
01:50:33,479 --> 01:50:37,399
pruning it's all push button and I was

3034
01:50:36,158 --> 01:50:38,879
going to have to have surgeries and

3035
01:50:37,399 --> 01:50:40,559
stuff and it and it completely

3036
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:42,359
rehabilitated me you have good control

3037
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:45,560
on it so you can do yeah so check it out

3038
01:50:42,359 --> 01:50:48,759
so you can shorten it down to small

3039
01:50:45,560 --> 01:50:50,440
precise rapid cut motion right you want

3040
01:50:48,760 --> 01:50:52,079
bigger Cuts you can get it up to Lopper

3041
01:50:50,439 --> 01:50:53,638
size right like that and then if you

3042
01:50:52,078 --> 01:50:55,238
really want

3043
01:50:53,639 --> 01:50:56,760
you have Precision control so you can

3044
01:50:55,238 --> 01:50:58,198
just press it and it's got Precision

3045
01:50:56,760 --> 01:51:00,000
control so you can really be intricate

3046
01:50:58,198 --> 01:51:02,839
it's the same exact freaking tool as my

3047
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,158
sidearm here exactly except it don't

3048
01:51:02,840 --> 01:51:05,960
take any strength which is the best

3049
01:51:04,158 --> 01:51:09,158
thing in the world it's not cheap like

3050
01:51:05,960 --> 01:51:10,599
Bic robot arm it is a robot arm it's a

3051
01:51:09,158 --> 01:51:12,158
and that's the battery yeah it's a

3052
01:51:10,599 --> 01:51:13,880
battery pack I can store two batteries

3053
01:51:12,158 --> 01:51:16,039
in here which is cool and the cool thing

3054
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:18,520
about it is I can charge this thing and

3055
01:51:16,039 --> 01:51:20,078
like I think I can get up to like you

3056
01:51:18,520 --> 01:51:22,199
know somewhere around 24 hours of

3057
01:51:20,078 --> 01:51:25,039
constant use you know or close to it

3058
01:51:22,198 --> 01:51:28,319
maybe you know more than half a day a

3059
01:51:25,039 --> 01:51:29,840
constant use like constant use like stff

3060
01:51:28,319 --> 01:51:32,439
it's my best friend I mean one charge

3061
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:34,800
usually lasts me a couple days because a

3062
01:51:32,439 --> 01:51:36,238
big tree that normally took me 3 hours

3063
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,000
now takes me an hour and a half you know

3064
01:51:36,238 --> 01:51:40,000
what I mean it cut my time in half mouth

3065
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:42,118
only gets so far open so is there a

3066
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:44,279
larger version there is other versions

3067
01:51:42,118 --> 01:51:47,039
but once if it's any bigger than this

3068
01:51:44,279 --> 01:51:48,800
big then I have uh and I got my saws and

3069
01:51:47,039 --> 01:51:50,920
chainsaws and other saws like that that

3070
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:53,159
are there but like changing tools and

3071
01:51:50,920 --> 01:51:54,520
stuff like I used to have to tools all

3072
01:51:53,158 --> 01:51:56,920
the time cuz you can't cut stuff with

3073
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:59,320
this like that you know so saves so much

3074
01:51:56,920 --> 01:52:00,960
time let's let's let's give me the

3075
01:51:59,319 --> 01:52:02,439
biggest one where's the biggest let's

3076
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:04,000
let's cut it down so you can see it in

3077
01:52:02,439 --> 01:52:06,799
action okay let's see here let's just

3078
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:09,560
get this cleaned

3079
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:12,440
up shorten it down so it's

3080
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:15,119
quicker all right you do any type of

3081
01:52:12,439 --> 01:52:19,039
pruning or rose pruning or fruit tree

3082
01:52:15,118 --> 01:52:22,519
pruning or ganja prun I mean and you do

3083
01:52:19,039 --> 01:52:23,679
a lot of it save your life man use a

3084
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:25,280
they have other ones that are a lot

3085
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:27,199
cheaper than this one that are like

3086
01:52:25,279 --> 01:52:28,719
compressed air that do a similar thing

3087
01:52:27,198 --> 01:52:31,279
you can just pop in a little little

3088
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:32,920
whipp it thing or whatever and uh you

3089
01:52:31,279 --> 01:52:34,559
can kind of go to yeah yeah come and

3090
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:37,480
come go to town for a little while you

3091
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:40,760
know and they work pretty good so I

3092
01:52:37,479 --> 01:52:43,879
mean sorry home

3093
01:52:40,760 --> 01:52:45,920
skillet looks like like a poodle that

3094
01:52:43,880 --> 01:52:47,560
got shaved right I'm going to cut it

3095
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:50,279
down to the ground level cuz we want to

3096
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:52,159
you know utilize this right one cut

3097
01:52:50,279 --> 01:52:54,439
beautiful nice and clean see you later

3098
01:52:52,158 --> 01:52:54,439
brother

3099
01:52:54,520 --> 01:52:57,639
you know that's the cambium layer that

3100
01:52:56,279 --> 01:53:00,039
Green Layer right in there this is like

3101
01:52:57,639 --> 01:53:01,599
your you know this is your your cambium

3102
01:53:00,039 --> 01:53:03,599
this is where we do lots of grafting and

3103
01:53:01,599 --> 01:53:05,800
stuff this is where we would split it

3104
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:07,159
and I would put you know I'd put

3105
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:09,039
something into this bark if this was

3106
01:53:07,158 --> 01:53:10,719
upside down this was the trunk of a tree

3107
01:53:09,039 --> 01:53:13,118
and I cut the head off of it and I

3108
01:53:10,719 --> 01:53:15,480
wanted to actually graph this plant so

3109
01:53:13,118 --> 01:53:18,479
like we're talking like plums yeah

3110
01:53:15,479 --> 01:53:21,439
Citrus avocado whatever you basically

3111
01:53:18,479 --> 01:53:24,439
cut off the say

3112
01:53:21,439 --> 01:53:24,439
here

3113
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:28,520
right say that's a tree right we cut his

3114
01:53:26,679 --> 01:53:29,960
head off we want to make this a

3115
01:53:28,520 --> 01:53:31,880
different tree and this is a plum and I

3116
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:33,399
want to put a cherry on it you know you

3117
01:53:31,880 --> 01:53:34,400
come up here you cut it head out nice

3118
01:53:33,399 --> 01:53:37,879
and clean it's where you got a good

3119
01:53:34,399 --> 01:53:39,279
cambium there and we take this sucker

3120
01:53:37,880 --> 01:53:42,920
and we'll split the

3121
01:53:39,279 --> 01:53:45,359
bark just like so kind of rock it in

3122
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:47,760
there give it a good press and then I

3123
01:53:45,359 --> 01:53:47,759
can

3124
01:53:48,158 --> 01:53:53,078
actually crack this off a little bit and

3125
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:54,920
this is not the tool to use but I can do

3126
01:53:53,078 --> 01:53:57,719
it cuz I've done it a million times

3127
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:59,158
super siiz knife and then you take uh

3128
01:53:57,719 --> 01:54:02,118
the plant that you really want you're

3129
01:53:59,158 --> 01:54:05,960
like oh man I want the I want this

3130
01:54:02,118 --> 01:54:05,960
freaking TK on

3131
01:54:08,198 --> 01:54:15,039
the on the freaking you make a little uh

3132
01:54:13,238 --> 01:54:16,479
it's got to be nice and clean and not be

3133
01:54:15,039 --> 01:54:18,279
nice and sharp which is why you want to

3134
01:54:16,479 --> 01:54:20,279
use your your grafting knife or

3135
01:54:18,279 --> 01:54:22,519
something that's really Mak nice not not

3136
01:54:20,279 --> 01:54:25,439
your D knife yeah not the one that does

3137
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:29,400
my digging but the

3138
01:54:25,439 --> 01:54:31,879
idea is you expose about an inch and a

3139
01:54:29,399 --> 01:54:33,439
half or so of the cambium layer on this

3140
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:35,239
side and you can leave this back side

3141
01:54:33,439 --> 01:54:36,559
here you make a little bit better cut

3142
01:54:35,238 --> 01:54:37,919
here but the idea since we're not

3143
01:54:36,560 --> 01:54:40,239
talking about grafting and then you

3144
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:45,639
slide this hand just like a a little

3145
01:54:40,238 --> 01:54:48,399
pencil gently you tape it up yep

3146
01:54:45,639 --> 01:54:50,760
gently

3147
01:54:48,399 --> 01:54:52,598
and and then on this side you can see it

3148
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:53,800
like and if this was a fruit tree i'

3149
01:54:52,599 --> 01:54:56,360
slice this down a little bit more and

3150
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:58,279
really make it perfect but the idea is

3151
01:54:56,359 --> 01:55:02,799
to break open that cambium layer

3152
01:54:58,279 --> 01:55:04,719
slightly oh yeah you pop you pop it into

3153
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:08,199
the side into this cambium lay so that

3154
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:10,319
the part you cut Falls right in line

3155
01:55:08,198 --> 01:55:12,638
with the other stuff and we take some

3156
01:55:10,319 --> 01:55:16,078
tape or some grafting wax and we tape

3157
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:17,760
that sucker up and bang this thing would

3158
01:55:16,078 --> 01:55:19,000
uh harden off at the right time of year

3159
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:21,000
and would all of a sudden fuse and then

3160
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:22,560
this would be your own tree of whatever

3161
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,158
variety you put in using this is the

3162
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:25,280
root stock that's how they graft all

3163
01:55:24,158 --> 01:55:26,879
your fruits you know that's one of the

3164
01:55:25,279 --> 01:55:29,118
ways they do it's called a b graft so

3165
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:31,078
it' be like if you gave my if you put

3166
01:55:29,118 --> 01:55:33,158
like my brain onto a different body

3167
01:55:31,078 --> 01:55:35,198
exactly yeah two different plants on One

3168
01:55:33,158 --> 01:55:37,399
Tree I'd be like thank you for the use

3169
01:55:35,198 --> 01:55:40,078
of your body exactly exactly have the

3170
01:55:37,399 --> 01:55:41,920
genetics of both yeah yeah um now could

3171
01:55:40,078 --> 01:55:44,880
you do this with weed you can do this

3172
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:46,599
with weed I've never um what was the wax

3173
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:48,319
you talked about there stuff called

3174
01:55:46,599 --> 01:55:50,560
grafting wax you can use any wax

3175
01:55:48,319 --> 01:55:51,639
honestly I use I've used candle wax

3176
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:53,079
where you just coll light a candle and

3177
01:55:51,639 --> 01:55:54,359
you're literally ripping wax on there

3178
01:55:53,078 --> 01:55:56,479
and basically you're just sealing up all

3179
01:55:54,359 --> 01:55:58,238
the air holes and you want to tape this

3180
01:55:56,479 --> 01:56:00,959
really good with some stretchy tape or a

3181
01:55:58,238 --> 01:56:02,399
graphing tape or you can use electrical

3182
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:03,840
tape you can use the various things but

3183
01:56:02,399 --> 01:56:05,238
you're basically going to push this down

3184
01:56:03,840 --> 01:56:06,679
as high as you can to force it against

3185
01:56:05,238 --> 01:56:08,678
itself so what about this that you want

3186
01:56:06,679 --> 01:56:10,440
to close up all of that in there yeah so

3187
01:56:08,679 --> 01:56:12,920
then you would you don't want to put wax

3188
01:56:10,439 --> 01:56:15,399
inside of any hole you want to smear it

3189
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:17,078
over the top so that it doesn't like

3190
01:56:15,399 --> 01:56:18,439
fall in there very easily how the fuck

3191
01:56:17,078 --> 01:56:20,359
do you keep it from falling in it's

3192
01:56:18,439 --> 01:56:21,759
thick wax and it and it and'll you can

3193
01:56:20,359 --> 01:56:23,679
kind of just smear it over the top so it

3194
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:25,920
doesn't fall you know I mean or you can

3195
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:27,840
use tape and and it's an art that's part

3196
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:29,078
of the that's a part of the skill you

3197
01:56:27,840 --> 01:56:30,360
know what I mean it's like taking out a

3198
01:56:29,078 --> 01:56:32,359
transmission or whatever there's little

3199
01:56:30,359 --> 01:56:33,839
tricks that dudes do that we can you

3200
01:56:32,359 --> 01:56:36,279
know get away with things that are like

3201
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:38,319
how the fuck did he do that but no wax

3202
01:56:36,279 --> 01:56:40,439
down but you don't want to jam wax into

3203
01:56:38,319 --> 01:56:42,399
the cut because then that will seal off

3204
01:56:40,439 --> 01:56:44,919
the connection of where it needs to be

3205
01:56:42,399 --> 01:56:46,519
touching to fuse together so you want to

3206
01:56:44,920 --> 01:56:48,118
cover it so air and water can kind of

3207
01:56:46,520 --> 01:56:49,599
get in there and you can use tape to do

3208
01:56:48,118 --> 01:56:52,319
that you can use it just depends on what

3209
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:54,239
you have in hand how good you are but um

3210
01:56:52,319 --> 01:56:56,479
that's that's a cool little side

3211
01:56:54,238 --> 01:56:58,759
Sidetrack thing on this grafting which

3212
01:56:56,479 --> 01:57:02,039
is funny um but yeah you can technically

3213
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:04,159
do it with Canabis I've never uh set up

3214
01:57:02,039 --> 01:57:06,760
a plant which I meant to for years to

3215
01:57:04,158 --> 01:57:08,920
just set up a host plant and Pam would

3216
01:57:06,760 --> 01:57:11,000
be a good host plant for that and you

3217
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:13,158
can do it on another species right like

3218
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:16,960
you could graph the Cannabis

3219
01:57:13,158 --> 01:57:18,920
onto hops the same family right so I

3220
01:57:16,960 --> 01:57:20,920
don't know 100% if it would be

3221
01:57:18,920 --> 01:57:22,560
successful but Hops and cannabis are

3222
01:57:20,920 --> 01:57:24,760
related I don't know if it's Clos enough

3223
01:57:22,560 --> 01:57:26,320
related where we could actually graft it

3224
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:28,320
but they have to be in the same family

3225
01:57:26,319 --> 01:57:29,439
they have to be like like prunus plums

3226
01:57:28,319 --> 01:57:32,078
and peaches and stuff they're all a

3227
01:57:29,439 --> 01:57:33,839
family of prunus you know so um they

3228
01:57:32,078 --> 01:57:35,279
have to be in the same family Citrus you

3229
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:37,400
can do it with Citrus you can put an

3230
01:57:35,279 --> 01:57:38,719
orange a lemon on a Grapefruit Tangerine

3231
01:57:37,399 --> 01:57:40,399
All in One Tree and I a little citrus

3232
01:57:38,719 --> 01:57:42,279
salad graft and they do that which is

3233
01:57:40,399 --> 01:57:44,679
totally cool but it's all citrus they

3234
01:57:42,279 --> 01:57:46,960
all got to be relatives you know um wait

3235
01:57:44,679 --> 01:57:50,319
so you could on like the same base you

3236
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:53,239
could have like one arm that's a that's

3237
01:57:50,319 --> 01:57:55,479
grapefruit the next arm's a green one's

3238
01:57:53,238 --> 01:57:58,638
that orange as you know as many as you

3239
01:57:55,479 --> 01:58:00,519
can support or success they sell them in

3240
01:57:58,639 --> 01:58:02,480
like four or five graphs already if you

3241
01:58:00,520 --> 01:58:04,320
go to like a just a Retail Nursery and

3242
01:58:02,479 --> 01:58:05,718
you're like I want a citrus salad tree

3243
01:58:04,319 --> 01:58:08,399
or a fruit salad tree they call them

3244
01:58:05,719 --> 01:58:10,599
fruit salad or citrus salad you know the

3245
01:58:08,399 --> 01:58:13,559
citrus salad will have a lemon a lime an

3246
01:58:10,599 --> 01:58:15,920
orange a tangerine and like a grapefruit

3247
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:17,280
or some other type of tangelo or some

3248
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:19,960
random fruit but you have like the

3249
01:58:17,279 --> 01:58:21,880
Staples plus one uh and you can buy that

3250
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:24,920
tree for like 200 bucks in like a retail

3251
01:58:21,880 --> 01:58:28,118
shop you know and plant as long as with

3252
01:58:24,920 --> 01:58:30,359
graphs each branch is its own tree so

3253
01:58:28,118 --> 01:58:32,198
each it has its own personality and and

3254
01:58:30,359 --> 01:58:35,279
own growth habit and own like things

3255
01:58:32,198 --> 01:58:37,198
that it wants to do so you have to keep

3256
01:58:35,279 --> 01:58:38,359
them all equal size cuz there's always

3257
01:58:37,198 --> 01:58:39,960
going to be one I always say there's

3258
01:58:38,359 --> 01:58:41,479
always one big brother that wants to

3259
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:42,639
grow bigger and stronger and faster than

3260
01:58:41,479 --> 01:58:44,399
the other two big brothers and he'll

3261
01:58:42,639 --> 01:58:45,599
dominate the other ones out of existence

3262
01:58:44,399 --> 01:58:47,719
he'll take more of their food their

3263
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:50,119
nutrients and then all of a sudden your

3264
01:58:47,719 --> 01:58:52,118
graphs start getting depleted and you

3265
01:58:50,118 --> 01:58:54,960
got this one thing that was really tough

3266
01:58:52,118 --> 01:58:57,639
so you keep them pruned so that each

3267
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:59,439
graft is about the same equal size mass

3268
01:58:57,639 --> 01:59:00,880
and then they'll all play together and

3269
01:58:59,439 --> 01:59:03,039
have a good time so they just it's it's

3270
01:59:00,880 --> 01:59:05,159
more of a like a talking concept and

3271
01:59:03,039 --> 01:59:08,439
like I got this this is really cool it's

3272
01:59:05,158 --> 01:59:10,039
a Pastime thing production it sucks

3273
01:59:08,439 --> 01:59:11,479
don't plant that tree cuz you're doing

3274
01:59:10,039 --> 01:59:13,238
all kinds of stuff and you got to prune

3275
01:59:11,479 --> 01:59:14,839
it too much and your production suffers

3276
01:59:13,238 --> 01:59:18,718
and it's just like you know it's just

3277
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:20,078
it's a lot of work but it's very cool um

3278
01:59:18,719 --> 01:59:24,039
very cool all right so let's see you do

3279
01:59:20,078 --> 01:59:24,039
this one all right

3280
01:59:27,880 --> 01:59:34,679
That's it man if you had one on each arm

3281
01:59:30,359 --> 01:59:34,679
I know Edward Scissor

3282
01:59:39,279 --> 01:59:42,800
Hands FAL

3283
01:59:43,039 --> 01:59:47,560
a20 and then we can just leave this on

3284
01:59:45,479 --> 01:59:48,799
top you put it in here I would dig it in

3285
01:59:47,560 --> 01:59:51,760
you know if you want to get its full

3286
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:53,480
maximum benefit but then or you cover it

3287
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:54,880
with mulch or you cover it because if

3288
01:59:53,479 --> 01:59:58,000
you just leave this on the surfice this

3289
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:59,560
sun will oxidize a lot of that nutrition

3290
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:01,560
and you won't get its full benefit

3291
01:59:59,560 --> 02:00:03,199
you'll get benefit but you won't get it

3292
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:05,760
like you know the the

3293
02:00:03,198 --> 02:00:07,319
full the full deal so however you kind

3294
02:00:05,760 --> 02:00:10,320
of want to but I would dig it in there

3295
02:00:07,319 --> 02:00:12,960
and cover it this is our rebirth yeah

3296
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:14,799
totally um yeah I'm sorry dude I'm sorry

3297
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:16,279
brother well that's okay I mean the

3298
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:18,159
thing is is that this is a lesson right

3299
02:00:16,279 --> 02:00:20,679
here taught you man but they also they

3300
02:00:18,158 --> 02:00:24,359
did so well up until that point that

3301
02:00:20,679 --> 02:00:26,359
there's a lot you take it for

3302
02:00:24,359 --> 02:00:29,639
sure yeah man every year is a new

3303
02:00:26,359 --> 02:00:31,359
learning experience bro that I learned

3304
02:00:29,639 --> 02:00:32,880
something new maybe just yeah I was

3305
02:00:31,359 --> 02:00:34,598
going to say right now we could cut some

3306
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:35,840
of these up into smaller pieces and we

3307
02:00:34,599 --> 02:00:38,960
can just bury them

3308
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:40,599
later I always make killer poers out of

3309
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:42,078
you know a good stemmer to man make some

3310
02:00:40,599 --> 02:00:43,800
killer pokers out of those things I make

3311
02:00:42,078 --> 02:00:46,158
a mic stand out of a few just like that

3312

02:01:18,599 --> 02:01:23,920
those tops up a little bit better see if

3328
02:01:22,158 --> 02:01:25,039

3332
02:01:33,319 --> 02:01:37,158
like it's about two grand for the thing

3333
02:01:35,639 --> 02:01:41,880
they're like yeah probably

3334
02:01:37,158 --> 02:01:46,158
1,800 save up for that one

3335
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:47,520
uh you can get you can yeah you can get

3336
02:01:46,158 --> 02:01:49,559
uh you can get like I said before you

3337
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:51,960
can get the ones that are less um

3338
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:54,119
expensive they're for like $4 or $500

3339
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:55,679
this plant was not here my my Gardener

3340
02:01:54,118 --> 02:01:58,759
actually actually some of these look

3341
02:01:55,679 --> 02:02:00,639
good it's it has nothing to do with this

3342
02:01:58,760 --> 02:02:03,760
let's get that out of here I was going

3343
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:04,679
to say is like here all my fing check

3344
02:02:03,760 --> 02:02:05,920
this out check this out let's see what

3345
02:02:04,679 --> 02:02:08,158
this says actually while we're standing

3346
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:11,399
here temperature yeah let's see what it

3347
02:02:08,158 --> 02:02:13,638
says just for GRS

3348
02:02:11,399 --> 02:02:15,679
right it's probably not bad but let's

3349
02:02:13,639 --> 02:02:18,039
just see what it says this one yeah this

3350
02:02:15,679 --> 02:02:20,039
looks okay this one does look okay this

3351
02:02:18,039 --> 02:02:22,880
looks pretty good actually have you been

3352
02:02:20,039 --> 02:02:24,319
picking uh

3353
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:28,159
I haven't found any

3354
02:02:24,319 --> 02:02:31,158
93 so what does that mean so above

3355
02:02:28,158 --> 02:02:33,198
85 110 on the outside of that fabric pot

3356
02:02:31,158 --> 02:02:35,839
right there you got 110 right there wow

3357
02:02:33,198 --> 02:02:37,839
how hot is it outside right now I think

3358
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:40,800
it's less than 110 oh it's a lot less

3359
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:43,078
than 110 it's like 70° it's like 75°

3360
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:45,599
right so so if you you can imagine like

3361
02:02:43,078 --> 02:02:47,279
this sitting in the sun it's 110 right

3362
02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:49,880
now it's not 110 throughout that whole

3363
02:02:47,279 --> 02:02:52,039
thing but everywhere where those surface

3364
02:02:49,880 --> 02:02:53,960
roots are everywhere where that that

3365
02:02:52,039 --> 02:02:56,800
most action is there where the life is

3366
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:58,920
happening it's it's above 85 degrees and

3367
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:01,520
when you get above 85 Degrees most

3368
02:02:58,920 --> 02:03:03,679
plants are like fuck that they start

3369
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:05,679
shutting down they stop drinking water

3370
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:07,000
and then usually above 85 Dees the

3371
02:03:05,679 --> 02:03:08,399
workers that live in the soil the

3372
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,760
microbes and other things they don't

3373
02:03:08,399 --> 02:03:11,399
live there or they don't want to work

3374
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:13,800
anymore so they go to sleep I'm going to

3375
02:03:11,399 --> 02:03:15,879
take they go they die they do that and

3376
02:03:13,800 --> 02:03:17,760
then being uncovered there's no way for

3377
02:03:15,880 --> 02:03:20,599
any of those organisms to really occupy

3378
02:03:17,760 --> 02:03:23,480
and live there like efficiently so he's

3379
02:03:20,599 --> 02:03:25,599
hungry he's hot and he's not drinking

3380
02:03:23,479 --> 02:03:29,238
water for most of the time that he

3381
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:31,279
exceeds the the you know that 85 Mark

3382
02:03:29,238 --> 02:03:35,000
and I mean they can they can do okay at

3383
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:37,880
85° but once you start getting 110 you

3384
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:40,319
know 99 I mean it's nothing wants to be

3385
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:41,840
over 100° we don't want to work at 100°

3386
02:03:40,319 --> 02:03:43,359
they don't want to work at 100° it's

3387
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:44,760
just that's that's just the nature of

3388
02:03:43,359 --> 02:03:47,000
the B so I always want to shoot what it

3389
02:03:44,760 --> 02:03:48,039
is and these are even the tan ones right

3390
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,279
and you're shooting the outside of the

3391
02:03:48,039 --> 02:03:50,639
tan pots and those are supposed to

3392
02:03:49,279 --> 02:03:52,719
reflect the heat which they do

3393
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:56,319
tremendously compared the others but

3394
02:03:52,719 --> 02:03:59,039
that's still 109° right so but they need

3395
02:03:56,319 --> 02:04:01,960
the Sun so the the idea is what do you

3396
02:03:59,039 --> 02:04:03,679
do you cover it it has to have cover you

3397
02:04:01,960 --> 02:04:05,920
have to have that clothes over the skin

3398
02:04:03,679 --> 02:04:08,480
to protect it so that it at least has

3399
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:10,599
that buffer zone uh that will drop and

3400
02:04:08,479 --> 02:04:12,000
if you look at anything in Earth that's

3401
02:04:10,599 --> 02:04:15,840
actually covered with the appropriate

3402
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:17,279
amount of of stuff it'll always be yard

3403
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:21,159
it'll always

3404
02:04:17,279 --> 02:04:23,399
be about 60 to 60 to 85 but it'll always

3405
02:04:21,158 --> 02:04:25,118
be about 70 5° you go anywhere on earth

3406
02:04:23,399 --> 02:04:29,479
right so let's check this out we you had

3407
02:04:25,118 --> 02:04:34,198
this straw out here move the straw

3408
02:04:29,479 --> 02:04:36,158
aside you're at 82 de yeah right I mean

3409
02:04:34,198 --> 02:04:38,039
that's way better than about let's do

3410
02:04:36,158 --> 02:04:40,198
this the whole point we I had the straw

3411
02:04:38,039 --> 02:04:42,158
in here yeah so that's that's that's

3412
02:04:40,198 --> 02:04:43,479
correct so then you're regulating better

3413
02:04:42,158 --> 02:04:45,960
can we check out this and you're and

3414
02:04:43,479 --> 02:04:47,439
you're below you're below that 85 right

3415
02:04:45,960 --> 02:04:48,880
and I mean it's like I said it's below

3416
02:04:47,439 --> 02:04:51,078
that down low and other things but

3417
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:52,719
that's that it's this it's it's this if

3418
02:04:51,078 --> 02:04:55,198
you feel the soil if you reach down you

3419
02:04:52,719 --> 02:04:58,279
can touch the soil and it's hotter and

3420
02:04:55,198 --> 02:05:00,118
it's as hot as your body or warmer then

3421
02:04:58,279 --> 02:05:01,439
it's got your soil's got a fever and

3422
02:05:00,118 --> 02:05:03,039
it's not functioning to where it should

3423
02:05:01,439 --> 02:05:05,198
be you know in a lot of cases and that's

3424
02:05:03,039 --> 02:05:08,679
beautifully cool ask and it's sitting in

3425
02:05:05,198 --> 02:05:11,000
full sun 81° right now where it was 100

3426
02:05:08,679 --> 02:05:14,359
100° on the surface we're crushing it

3427
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:16,719
down below but early on the bamboo I had

3428
02:05:14,359 --> 02:05:19,118
up and they were really thriving when

3429
02:05:16,719 --> 02:05:20,800
they were within the BAM this bamboo

3430
02:05:19,118 --> 02:05:22,158
structure I put up they were getting

3431
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:24,039
plenty of Sun

3432
02:05:22,158 --> 02:05:27,158
but also it was interspersed so the

3433
02:05:24,039 --> 02:05:28,920
leaves were being cooled and so is that

3434
02:05:27,158 --> 02:05:30,399
something is that you know was that you

3435
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:31,719
know so when the plants are young they

3436
02:05:30,399 --> 02:05:33,519
don't have a lot of mass they're not

3437
02:05:31,719 --> 02:05:35,198
dropping a lot of shade onto the canopy

3438
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:38,159
floor right under there so there's more

3439
02:05:35,198 --> 02:05:39,799
exposure it's more you know more app to

3440
02:05:38,158 --> 02:05:41,238
temperatures fluctuating so if you don't

3441
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:42,800
have a ton of mulch or they're really

3442
02:05:41,238 --> 02:05:44,638
young it'll get hotter quicker so having

3443
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:46,199
the bamboo created more shade and more

3444
02:05:44,639 --> 02:05:47,639
moisture was able to hang out there for

3445
02:05:46,198 --> 02:05:49,839
longer and that was that was totally

3446
02:05:47,639 --> 02:05:53,199
fine okay so here's my other question

3447
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:54,639
out here in the valley we reached 117 oh

3448
02:05:53,198 --> 02:05:57,638
yeah yeah yeah it was not yeah it was

3449
02:05:54,639 --> 02:06:00,559
not pretty was that mine that's not you

3450
02:05:57,639 --> 02:06:02,599
right so I was in the same position and

3451
02:06:00,559 --> 02:06:04,639
I mean I didn't have any problems at all

3452
02:06:02,599 --> 02:06:06,679
I mean granted I'm in the ground so when

3453
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:08,520
you're in the ground and you're at 110

3454
02:06:06,679 --> 02:06:09,920
for a couple days the plants can

3455
02:06:08,520 --> 02:06:11,520
tolerate that as long as you put water

3456
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:13,920
out there and they they're okay you got

3457
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:16,159
cover you're good the temperature it's

3458
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:18,399
110 outside if you got cover on the

3459
02:06:16,158 --> 02:06:19,879
ground it'll still be below 85° it'll

3460
02:06:18,399 --> 02:06:21,399
still be right in that habitable zone no

3461
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:23,440
matter what and that's the beauty of it

3462
02:06:21,399 --> 02:06:25,479
all and you can go to the Redwood Forest

3463
02:06:23,439 --> 02:06:28,039
or the Amazon or any place where plants

3464
02:06:25,479 --> 02:06:29,919
are growing or we're not scratch aside

3465
02:06:28,039 --> 02:06:31,719
the the forest floor and shoot the soil

3466
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:34,359
and it will always be in that range 60

3467
02:06:31,719 --> 02:06:35,840
to 80 60 to 85 always that's where

3468
02:06:34,359 --> 02:06:37,920
nature regulates the temperature that's

3469
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:39,239
the magic Zone you know and that's

3470
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:41,158
there's even a book about it called like

3471
02:06:39,238 --> 02:06:43,279
59 degre about the for the pl will be

3472
02:06:41,158 --> 02:06:45,279
able to respirate it'll be able to do

3473
02:06:43,279 --> 02:06:46,960
all of that as long as it's cooled down

3474
02:06:45,279 --> 02:06:48,359
below and then every all the organisms

3475
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:50,719
and things that want to live there will

3476
02:06:48,359 --> 02:06:52,598
want to work and occupy and do that and

3477
02:06:50,719 --> 02:06:55,719
you don't want it too cool because below

3478
02:06:52,599 --> 02:06:57,000
that you know below 60 you got a band of

3479
02:06:55,719 --> 02:06:58,399
yeah nobody wants to work below it

3480
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:00,118
starts getting cold they start shutting

3481
02:06:58,399 --> 02:07:02,598
down and doing their thing it's it so it

3482
02:07:00,118 --> 02:07:05,519
can go in the reverse but the

3483
02:07:02,599 --> 02:07:07,319
insulation keeps it from jumping around

3484
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:09,000
and keeps it from going either way too

3485
02:07:07,319 --> 02:07:10,759
far which is really cool so that's the

3486
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:12,319
importance of the of the mulch like

3487
02:07:10,760 --> 02:07:14,159
firsthand like not having it and having

3488
02:07:12,319 --> 02:07:15,599
it you can see the difference in in what

3489
02:07:14,158 --> 02:07:17,238
the temperature is you know what I mean

3490
02:07:15,599 --> 02:07:19,199
and that and that has a great effect on

3491
02:07:17,238 --> 02:07:21,000
everything so so can we use that tool to

3492
02:07:19,198 --> 02:07:22,879
just cut these big pieces up a little

3493
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:26,158
bit

3494
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:28,440
oh you had one guy on who said that when

3495
02:07:26,158 --> 02:07:31,519
it got really hot he sort of was misting

3496
02:07:28,439 --> 02:07:33,359
his plants a little bit I would never

3497
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:36,960
miss my plants during the heat of the

3498
02:07:33,359 --> 02:07:39,319
day or after he did say that or after or

3499
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:42,279
after about nobody said he did he he set

3500
02:07:39,319 --> 02:07:43,359
the he say he goes He above them just

3501
02:07:42,279 --> 02:07:44,679
yeah so like that's how you get

3502
02:07:43,359 --> 02:07:46,439
powdering mildew problems because you're

3503
02:07:44,679 --> 02:07:48,078
increasing the the the the DraStic

3504
02:07:46,439 --> 02:07:49,839
shifts and humidity and things right so

3505
02:07:48,078 --> 02:07:52,759
if you do it before right someone who

3506
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:54,639
came here no it was on when on your sh

3507
02:07:52,760 --> 02:07:56,159
so so like in Arizona I'm from Arizona

3508
02:07:54,639 --> 02:07:57,880
originally like my my grandparents

3509
02:07:56,158 --> 02:07:59,638
everybody lives out there it's 120°

3510
02:07:57,880 --> 02:08:02,118
every day I mean just freaking miserable

3511
02:07:59,639 --> 02:08:04,520
from May on you know what I mean and

3512
02:08:02,118 --> 02:08:06,078
they misting systems and things but the

3513
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:08,960
way you keep out of trouble is it's like

3514
02:08:06,078 --> 02:08:12,279
early in the morning like like late

3515
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:14,920
morning tops you can miss done but as

3516
02:08:12,279 --> 02:08:16,599
soon as you're at noon or afterwards and

3517
02:08:14,920 --> 02:08:18,520
we're at that Peak and the Sun is at its

3518
02:08:16,599 --> 02:08:20,119
crucial as Point down and it's said and

3519
02:08:18,520 --> 02:08:21,840
you're just especially you're just

3520
02:08:20,118 --> 02:08:24,558
you're hurting yourself I think I think

3521
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:27,199
you should if I don't hit

3522
02:08:24,559 --> 02:08:29,239
my I mean I'd rather water the ground

3523
02:08:27,198 --> 02:08:30,719
which is still cause for concern after

3524
02:08:29,238 --> 02:08:32,439
that noon because of the moisture and

3525
02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:34,118
stuff but I'd rather do that than spray

3526
02:08:32,439 --> 02:08:35,919
the plants themselves just because it's

3527
02:08:34,118 --> 02:08:37,399
just such a drastic fluctuation and

3528
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:40,078
that's kind of what happens but when

3529
02:08:37,399 --> 02:08:41,399
it's over 110° anyway powdery mildew

3530
02:08:40,078 --> 02:08:45,399
really can't live in those high

3531
02:08:41,399 --> 02:08:47,719
temperatures anyway so it's kind of

3532
02:08:45,399 --> 02:08:49,118
like you know it's not the worst thing

3533
02:08:47,719 --> 02:08:50,559
in the world because at high high

3534
02:08:49,118 --> 02:08:52,839
temperatures they tell you heat heat

3535
02:08:50,559 --> 02:08:54,880
will kill the mil Spore you know above I

3536
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:57,078
think it's above 95° or something we'll

3537
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:58,559
actually start killing the Milo spores

3538
02:08:57,078 --> 02:09:02,198
for a certain period of time so if

3539
02:08:58,559 --> 02:09:04,119
you're over 110 and you're missing

3540
02:09:02,198 --> 02:09:06,960
mildew is not your problem but if the

3541
02:09:04,118 --> 02:09:09,639
next day and the day after aren't 110

3542
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:11,760
and it's in those ranges for milw to

3543
02:09:09,639 --> 02:09:13,400
take hold you've created you know

3544
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:15,440
problem in my opinion you know that way

3545
02:09:13,399 --> 02:09:17,078
so did you see any problems with any of

3546
02:09:15,439 --> 02:09:20,759
the crops or any of the people you've

3547
02:09:17,078 --> 02:09:23,759
been working with that hit 115 or above

3548
02:09:20,760 --> 02:09:26,159
so it's so the guys that had him in pots

3549
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:28,199
like you there was there was an old an

3550
02:09:26,158 --> 02:09:31,238
old friend of mine I I call him I call

3551
02:09:28,198 --> 02:09:32,839
him the cool old guy but um he he has

3552
02:09:31,238 --> 02:09:35,000
bigger pots than that I think they were

3553
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:38,078
like 30 gallon or something they were

3554
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:39,880
uncovered and they were the fabric pots

3555
02:09:38,078 --> 02:09:42,238
and during that heat wave the the plants

3556
02:09:39,880 --> 02:09:44,840
that were in there really drooped and

3557
02:09:42,238 --> 02:09:47,198
suffered and all of the pistols started

3558
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:48,639
to to turn and really had a bad effect

3559
02:09:47,198 --> 02:09:50,638
on the plants themselves to the point

3560
02:09:48,639 --> 02:09:52,199
where they never came back out of it to

3561
02:09:50,639 --> 02:09:54,400
where he had to harvest them

3562
02:09:52,198 --> 02:09:56,198
early um the ones in the ground are

3563
02:09:54,399 --> 02:09:58,158
going to be a lot more resilient to the

3564
02:09:56,198 --> 02:09:59,479
temperatures especially if you have the

3565
02:09:58,158 --> 02:10:01,198
the molch down if you don't have the

3566
02:09:59,479 --> 02:10:02,399
molch down then you're in trouble it's

3567
02:10:01,198 --> 02:10:05,039
going to have a hard time in those

3568
02:10:02,399 --> 02:10:06,719
temperatures but they can Toler it they

3569
02:10:05,039 --> 02:10:08,319
don't like it they just don't do much in

3570
02:10:06,719 --> 02:10:10,559
it so if they if you can just get them

3571
02:10:08,319 --> 02:10:13,960
to not do anything as opposed to like

3572
02:10:10,559 --> 02:10:15,480
get sick then that's better than than

3573
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:16,880
you know what I mean going downhill you

3574
02:10:15,479 --> 02:10:17,799
know so you just on those hot days you

3575
02:10:16,880 --> 02:10:20,520
got to make sure that they're well

3576
02:10:17,800 --> 02:10:22,440
hydrated in the soil early or later that

3577
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:25,559
that night before Tom's yard is an

3578
02:10:22,439 --> 02:10:27,399
example of like this area which is

3579
02:10:25,559 --> 02:10:30,559
always in the shade and has the same

3580
02:10:27,399 --> 02:10:34,238
irrigation is like your feet sink into

3581
02:10:30,559 --> 02:10:35,679
the ground and then over here always hot

3582
02:10:34,238 --> 02:10:38,799
it's like always hot and dry and then

3583
02:10:35,679 --> 02:10:41,118
you have like some spots it kind of runs

3584
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:43,760
down there so it stays soft here it's

3585
02:10:41,118 --> 02:10:45,759
it's totally hard almost we just moved

3586
02:10:43,760 --> 02:10:47,480
in so we're just trying kill the

3587
02:10:45,760 --> 02:10:49,440
sprinklers on that side for deal with

3588
02:10:47,479 --> 02:10:51,078
this I have to kill the sprinklers and I

3589
02:10:49,439 --> 02:10:55,638
have to figure out which section does

3590
02:10:51,078 --> 02:10:58,039
the and kill those and and but yeah this

3591
02:10:55,639 --> 02:11:00,520
is as hard as a rock all right so this

3592
02:10:58,039 --> 02:11:01,800
is all little calcium so get some get

3593
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:03,719
some of that calcium give it some

3594
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:05,000
calcium and give it some microbes man

3595
02:11:03,719 --> 02:11:06,960
and that stuff will come back calcium

3596
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,920
will loosen up the soil structure I love

3597
02:11:06,960 --> 02:11:09,960
that it'll give a little bit of

3598
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:12,078
something give some micros you can try

3599
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:14,480
doing something like that yeah you feed

3600
02:11:12,078 --> 02:11:17,960
it to I me raw

3601
02:11:14,479 --> 02:11:19,959
milk do you guys eat eggs I do I'm going

3602
02:11:17,960 --> 02:11:22,118
to got to look up Chris Trump man and

3603
02:11:19,960 --> 02:11:23,198
learn how to make the WCA stuff it works

3604
02:11:22,118 --> 02:11:25,839
good

3605
02:11:23,198 --> 02:11:28,719
absolutely

3606
02:11:25,840 --> 02:11:32,599
so so good job yeah so chop up more of

3607
02:11:28,719 --> 02:11:32,599
the stuff for you help you up a little

3608
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:36,559
bit this is so much more satisfying than

3609
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:39,800
if we had

3610
02:11:36,559 --> 02:11:42,440
to right cut all this I got a hand on my

3611
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:44,559
hip brother we're good show show me the

3612
02:11:42,439 --> 02:11:48,319
shears we would have used where are

3613
02:11:44,559 --> 02:11:50,440
yours mine are uh well no your what we

3614
02:11:48,319 --> 02:11:52,558
would have been chopping with th is like

3615
02:11:50,439 --> 02:11:55,519
some something in here brother give a

3616
02:11:52,559 --> 02:11:56,559
chop here give me this is all I got yeah

3617
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:59,840
that

3618
02:11:56,559 --> 02:12:03,480
works work they don't get very wide

3619
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:03,480
though it would have been

3620
02:12:07,439 --> 02:12:11,678
problematic yeah as soon as I got this

3621
02:12:09,479 --> 02:12:13,399
man I was I was having all kinds of

3622
02:12:11,679 --> 02:12:14,960
problems with my shoulders and my wrists

3623
02:12:13,399 --> 02:12:17,638
I couldn't lift things out of the fridge

3624
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:20,760
or pick up my kids doctors wanted to

3625
02:12:17,639 --> 02:12:23,039
give me surgery so you know putting a

3626
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:25,079
layer of straw on top of raised beds is

3627
02:12:23,039 --> 02:12:26,719
something kind of everyone does but like

3628
02:12:25,078 --> 02:12:29,238
would you ever just use like I have so

3629
02:12:26,719 --> 02:12:30,599
many uh you use it in the garden too

3630
02:12:29,238 --> 02:12:32,678
what I was going to say I have so many

3631
02:12:30,599 --> 02:12:34,279
leaves that like can you just put like

3632
02:12:32,679 --> 02:12:35,599
what's wrong with a layer of leaves is

3633
02:12:34,279 --> 02:12:39,238
that equally cuz I feel like everyone

3634
02:12:35,599 --> 02:12:40,719
has leaves what why do people buy straw

3635
02:12:39,238 --> 02:12:42,359
people throw away what they should be

3636
02:12:40,719 --> 02:12:44,158
using on their land so at my house

3637
02:12:42,359 --> 02:12:46,158
nothing leaves my land like in the green

3638
02:12:44,158 --> 02:12:47,479
bin my green bin is always empty like I

3639
02:12:46,158 --> 02:12:49,839
never put it out on the street for

3640
02:12:47,479 --> 02:12:51,399
collection for anybody to take like all

3641
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:53,559
the leaves that come off of the the

3642
02:12:51,399 --> 02:12:57,719
plants or the trees or the branches that

3643
02:12:53,559 --> 02:13:01,920
I cut or the grass that's mowed or any

3644
02:12:57,719 --> 02:13:04,559
debris from the from the land all either

3645
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:06,000
gets put on the ground is mulch you know

3646
02:13:04,559 --> 02:13:07,199
if it's nice leaves I always put out

3647
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,479
leaves at the end of the year as soon as

3648
02:13:07,198 --> 02:13:10,839
everything drops I'll rake up a bunch of

3649
02:13:08,479 --> 02:13:13,238
leaves and dump them in my Orchard that

3650
02:13:10,840 --> 02:13:14,880
is magic man that's Leaf all that good

3651
02:13:13,238 --> 02:13:16,479
Leaf M but then how come so many people

3652
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:18,359
with raised beds don't just use the

3653
02:13:16,479 --> 02:13:20,638
leaves around their yard because most

3654
02:13:18,359 --> 02:13:22,880
people are afraid of the diseases that

3655
02:13:20,639 --> 02:13:24,239
come with the plants that they're using

3656
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:26,639
so like if they got a bunch of leaves

3657
02:13:24,238 --> 02:13:27,759
that fell they know it's cleaner right

3658
02:13:26,639 --> 02:13:29,960
and they're not they're worried about

3659
02:13:27,760 --> 02:13:32,400
the but the the idea that I have in my

3660
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:34,039
mind is yeah obviously you don't want to

3661
02:13:32,399 --> 02:13:37,319
put a bunch of disease like directly on

3662
02:13:34,039 --> 02:13:40,078
your thing but nature nature is not

3663
02:13:37,319 --> 02:13:42,000
stand right over there like nature is

3664
02:13:40,078 --> 02:13:43,880
not really picking and choosing and in

3665
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:46,078
most cases the good will always outweigh

3666
02:13:43,880 --> 02:13:48,199
the bad if you got a good system cuz

3667
02:13:46,078 --> 02:13:50,000
what I do with my leaves is they're dry

3668
02:13:48,198 --> 02:13:52,519
and then I let them totally dry out

3669
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:55,118
until I canap World bro so you don't

3670
02:13:52,520 --> 02:13:57,960
want to use eucalyptus leaves you don't

3671
02:13:55,118 --> 02:14:00,039
want to use U straight pine pine needles

3672
02:13:57,960 --> 02:14:02,439
Mulberry great excellent food source or

3673
02:14:00,039 --> 02:14:03,840
Magnolia no Magnolia Magnolia is not the

3674
02:14:02,439 --> 02:14:05,638
end of the world that'll work too that's

3675
02:14:03,840 --> 02:14:07,639
fine if they're really dry they're good

3676
02:14:05,639 --> 02:14:09,078
if they're really wet I no no I let I

3677
02:14:07,639 --> 02:14:10,800
let them bake in the sun then you're

3678
02:14:09,078 --> 02:14:12,679
good then then yeah even if they're

3679
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:14,239
crushed a little bit someone was uh

3680
02:14:12,679 --> 02:14:17,199
Pedro this morning was saying he's been

3681
02:14:14,238 --> 02:14:18,799
collecting pine needles and I was like

3682
02:14:17,198 --> 02:14:22,279
that's that's what I said cuz I I had a

3683
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:24,440
Pine Forest growing up and like else the

3684
02:14:22,279 --> 02:14:26,078
pine yeah so Pines emit tannins through

3685
02:14:24,439 --> 02:14:27,839
their leaves through their Roots through

3686
02:14:26,078 --> 02:14:30,078
their needles through everything that

3687
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:31,599
they create and these they're these oils

3688
02:14:30,078 --> 02:14:33,679
that kind of discourage the growth of

3689
02:14:31,599 --> 02:14:36,800
other plants you to cut that right there

3690
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:40,359
yes sir um so when you plant underneath

3691
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:42,719
of a eucalyptus or a pine tree or any of

3692
02:14:40,359 --> 02:14:44,439
those things it's a constant oil forest

3693
02:14:42,719 --> 02:14:45,559
from those trees that are segregating

3694
02:14:44,439 --> 02:14:46,919
themselves off so that's why you say you

3695
02:14:45,559 --> 02:14:48,639
go to a Pine Forest you only see pine

3696
02:14:46,920 --> 02:14:50,599
trees for the most part that was my

3697
02:14:48,639 --> 02:14:51,679
opinion plus they're really really

3698
02:14:50,599 --> 02:14:54,279
acidic

3699
02:14:51,679 --> 02:14:56,158
and adding too many of them can throw

3700
02:14:54,279 --> 02:14:58,479
things out of balance but it's really

3701
02:14:56,158 --> 02:15:01,399
the oils and the tannins in them but

3702
02:14:58,479 --> 02:15:02,879
small quantity small quantity I'm okay

3703
02:15:01,399 --> 02:15:04,960
with the small quantity yeah yeah less

3704
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:07,400
than yeah 5% or less go for it no

3705
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:08,719
problem right um not a problem but like

3706
02:15:07,399 --> 02:15:10,319
if you're starting to use that as like

3707
02:15:08,719 --> 02:15:12,158
your Source all the time or like it's

3708
02:15:10,319 --> 02:15:14,118
your main source then hell no don't

3709
02:15:12,158 --> 02:15:16,158
don't ever use pine needles like that or

3710
02:15:14,118 --> 02:15:20,158
eucalyptus leaves but once they're

3711
02:15:16,158 --> 02:15:21,799
really dry and over you know overly dead

3712
02:15:20,158 --> 02:15:22,879
and been around for a season or two

3713
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:25,119
sitting there if you're going to store

3714
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:26,760
it then things will lose their tannins

3715
02:15:25,118 --> 02:15:28,719
and you can start to turn into carbon

3716
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:30,320
that's usable and I think I think that's

3717
02:15:28,719 --> 02:15:31,800
where they're talking about introducing

3718
02:15:30,319 --> 02:15:33,519
it probably yeah so if you're going to

3719
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:35,719
take it through a process or something

3720
02:15:33,520 --> 02:15:37,480
and then like you know do it in some way

3721
02:15:35,719 --> 02:15:39,880
then that's okay but collecting it and

3722
02:15:37,479 --> 02:15:41,598
using it as much no I wouldn't do that

3723
02:15:39,880 --> 02:15:43,520
yeah that's no good yeah but those are

3724
02:15:41,599 --> 02:15:46,159
the two big ones that I wouldn't use is

3725
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:49,079
eucalyptus leaves and pine needles

3726
02:15:46,158 --> 02:15:51,558
checking but other than that uh I mean

3727
02:15:49,078 --> 02:15:53,319
most things are pretty pretty good and

3728
02:15:51,559 --> 02:15:55,360
especially if it's good and dead and

3729
02:15:53,319 --> 02:15:56,920
it's been dead a long time you're better

3730
02:15:55,359 --> 02:15:58,279
off if you're going to do chop and drop

3731
02:15:56,920 --> 02:16:00,039
like I do a lot of chop and drop where

3732
02:15:58,279 --> 02:16:01,840
you're dropping green stuff like this on

3733
02:16:00,039 --> 02:16:03,960
the ground so talk to me about what

3734
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:06,440
you're seeing here like healthy I mean

3735
02:16:03,960 --> 02:16:08,760
th this is looking healthy so some

3736
02:16:06,439 --> 02:16:12,399
people say like the the hollow stems is

3737
02:16:08,760 --> 02:16:15,000
like Boron or other things um some of my

3738
02:16:12,399 --> 02:16:17,158
Hollow stems are some of my best plants

3739
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:18,880
like in a lot of cases where I'll go

3740
02:16:17,158 --> 02:16:21,078
through and I'll be like oh you're the

3741
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:23,000
sometimes they have like the most that I

3742
02:16:21,078 --> 02:16:24,558
me this isn't Hollow down here it's just

3743
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:26,198
Hollow on the and there's going to be a

3744
02:16:24,559 --> 02:16:28,119
little Hollow where the sap is and it'll

3745
02:16:26,198 --> 02:16:30,000
lose it you know lose it over time you

3746
02:16:28,118 --> 02:16:31,238
know and sometimes they really harden up

3747
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:33,239
but you see all that sap that's kind of

3748
02:16:31,238 --> 02:16:34,638
in there and like as I break this

3749
02:16:33,239 --> 02:16:37,558
everything in there kind of collapses

3750
02:16:34,638 --> 02:16:39,518
too you know so it's it's it's not quite

3751
02:16:37,558 --> 02:16:41,759
as Hollow as it kind of appears but it

3752
02:16:39,519 --> 02:16:43,000
is hollow and then it's nutrition in

3753
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:44,439
some way I mean towards the end of the

3754
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:46,000
flower cycle it's using a lot of the

3755
02:16:44,439 --> 02:16:48,719
minerals and the microminerals is that

3756
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:50,120
what's passing through there and yeah

3757
02:16:48,718 --> 02:16:51,358
and that's got it's sending a lot of

3758
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:53,639
nutrition through the

3759
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:56,800
around the outside layer that intern you

3760
02:16:53,638 --> 02:16:58,638
should get naked and roll around in this

3761
02:16:56,799 --> 02:17:00,718
bed before you go inside you want me to

3762
02:16:58,638 --> 02:17:02,558
chop this one you want to save this one

3763
02:17:00,718 --> 02:17:04,718
you want to do want me to do something

3764
02:17:02,558 --> 02:17:09,718
with this uh yeah this can be chopped

3765
02:17:04,718 --> 02:17:09,718
okay I don't want to step out of line

3766
02:17:10,599 --> 02:17:16,398
there so so you wouldn't uh use one of

3767
02:17:14,519 --> 02:17:18,478
those like mulchers that you could buy

3768
02:17:16,398 --> 02:17:19,959
at Home Depot and just like I would but

3769
02:17:18,478 --> 02:17:23,119
I'd mulch it into a corner and let it

3770
02:17:19,959 --> 02:17:25,039
sit for well yeah okay heck yeah now

3771
02:17:23,120 --> 02:17:26,960
well actually why why wouldn't you bury

3772
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:28,639
it in here like you're doing like so in

3773
02:17:26,959 --> 02:17:31,318
small scale like if you're going to chop

3774
02:17:28,638 --> 02:17:33,279
and drop like I wouldn't do a whole just

3775
02:17:31,318 --> 02:17:35,519
slew of just tons of just green stuff on

3776
02:17:33,280 --> 02:17:37,639
the ground uh sometimes with like trees

3777
02:17:35,519 --> 02:17:40,398
anyway like the bark and those things

3778
02:17:37,638 --> 02:17:41,920
like the the raw woods and things that

3779
02:17:40,398 --> 02:17:43,718
aren't that aren't broken down this

3780
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:45,040
isn't too much this isn't too much you

3781
02:17:43,718 --> 02:17:46,839
can till this in this will turn in a

3782
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:49,439
combo and it's softer stuff it's not

3783
02:17:46,840 --> 02:17:51,000
necessarily like a a tree would be or

3784
02:17:49,439 --> 02:17:53,760
but if we had like three times the

3785
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:55,799
amount of this I would try to do yeah

3786
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:57,359
I'd spread it out a little bit um just

3787
02:17:55,799 --> 02:17:59,398
because sometimes the green stuff takes

3788
02:17:57,359 --> 02:18:01,159
energy to break down so if you're

3789
02:17:59,398 --> 02:18:02,519
demanding resources sometimes it robs

3790
02:18:01,159 --> 02:18:04,478
from other things especially with barks

3791
02:18:02,519 --> 02:18:06,559
and different things that are too fresh

3792
02:18:04,478 --> 02:18:09,279
it'll steal nitrogen and other nutrients

3793
02:18:06,558 --> 02:18:11,879
and things and to its process so just

3794
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:13,239
letting it do its thing satisfying it'll

3795
02:18:11,879 --> 02:18:15,318
be better off there a certain

3796
02:18:13,239 --> 02:18:17,359
satisfaction it's like when you're you

3797
02:18:15,318 --> 02:18:21,439
know done doing a play and you strike

3798
02:18:17,359 --> 02:18:25,079
the set um there's a certain s s

3799
02:18:21,439 --> 02:18:27,840
that's the noise that like uh like uh

3800
02:18:25,079 --> 02:18:30,599
You' be surprised nobody knows that this

3801
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:32,439
I love it matter of fact you could sell

3802
02:18:30,599 --> 02:18:34,000
some of those it's insane you know

3803
02:18:32,439 --> 02:18:35,880
people should be purchasing those they

3804
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:37,638
should they absolutely I go to all these

3805
02:18:35,879 --> 02:18:39,119
nurseries people like what the hell is

3806
02:18:37,638 --> 02:18:40,718
that it's like man it took me a while to

3807
02:18:39,120 --> 02:18:42,519
realize have a large grow and you're

3808
02:18:40,718 --> 02:18:45,398
doing a lot of pruning pruning how much

3809
02:18:42,519 --> 02:18:47,120
do those cost about two on are almost

3810
02:18:45,398 --> 02:18:50,358
2,000 yeah if you want like an extra

3811
02:18:47,120 --> 02:18:53,639
battery and like all the funny stuff wow

3812
02:18:50,359 --> 02:18:55,200
yeah so they're no joke uh smaller

3813
02:18:53,638 --> 02:18:57,799
version you get a smaller version for

3814
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:59,200
like 500 Tom now we're getting into the

3815
02:18:57,799 --> 02:19:00,840
price somewhere in there it's not quite

3816
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:02,920
the same but it is the same it's much

3817
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:05,799
better than that but what's the brand is

3818
02:19:02,920 --> 02:19:07,799
this like f FCO is the best man I don't

3819
02:19:05,799 --> 02:19:09,840
care need that if you're Fel is the best

3820
02:19:07,799 --> 02:19:11,518
Swiss Swiss made gu this thing right

3821
02:19:09,840 --> 02:19:14,639
here is freaking guaranteed for life and

3822
02:19:11,519 --> 02:19:16,398
the reason why it's also the best out to

3823
02:19:14,638 --> 02:19:18,920
the reason why is like you can buy all

3824
02:19:16,398 --> 02:19:21,318
these parts at a nursery like every

3825
02:19:18,920 --> 02:19:24,079
blade every screw every piece of this

3826
02:19:21,318 --> 02:19:26,079
thing you know every it's like DeWalt

3827
02:19:24,079 --> 02:19:27,398
all the parts everyone has to stock all

3828
02:19:26,079 --> 02:19:28,558
the parts so all you need to do is buy

3829
02:19:27,398 --> 02:19:31,119
this once and you can change the blade

3830
02:19:28,558 --> 02:19:32,518
for 12 bucks and it's good for forever

3831
02:19:31,120 --> 02:19:35,120
again you know what I mean over and over

3832
02:19:32,519 --> 02:19:36,398
again um they're the shit they they work

3833
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:37,160
way better than anything else they're

3834
02:19:36,398 --> 02:19:40,119
the

3835
02:19:37,159 --> 02:19:42,000
shit so I've used everything these are

3836
02:19:40,120 --> 02:19:45,359
the these are the best ones do you want

3837
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:49,120
any of these uh sweet compromise buds

3838
02:19:45,359 --> 02:19:51,239
for your compost at home so all of my

3839
02:19:49,120 --> 02:19:53,200
one thing I'm not lacking is is stuff to

3840
02:19:51,239 --> 02:19:54,799
put into my compost all my trim

3841
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:57,399
everything that I take down all the

3842
02:19:54,799 --> 02:20:00,119
stocks all the leaves all the crappy

3843
02:19:57,398 --> 02:20:01,239
buds all the trim that I would make hash

3844
02:20:00,120 --> 02:20:03,439
out of all that goes back into the

3845
02:20:01,239 --> 02:20:05,000
orchard onto the floor just goes to the

3846
02:20:03,439 --> 02:20:06,800
forest floor CU it's all it's all the

3847
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:08,559
bioaccumulated stuff from my Orchard

3848
02:20:06,799 --> 02:20:09,840
anyway it's full of nutrition and that

3849
02:20:08,559 --> 02:20:11,039
just goes out to the mold pile every

3850
02:20:09,840 --> 02:20:14,040
year I got a

3851
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:16,080
big purple started coming out at at a

3852
02:20:14,040 --> 02:20:17,439
certain I don't know what what like if

3853
02:20:16,079 --> 02:20:18,520
that was well that's that's what there

3854
02:20:17,439 --> 02:20:20,040
that plant was going to do it was going

3855
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:21,319
to give a little purple into it and you

3856
02:20:20,040 --> 02:20:23,399
were going to get a little bit of color

3857
02:20:21,318 --> 02:20:25,478
and the as the fall approached you going

3858
02:20:23,398 --> 02:20:27,358
to get get and worse the veining started

3859
02:20:25,478 --> 02:20:29,079
happening which was cool that would have

3860
02:20:27,359 --> 02:20:30,680
been really pretty I mean it it still

3861
02:20:29,079 --> 02:20:33,600
kind of is but it really would have been

3862
02:20:30,680 --> 02:20:36,600
a nice let's pretty thing let's chop

3863
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:38,960

3877
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:15,600
Nets some people don't like the Nets

3878
02:21:14,239 --> 02:21:16,959
they think it you know some people can't

3879
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:19,559
put them up they don't have the space

3880
02:21:16,959 --> 02:21:22,559
that too hard to go in no way bro all

3881
02:21:19,559 --> 02:21:22,559
right

3882
02:21:23,559 --> 02:21:27,920
that's that's what that's what Tom ask

3883
02:21:25,239 --> 02:21:31,159
his wife sometimes so this is pretty

3884
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:33,520
much history as well right yeah let's

3885
02:21:31,159 --> 02:21:35,680

3886
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:37,040

3887
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:38,520

3888
02:21:37,040 --> 02:21:40,600

3889
02:21:38,520 --> 02:21:43,960

3893
02:21:47,600 --> 02:21:51,120
you so much you know I mean like

3894
02:21:49,200 --> 02:21:53,000
seriously you're you're you learned shit

3895
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:54,840
you didn't even know you learn you'll

3896
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:56,280
remember next year you be like fuck man

3897
02:21:54,840 --> 02:21:58,200
this is how it's done brother taught us

3898
02:21:56,280 --> 02:22:01,159
that there's a cool tool that we must

3899
02:21:58,200 --> 02:22:03,800
have I'm all I'm all into forensics of

3900
02:22:01,159 --> 02:22:06,840
any kind so this has been forensically

3901
02:22:03,799 --> 02:22:10,199
do you watch uh investigation discovery

3902
02:22:06,840 --> 02:22:12,719
yes dude it's on it's on like 85% of the

3903
02:22:10,200 --> 02:22:15,040
time courtesy of Laura she loves them

3904
02:22:12,719 --> 02:22:17,478
yeah I think women get totally into like

3905
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:19,160
it's like murder mystery after murder

3906
02:22:17,478 --> 02:22:21,559
mystery after murder I don't know if

3907
02:22:19,159 --> 02:22:24,079
she's like like plant you you you never

3908
02:22:21,559 --> 02:22:26,920
know what's going so what's that one 97

3909
02:22:24,079 --> 02:22:28,600
inside 104 on the outside wow so it's

3910
02:22:26,920 --> 02:22:30,239
not I mean I mean that's like that's

3911
02:22:28,600 --> 02:22:32,359
livable temperatures but being in such a

3912
02:22:30,239 --> 02:22:35,478
small space plants are going to have a

3913
02:22:32,359 --> 02:22:37,479
hard time yeah I I think in the I mean

3914
02:22:35,478 --> 02:22:39,719
for the rest of the year we'll be

3915
02:22:37,478 --> 02:22:43,039
fine perfect for the

3916
02:22:39,719 --> 02:22:45,199
co so so there's a real both ways but so

3917
02:22:43,040 --> 02:22:47,560
there's a real ideal purpose for these

3918
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:51,439
small cloth pots like because they do

3919
02:22:47,559 --> 02:22:52,879
tend to get hot and so so yeah yeah um

3920
02:22:51,439 --> 02:22:54,359
you know it seems like they're not like

3921
02:22:52,879 --> 02:22:55,920
you don't want to keep your plant in

3922
02:22:54,359 --> 02:22:58,120
there for very long because it's just

3923
02:22:55,920 --> 02:22:59,960
too hot in envir in the winter time I

3924
02:22:58,120 --> 02:23:03,000
think is a good time to use those

3925
02:22:59,959 --> 02:23:05,159
personally because they keep warmer than

3926
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:06,959
a plastic outside shell would right that

3927
02:23:05,159 --> 02:23:08,879
plastic pot on the outside is going to

3928
02:23:06,959 --> 02:23:10,759
get cold no matter where you put it no

3929
02:23:08,879 --> 02:23:13,119
matter what unless this be a starter

3930
02:23:10,760 --> 02:23:15,120
environment that is a great winter pot

3931
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:16,640
in my opinion like a starter winter pot

3932
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:18,720
you can grow small plants in there

3933
02:23:16,639 --> 02:23:22,318
easily in the win mean in the summer I

3934
02:23:18,719 --> 02:23:23,760
mean I have huge squat and strawberries

3935
02:23:22,318 --> 02:23:25,600
growing I mean you can and there's

3936
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:27,680
nothing wrong with that but it's not the

3937
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:29,318
if they're good and people pull lots and

3938
02:23:27,680 --> 02:23:30,960
if you've been using it my dad always

3939
02:23:29,318 --> 02:23:32,719
says best tool in the toolbox is the one

3940
02:23:30,959 --> 02:23:35,318
that works for you that you know how to

3941
02:23:32,719 --> 02:23:37,559
use and that's it and some people man

3942
02:23:35,318 --> 02:23:39,159
those are Superstar you know pots for

3943
02:23:37,559 --> 02:23:41,079
and that's fine so what do you use but

3944
02:23:39,159 --> 02:23:44,000
personally I use regular old pots like

3945
02:23:41,079 --> 02:23:45,760
regular old black plastic pots and the

3946
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:48,120
ground those are the two things that I

3947
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:50,920
use um period that's what nurseries have

3948
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:53,600
been using for you know 100 hundreds

3949
02:23:50,920 --> 02:23:55,159
plus years and I mean it's just that's

3950
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:58,200
just that it's

3951
02:23:55,159 --> 02:24:00,920
nothing if you transplant

3952
02:23:58,200 --> 02:24:02,880
appropriately then the root tips and all

3953
02:24:00,920 --> 02:24:04,279
that stuff all that stuff doesn't matter

3954
02:24:02,879 --> 02:24:05,799
it's irrelevant you know what I mean if

3955
02:24:04,279 --> 02:24:08,000
you're just growing a healthy plant

3956
02:24:05,799 --> 02:24:10,519
you're you I mean the outside of my pots

3957
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:11,719
are root tips and hairs and beautiful

3958
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:13,359
shit when I pull them out of there you

3959
02:24:11,719 --> 02:24:14,639
know what I mean it's not it's not the

3960
02:24:13,359 --> 02:24:16,920
end of the world and also the thing that

3961
02:24:14,639 --> 02:24:18,719
I didn't like about the the fabric pots

3962
02:24:16,920 --> 02:24:20,920
the most out of everything was

3963
02:24:18,719 --> 02:24:22,199
transplanting them like can't get them

3964
02:24:20,920 --> 02:24:23,840
out of there without kind of like

3965
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:25,200
ripping or or doing stuff unless it's a

3966
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:26,559
velcro one and those ones were cool

3967
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:28,439
actually that's what I was just those on

3968
02:24:26,559 --> 02:24:30,039
were cool yeah so the velcro ones were

3969
02:24:28,439 --> 02:24:31,720
cooler cuz I was stoked on the velcro

3970
02:24:30,040 --> 02:24:34,040
versions cuz you can pop that out of

3971
02:24:31,719 --> 02:24:35,358
there a lot easier but like I said if it

3972
02:24:34,040 --> 02:24:37,920
works for you it works for you I'm good

3973
02:24:35,359 --> 02:24:40,920
with that so but that said you can get a

3974
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:44,120
more amable environment in these larger

3975
02:24:40,920 --> 02:24:46,600
beds larger beds yes that's got good

3976
02:24:44,120 --> 02:24:49,160
breathability the larger situation I

3977
02:24:46,600 --> 02:24:51,439
think are way more better idea on that

3978
02:24:49,159 --> 02:24:53,318
aspect because wood rots

3979
02:24:51,439 --> 02:24:55,439
fabric you can kind of get away with it

3980
02:24:53,318 --> 02:24:58,519
takes a lot of time it's lighter to set

3981
02:24:55,439 --> 02:24:59,880
up and move ready for the 4 by8 I'm good

3982
02:24:58,520 --> 02:25:03,000
with that maybe so if you're not in the

3983
02:24:59,879 --> 02:25:04,239
ground or cuz then you're at 4 exactly I

3984
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:05,639
believe that you need the more space

3985
02:25:04,239 --> 02:25:07,478
especially if you're growing with soil

3986
02:25:05,639 --> 02:25:09,000
you need a bigger battery the bigger

3987
02:25:07,478 --> 02:25:10,719
battery means you need a bigger space to

3988
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:12,398
pull from it's not going to get hot and

3989
02:25:10,719 --> 02:25:16,599
cook you you is there a big difference

3990
02:25:12,398 --> 02:25:20,478
between having a 2x4 and a 4X4 yeah yeah

3991
02:25:16,600 --> 02:25:22,840
yeah I mean yeah yeah there is there is

3992
02:25:20,478 --> 02:25:25,079
yeah it's a bigger Universe for the The

3993
02:25:22,840 --> 02:25:26,159
Life just their squish yeah they just

3994
02:25:25,079 --> 02:25:27,719
yeah you just don't have enough I mean

3995
02:25:26,159 --> 02:25:29,920
you're living in Mom's basement you know

3996
02:25:27,719 --> 02:25:32,438
you have a you have an end right this is

3997
02:25:29,920 --> 02:25:33,600
Mom's basement right and this better you

3998
02:25:32,439 --> 02:25:34,880
got your own place right you got a

3999
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:36,040
little one bedroom right so you're a

4000
02:25:34,879 --> 02:25:38,478
little bit you know what I'm saying it's

4001
02:25:36,040 --> 02:25:39,800
a little bit better I mean shoot though

4002
02:25:38,478 --> 02:25:41,039
if you don't have to pay rent in Mom's

4003
02:25:39,799 --> 02:25:43,358
basement you might be able to get away

4004
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:45,279
with so there are benefits both ways but

4005
02:25:43,359 --> 02:25:48,079
bigger is always better in my opinion

4006
02:25:45,279 --> 02:25:48,079
see what the great one is

4007
02:25:48,359 --> 02:25:52,239
anyway 116

4008
02:25:52,478 --> 02:25:58,719
soil is moist in this it's

4009
02:25:55,200 --> 02:26:02,600
moist but it's that's that's at

4010
02:25:58,719 --> 02:26:05,199
96 and wet so the soil is wet it's a 96

4011
02:26:02,600 --> 02:26:07,318
so the even though that there's water in

4012
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:08,600
here the plant can't uptake it properly

4013
02:26:07,318 --> 02:26:10,639
because the temperatures it's kind of in

4014
02:26:08,600 --> 02:26:12,439
hold mode to not you know so it's and

4015
02:26:10,639 --> 02:26:14,799
it's too hot anyway so and you can also

4016
02:26:12,439 --> 02:26:17,920
see the plant itself yeah the leaves are

4017
02:26:14,799 --> 02:26:20,438
tacoed like taco shells right and when

4018
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:21,879
they Taco up like that tomatoes are kind

4019
02:26:20,439 --> 02:26:23,840
of they do that anyway in the sun that's

4020
02:26:21,879 --> 02:26:25,278
one of the defense mechanisms but all

4021
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:27,120
plants that kind of Taco up like taco

4022
02:26:25,279 --> 02:26:28,840
shells like that are trying to make

4023
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:30,880
themselves smaller minimalize their

4024
02:26:28,840 --> 02:26:32,600
exposure to the Sun and try to drink any

4025
02:26:30,879 --> 02:26:33,879
Dew that settles on the leaves you know

4026
02:26:32,600 --> 02:26:35,439
so they can funnel it to the to the

4027
02:26:33,879 --> 02:26:37,119
roots it means they're too hot or they

4028
02:26:35,439 --> 02:26:38,600
need more water and those are two those

4029
02:26:37,120 --> 02:26:39,920
are the two signs classically and then

4030
02:26:38,600 --> 02:26:41,720
you shoot it with the thermometer and

4031
02:26:39,920 --> 02:26:43,239
it's too hot and you can see it's

4032
02:26:41,719 --> 02:26:44,559
telling you that you know just by the

4033
02:26:43,239 --> 02:26:48,039
way that the leafes are cupping in that

4034
02:26:44,559 --> 02:26:49,920
regard so things that that tells you you

4035
02:26:48,040 --> 02:26:52,479
know but you don't even need one of

4036
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:54,239
these all you need to do is go like this

4037
02:26:52,478 --> 02:26:56,039
and if it's as hot as you or hot then

4038
02:26:54,239 --> 02:26:57,840
you need to figure out a way to just

4039
02:26:56,040 --> 02:26:59,720
just slow it down and and in the winter

4040
02:26:57,840 --> 02:27:02,398
you want it actually kind of feels a

4041
02:26:59,719 --> 02:27:04,679
little cooler yeah that side yeah yeah

4042
02:27:02,398 --> 02:27:06,760
on that side cuz I have shade over there

4043
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:09,680
but and and like I said it work it works

4044
02:27:06,760 --> 02:27:10,840
both ways to benefit and to detriment

4045
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:12,960
you know what I mean it just depends

4046
02:27:10,840 --> 02:27:15,760
it's a it's a you deploy it in the right

4047
02:27:12,959 --> 02:27:19,278
situation it's a star for you you know

4048
02:27:15,760 --> 02:27:21,719
all right but every you set up one of

4049
02:27:19,279 --> 02:27:24,279
these man you'll get every nug guarantee

4050
02:27:21,719 --> 02:27:26,000
it you love it it'll be ugly and you

4051
02:27:24,279 --> 02:27:27,840
know but hey you get every nug if you

4052
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:29,879
set up a nice one like this you know

4053
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:31,960
like I do you can walk in there and just

4054
02:27:29,879 --> 02:27:33,920
hang out with them and then like at

4055
02:27:31,959 --> 02:27:35,799
night and stuff like no bugs are biting

4056
02:27:33,920 --> 02:27:37,398
you and shit cuz you're in your freaking

4057
02:27:35,799 --> 02:27:39,559
little little mosquito Hut you know what

4058
02:27:37,398 --> 02:27:41,398
I mean you can you can work in there and

4059
02:27:39,559 --> 02:27:44,478
it's safe and it's clean and it's just

4060
02:27:41,398 --> 02:27:45,760
it's just cool and it's not I mean it's

4061
02:27:44,478 --> 02:27:48,559
not super

4062
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:51,239
expensive any joke does shift to to be

4063
02:27:48,559 --> 02:27:53,318
able to do that it's not no it's nothing

4064
02:27:51,239 --> 02:27:55,119
it's really it's makeshift but it's

4065
02:27:53,318 --> 02:27:57,519
totally effective it totally works and

4066
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:59,600
Ian it's something like I bought weird

4067
02:27:57,520 --> 02:28:02,239
stuff I have real green houses I I

4068
02:27:59,600 --> 02:28:04,920
oversee in cool commercial operations I

4069
02:28:02,239 --> 02:28:07,639
mean we've I've I've had 100 lighters

4070
02:28:04,920 --> 02:28:11,000
and then at home I deploy freaking TVC

4071
02:28:07,639 --> 02:28:13,000
P of our the tree here and tell me like

4072
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:17,279
yeah so it's good because it's got cover

4073
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:19,120
right so This Grass serves as your mulch

4074
02:28:17,279 --> 02:28:20,239
this is your cover Zone it's a color

4075
02:28:19,120 --> 02:28:23,479
that's not going to it's going to be a

4076
02:28:20,239 --> 02:28:24,920
buffer it's at 84° so it's below that

4077
02:28:23,478 --> 02:28:26,159
Mark right and that's on the surface of

4078
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:27,760
the grass if you go under the grass

4079
02:28:26,159 --> 02:28:30,318
which we can't it'll be much cooler than

4080
02:28:27,760 --> 02:28:32,520
that so our the leaves aren't tacoing

4081
02:28:30,318 --> 02:28:34,199
right they're not really shriveled up

4082
02:28:32,520 --> 02:28:36,359
they were like yeah the flowers will

4083
02:28:34,200 --> 02:28:38,159
yeah that's normal really okay that's

4084
02:28:36,359 --> 02:28:40,239
normal it'll go through a balloon period

4085
02:28:38,159 --> 02:28:42,318
it'll shrivel up and set it seed and and

4086
02:28:40,239 --> 02:28:44,279
the nut this is where it should be

4087
02:28:42,318 --> 02:28:46,318
that's where it should be yeah uh you

4088
02:28:44,279 --> 02:28:47,960
don't I don't love when when air can

4089
02:28:46,318 --> 02:28:50,398
kind of swoop underneath of a root like

4090
02:28:47,959 --> 02:28:52,199
this right like having them at the surf

4091
02:28:50,398 --> 02:28:53,920
is where you want it but when air and

4092
02:28:52,200 --> 02:28:55,600
stuff can kind of start ripping through

4093
02:28:53,920 --> 02:28:56,920
there in other places I would always

4094
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:58,760
suggest add a little bit of something

4095
02:28:56,920 --> 02:29:01,879
just to cover that like what a little

4096
02:28:58,760 --> 02:29:03,960
bark chip couple leaves straw just don't

4097
02:29:01,879 --> 02:29:05,159
pile it up on like crazy but just just

4098
02:29:03,959 --> 02:29:07,278
cover it up so air doesn't swoop

4099
02:29:05,159 --> 02:29:08,959
underneath that Crown okay and it's not

4100
02:29:07,279 --> 02:29:10,520
yeah it will live like this just fine

4101
02:29:08,959 --> 02:29:12,358
and you'll see that nature just fine I

4102
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:14,880
just it just eliminates a a beacon for

4103
02:29:12,359 --> 02:29:15,920
me personally beautiful uh keep them

4104
02:29:14,879 --> 02:29:18,039
extra healthy and you won't have to

4105
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:21,318
worry about

4106
02:29:18,040 --> 02:29:24,000
it all right

4107
02:29:21,318 --> 02:29:25,760
should we call it a wrap on that this

4108
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:30,279
has been

4109
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:33,079
great I mean look look look look what is

4110
02:29:30,279 --> 02:29:34,720
not there anymore I know sad isn't it

4111
02:29:33,079 --> 02:29:35,840
but we get to restart get to start

4112
02:29:34,719 --> 02:29:37,358
that's the fun part now it's all the

4113
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:39,318
dream start again you know what I mean

4114
02:29:37,359 --> 02:29:42,318
and there's a there's a uh look at that

4115
02:29:39,318 --> 02:29:43,840
that soil is going to be humming yeah

4116
02:29:42,318 --> 02:29:45,680
yeah kind throw some compost in there

02:35:24,920 --> 02:35:29,840
them in motion and that's the key so by

4275
02:35:27,200 --> 02:35:31,279
the way water those things cuz their

4276
02:35:29,840 --> 02:35:33,079
cups are going to get dry we should TR

4277
02:35:31,279 --> 02:35:34,800
so part of the reason why I was psych to

4278
02:35:33,079 --> 02:35:37,359
kill everything was so we can start

4279
02:35:34,799 --> 02:35:40,318
transplanting yeah totally those thing

4280
02:35:37,359 --> 02:35:42,318
out of the solo cupt put the chopper

4281
02:35:40,318 --> 02:35:43,680
here well there's some well but again

4282
02:35:42,318 --> 02:35:45,478
we're still we're putting them into the

4283
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:47,960
bags but those are okay for now winter

4284
02:35:45,478 --> 02:35:51,559
time going into fall you're better off

4285
02:35:47,959 --> 02:35:53,639
we we've passed the peak Valley exactly

4286
02:35:51,559 --> 02:35:58,159
Heat

4287
02:35:53,639 --> 02:35:58,159
season also known as the

4288
02:35:59,920 --> 02:36:05,239
summer you guys see those trees out

4289
02:36:02,159 --> 02:36:07,439
there yes the big ones out there you see

4290
02:36:05,239 --> 02:36:09,879
how they were they're up on a mound f

4291
02:36:07,439 --> 02:36:11,439
fucking things right there every time

4292
02:36:09,879 --> 02:36:12,519
you can say it every time I I can say it

4293
02:36:11,439 --> 02:36:15,359
without even looking you know what I

4294
02:36:12,520 --> 02:36:17,479
mean no matter what it's like always the

4295
02:36:15,359 --> 02:36:19,840
case it

4296
02:36:17,478 --> 02:36:22,000
is and in nature in the forest that's

4297
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:24,200
the tree that lives to be 200 or 300 or

4298
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:25,439
3,000 or whatever it is you know that's

4299
02:36:24,200 --> 02:36:27,560
the one that was planted amongst the

4300
02:36:25,439 --> 02:36:29,880
others that was just in the right little

4301
02:36:27,559 --> 02:36:34,799
Hill the right looking at that how old

4302
02:36:29,879 --> 02:36:37,639
would you you what is it that is a um

4303
02:36:34,799 --> 02:36:40,398
liquid Amber tree um which one the one

4304
02:36:37,639 --> 02:36:42,119
out front the huge one yeah liquid Amber

4305
02:36:40,398 --> 02:36:44,959
it loses it leaves in the fall gets

4306
02:36:42,120 --> 02:36:47,319
really colorful uh it's like our fall

4307
02:36:44,959 --> 02:36:48,759
maple tree is our lookalike right it's a

4308
02:36:47,318 --> 02:36:50,959
really invasive plant breaks up

4309
02:36:48,760 --> 02:36:52,719
everything gets into the sewers it's an

4310
02:36:50,959 --> 02:36:54,839
awesome tree though man it's a it

4311
02:36:52,719 --> 02:36:56,079
supports so much life it does so much it

4312
02:36:54,840 --> 02:36:57,559
really does it's a great tree for like

4313
02:36:56,079 --> 02:36:59,680
the middle of the park and everything

4314
02:36:57,559 --> 02:37:00,840
but it's a crazy tree they planted a

4315
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:03,239
bunch of these back in the day

4316
02:37:00,840 --> 02:37:04,439
especially in LA and in San Diego for

4317
02:37:03,239 --> 02:37:05,879
the color and they planted them on the

4318
02:37:04,439 --> 02:37:07,000
neighborhood roads and when you drive

4319
02:37:05,879 --> 02:37:08,559
down the roads and some of these old

4320
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:10,879
ones you see all these you know cool

4321
02:37:08,559 --> 02:37:13,039
colorful things and stuff but DN man

4322
02:37:10,879 --> 02:37:15,519
they're just so their roots are insane

4323
02:37:13,040 --> 02:37:17,560
and that thing's got to be you know I

4324
02:37:15,520 --> 02:37:20,760
mean it's got to be I don't know when

4325
02:37:17,559 --> 02:37:23,439
this house was built but I'd say say

4326
02:37:20,760 --> 02:37:25,880
that thing's a 70y old tree probably I'd

4327
02:37:23,439 --> 02:37:27,079
say 60 years old 70 years old 60 years

4328
02:37:25,879 --> 02:37:29,039
old right around there cuz they grow

4329
02:37:27,079 --> 02:37:32,600
faster not really B Park how many seeds

4330
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:35,880
are in here uh somewhere between seven

4331
02:37:32,600 --> 02:37:37,640
and 15 okay so some are seven some it

4332
02:37:35,879 --> 02:37:41,239
just depends on what I had left of

4333
02:37:37,639 --> 02:37:43,680
things put some into here and you can so

4334
02:37:41,239 --> 02:37:45,639
basically all I do is I take just like a

4335
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:47,760
short cup I put a little bit of water in

4336
02:37:45,639 --> 02:37:51,519
I drop the seeds in the top they'll

4337
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:54,639
float and then like 24h hour or 4 you

4338
02:37:51,520 --> 02:37:56,800
know 24 to 36 hours later we can

4339
02:37:54,639 --> 02:37:58,799
literally just put them right into soil

4340
02:37:56,799 --> 02:38:02,438
like that's that's the next stage those

4341
02:37:58,799 --> 02:38:06,039
Solo cups yeah yeah

4342
02:38:02,439 --> 02:38:08,079
um yeah those hubbles those are uh like

4343
02:38:06,040 --> 02:38:11,080
something in those In Those Jeans are

4344
02:38:08,079 --> 02:38:13,959
making that thing like slow to grow so

4345
02:38:11,079 --> 02:38:16,200
if you germinate them um germinate you

4346
02:38:13,959 --> 02:38:18,519
know germinate those ones because three

4347
02:38:16,200 --> 02:38:22,000
or three might two might not go they're

4348
02:38:18,520 --> 02:38:22,000
just they're honor they're got this

4349
02:38:22,200 --> 02:38:26,120
weird they're very selective some of the

4350
02:38:24,478 --> 02:38:27,478
land race stuff like it's a land race

4351
02:38:26,120 --> 02:38:29,840
trait where they don't want to grow

4352
02:38:27,478 --> 02:38:31,239
right away they want to sit dormant and

4353
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:33,279
sometimes those recessive trades kind of

4354
02:38:31,239 --> 02:38:34,680
pop up and you know it's just weird a

4355
02:38:33,279 --> 02:38:36,479
bad thing because when they take they

4356
02:38:34,680 --> 02:38:39,159
really take they take and I guess those

4357
02:38:36,478 --> 02:38:41,039
are some of the best like unique plants

4358
02:38:39,159 --> 02:38:42,439
you'll find is in that in that Hubble

4359
02:38:41,040 --> 02:38:45,920
stuff something a little different that

4360
02:38:42,439 --> 02:38:48,760
nobody does so I'll pop a bunch and then

4361
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:50,960
uh but those are also the shittiest germ

4362
02:38:48,760 --> 02:38:52,680
rated seeds that I that I had because

4363
02:38:50,959 --> 02:38:53,679
those are the last ones there's not that

4364
02:38:52,680 --> 02:38:55,000
many I was just giving you guys

4365
02:38:53,680 --> 02:38:56,279
something that really good that I knew

4366
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:58,680
would be good you get something sweet

4367
02:38:56,279 --> 02:39:00,000
out of but there's not even anymore I

4368
02:38:58,680 --> 02:39:01,920
don't have any of at the banks anymore

4369
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:04,680
cuz they're all that's it they're I'm

4370
02:39:01,920 --> 02:39:07,680
working on the Next

4371
02:39:04,680 --> 02:39:10,040
Generation Um now are you are you

4372
02:39:07,680 --> 02:39:11,880
constant are you have stuff going on all

4373
02:39:10,040 --> 02:39:14,439
the time well you're not in you're only

4374
02:39:11,879 --> 02:39:17,079
outside so you don't have continuous

4375
02:39:14,439 --> 02:39:20,398
Harvest I have yeah I have continuous

4376
02:39:17,079 --> 02:39:22,559
for the most part yeah cool yeah so a

4377
02:39:20,398 --> 02:39:26,840
phone yeah it's my phone I was like yeah

4378
02:39:22,559 --> 02:39:30,359
so yeah no like I like cuz I have I have

4379
02:39:26,840 --> 02:39:32,079
plants that are you know Seven 8 N9 10

4380
02:39:30,359 --> 02:39:35,239
years old you know I have clones that

4381
02:39:32,079 --> 02:39:39,039
I've kept for years you know so always

4382
02:39:35,239 --> 02:39:41,119
in my like in the summer in the summer

4383
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:43,160
they come out cuz they're old and by

4384
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:45,760
coming out and going into the ground

4385
02:39:43,159 --> 02:39:47,639
they can tap into the Earth fully

4386
02:39:45,760 --> 02:39:48,920
regenerate and rejuvenate and like a lot

4387
02:39:47,639 --> 02:39:50,398
of the old heads have always said well

4388
02:39:48,920 --> 02:39:52,318
if we take outside you can rejuvenate

4389
02:39:50,398 --> 02:39:53,879
them and I've been just I I fully am a

4390
02:39:52,318 --> 02:39:55,600
believer in that like they rejuvenate

4391
02:39:53,879 --> 02:39:57,119
them back to freaking brand new you know

4392
02:39:55,600 --> 02:39:59,239
what I mean you'll get these big thick

4393
02:39:57,120 --> 02:40:01,040
healthy branches and growth and then you

4394
02:39:59,239 --> 02:40:02,119
can take the Clones off of that right

4395
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:04,279
and then those will be your new moms

4396
02:40:02,120 --> 02:40:06,560
those mom that go inside sitting for how

4397
02:40:04,279 --> 02:40:09,120
long the what seeds what are you talking

4398
02:40:06,559 --> 02:40:10,840
about those just a plant those just a

4399
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:12,680
plant for the mom yeah so like those

4400
02:40:10,840 --> 02:40:15,079
ones will go inside and then over the

4401
02:40:12,680 --> 02:40:17,639
winter time basically keeping carbon

4402
02:40:15,079 --> 02:40:19,478
copies of that Mom for Generation

4403
02:40:17,639 --> 02:40:21,199
there's always something alive because

4404
02:40:19,478 --> 02:40:22,879
you can't lose those because those are

4405
02:40:21,200 --> 02:40:25,200
making those are those are those are my

4406
02:40:22,879 --> 02:40:27,358
flagships and then in the winter time

4407
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:30,279
when even a seed from that will Express

4408
02:40:27,359 --> 02:40:31,640
itself slightly differently or nothing

4409
02:40:30,279 --> 02:40:33,359
just like that yeah it's just like me or

4410
02:40:31,639 --> 02:40:34,680
you if you have 50 kids none of them are

4411
02:40:33,359 --> 02:40:36,640
going to be you Tom there's never going

4412
02:40:34,680 --> 02:40:38,479
to be another you know so that's yeah

4413
02:40:36,639 --> 02:40:41,239
they'll be close but none of them will

4414
02:40:38,478 --> 02:40:42,879
be who you know and that's it that's it

4415
02:40:41,239 --> 02:40:46,000
will never you can you can get close but

4416
02:40:42,879 --> 02:40:47,519
you never get you um so you got that you

4417
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:49,959
got the Clone and then in the winter

4418
02:40:47,520 --> 02:40:52,960
times when I do a lot of like

4419
02:40:49,959 --> 02:40:54,639
like my seed tests and my quick looks

4420
02:40:52,959 --> 02:40:56,318
because it's all quick and small and you

4421
02:40:54,639 --> 02:40:58,079
can do things in like one gallon pots

4422
02:40:56,318 --> 02:40:59,639
and two gallon pots and I can kind of

4423
02:40:58,079 --> 02:41:01,039
give them to all my other friends and we

4424
02:40:59,639 --> 02:41:03,278
can kind of go through a bunch of stuff

4425
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:05,840
indoors and pick out the good guys that

4426
02:41:03,279 --> 02:41:07,680
we think are going to be good guys to

4427
02:41:05,840 --> 02:41:09,200
put outside for the full season and then

4428
02:41:07,680 --> 02:41:10,680
we run them full term and then when

4429
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:12,720
they're really awesome either those will

4430
02:41:10,680 --> 02:41:14,159
get seeds or those will be whatever

4431
