[Music]

2
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:19,890
we're sitting in your 5000 square foot

3
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:23,250
grow in Pacoima California in the black

4
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:25,199
haze room you have a unique way of doing

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,809
your indoor grill explain that to us

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,060
yeah I don't know if it's so much unique

7
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:32,939
as much as it's just an old way of

8
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:35,939
growing it's a way that used to be

9
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:38,429
referred to as Dutch trays if I'm

10
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:41,820
correct on it it was really more popular

11
00:00:38,429 --> 00:00:44,689
kind of in the 90s and the primitive use

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,710
of it was with kind of rain gutters and

13
00:00:44,689 --> 00:00:51,689
water was fed to the plant and it would

14
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:53,340
recirculate into a reservoir and it's

15
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:55,109
just the way that we've grown for 13

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,350
years I really like the way the herb

17
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:59,579
comes out on it we get a good smell

18
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:02,939
every grower thinks they have great herb

19
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,978
but our I think the consensus a lot of

20
00:01:02,939 --> 00:01:06,899
patience it does very well at shops so

21
00:01:04,978 --> 00:01:09,750
basically what the system is that we

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,118
have our six inch PVC pipes with five

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,280
inch net pots we drill holes into the

24
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:17,640
net pots and the roots it's suspended in

25
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,489
the pipe the water circulates over the

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,849
top it's called NFT or a nutrient film

27
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:26,219
technique and it washes over the roots

28
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:30,000
and recirculates under the reservoir is

29
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:31,828
it energy or resource efficient it's

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,129
very efficient for water because the

31
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:39,688
water circulates this room has 210

32
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:42,298
gallons of water in it and it gets

33
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:45,688
changed once a week you don't use soil

34
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,390
what are you used in place of soil we

35
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:50,008
use rock wall with hydro time we could

36
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,750
just use straight rock wall like a lot

37
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,180
of people do but what I found is a hydro

38
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,368
ton repels algae better a lot of the

39
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,799
grow dam cubes or the rock wall algae

40
00:01:56,368 --> 00:02:00,060
just seems to have an easy time there

41
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,159
and if you go with a lot of girls you'll

42
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,350
notice well everybody uses a lot of

43
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,520
floor flex now so it blocks light out

44
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:10,530
but before those days those are the caps

45
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,730
then it's a brand name for the caps that

46
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,680
people put on top

47
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:15,419
the large rock wall cubes which is the

48
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,409
common way people do hydroponic these

49
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:18,809
days aha

50
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:22,229
now do you use any nutrients or

51
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:26,569
fertilizers or any chemicals at all oh

52
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:28,949
yes we use we use ten different

53
00:02:26,568 --> 00:02:32,219
nutrients from four different companies

54
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:34,500
in our formula that we mix we just use a

55
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:38,818
lot of the classic companies general

56
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,799
hydroponics bow Tanic air super thrive a

57
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:45,810
couple things from the company Canadian

58
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:47,580
Express we also use a product from Mills

59
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,229
so we're really hitting a lot of

60
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,299
companies across what we do is just

61
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:53,280
follow the things at work and we pieced

62
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:57,829
it together now talk a little bit about

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:00,419
your your harvesting your cultivation

64
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:02,430
practice how many strains you have

65
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:04,979
running at any point in time and how

66
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,140
many harvests you do we just run more

67
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,090
strains than we do now and a lot of that

68
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:12,359
is because testing has gotten very

69
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:14,129
expensive so it doesn't make much sense

70
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,810
to run three or four varieties in a room

71
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:18,120
because the testing really starts to eat

72
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,680
into your profit margin and since we are

73
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:25,709
a boutique Kraft scale grow operation

74
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,719
we're a specialty size which is up to

75
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:33,599
5,000 square feet of canopy our real

76
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:35,939
canopy size is about 20 to 5 so if you

77
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,789
start eating up a lot of that in testing

78
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:41,280
it basically kills our profitability and

79
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:43,138
so we've had to scale down to just one

80
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,509
or two varieties per room so that we're

81
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,010
doing a maximum of two tests for the

82
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:49,500
flower although then we did the pre

83
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:51,328
rolls which is a couple more tests as

84
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,250
well before we get to the pre rolls

85
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:55,950
which is a new product you're putting on

86
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:59,340
the market you raise sort of the issue

87
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:02,280
of margins so how tight are the margins

88
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:06,120
in a in this market place and in a grow

89
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,969
of this size I've marked our tight for

90
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,099
everybody I think a lot of cultivation

91
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:13,469
if you're profitable I think that's a

92
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:16,728
feat in itself right now because I do I

93
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:19,079
personally believe that a lot of large

94
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:21,750
operations and small operations are not

95
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,418
profitable people are searching for the

96
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,230
right niche for themselves and until

97
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:26,729
that happens

98
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:29,550
it's it's just a nature of the beats

99
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,960
there's also a huge investment bubble in

100
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,060
here so there's a lot of people that

101
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,649
don't subscribe to regular market

102
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,420
fundamentals such as profitability

103
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:38,579
they're more interested in market share

104
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,730
than profitability and so it's kind of

105
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:42,839
created a bit of a distortion on the

106
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:45,540
production side that you just have to

107
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:48,659
deal with you know if a fund comes in

108
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,280
and and they're putting down 20 million

109
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,780
on a grow and they can afford to lose

110
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:53,699
money month after month while they

111
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:55,229
establish their market share it's just a

112
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:56,729
reality you have to compete against for

113
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,009
us as a small craft girl or we've been

114
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:01,710
doing this for a long time we have to

115
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:03,599
make money to survive and so finding

116
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:07,259
that niche in that place that we can

117
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,000
achieve profitability is basically if we

118
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:11,370
do we survive if we don't we don't

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,100
survive so in other words in addition to

120
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:16,590
the the testing costs for additional

121
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,540
strains if a strains out on the market

122
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:20,579
and it isn't moving that's not really

123
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,650
working for you it's fair to say if you

124
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:24,180
can't sell your weed at the price you

125
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:25,620
need to sell it for you're gonna be in

126
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,500
trouble when you go into a shop and

127
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,120
you're distributed by refinery distro is

128
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,100
that correct yeah refinery does my

129
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,199
distribution I've known I've gone way

130
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,260
back obviously I've been in the industry

131
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,430
since oh five and back in the days where

132
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:41,189
we used to do a lot of civil

133
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,110
disobedience and protests and we used to

134
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:45,269
lay down and block DEA cars when they

135
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,180
would raid shops the Bush years were

136
00:05:45,269 --> 00:05:50,310
exciting and a lot of people I know I've

137
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,110
known from back in those days when it

138
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,000
was very antagonistic between the

139
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,670
federal government and even the local

140
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,550
government and the cannabis industry and

141
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:02,250
so refiner does my distribution I've

142
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,259
known them over there for over a decade

143
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,089
as with most of the shops I deal with it

144
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,980
I've always dealt with her the people

145
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:10,049
who are here prio seven so most of my

146
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:12,569
personal relationships go way back

147
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:15,990
wasn't the cultivations alliance in that

148
00:06:12,569 --> 00:06:17,599
fold into a group or did it stay yeah

149
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,129
it's it's basically folded into the

150
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,350
Southern California coalition right the

151
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:25,199
cultivators alliance still exists as an

152
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:27,570
entity but for the most part we eat that

153
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,860
was a kind of a conduit and along with

154
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:32,449
some other groups such as the California

155
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:35,340
Minority Alliance and glocca and the

156
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:36,959
delivery alliances well now we kind of

157
00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:38,728
rolled into a larger group to try

158
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,698
encompass as much of the industry as we

159
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:44,149
could gotcha but from the very beginning

160
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:47,009
you've been there you've been out there

161
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:49,348
representing Los Angeles cultivators for

162
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:52,949
years and years talk about that journey

163
00:06:49,348 --> 00:06:53,848
what why did you step up because you're

164
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:54,780
pretty visible

165
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:58,009
you've been out there you've been a

166
00:06:54,779 --> 00:07:00,179
leader in that role how did that happen

167
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:04,710
that happened because when I first

168
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:06,810
started here in 2005 I had the great

169
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:08,909
fortune of going to work for Don Duncan

170
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,889
who is one of the founders of Americans

171
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,630
for safe access and has really been the

172
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:15,960
leader in pushing positive legislation

173
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:17,728
for cannabis in the state and all of

174
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:20,698
those what I had mentioned before about

175
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:24,389
protests and civil disobedience that was

176
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:26,400
all tactics that had to be used in those

177
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:28,860
days to get the shops to be allowed and

178
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:31,379
so going from that and having gone as my

179
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,658
mentor I saw how he organized the shops

180
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:36,180
back in those days to push back and to

181
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:38,490
get the licensing so when I first got my

182
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,199
warehouse up here I looked at this and

183
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,710
thought well there's no permit process

184
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,840
for me yet and I can't really rely on

185
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:47,698
somebody else to come do it for me I saw

186
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,500
how it happened with the shops and so I

187
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:53,038
just decided it was time to try to find

188
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:55,259
like-minded cultivation people that had

189
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:57,180
their own and wanted to come and push

190
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,158
for a regulated industry and we

191
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,590
organized found those like-minded people

192
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:03,990
and we formed the group how have the

193
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:06,810
politics of the city changed how

194
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:09,750
different are they now the politics is

195
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:12,598
one issue and then the economics is the

196
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:16,348
other issue well let me put it to you

197
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:18,478
this way of the leg of the of the of the

198
00:08:16,348 --> 00:08:22,468
LA growers that you've known over the

199
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:25,649
years how many of them are not going for

200
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:27,418
licenses you know the two pressures I

201
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:29,848
think that every growers had to the last

202
00:08:27,418 --> 00:08:32,250
three years is one meeting the

203
00:08:29,848 --> 00:08:36,379
regulatory challenges and process and

204
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:38,490
the other one is the economics and as

205
00:08:36,379 --> 00:08:40,139
cultivation of cannabis has gotten more

206
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,860
prevalent and up north has dealt with

207
00:08:40,139 --> 00:08:46,620
this as well prices have collapsed

208
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:49,440
prices are about you know a third to

209
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,700
half of what they were 10 years ago in a

210
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,460
lot of cases

211
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,860
less than a third and I think people who

212
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,480
weren't efficient struggled to get

213
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,889
through that even before the permitting

214
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,470
had started which presents a whole

215
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:03,509
nother set of challenges coming through

216
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:06,029
and I think at the end of the day people

217
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:08,669
who are growing or looking at it as how

218
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:10,319
am i supporting my livelihood and a lot

219
00:09:08,669 --> 00:09:14,879
of them just look at the path towards

220
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:17,430
regulation and said this isn't it I mean

221
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:20,279
if I'm just gonna be honest about why I

222
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:23,759
I would say 90% of the growers I know

223
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:27,179
haven't went for license and to be fair

224
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,980
a lot of those 90 percent they they hung

225
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:31,049
it up a year and a half ago anyways I

226
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,570
would you know I think the number of

227
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:36,209
growers I know who are still growing and

228
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:38,250
are gung-ho black market I don't even

229
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:40,920
know if I know anymore most of them just

230
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,570
they they've kind of washed out and have

231
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:44,129
moved on to other things a lot of them

232
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,360
interesting they're consultants for a

233
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:49,320
lot of the big companies that come in

234
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,090
now right and you know and I think those

235
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,290
who have been pretty successful at

236
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,120
growing and who have been able to

237
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:56,969
differentiate and as I said before find

238
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,620
their niche are continuing to do it and

239
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:00,180
with us we're lucky in that we kind of

240
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,299
have found our niche which you've

241
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:05,279
discovered yourself and shops I guess

242
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:09,089
the question for me is at the end of the

243
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:11,699
day will the Los Angeles cultivator

244
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:14,580
community be a fraction of what it

245
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:17,220
previously was is like is it'll just be

246
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,600
much smaller but more dedicated and I

247
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,240
mean is that what we're looking at or

248
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,370
will new people come in and try and you

249
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,990
know take up the slack there's plenty of

250
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,470
plenty of new people are already here

251
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:29,730
and cultivate oh yeah and it's a

252
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,790
different it's a different type of

253
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:36,570
person than the the grower before and

254
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:38,129
everybody has a different idea of where

255
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:39,870
their places and how they're going to

256
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:43,379
get there I think with a lot of people

257
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:48,060
have looked at it as everybody wants to

258
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:50,149
scale and how do you scale correctly I

259
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:53,429
think is the one that I'm not sure

260
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:55,139
anybody's really nailed yet a lot of

261
00:10:53,429 --> 00:10:57,179
times people scale up and the quality

262
00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:00,389
suffers and so just working out those

263
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:03,120
issues is a thing and I think a lot of

264
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:04,028
cannabis out there at least the feedback

265
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,188
I hear

266
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:08,169
a lot of the quality out there isn't as

267
00:11:06,188 --> 00:11:10,389
good I I've heard people talk about a

268
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:14,620
race to the bottom on it and it very

269
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:16,629
well could be but I also know that those

270
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,639
who can produce a quality that will

271
00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:21,009
differentiate itself will differentiate

272
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,659
itself right for for our selves you know

273
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:24,459
for our company here legacy strains

274
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:26,889
we're not carried in very many shops

275
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:30,838
because we don't produce that much but

276
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:34,240
the nine shops that we are carried in

277
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:36,279
they buy up all of our inventory and if

278
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:41,350
I had more inventory we could open more

279
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:44,009
shops so um are you are you breaking

280
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:47,759
even are you profitable can you sustain

281
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:52,839
yourself your business model currently

282
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:55,600
yes we are okay right now I don't know

283
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:59,680
if in the future we can which is a whole

284
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,600
nother dilemma is the real estate prices

285
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,388
or the rental prices for cannabis

286
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,889
facilities if you go back five eight

287
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:10,419
nine years ago industrial was renting

288
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:12,459
for seventy five cents a square foot

289
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:14,740
eighty cents a square foot sometimes

290
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:17,588
even sixty five cents a square foot now

291
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:20,558
if you're doing cannabis you're lucky if

292
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:22,779
you're under a buck fifty a lot of

293
00:12:20,558 --> 00:12:24,808
brand-new of turnkey places they come at

294
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:27,429
you with three bucks a square foot I

295
00:12:24,808 --> 00:12:30,068
just don't think that that is realistic

296
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:32,948
long term because I think prices will

297
00:12:30,068 --> 00:12:36,519
continue to face a downward pressure as

298
00:12:32,948 --> 00:12:38,708
scaling does ramp up and people do start

299
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,539
to become successful at scaling really

300
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:43,479
well quality wise are you pricing a

301
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:45,219
product yeah the prod the wholesale

302
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,139
pound price well I think continue to

303
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,930
fall a little bit so what do you think

304
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:52,240
will happen with with craft or artisan

305
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:54,669
boutique products such as yours do you

306
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,318
think prices will be maintained do you

307
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:58,509
see the marketplace what do you see out

308
00:12:56,318 --> 00:13:00,789
there in the marketplace because this is

309
00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:03,490
something I ask all the time like the

310
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:06,219
consumer is the consumer just want the

311
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:08,169
cheapest or as or do you think there's

312
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,439
connoisseurs out there who will pay for

313
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:13,539
quality and continue to this this comes

314
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:15,849
from my night I was a budtender for nine

315
00:13:13,539 --> 00:13:17,139
years while i moonlighted learning

316
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,629
cultivation

317
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:22,509
and the one thing a lot of people I

318
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:25,089
think forget and especially I think a

319
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:26,739
lot of the outside people outside the

320
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:30,119
cannabis industry getting into it is

321
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:32,920
they look at this large untapped

322
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:34,928
consumer base but the reality of it is

323
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:36,759
and has always been is that 20% of

324
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:40,389
cannabis users consume 80% of the

325
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:43,600
cannabis and you can try to target

326
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:46,178
people that are in that other 80% that

327
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,720
consumes 20% and there's untapped market

328
00:13:46,178 --> 00:13:51,999
how big that is is anybody's guess but I

329
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,119
do think they the core constituency

330
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:57,790
still is that 20% of cannabis users and

331
00:13:55,119 --> 00:14:02,678
they generally care about really good

332
00:13:57,789 --> 00:14:04,480
quality cannabis or else they want the

333
00:14:02,678 --> 00:14:05,948
cheapest cannabis and those are kind of

334
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,249
the two everywhere in the middle is kind

335
00:14:05,948 --> 00:14:12,878
of a no-man's land so for myself as long

336
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:16,269
as the consumer will pay is willing to

337
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:18,938
pay $50 maybe up to 55 dollars for an

338
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:21,938
eighth of some of the nicest herb they

339
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:23,618
can see in the Shelf I will be ok if the

340
00:14:21,938 --> 00:14:25,928
day comes with a consumer will no longer

341
00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:27,759
pay $50 for the nicest herb in the shelf

342
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:31,088
then what I am doing

343
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:34,899
needs to change because that you know it

344
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:36,579
if the ceiling becomes $35 then this

345
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:39,009
business model is unsustainable

346
00:14:36,578 --> 00:14:40,568
but but if it stays at 50 and a lot of

347
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:42,579
people they they come in and they want

348
00:14:40,568 --> 00:14:44,349
the nicest jar there and the bud tenders

349
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:46,298
pick ours out and say this is it it's

350
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:49,028
and the price point is around there I'll

351
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:52,088
be ok I know that small price points

352
00:14:49,028 --> 00:14:53,499
make a huge difference in markets in

353
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:56,019
these markets well you know the

354
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:58,048
retailer's $5 price point is less than a

355
00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:01,058
$5 change on the wholesale side as well

356
00:14:58,048 --> 00:15:05,860
speaking of of of your product in

357
00:15:01,058 --> 00:15:08,588
particular it could go for 40 right but

358
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:12,100
also 50 like a mile and a half from

359
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:16,089
Greg's place it's selling for 50 and 8

360
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:17,739
at actually if buds and roses so you

361
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:20,679
know and actually that's not that far

362
00:15:17,739 --> 00:15:22,149
away so you know there are some

363
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:24,338
differences we're basically in the four

364
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:29,309
year the 50 well I think I think to be

365
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:31,470
fair you have to look at the

366
00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:32,819
the demographics in the area that Aaron

367
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,550
is with buds and roses in the area

368
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:37,020
Greg's at with refinery and they're just

369
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:39,539
they're dealing with different client

370
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:42,710
tells all together Aaron is kind of in

371
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:44,909
the creme de la creme of the studio city

372
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:55,050
you know getting close to Sherman Oaks

373
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:57,360
young Ventura I would imagine

374
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:59,009
Aaron I would imagine buds and roses is

375
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,139
probably paying more per square foot of

376
00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:04,909
their shop that Greg is playing over

377
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,909
over on Oxnard and Custer

378
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,948
all right so my concerns number one

379
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:16,958
personally is taxes are definitely tough

380
00:16:13,948 --> 00:16:19,778
it would be a lot easier I think a lot

381
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:22,599
of us initially to have the taxes start

382
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:24,938
to go down the regulations are really

383
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,930
crazy to deal with as a small cultivator

384
00:16:24,938 --> 00:16:31,149
I have had to pay my entire savings life

385
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:32,528
savings into hiring consultants and

386
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:35,799
attorneys try to get me through this

387
00:16:32,528 --> 00:16:39,879
application process and just for being a

388
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:43,599
small kind of self-funded person it's

389
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:45,909
pretty brutal again we the other side of

390
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,220
it is as far as what would I like to see

391
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:49,568
the larger industry there's a lot of

392
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,480
people such as myself who have been

393
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:54,188
around a long time and have been part of

394
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,009
cannabis kind of as a culture in this

395
00:16:54,188 --> 00:16:59,649
state and I think as the commodification

396
00:16:57,009 --> 00:17:02,318
of it starts to happen some of those

397
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:03,999
cultural aspects are going to be lost

398
00:17:02,318 --> 00:17:05,980
which is really more of a nostalgic

399
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:08,259
thing but still I think it would be a

400
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:12,370
shame as a lot of the small independent

401
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:14,619
growers are just unable to to do the

402
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:17,828
heavy lifting of the regulatory process

403
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:19,148
or even just being able to hire the

404
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,798
professionals that will help them

405
00:17:19,148 --> 00:17:22,269
through it and just that you need to

406
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,099
hire so many professionals to get

407
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:25,689
through the application process is

408
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:27,759
another thing that's going to be very

409
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:31,149
hard to stop new people from entering

410
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:33,119
the one concern going forward is with

411
00:17:31,148 --> 00:17:35,739
too much regulations is going to stop

412
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,119
small new entrepreneurs from coming in

413
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,099
and trying to do something new and

414
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,589
different and potentially better that

415
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:44,528
will benefit the entire industry and the

416
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:46,959
more hurdles you put in place up front

417
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:48,460
the harder it is for that person to be

418
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,980
able to take a chance and see if they're

419
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:53,200
gonna hack it now where are you in your

420
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,149
application process right now or in your

421
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:58,019
licensing we are about to submit our

422
00:17:55,148 --> 00:18:00,548
permanent state application we have our

423
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:02,859
temporary from the city we have our

424
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:04,990
temporary from the state and and

425
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:06,668
actually right after this interview we

426
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,440
will be putting the final touches on our

427
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:11,409
state application and getting that off

428
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:14,159
and compliance wise how you how you feel

429
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:16,510
about things I have my appointment on

430
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:19,780
coming up to go down to City Hall and

431
00:18:16,509 --> 00:18:20,650
give the city my my first tax payment

432
00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:23,049
since I've been off

433
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:24,940
here so what about like Bill did like

434
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:29,049
the bill planning department all that

435
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:30,759
kind of stuff the city agencies I've

436
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:33,009
worked with through the DCR have been

437
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:34,480
great I absolutely could not complain

438
00:18:33,009 --> 00:18:35,619
they've been very helpful they've been

439
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,740
very supportive

440
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:40,089
I think the DCR is really really doing

441
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:44,559
the best job they can with the resources

442
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:46,049
they have and I am very very happy with

443
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,269
the effort they've been putting forward

444
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:51,759
nothing's been perfect and smooth but I

445
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:53,529
nunn of nunn of the fault I would put in

446
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,089
the DCR I really think they've been

447
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:56,589
doing a phenomenal job with what they've

448
00:18:55,089 --> 00:18:59,500
had to do and have been very supportive

449
00:18:56,589 --> 00:19:01,869
of of trying to really make this

450
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:06,309
industry happen you have to be really

451
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:09,699
pleased that your legacy strains product

452
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:14,049
is moving off the shelves the way it is

453
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:15,819
I call around and you know people are

454
00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:18,339
waiting especially the black caves you

455
00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:20,500
know to get it in so plants please grow

456
00:19:18,339 --> 00:19:24,459
quickly okay because these need on the

457
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:28,289
market so is your is like let's come

458
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:31,150
back to just briefly about about scaling

459
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:35,710
because we want to see an industry with

460
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:38,560
with with product that is that as that

461
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,759
has the attention has been brought to it

462
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,559
that you have you know you're a

463
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:45,549
dedicated grower and have been for many

464
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:48,129
years and it would be a shame if you had

465
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:51,129
to go off and do something else you know

466
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:53,680
or work for some big company so how do

467
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:55,300
you scale like what is your plan what is

468
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,490
that biggest challenge finding another

469
00:19:55,299 --> 00:20:00,069
space it's the cost in real estate or

470
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:04,029
will you will have to pick up and move

471
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:05,079
to a cheaper part of the state if push

472
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:07,690
comes to shove

473
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,549
yeah if push comes to shove I will

474
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:13,750
definitely have to I want to stay in LA

475
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:18,609
the big problem is just more the real

476
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:20,829
estate speculation and I think that I I

477
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:23,229
could expand tomorrow if I could find a

478
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:25,029
40,000 square foot building that the

479
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:28,000
landlord would be giving me a buck 50 or

480
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:29,769
less in rent if that happened I could be

481
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,259
there I could have the funding for it we

482
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:33,200
could make it happen but I mean my I

483
00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:36,138
have a couple broker

484
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,600
looking at it and I hear things like you

485
00:20:36,138 --> 00:20:41,388
know talk to a building owner in a

486
00:20:38,599 --> 00:20:44,359
compliant area this particular was in El

487
00:20:41,388 --> 00:20:46,879
Monte which has is permitting very

488
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:49,490
supportive city but the zoning they only

489
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,760
have 15 to 20 locations that are

490
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:55,940
suitable for cannabis under their zoning

491
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:58,579
you know and one of the owners who had

492
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,139
where it's actually open said until it's

493
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:03,138
three bucks a square foot don't call me

494
00:21:00,138 --> 00:21:05,058
back so that's pretty much the issue

495
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:06,798
everywhere same thing was looking at

496
00:21:05,058 --> 00:21:08,869
desert properties and it's three dollars

497
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,359
a square foot and it's just I mean that

498
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:13,339
I would scale up and have a worse

499
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:14,148
overhead than I have my five thousand

500
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:16,220
square foot that would be less

501
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:19,129
profitable than my smaller facility like

502
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,659
that so at some point for example one in

503
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:23,450
the desert I heard have been on the

504
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:24,950
market for almost two years now and at

505
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:27,919
some point these owners are gonna

506
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:29,450
realize that the money in the cannabis

507
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,880
industry is like it is for everything

508
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:33,950
else you know in some ways we have

509
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,039
smaller margins than other manufacturing

510
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:38,538
sectors and until that realization comes

511
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:41,690
and those buildings were sat there for

512
00:21:38,538 --> 00:21:43,879
long enough and nobody's paying the

513
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:45,769
three dollars a square foot they're

514
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,269
gonna you know then then the then the

515
00:21:45,769 --> 00:21:49,788
rent will eventually come down when they

516
00:21:47,269 --> 00:21:51,349
figure they're sick of paying property

517
00:21:49,788 --> 00:21:54,470
taxes on a vacant building and

518
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:55,908
eventually it'll come down to the where

519
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,278
people like myself will want to occupy

520
00:21:55,909 --> 00:22:00,350
it and we see opportunity but are there

521
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:04,369
owners out there who are open to other

522
00:22:00,349 --> 00:22:06,230
arrangements like yeah yeah yeah I'll

523
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:08,388
rent it to you for a two bucks a square

524
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:10,819
foot and you give me 15% of your equity

525
00:22:08,388 --> 00:22:14,658
yeah there's there's that too but you

526
00:22:10,819 --> 00:22:16,579
know it's I think a lot of small smaller

527
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:18,380
people and even larger people have to be

528
00:22:16,579 --> 00:22:20,028
careful that they're not just making

529
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,039
money for a landlord and that's it I

530
00:22:20,028 --> 00:22:23,898
think profitability is going to become

531
00:22:22,038 --> 00:22:25,250
an issue here probably in the next year

532
00:22:23,898 --> 00:22:27,439
or two I think you're gonna see an

533
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,630
emphasis in the industry on

534
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,840
profitability like real profitability

535
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:34,909
and not not just you know being funny

536
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:37,879
with your books and I think it's going

537
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:39,409
to matter and when that does matter it's

538
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,269
it's gonna happen it's gonna have to

539
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:42,769
happen do you think that that when that

540
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:43,640
happens it might there might be an

541
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:46,490
advantage

542
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:53,060
smaller operators who've managed to stay

543
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:56,809
independent and efficient and quality if

544
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:58,129
that you know it that that dynamic might

545
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:00,409
be more prevalent in the lords

546
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:03,470
publicly-traded or the large companies

547
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:05,330
that are acquiring now where they have

548
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,740
to continue to grow their business

549
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:10,490
models they're not growing they're

550
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,960
failing yes so each one of those brands

551
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,329
that they've acquired will need to

552
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,059
perform yeah well I mean that's the

553
00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:19,879
thing I think I think the emphasis a lot

554
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:21,259
in the industry from you know particular

555
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,360
people outside and I don't mean to beat

556
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:25,269
up on them we you know it's it's nothing

557
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:29,059
nothing against it but it seems like

558
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:31,190
people see value in acquiring brands

559
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:34,210
more than they see the value of the

560
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:37,190
brand performances themselves and so

561
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:39,200
when when it comes down to the you know

562
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:41,690
it's I have 20 companies well I have 30

563
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,400
companies well I have 40 companies well

564
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:44,500
what are those companies doing and I

565
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,030
think that's the question

566
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,380
nobody's really stopped to look at yet

567
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:50,720
because they're just more concerned

568
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,310
about acquiring more and more companies

569
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,769
and you think the day of reckoning is

570
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:56,809
maybe a couple of years away all right

571
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:59,389
sooner well that's it who really knows

572
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:02,539
when that day of reckoning is I all I'd

573
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:05,450
I am I feel like the day of reckoning

574
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:08,329
will happen but I mean what do I know it

575
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:10,940
may never happen it may speculation may

576
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:14,089
just continue and and people might just

577
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,740
continue to invest money in it and you

578
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:17,329
know last question for you your

579
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,890
pre-rolls they're coming on the market

580
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:20,389
talk about them when are they when are

581
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,009
they when can we see them on the market

582
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,150
and what are they

583
00:24:22,009 --> 00:24:25,160
we're they're gonna be strain-specific

584
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:28,519
the first one rolling out is the black

585
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,800
haze and we are hoping to have them on

586
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:33,289
the shelves right around 4:20 maybe a

587
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,869
little earlier great and that their

588
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:38,720
packs of seven packs of seven half gram

589
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:42,079
joints they taste just like the strain

590
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,000
they're supposed to great wonderful so

591
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:45,949
what are your so you're moving into

592
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,720
pre-rolls do you have high hopes for the

593
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:51,980
pre-roll market for pre-roll sales I do

594
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,890
the pre-roll markets pretty competitive

595
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:56,620
and I know that quality is an issue in

596
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:58,600
the pre-roll market and so

597
00:24:56,619 --> 00:25:00,009
I really just hope we take our same

598
00:24:58,599 --> 00:25:02,918
attention to detail that we've taken

599
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:04,900
with our packaged flour and that the pre

600
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,870
rolls will speak for themselves as it is

601
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,340
for legacy we do zero marketing like all

602
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:12,399
our marketing has been word of mouth and

603
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:14,168
so that we're gonna try to grow the pre

604
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,000
rolls the same way the people who

605
00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:17,980
already get legacy are probably gonna be

606
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,329
the first ones to buy them and if they

607
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,769
like them they're gonna tell their

608
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:21,970
friends how great they are and their

609
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:23,528
friends are gonna check them out and

610
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,569
they're gonna become repeat customers as

611
00:25:23,528 --> 00:25:27,308
well you know that begs the question you

612
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:29,019
know I mean legacy up in the Bay Area

613
00:25:27,308 --> 00:25:30,579
expanding your footprint I know you

614
00:25:29,019 --> 00:25:33,398
can't do it now but I'll thank you sure

615
00:25:30,579 --> 00:25:36,129
would like to I would like to when the

616
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:37,689
day comes where I can find a reasonable

617
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:39,340
rate on a forty thousand square foot

618
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:40,720
warehouse and that gets cranking I

619
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:43,028
should probably have the bandwidth to

620
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,759
start releasing I have shops in the bay

621
00:25:43,028 --> 00:25:47,589
that wanna carry us already and I you

622
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,538
know just unable to make it happen right

623
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:52,558
now because I'm too busy filling the

624
00:25:49,538 --> 00:25:52,558
orders my existing shops
