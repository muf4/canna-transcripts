1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,649
I think this is a good segue into the

2
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,260
next topic which would be the

3
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:27,329
environmental component of him you know

4
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,118
we hear a lot towards the twenty five

5
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,320
thousand different uses and I think

6
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,700
however many it is that one of the

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,250
things that stands out is that hemp

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,649
seems to perform nearly better than any

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,329
other option and so that's that's where

10
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:43,500
some of its usefulness and utility I

11
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,649
think really comes in so in terms of the

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,738
environmental aspect we know that it has

13
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:51,509
great benefits to soil and air quality

14
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:54,959
and putting carbon back in the earth at

15
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:56,399
the farming component but also let's

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,960
talk a little bit about you know

17
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,870
limiting waste and reusable products

18
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,969
that can come from him and most

19
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:08,219
importantly I think the environmental

20
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:12,030
aspect that inspired you to do your

21
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:15,000
certain businesses today on the farming

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,219
aspect of it right now anything that you

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,688
find that's you know cannabis or hand it

24
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:20,548
basically you need to farm it

25
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:23,099
organically because there's thankfully

26
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,920
nothing no pesticide labeled for

27
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:28,649
cannabis so in a way I feel that's going

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,840
to help move the industry forward into a

29
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,259
norm of farming organically instead of

30
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,030
staying with conventional practices you

31
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,329
know just as far as like the soil

32
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,710
remediation and the you know the

33
00:01:38,328 --> 00:01:44,489
biodegradability the fact that you can

34
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:46,319
grow you know two to three crops of hemp

35
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:49,140
a year instead you know who talked about

36
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:52,379
paper you know takes how many years to

37
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,269
grow an acre of trees and you can have

38
00:01:52,379 --> 00:01:58,709
you know at least two crops of hemp in

39
00:01:54,269 --> 00:02:04,399
this in the same year for you know less

40
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:06,478
water no pesticides and it's it's just

41
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,219
again there's so much that I could say

42
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,598
but I'll go ahead and yeah it's kind of

43
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:17,658
a wonder crop in that regard

44
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:20,628
so I think that the everything that been

45
00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:23,269
said is true and at the same time I

46
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:25,818
think that it's really important to

47
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:29,688
recognize that the forces that are

48
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:32,780
driving not only the in the legalization

49
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:35,658
of industrial hemp but the growth of the

50
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,908
market are not necessarily you know the

51
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:41,000
small companies that are here it's it's

52
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:44,030
big AG the only reason why Mitch

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,209
McConnell got on board after decades of

54
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,699
opposing the legalization of industrial

55
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:52,039
hemp is because his buddies the Kentucky

56
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:54,949
tobacco farmers were losing money in the

57
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:57,620
tobacco in in the tobacco world they hit

58
00:02:54,949 --> 00:03:00,229
with a couple of bad years and you know

59
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,819
they figured they'd cut their cut their

60
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:04,399
losses and invest in an up-and-coming

61
00:03:01,818 --> 00:03:06,679
crop and once they got their

62
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,750
infrastructure together and you know and

63
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,819
was they were able to sort of slow

64
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,729
everything down through the earlier farm

65
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:15,828
bill and do the research and and make

66
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:17,359
sure that it was gonna work then they

67
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:19,939
were saying okay we're now we're ready

68
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:22,430
and so McConnell let it go through and

69
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:25,669
pass and and garnered the bipartisan

70
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,139
support which you know had it had had

71
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:29,120
this happened earlier anyway I don't

72
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:31,669
want to speculate but the point is that

73
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,408
I went to some of those test fields in

74
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:38,299
Kentucky and I saw the research that was

75
00:03:36,408 --> 00:03:40,039
happening and a lot it's a lot of the

76
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:41,719
research has to do with pesticides it's

77
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:43,758
like well we in this little test patch

78
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:44,930
we use this pesticide and in this bed

79
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:46,899
we use this but we're trying to figure

80
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:51,439
out which pesticide is right for which

81
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:53,688
so there there is even though you know

82
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:56,049
the the kind of theory is that hemp

83
00:03:53,688 --> 00:04:00,019
grows so densely that we don't need

84
00:03:56,049 --> 00:04:03,379
pesticides the reality is that Monsanto

85
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:04,908
is tied in with big tobacco and they've

86
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:06,500
got their supply chains in their

87
00:04:04,908 --> 00:04:08,750
relationships and everything and they're

88
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:12,348
gonna figure out a way to justify you

89
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:14,930
know more pesticides for him that's just

90
00:04:12,348 --> 00:04:16,509
that simple and I think and and not not

91
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:20,298
just the pesticide part of it but the

92
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:22,580
the the big AG agricultural practices as

93
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,009
opposed to regenerative regenerative

94
00:04:22,579 --> 00:04:26,279
farming

95
00:04:23,009 --> 00:04:28,250
practices which can not only obviate the

96
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:31,459
need for pesticides but can actually

97
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:33,959
contribute to the positive environmental

98
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:36,509
impacts that we want to see particularly

99
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:38,609
with respect to global warming so in a

100
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:41,639
way I think what's unique the unique

101
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:44,490
opportunity here is that the hemp

102
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:47,339
consumer is pretty much different than

103
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,019
the tobacco consumer and so the

104
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:54,539
opportunity is that the hemp consumer

105
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:57,870
can drive the development of the

106
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,480
industry and therefore affect the

107
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:04,230
overall environmental impact that we

108
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:06,030
have and and so there there's it's both

109
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,319
going to come from the top down to some

110
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:10,409
degree there as long as there are

111
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:13,529
companies like you know John relax you

112
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,120
know riri botanicals who are gonna get

113
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:18,689
into every single Whole Foods and

114
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,189
whatever around but they'll still only

115
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:25,920
be one option there's also going to be

116
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:31,139
that you know drug CBD company which do

117
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:33,629
you know the one of Jeannette right and

118
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:34,800
I mean you look at they'd sent me some

119
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:36,540
samples at the store and there were

120
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,960
these little fluorescent colored pills

121
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:42,540
and I'm like wait what are these this is

122
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:45,060
CBD this is like the new face of CB what

123
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:46,010
is this company and I was just like no

124
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,589
thank you

125
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:51,779
in into the trash so so and I'm a

126
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:53,969
consumer and I but I'm not just a soar

127
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:56,099
owner I'm a consumer so I made that

128
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,230
decision and I made that decision for me

129
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,480
and for my the people who come to my

130
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:02,879
store so anyway so that's that's kind of

131
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,189
the opportunity is where we can

132
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:07,949
influence how this industry develops and

133
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:09,269
therefore amen and I as far as you know

134
00:06:07,949 --> 00:06:13,469
I'm thinking too with you know paper

135
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:15,479
I've been in the magazine industry I how

136
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:18,990
about you know I look forward to the day

137
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,210
when hemp is grown plentifully enough

138
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:24,949
and the prices drop enough because we

139
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:27,589
it's very expensive that's why you know

140
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:29,579
even a lot of people don't have their

141
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:32,399
business cards printed on hemp paper

142
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:35,300
because it's it's prohibitive but how

143
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:38,639
about how about good job

144
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,590
and you know how about the day when you

145
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,139
can pick up a magazine and it's made of

146
00:06:40,589 --> 00:06:45,000
hemp paper instead of you know what an

147
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:48,449
end it an acre of hemp gives you four

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,300
four times as much usable you know

149
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:54,360
usable content as as an acre of trees so

150
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:58,319
which probably why it was legalized in

151
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:02,400
the first place I just want to touch on

152
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,930
a few quick things on the paper side you

153
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,729
know there's there's a few people in the

154
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:09,389
country making hemp paper on a small

155
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:11,550
scale one I would want to point out is

156
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:15,209
Greenfield paper company down in San

157
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:17,520
Diego they have I think the most

158
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:19,379
consistent hemp paper on the market

159
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,109
right now that's made domestically but

160
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:24,569
the pulp that they're using I want to

161
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:28,080
say is from Spain just because there's

162
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:30,959
not a consistent enough domestic source

163
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:34,289
of heaven pulp for them to be using and

164
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:39,449
then quickly to other things you know

165
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:41,790
we're talking about big AG earlier you

166
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:44,159
know cotton accounts for I think twenty

167
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:46,920
five percent of all you know pesticides

168
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,220
used globally so provides a great

169
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:52,080
alternative there and then for us

170
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,240
specifically we're always comparing it

171
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,099
to corn because that's what most bio

172
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,699
plastics are made out of and it uses

173
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,860
about a third of the water as corn and

174
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:08,909
grows in a little more than half the

175
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:10,770
time I think that that topics really

176
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:13,200
timely - I just got back from the world

177
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:14,849
Ag Expo and and you can see that there's

178
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,680
a lot of people still using heavy

179
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,540
machinery

180
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,850
you know just ripping up the earth

181
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,830
rippers and tillers and everything and

182
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:25,080
the small percentage of the market is

183
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:27,419
focused on you know organics and

184
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:29,399
regenerative farming practices and so

185
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,860
it's not just an in hemp but it's also

186
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,929
in the big AG and then that that's kind

187
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,470
of a timely conversation as well because

188
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:39,239
you have labeling and organizations like

189
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:41,100
US hemp Authority that they're trying to

190
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,349
put some some self regulations on

191
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:46,110
labeling and identifying the product and

192
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:48,240
some of the dialogue within the industry

193
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,039
is about well sourcing you know

194
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,019
are we gonna have to actually identify

195
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:54,118
where the products coming from because

196
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:56,999
currently their suggestions are not to

197
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:58,829
include a country of origin is that is

198
00:08:56,999 --> 00:09:00,899
the CBD actually derived from hemp

199
00:08:58,828 --> 00:09:03,479
because there are people considering you

200
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:06,240
know deriving CBD from from yeast and

201
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,499
doing it in a GMO fashion so these these

202
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,749
things that are like front and center

203
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:12,300
considerations not only for the hemp

204
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:15,959
industry but for AG in general and for

205
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:17,399
the canvas industry so you know it's

206
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:19,229
right there it's kind of big industry

207
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:20,789
versus regenerative and smaller scale

208
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,769
practices I think the biggest thing is

209
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:24,808
education people need to be educated

210
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:26,100
that they can farm in a different

211
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:29,399
practice and they can make the right

212
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:32,550
decision based upon you know how they

213
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,139
want the world to continue and I think

214
00:09:32,549 --> 00:09:36,389
California could be in one of the four

215
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:42,360
fronts of that just because everybody

216
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:46,019
here is very organically minded and you

217
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,610
know closed-loop farming and such but I

218
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,919
think education is the best place to

219
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:53,428
start and I know with this hemp CBD

220
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:55,708
versus the versus the cannabis CBD

221
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:56,578
that's one of the big education points

222
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:58,649
right now because people don't

223
00:09:56,578 --> 00:10:00,539
understand what the differences are

224
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:03,448
because it's all kind of been

225
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:04,828
oh it's CBD is CBD and now there's a lot

226
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:06,269
of companies going out there and going

227
00:10:04,828 --> 00:10:08,099
out and making the differences of no

228
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:09,448
there's hemp CBD there's cannabis EVD

229
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:14,790
these are the benefits this is what they

230
00:10:09,448 --> 00:10:18,208
can bring you so I think education yeah

231
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:22,139
and education you know again from the

232
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:25,798
media standpoint and I can see even even

233
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:28,889
from a few years ago just that you know

234
00:10:25,798 --> 00:10:30,149
people are very slowly it's two steps

235
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:37,220
forward one step back but you know

236
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:39,659
they're coming around to being more

237
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,379
approachable I guess I would say with

238
00:10:39,659 --> 00:10:48,208
you know with being open to even

239
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:50,990
receiving education you know and to you

240
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:54,719
know non cannabis companies you know

241
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:56,278
advertising on cannabis platforms saying

242
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,168
you know know that you're not going to

243
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:58,828
get like Blackwall for this or something

244
00:10:58,168 --> 00:11:01,360
here

245
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:05,979
well I mean and also

246
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:10,060
the converse is true I I can't even

247
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:12,159
believe my eyes still when I see some of

248
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:15,549
these med men billboards all over town

249
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,809
I'm like oh my gosh there's a giant

250
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,909
billboard in the sky and it says

251
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:21,369
cannabis am I in some kind of like

252
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:23,019
alternative reality here because this is

253
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:25,089
not what I thought the world would be

254
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:30,610
like when I was you know 15 years old

255
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:32,980
and I was paranoid all the time so

256
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:35,740
there's that and then there's the idea

257
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,889
that the the hemp consumer and the

258
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,450
cannabis consumer is the cannabis

259
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:43,120
consumers coming out of the closet and

260
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,810
the hemp consumer is discovering that

261
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,889
they are that they that they actually

262
00:11:45,809 --> 00:11:51,219
that there's their products out there

263
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:52,600
that are more effective and better and

264
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,300
better for the planet and line with

265
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,129
their values and so just today I was at

266
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:58,899
my shop in the morning and these two

267
00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:00,669
older women came by and walking their

268
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:05,528
dogs and they're like oh look we can get

269
00:12:00,669 --> 00:12:07,528
CBD here I was like wow this is just you

270
00:12:05,528 --> 00:12:10,480
know like one step away from my mom

271
00:12:07,528 --> 00:12:13,689
wanting to take CBD which I'm still

272
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:19,449
working on her but she loves the hemp

273
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:22,420
clothing so so I think that that's it's

274
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:29,039
it's it's education it's hemp dication

275
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:33,429
and it's also just the mainstreaming of

276
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:35,319
what was once a vital crop for this

277
00:12:33,429 --> 00:12:37,989
country so it's kind of a rediscovering

278
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,600
of our own history it's it's reclaiming

279
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,778
our plant inheritance you know it's so

280
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,389
weird that that a plant was basically a

281
00:12:43,778 --> 00:12:48,429
plant that was grown in every state and

282
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:53,110
and all over the world was sort of

283
00:12:48,429 --> 00:12:55,448
erased and you know band and demonized

284
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,970
and taken away from its from the

285
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:59,588
ecosystems it's terrible but now it's

286
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:00,610
back then coming back stronger and

287
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:03,160
stronger

288
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:05,200
I'd love to add one more thing just on

289
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:07,269
the topic of education you know it can

290
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,870
be sometimes confusing to look at

291
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:13,750
industries within their silos but you

292
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:17,470
know taking a more macro look at the

293
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:19,240
whole world in the global economy some

294
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,879
of the macro shifts that are happening

295
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,159
and that need to happen are shifting

296
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:26,679
towards what we would call circular

297
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:29,019
economy versus a linear economy which is

298
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:32,409
take make dispose which is how we've

299
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:36,039
been operating for you know pretty much

300
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:39,789
you for all the industrial era and

301
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:41,889
modern era and you know really I think a

302
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:45,370
lot of what the hemp industry is

303
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:46,659
perfectly suited for is is furthering

304
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,970
our path towards a circular economy

305
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:52,000
where we're designing things for

306
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:54,670
recovery whether it's clothing whether

307
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,950
it's packaging whether it's the products

308
00:13:54,669 --> 00:13:59,078
we put in our body it's doing things for

309
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:00,610
generatively and and I would encourage

310
00:13:59,078 --> 00:14:02,979
you all to look up the Ellen MacArthur

311
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:07,539
Foundation and just find out more about

312
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:09,550
what a circular economy means and then I

313
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:13,599
think it will make it easier to

314
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:15,039
understand how hemp and other things

315
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,500
that are happening globally right now

316
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,789
fit into that larger story and that

317
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:23,169
larger change that needs to be happening

318
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:25,750
yeah I think I think we're all right

319
00:14:23,169 --> 00:14:29,019
there with you James and it's kind of an

320
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:31,480
ironic and circular movement itself that

321
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:34,500
you know this plant that has a 10 to 12

322
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,690
thousand year history with human some

323
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:41,440
some people theorize that we actually

324
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,910
have a co-evolutionary process with

325
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,850
cannabis like Michael Pollan

326
00:14:42,909 --> 00:14:47,610
and now it's coming back into the

327
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:51,519
mainstream it's pulling all of these

328
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:53,370
resources it's giving us resources to to

329
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:56,049
heal the planet and change our ways and

330
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,610
alternatives to fossil fuels and things

331
00:14:56,049 --> 00:15:01,120
that we've been just doing kind of

332
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:02,620
blindly and unconsciously so it's an

333
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,049
element of like how do we bring the

334
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:07,870
educational aspect into our branding how

335
00:15:05,049 --> 00:15:10,328
do we how do we focus products to a

336
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:12,429
marketplace that is about you know

337
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:14,649
regenerative practices

338
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:18,069
natural products and really like

339
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:19,569
responsible consumerism so maybe talk to

340
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:21,610
like some of your favorite products on

341
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:24,010
the market or how you do it within your

342
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:28,480
brand to like represent those sort of

343
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:30,970
business ethics to just kind of as part

344
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,539
of that Segway to I like to say I think

345
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:38,110
that probably the one of the one of the

346
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:40,149
best things that we can do as people in

347
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:44,019
the industry is to be authentic about

348
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:45,759
who you are what you do because I it was

349
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:48,490
a real eye-opener I started going to

350
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,889
some very professional networking groups

351
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,269
a couple years ago and it was just it

352
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:55,179
was so funny cuz you know people you

353
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:58,059
know tell them what you do and about

354
00:15:55,179 --> 00:16:01,509
half the people were like oh cool the

355
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:04,199
other half were like you know but I

356
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:06,639
swear of that other of that other 50%

357
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,460
probably 90% of them would come back

358
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,409
around and go well actually you know so

359
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:15,220
it's just when we when we give ourselves

360
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:16,899
permission to be authentic it's it's it

361
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,720
has an exponential effect it gives other

362
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:22,319
people permission to be authentic you

363
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:31,330
know and that's how change happens so

364
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:38,110
that's my take on that I think the way

365
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:41,259
that I in in the vital hemp gets the

366
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:46,060
word out and sort of markets the the

367
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:51,340
vitality of this crop is by connecting

368
00:16:46,059 --> 00:16:54,939
it to everyday activities so last year I

369
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:56,889
don't know at a party I must have said

370
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,380
something which was like it everything's

371
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:01,870
better in hemp and and then I was like

372
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:03,909
better in him that's a slogan and so I

373
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:07,299
came up with a whole marketing kind of

374
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:09,220
campaign where it was like pictures with

375
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:14,950
just better in it and it's like you know

376
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:19,088
Yoga is better in hemp you know men are

377
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:21,450
better in him New York is better in him

378
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:24,940
meditation is better in Hampton and so

379
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:25,980
it's like a wide range of people in

380
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:28,830
places and things

381
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:31,950
are better in hemp and if you really

382
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:35,308
think about it it's true so it's kind of

383
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:39,840
an arguable thing and if you experience

384
00:17:35,308 --> 00:17:44,308
it so I think the it's so interesting to

385
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:47,759
me that ten years ago or so there was

386
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:50,970
maybe one company that I knew knew of

387
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:56,789
making hemp shampoo and now there must

388
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:58,798
be 30 at least maybe more maybe 50 I

389
00:17:56,789 --> 00:18:01,529
just read that Barney's is now going to

390
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:07,410
include CBD cosmetic products and their

391
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:11,819
storyline yeah there you go yeah they're

392
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:13,440
opening up a whole little CBD store with

393
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:15,029
one brand that I can't remember the name

394
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,220
of the brand now which is terrible but

395
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:19,859
Bebo there we go they're opening that up

396
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,240
in the Beverly Hills Barneys which is

397
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:24,240
just incredible

398
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:27,450
I mean that just shows how far things

399
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:33,179
have come hopefully it's not just like a

400
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:36,600
fad though available for elite consumers

401
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:38,640
then right and widespread because the

402
00:18:36,599 --> 00:18:40,469
efficacy is so good for everyone in

403
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,940
different walks of life well then I

404
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:45,990
think that's what the studies are

405
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:48,240
showing just even even anecdotal studies

406
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:51,929
are showing that people who are using

407
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,539
CBD are leaving pharmaceuticals they're

408
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:58,710
they're you know talk about a cure for

409
00:18:54,539 --> 00:19:04,319
the you know oxycontin crisis this is a

410
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:07,019
good one I educational marketing that's

411
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:09,149
all I have to say how'd it go about it I

412
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:10,950
mean there's so much education that you

413
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,320
have to do with your consumers anyways

414
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:16,940
in the hemp industry that you should

415
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:19,079
always just be leading with education

416
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,370
looking towards the future I mean the

417
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:22,319
last couple of years have been bright

418
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:24,928
and I don't think they're you know even

419
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,970
what we had in mind so the future of

420
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:29,070
cannabis and specifically hemp and hemp

421
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:30,450
in California and even yourselves in

422
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:32,369
your own ventures if you want to kind of

423
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:35,330
spiel off that and and we can kind of

424
00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:35,329
close out with some thoughts

425
00:19:35,878 --> 00:19:43,709
I I really hope that we're able to

426
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:46,470
continue building the the cannabis side

427
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:48,840
and the hemp side the industries that

428
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:51,479
you know are the ones that we've been

429
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:54,478
building towards I hope we're not to

430
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:57,028
detract by you know big cannabis and big

431
00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:59,819
hem obviously there's a place for that

432
00:19:57,028 --> 00:20:02,788
but I I just you know looking towards

433
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:04,618
the future I a I hope the infrastructure

434
00:20:02,788 --> 00:20:08,239
comes but with the infrastructure I hope

435
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:10,319
we're able to hold on to the integrity I

436
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:12,720
just feel with it being such an amazing

437
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:16,648
plant that we just need to stay true to

438
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:21,629
the plant and basically give to it what

439
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:25,728
it has given to us i I would say one of

440
00:20:21,628 --> 00:20:32,098
my biggest focuses with moving ahead is

441
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:34,440
to include I hate to use the word

442
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:37,138
minority but to include populations that

443
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:40,278
have been kind of left out and have been

444
00:20:37,138 --> 00:20:44,548
marginalized and including obviously

445
00:20:40,278 --> 00:20:47,009
Native Americans and you know because

446
00:20:44,548 --> 00:20:51,658
they're they actually can't federally

447
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:53,579
grow well marijuana that that side of

448
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:56,159
the cannabis industry but of course

449
00:20:53,579 --> 00:21:00,178
we're focused on hemp here well they can

450
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:01,889
but they have to give up their

451
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:04,019
sovereignty

452
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:05,728
so with hemp it's it's another story

453
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:09,720
thankfully and I just want to give a

454
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:14,069
shout out to Evo hemp they are working

455
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:17,329
with out with Alex white plume from the

456
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:22,229
Pine Ridge Reservation and they're in

457
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:25,769
3,000 locations now and they expect 25%

458
00:21:22,229 --> 00:21:29,759
of their revenue to come from the hemp

459
00:21:25,769 --> 00:21:32,878
from Alex white plume and from white

460
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:35,548
plume hemp and again I got the chance to

461
00:21:32,878 --> 00:21:38,998
visit that reservation several years ago

462
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:41,158
and 90% of that reservation lives

463
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:42,868
beneath the poverty line and there's

464
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:44,999
literally the middle of you know the

465
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:46,259
middle of nowhere there's there's the

466
00:21:44,999 --> 00:21:47,279
people aren't not working because they

467
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:48,660
don't want to they're working

468
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,519
because there's no place to work it's

469
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:53,900
actually the the poorest County in the

470
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:56,759
United States yes and you know let's um

471
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:59,820
you know do what we can to get behind

472
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:03,569
the the rights of you know these people

473
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:04,859
who were placed where they are and let's

474
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:09,899
give them a it was a sustainable

475
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:13,259
industry well I think that the future of

476
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,730
hemp kind of relates to some things that

477
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:18,690
were talked about on the last panel

478
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:20,730
where I heard some guys saying you know

479
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,019
the these these these investors they

480
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,990
come in and they're so excited about

481
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:28,230
this new industry and he says dude I've

482
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:31,049
been growing for 20 years or this is not

483
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:33,539
a new industry and you know in the same

484
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:35,909
way hemp is there have been people in

485
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:39,480
this industry a lot longer than me and

486
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:41,040
I've been doing it 16 years and and

487
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,420
they're a lot of and I'd say a lot of

488
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,339
the people who've been doing it when it

489
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,920
wasn't necessarily the newest hottest

490
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:48,990
thing that's gonna be in every you know

491
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:52,350
supermarket those people were in it

492
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:54,299
because of you know a kind of a love and

493
00:22:52,349 --> 00:22:57,480
a respect for the plant and what it

494
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:59,460
could do for life on Earth in addition

495
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,650
to wanting to make a living and seeing a

496
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:10,279
future that we you know we wanted to

497
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:10,280
manifest so the the challenge is that

498
00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:16,379
some of these people who've been in it

499
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:19,920
the longest with the best practices and

500
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:24,480
the best values are getting marginalized

501
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:26,490
both in cannabis and in him and it's not

502
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,370
some malicious thing necessarily

503
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:31,710
it's just giant market forces moving in

504
00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:34,409
because they see opportunity they've

505
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,840
managed the legislative landscape to

506
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:39,150
favor them and they're going to

507
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:45,149
capitalize on it and so then the

508
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:50,100
question becomes our hoo-hoos again how

509
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:53,340
do we somehow effectively educate the

510
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:55,058
consumer not just to love hemp but to

511
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:57,558
love certain

512
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:59,389
humph it has a certain kind of the

513
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:03,619
supply chain in the same way

514
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:06,650
that's that consumers now want organic

515
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:10,250
produce right even at their Walmart they

516
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:15,230
want organic produce and so you know if

517
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:18,140
we can can create that kind of an ethic

518
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:20,779
for our industry both from the consumer

519
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,040
to the highest you know to the biggest

520
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:23,629
producer which I don't think it's going

521
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:25,039
to happen easily the only the big boys

522
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:26,809
only come along when they realize the

523
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,240
little guys are taking away their market

524
00:24:26,808 --> 00:24:30,769
share right because they're so that's

525
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,640
what that's what I think we need to do

526
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:37,490
is stand by our our best values continue

527
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,590
to educate the consumer with that there

528
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:42,710
are differences even within our industry

529
00:24:39,589 --> 00:24:46,069
in terms of what's produced and and then

530
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:52,220
there by hopefully you know get to a

531
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:53,928
better place with all of this there's

532
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,150
been people in California doing good

533
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:57,980
work for decades so that the market

534
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:01,000
could develop and we could get here I

535
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:03,349
mean Jack Herer Emperor wears no clothes

536
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,410
Richard Davis in the world cannabis

537
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:09,289
foundation and and John Trudell with

538
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:11,540
Hempstead project Hart who the namana me

539
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:13,789
tribe has actually taken over that

540
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:15,740
operation so there's a lot of nonprofits

541
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:18,168
and groups along with the future

542
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,730
cannabis project that are helping us to

543
00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:23,780
get the word out as an industry so

544
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:27,319
appreciate all that so I think we can

545
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:29,418
shift into Q&amp;A now I'm tethered here

546
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:32,359
with my microphone but if you want to

547
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:34,160
join me upfront my question is do you

548
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:36,709
think it would be prudent to have a

549
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,900
moratorium on production in areas that

550
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:42,048
are already well known for their

551
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:46,970
cannabis cultivation outdoors can't

552
00:25:42,048 --> 00:25:49,849
where can they coexist I believe that

553
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:52,410
they can coexist but it needs to be very

554
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:54,990
well planned out on how they

555
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:57,150
exist as long as the hemp farmer is

556
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:59,910
staying with feminized seeds and the

557
00:25:57,150 --> 00:26:02,730
distance is you know five miles away

558
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:04,200
from the most of all the cannabis like

559
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:06,450
when I'm out in Santa Barbara County all

560
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,910
the cannabis has grown in greenhouses so

561
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:11,700
it's not open fields so if the seeds are

562
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:12,870
feminized and the distance is set I

563
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,460
think the county would be able to

564
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:19,379
regulate that and everybody could be

565
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:23,430
happy yeah that's something at the CDF a

566
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:25,470
level that's likely like really a topic

567
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:27,630
that that comes down even to the local

568
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:29,490
level too so it is the county and I

569
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:31,740
commissioners the county boards of

570
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,240
Supervisors that are addressing that we

571
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:36,000
have the opportunity in California that

572
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,769
we actually have 58 counties where is

573
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,900
the county AG commissioner that kind of

574
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:42,299
sets the rule so there are already

575
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:45,269
counties that have at least temporary

576
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:50,430
moratoriums on on hemp pollen or hemp

577
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:56,039
production Riverside County tell me what

578
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:58,259
else Santa Barbara County San Bernardino

579
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:01,019
County so first and foremost if you do

580
00:26:58,259 --> 00:27:02,849
want to cultivate him San Joaquin see

581
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:04,799
there's they're popping up every day

582
00:27:02,849 --> 00:27:07,919
check with your check with your County

583
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:10,230
ant commissioner all right that's a wrap

584
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,289
thanks everybody thank you

585
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,289

586
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:22,319
