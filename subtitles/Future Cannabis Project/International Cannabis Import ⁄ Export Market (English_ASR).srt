1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,028
what about international we think a

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:07,378
Canada international well what part of

3
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:09,240
what part of international be talking

4
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:12,388
about because there's there's so much

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,609
talk about cultivation in Canada right

6
00:00:12,388 --> 00:00:16,589
now right I don't know I mean you and I

7
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:17,879
were down in Mexico yeah not long ago

8
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:20,640
we're confronted with a lot of people

9
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:23,009
from Colombia from Mexico talking about

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,929
cultivation at very low cost right and

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,359
there's all these deals happening right

12
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:30,149
now in the space in Canada where it's a

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,080
volume play for cultivation you know do

14
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:32,488
we think there's a future there

15
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:34,469
do we think how long is that gonna last

16
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,929
I'm considering what the climate in

17
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:39,660
Canada yeah you can only well I mean you

18
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:41,308
can cultivate outdoors for a very small

19
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:43,279
portion of the year so everything's

20
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,780
gonna have to be indoor or greenhouse

21
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,469
which again raises the cost of

22
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,939
cultivation it costs of production but

23
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,189
also like let's talk about Colombia

24
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:55,948
having an export license or concentrates

25
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:59,390
yeah once that comes into play bombilla

26
00:00:55,948 --> 00:01:01,738
yeah make Mexico as we talked about

27
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,899
shortcoming also Europe right here right

28
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,810
now Canada's importing exporting a ton

29
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,329
of stuff to Germany for example but you

30
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,799
also have Portugal and you have what's

31
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:12,688
Macedonia also doing a lot of

32
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,909
cultivation now I think one of the

33
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:16,529
things we need to consider is where the

34
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,850
majority of our produce is coming from

35
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,400
currently in the world

36
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:22,618
yep I agree in that belt of where that

37
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,109
produce is coming it's where Sanders

38
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:26,579
there is gonna be a change absolutely if

39
00:01:25,109 --> 00:01:29,670
somebody's gonna figure out hey you know

40
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:31,349
what I can grow tomatoes here yep or I

41
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,810
can grow hemp in cannabis right

42
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:35,368
absolutely and you know what and I have

43
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,990
all the installations I have all the

44
00:01:35,368 --> 00:01:39,450
logistics of all the import and export

45
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:41,789
situation yeah just different seeds

46
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,890
absolutely I think what the I think is

47
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,009
an opportunity I think the United States

48
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,680
is very well positioned right now to

49
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,978
benefit more so from industrial hemp

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,560
legalization than from cannabis I think

51
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:56,728
cannabis is gonna be a very small

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,009
segment of the money being made in the

53
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:00,929
pendant well sorry like consumable

54
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,560
cannabis as opposed to industrial hemp I

55
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,340
think industrial hemp will be the lion's

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,379
share of the business

57
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,739
and I think the US farmer could really

58
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:10,840
use this

59
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:12,459
it's it comes out to Kostas wild oh yeah

60
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,620
how much how much of that produce is

61
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:16,598
from the US is being kept in the u.s.

62
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,989
and how much is really important

63
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:22,089
elsewhere it's gonna follow that same

64
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:24,549
path we get a lot of our produce from

65
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,188
South and Central America Mexico for

66
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:30,549
produce just get so cheap the climate

67
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:31,810
and the soil is so fertile it grows and

68
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:34,810
what do we produce here soybeans

69
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,889
soybeans subsidized soybeans true do we

70
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,799
ever think we'll see a subsidy for

71
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:40,959
cannabis for him I don't know the farm

72
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:43,629
bill is pretty favorable I mean sugar

73
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,188
look at a sugar yeah sugar is a mafia

74
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:47,378
its own yeah it's true

75
00:02:45,188 --> 00:02:49,180
absolutely they'll be interesting to see

76
00:02:47,378 --> 00:02:51,429
but anyway we're talking international I

77
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,169
mean for us it's really interesting from

78
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,030
a software perspective having to go in

79
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:56,290
and internationalize everything that

80
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,120
should be that's gonna be a fun project

81
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:59,108
sure it's gonna be hard you've been

82
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,789
through this sort of thing before you

83
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:02,019
know what an undertaking that is but

84
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:02,530
it's also a sign of the times and that

85
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:03,730
what things are happening

86
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,979
internationally

87
00:03:03,729 --> 00:03:06,968
what stuff what do you been hearing

88
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:07,358
about internationally now that's

89
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:09,158
interesting

90
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:10,480
on our end we've been dealing with

91
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:11,818
obviously a lot of people with Canada

92
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,918
yep

93
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:17,888
China believe it or not not surprised

94
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:20,439
China simply because China has a lot of

95
00:03:17,889 --> 00:03:21,459
the hardware that it's currently being

96
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:23,530
built and they're trying to make a

97
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,150
statement and saying hey not only can we

98
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,620
sell it at wholesale being by direct

99
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,209
right and not only that I think most

100
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,569
people don't realize but I believe China

101
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:34,030
is large the world's leading seed hemp

102
00:03:30,568 --> 00:03:36,869
cultivator and CBD exporter right but

103
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:39,489
then there's also this interesting

104
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,530
mindset in the industry that CBD from

105
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:42,729
China is dirty CVD right not as

106
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,530
high-quality as what you're seeing and I

107
00:03:42,729 --> 00:03:46,449
I'm not involved in that world I don't I

108
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,889
don't know and I don't know either but I

109
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:50,139
mean China is definitely well positioned

110
00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:53,199
to take advantage of this newfound

111
00:03:50,139 --> 00:03:53,680
enthusiasm around the hemp space for

112
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,150
sure

113
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,099
I'm excited about when we can start

114
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:58,750
seeing hemp do something other than CBD

115
00:03:57,098 --> 00:04:02,318
everyone keeps talking about CBD in hemp

116
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:04,840
I mean I had someone come put a deck on

117
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:07,179
my on my desk the other day talking

118
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,109
about hemp production and CBD extraction

119
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,188
and I'm like oh that's all fine and good

120
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:12,099
but what are you gonna do to fibers

121
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:14,348
right right like that's and for me

122
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:16,029
almost more interesting how can we start

123
00:04:14,348 --> 00:04:17,560
doing composites how can we start doing

124
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,869
fibers how can we start doing

125
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,680
hemp as nutrition true right like

126
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,168
hamster

127
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,550
high in protein right we have an

128
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:27,008
ever-expanding

129
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,720
population in this world we need to feed

130
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:30,550
them somehow I'm telling it's gonna go

131
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,520
down that gluten-free world or it's

132
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,410
gonna be like the hemp with out blah

133
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,810
blah blah whatever that one pregnant

134
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,840
that they find that's like negative

135
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,728
towards towards humans I don't know what

136
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,500
that is yet yeah the isolation and the

137
00:04:42,728 --> 00:04:46,359
exclusion of others something absolutely

138
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,069
something and it's gonna be a branding

139
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,560
thing it's gonna be a marketing thing Oh

140
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:53,399
buy this hat because it's freeing this

141
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,399
and freeing that

142
00:04:54,819 --> 00:05:02,399
you

143
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:02,399
