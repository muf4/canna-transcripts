00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
[Music]

2
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:18,060
so Jocelyn why don't you kick us off

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:22,500
pick us off okay cool um what's up

4
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:24,379
virtual world I'm Jocelyn I am the

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,778
director of strategy at headset and

6
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:30,239
headset is a cannabis data and analytics

7
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,618
company the past year for us in the

8
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,269
cannabis industry we've had a lot of

9
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:35,280
different crisis that have come up we

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,800
have the VAP crisis right happen in

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,620
summer through November and now we're in

12
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:42,509
kovat and so for us we analyze all the

13
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,640
point-of-sale data and adult use

14
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,920
dispensaries and then we report on those

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,079
trends so we have been incredibly busy

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,670
over these past few weeks in particular

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:52,829
to trying to provide the industry a

18
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,469
real-time read of what we're seeing and

19
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,759
so today I'm gonna go over some of the

20
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,369
trends that we're seeing and then I

21
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:01,229
think we can just ask some questions to

22
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:03,209
you all based off those trends because

23
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:04,408
you really are on the frontlines and so

24
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,799
I think you can provide a lot of

25
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:11,370
perspective here so um maybe a good way

26
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:15,150
to start I'm gonna share my screen and

27
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:17,700
just go through some actual very

28
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,400
exciting charts but so you can see what

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,170
is really happening I run our California

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,000
strategy and operations and what that

31
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,129
means for me is that I work across the

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,680
supply chain I spend my days primarily

33
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:31,829
working with retailers brands

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,010
distributors manufacturers investors and

35
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:37,769
as recently well really the past year a

36
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,170
lot of associations and our local and

37
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:41,670
state policy makers the data that I'm

38
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,769
going to be going through right now is

39
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:46,290
all collected via our participating

40
00:01:43,769 --> 00:01:48,989
retailers point-of-sale systems so what

41
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,750
we do is we aggregate all of this data

42
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:53,849
we've got almost a thousand retailers

43
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,760
across all of the markets that headset

44
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:57,869
is reporting on which in this case I'm

45
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,390
just gonna talk about what we're seeing

46
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,219
here in California though we do I'm

47
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,650
covering in some data from other states

48
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:07,590
I think there's a lot we can learn from

49
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:08,849
Washington Colorado Nevada so I'm going

50
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,769
to give some insights into what's

51
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:12,959
happening there but what we do is we

52
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:15,658
aggregate all of the SKU level data and

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,269
then we normalize it so we get rid of

54
00:02:15,658 --> 00:02:20,699
any privacy related information we use

55
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:22,560
there's various methodologies

56
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:24,359
to be able to extrapolate the data out

57
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,509
so that it's reflective of the entire

58
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,850
state of California and then we compare

59
00:02:27,509 --> 00:02:31,439
all this data to our text numbers we

60
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,060
compare it to the state make and then we

61
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:37,379
make sure it's got a good go ahead and

62
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,539
then we're able to report on it so just

63
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:42,449
just that kind of a baseline here of

64
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:45,329
what we saw in California or across all

65
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:48,839
these markets in adult use sales in the

66
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,940
last year um you can see here California

67
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,800
is a really big market it is the biggest

68
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:55,620
market in the world in terms of cannabis

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,750
sales and in fact it you know is making

70
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,879
up almost as more sales than all of

71
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:02,580
these these markets combined so this

72
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:06,449
just gives us the gravity of how big the

73
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:09,630
California market is so as I had

74
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:11,879
mentioned that there is a lot going on

75
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:13,590
in cannabis in general but what we've

76
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,479
seen in our first couple years in the

77
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:17,759
cannabis industry is that life is

78
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,768
actually pretty predictable for cannabis

79
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,810
sales cannabis is much like other

80
00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:24,120
consumer packaged goods industries

81
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,289
I'm sorry other retail stores other

82
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,480
beverage stores they all have very

83
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:29,578
predictable trends which makes it a lot

84
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,789
easier for a product producer or

85
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:35,250
retailer to be able to predict demand

86
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:37,109
accordingly so generally what we've seen

87
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,000
in cannabis is that there's spikes

88
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,430
during some particular months we see

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,889
spikes during the holiday season so

90
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,890
November December we see them again

91
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:49,529
during summer months of course for 27:10

92
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:52,229
dab day now but what we see here is

93
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,479
we're looking at in 2020 we can see that

94
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:56,099
on the weekends Fridays in particular

95
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,500
are the biggest day for cannabis sales

96
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:02,459
so we see this very very predictable

97
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,769
trends but then coded happened and then

98
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,750
what we see here is that things start to

99
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:08,579
go all over the place

100
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,139
there really aren't any predictable

101
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:12,060
trends at this point this actually I

102
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,458
really can't stress this enough and our

103
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,959
data team can't stress this enough this

104
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:17,699
is unlike anything we've ever seen in

105
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,439
terms of like consumer purchasing

106
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:20,870
everything that we knew is really being

107
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,629
like flipped on its head at this point

108
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:26,850
so when we see here in mid-march when we

109
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:28,860
see all of these spikes starts go all

110
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:30,479
over the place this really is looking at

111
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,919
these four different states and we're

112
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,149
seeing that as soon as the

113
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:37,810
shelter-in-place order was announced

114
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:39,729
we saw people basically go out rush make

115
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,250
all their purchases and then a few days

116
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,110
later we started to see sales utha now

117
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,730
and actually now we see in some states

118
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,150
that they're starting to decline a bit I

119
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:51,250
don't know yet you know are people

120
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:52,719
consuming more are they just stocking up

121
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,699
out of fear they don't want to make less

122
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,200
trips that's what I'm hoping all of you

123
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:59,620
all can provide some insight into you

124
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:02,889
today um but let's look a little bit

125
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:04,240
closer at the month of March and been

126
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:07,919
marched in particular because this is

127
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,920
really when everything started to be

128
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,150
translated started to

129
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:21,159
here black suspect sales line so this is

130
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:21,970
what we would have expected this time of

131
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,700
year

132
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,950
if koban hadn't happened and so what we

133
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:28,418
can see is that anything above this line

134
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:30,399
means that sales are more than we

135
00:05:28,418 --> 00:05:32,620
expected anything below means that sales

136
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,089
are under standard performing so I want

137
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,990
to call out the Green Line which is

138
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:40,269
Nevada so when we think about nevada

139
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:43,300
nevada is how the hardest-hit in terms

140
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:45,250
of estate winter sales on Clark County

141
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:48,400
which is where Las Vegas is based makes

142
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,779
up 80% of all cannabis sales so we can

143
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,519
see that they've been hit the hardest

144
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:53,619
tourism is extremely important to the

145
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,120
state of Nevada so we can see there

146
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,129
there's also declined

147
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,199
we saw mid March as shelter-in-place

148
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:00,639
orders went to effect in California

149
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,069
Colorado and Washington we saw those

150
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,600
cells all spiked and exceed what we

151
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:06,279
normally would have expected this time

152
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,990
of year and then we see they start to go

153
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:10,929
back to normal levels just a few days

154
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:15,009
later so I think I would like to just

155
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:16,660
pause and take a moment here and um get

156
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:18,668
everyone else's thoughts like did you

157
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,050
guys see some types of similar trends

158
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:22,180
and the spikes and are things now

159
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:24,038
evening out for you or are there any

160
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:27,699
outliers in your businesses where it's

161
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:30,550
just still continuing to grow I have a

162
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:35,259
quick comment about this anecdotally

163
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:41,439
about when California especially Los

164
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:44,769
Angeles was put in to stay at home my

165
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:46,478
retailers the ones that I was going busy

166
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:48,519
and told me that odd that there were

167
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,800
like lines around the block people

168
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:59,079
weren't sure what was going to happen

169
00:06:50,800 --> 00:07:01,030
and so the sales were extraordinary but

170
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:02,199
the shops weren't closed you know they

171
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:04,059
weren't sure if they were gonna be that

172
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:07,168
the city or state wasn't sure if they

173
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:12,310
were going to keep them open and so

174
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:18,129
after that the it wasn't a panic mode

175
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:21,030
anymore but then a couple of about a

176
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:22,899
week and a half ago again this is all

177
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:25,809
anecdotally

178
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:29,918
sales started to draw now I'm referring

179
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:32,530
to Los Angeles not the Bay Area and the

180
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:38,129
shops I have been visiting or mostly

181
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:40,989
kind of in the San Fernando Valley but

182
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:44,228
several have also had to lay people off

183
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:48,430
because of the drop in sales

184
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:53,319
I think they've rebounded a little bit

185
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:58,180
but the question is what's going on and

186
00:07:53,319 --> 00:08:00,668
and why is there this difference in in

187
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:02,560
in business sort of up and down and I'm

188
00:08:00,668 --> 00:08:09,759
wondering whether it actually has to do

189
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:14,038
with cash in hand I can I can speak to

190
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:18,490
the Bay Area trend if you want me to

191
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:19,418
yeah could you also provide because I

192
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:25,720
think I've seen you at some of the

193
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:27,579
Berkeley City Council meetings or so

194
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,199
that was also one of the interesting

195
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:31,750
things to me is just you know Berkeley

196
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,269
to that reversal for that what 8-hour

197
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:36,458
period and then I I think it's of such a

198
00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:38,199
beautiful testament also to our industry

199
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:40,239
and all the activists that are out there

200
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,278
and really voiced themselves and came

201
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,500
forward and helped get this reversed

202
00:08:42,278 --> 00:08:46,509
so could you also as you're talking

203
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:51,250
about what you saw could you also talk

204
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:52,689
about that process and how how the

205
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,509
community was able to like come together

206
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:57,190
and get this reversal to happen because

207
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:58,629
I know Santa Clara is still facing the

208
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,430
same thing right and some of these other

209
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:03,850
mmunity a letís are potentially looking

210
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:04,419
at it yeah it was a it was really touch

211
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,820
and go

212
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:09,819
so Alameda County in San Francisco were

213
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:12,339
the first two jurisdictions to put a

214
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:16,390
shelter-in-place order in in the entire

215
00:09:12,339 --> 00:09:17,200
country and so that happened on March

216
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,708
13th

217
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:24,790
I'm sorry March 16th March 13th my

218
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:26,319
birthday so having a March 16th and you

219
00:09:24,789 --> 00:09:31,419
know nobody at 4:00 experienced this

220
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,700
before ever in any capacity and so we

221
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:35,828
were kind of first thing was you know

222
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,410
reading the shelter-in-place order okay

223
00:09:35,828 --> 00:09:38,599
what

224
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:40,879
business what isn't it's cannabis

225
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,540
considered an essential business

226
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:47,800
they have a provision about medical

227
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:49,610
providers and service providers and

228
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:52,429
different categories and sub-categories

229
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:57,560
of that and it says that this is to be

230
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:59,778
interpreted extremely broadly so there

231
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:02,318
was a you know I think the first city to

232
00:09:59,778 --> 00:10:06,698
go everybody determined that okay well

233
00:10:02,318 --> 00:10:09,198
we're it's definitely medicinal

234
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:10,929
medicinal but at the same time so many

235
00:10:09,198 --> 00:10:13,370
patients haven't renewed their

236
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:16,489
recommendations they're still shopping

237
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:19,938
medicinally they're just not technically

238
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:23,990
in the medicinal you know qualified

239
00:10:19,938 --> 00:10:25,698
cannabis patient so more referring to

240
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,039
like someone buying nyquil over the

241
00:10:25,698 --> 00:10:30,708
counter as opposed to a prescription I

242
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:35,719
think San Francisco was the first city

243
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:37,729
to say that they were not cannabis

244
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,959
dispensaries did have to shut down they

245
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:44,420
were not considered an essential

246
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:45,828
business and that was when and it was

247
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:47,719
like they had to shut down the next day

248
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:51,078
and so that created this scourge of

249
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,449
people coming out and wanting to stop up

250
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:54,799
because people assume that you know that

251
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:56,568
was going to be an order and everyone

252
00:10:54,799 --> 00:11:00,379
needed to get their their cannabis right

253
00:10:56,568 --> 00:11:03,019
now you know San Francisco Bay Area as a

254
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:06,679
long long storied history of activism

255
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:11,169
and and pushing reform for decades and

256
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:15,250
so this was you know everybody saw as a

257
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:19,219
huge injustice and a sort of cruel and

258
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:22,789
irrational move for the city and the

259
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:27,259
County of San Francisco to pursue and

260
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:29,448
also they so there was a big outcry by

261
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:32,600
patients and by industry members that

262
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:34,878
finally got it back to the city

263
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,949
I guess the Health Director and all of

264
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,680
these sort of determinations are coming

265
00:11:36,948 --> 00:11:42,588
from the Health Department basically in

266
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,539
these emergency orders and shelter in

267
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:45,829
place orders at least in Berkeley I

268
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:47,389
don't know specifically for San

269
00:11:45,828 --> 00:11:48,739
Francisco but I'm pretty sure they're

270
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:50,250
similar

271
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:52,500
the

272
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,909
city manager and the health department

273
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,860
are basically in control right now

274
00:11:53,909 --> 00:11:57,120
and they get to determine all of these

275
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,289
things there's a sort of de facto

276
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:04,350
government of these municipalities and

277
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:06,089
so finally they got the that order

278
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,389
reversed in San Francisco I think that

279
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:12,240
was eight hours or a day something like

280
00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:14,730
that it was really quick and that was

281
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,740
great and so nobody else so Alameda

282
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,529
County did not determine nobody

283
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,019
clarified if cannabis was essential or

284
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:25,019
not and if it needed to be closed or not

285
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:27,990
and so there were a lot of passive yeses

286
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:29,789
from representatives in the county and

287
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:32,909
on the city level but there was nothing

288
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:36,389
in writing anywhere and that was very

289
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:38,990
concerning but you know it we we if ever

290
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:42,269
there was a time people needed cannabis

291
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:45,720
it's now you know it would just be so

292
00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:47,759
wrong to take away this form of relief

293
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:52,980
and this healthier alternative and such

294
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:55,799
a you know anxiety carry time I that we

295
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,600
felt that it was necessary to you know

296
00:12:55,799 --> 00:12:59,309
make sure that we were being compliant

297
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,110
that everything was going to be and then

298
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:03,239
that I guess the state came down with

299
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,950
their and the state determined that

300
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,220
cannabis wasn't essential business and

301
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:10,710
that was the first time it was actually

302
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:15,379
stated in writing that cannabis was

303
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:20,250
essential and the City of Berkeley on

304
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:25,200
the 25th sent the four five retailers

305
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:30,000
that are open to only go to delivery

306
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:32,610
only and none of the retailers in

307
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,789
Berkeley were set up for delivery we all

308
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:40,639
are the storefront so basically it was

309
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:43,409
they were gonna shut down the cannabis

310
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,539
accessibility in City of Berkeley which

311
00:13:43,409 --> 00:13:48,360
was crazy and totally unacceptable

312
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:53,159
there's a we've had a history with the

313
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:55,769
health department in the city there's

314
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:58,559
there's been a lot of back and forth and

315
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:01,679
it had only been a month since we'd come

316
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:04,139
out of there another fight of trying to

317
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,319
have consumption lounges

318
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:10,019
then make sure that they didn't banned

319
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,520
flavoured bait products and and that

320
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,129
whole thing that seems like a year ago

321
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,439
now but I had only been a month before

322
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:18,120
this came out and this happened and they

323
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,170
they told us all to essentially shut

324
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:25,519
down so BBG was was able to sort of

325
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:28,649
Europe get like one or two cars going

326
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,120
but it was completely unsustainable in

327
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:34,169
all of the dispensaries we kind of a

328
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:37,110
knit together a lot of bay area and cold

329
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:39,179
cannabis activists we all got on calls

330
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:42,450
and and sort of you know very well

331
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:46,469
trained to to activate and react very

332
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:49,230
quickly to any sort of policy impacts

333
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:51,570
that affect us and in the industry and

334
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:55,170
our patients and their customers so we

335
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:58,290
just sort of reorganized and reactivated

336
00:14:55,169 --> 00:15:00,449
what we had done a month ago and had

337
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:05,000
everybody calling the city manager and

338
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:09,000
and call City Council members and really

339
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,860
demand an answer to why cannabis which

340
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,409
was declared as essential and at that

341
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,909
point Alameda County San Francisco and

342
00:15:13,409 --> 00:15:16,740
the state of California had all

343
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:18,750
expressly stated that cannabis was an

344
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:22,950
essential business for medicinal and

345
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:26,669
adult use and so why we were subjected

346
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:28,650
to the stricter regulation as an

347
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:30,990
essential business that's following the

348
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:32,669
exact same you know mitigation and

349
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,590
social distancing protocols as every

350
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:36,750
other essential business why are we why

351
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:39,540
do we have to have this excessive more

352
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:45,090
extreme restrictions on on who and how

353
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:47,669
we can serve our community an important

354
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:49,590
point of like and actually I think it

355
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:51,120
would be really important for you to

356
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:52,649
talk about your role and Berkeley

357
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,899
patients group for people who aren't

358
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:57,149
aware because vpg is one of the oldest

359
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:59,970
if I understand it are the first in in

360
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:01,740
Bay Area and as I go to a lot of these

361
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,600
City Council meetings you tend to see

362
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,700
the same activists that show up in each

363
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,040
community or each municipality has its

364
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,560
own culture that they're working within

365
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,959
and so one of the things I find really

366
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,579
interesting is one that your role exists

367
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,139
within BPG because there's so many

368
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:18,180
retailers that don't necessarily have a

369
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:20,100
policy or an Affairs person

370
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:22,649
it's really out and working with City

371
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,420
Council and so I think would be to the

372
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:26,490
benefit of the whole industry if more

373
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:28,019
people were involved and I think this is

374
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:29,789
one of the reasons that we often see

375
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,850
policy not being lenient towards

376
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:36,179
cannabis so could you also explain like

377
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:38,550
your role and why that's so important to

378
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:43,259
a retailer in making sure that you have

379
00:16:38,549 --> 00:16:46,379
this this warmness from the city oh yeah

380
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:47,909
absolutely yeah so I'm the chief public

381
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:50,549
affairs officers at Berkeley patient

382
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:52,469
group and BPG is the oldest continuously

383
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:54,899
operating the center in the country it

384
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:56,519
was formed out of a group of cannabis

385
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,830
activists in the 90s

386
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:02,189
well cannabis HIV AIDS activists who

387
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:04,529
were fighting to get relief for hiv/aids

388
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,029
patients and wanted to make sure there

389
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:07,709
was safe access to cannabis because

390
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:10,078
there weren't any there wasn't any

391
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:13,799
research or any other medication for

392
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:16,230
relief for those patients and so CPG was

393
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,169
born out of the spirit of activism and

394
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,400
community engagement and community

395
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:26,039
organizing and so that's always been the

396
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,600
ethos of the dispensary and we have had

397
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:31,349
you know worked with the City of

398
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:34,230
Berkeley over 20 years to and you know

399
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:36,299
help develop regulations and protocol

400
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:39,569
and and be expressed become expressly

401
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:42,480
allowed to operate and having these

402
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:47,789
relationships with the city and the

403
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:49,980
community are invaluable I mean it's for

404
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:51,869
any business but especially for a highly

405
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,539
regulated controversial business like

406
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:59,000
cannabis and even more especially for a

407
00:17:54,539 --> 00:18:02,279
new industry that is evolving and and

408
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,808
developing every day and with all these

409
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:07,049
new challenges that everyone else is

410
00:18:03,808 --> 00:18:09,990
facing on top of all our unique cannabis

411
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:12,119
challenges so you know there's it's so

412
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:14,940
important you you have to stay on top of

413
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:17,909
regulatory changes such as things like

414
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:21,570
this because I'm constantly engaged in

415
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:23,550
the city with the Health Department with

416
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:25,169
council members you know I I do have

417
00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:28,678
relationships with them and I can

418
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:30,808
communicate with them and we you know we

419
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,990
don't always agree on everything but I

420
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:34,629
think we all have this

421
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,069
intent wishes what's best for the

422
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,410
community and what's best for the city

423
00:18:36,069 --> 00:18:41,470
and we have different ideas sometimes of

424
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:44,650
as to what that is but we all want

425
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:47,500
what's best and a really good example

426
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:49,990
vacuum you as to why it is so critical

427
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,058
to have these relationships with your

428
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:55,480
with your community and with your local

429
00:18:52,058 --> 00:18:58,649
government is you know BBG had a couple

430
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:03,339
of federal cases

431
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:05,440
well coo during Melinda Hague is a US

432
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:07,299
attorney in Northern California and came

433
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,420
after Berkeley patient group a couple of

434
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:13,269
years ago tried to shut them down and

435
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:15,940
the City of Berkeley and the community

436
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:20,589
actually organized and joined the case

437
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:21,220
on in with BPG against the federal

438
00:19:20,589 --> 00:19:23,379
government

439
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,660
to stop the federal government from

440
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:28,870
shutting down the city and that was

441
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,640
because Berkeley patients group is you

442
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:32,649
know I sort of call it a Berkeley

443
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,710
institution it is it's part of the

444
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:38,170
community we have you know all these

445
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:42,039
relationships with nonprofits and and

446
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:44,380
all these support efforts that we do and

447
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:48,178
fundraising drives and food drives and

448
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:52,420
toy drives and you know just become a

449
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:55,929
valuable asset and not just in you know

450
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:59,019
obviously serving consumers and patients

451
00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:01,870
is a critical part of it but you know as

452
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:03,759
in every any business corporate social

453
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:10,359
responsibility and those relationships

454
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:13,058
can really ensure to the best of its

455
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:16,779
ability that that you are going to be

456
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:18,759
secure and sustainable in the place that

457
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:21,339
you operate and that's really important

458
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:23,950
I think for public facing cannabis

459
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:26,980
operators probably definitely more so

460
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:30,370
than other parts of supply chain because

461
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:33,099
we're so public and you know whenever

462
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:35,189
anything goes wrong all of those church

463
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:37,480
your rules on at least and Berkeley or

464
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:42,160
retailers in there are for anybody else

465
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:45,700
and so having we also have that sort of

466
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:47,139
broader community of activists

467
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,690
that have all been doing this for a

468
00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:51,638
really long time and so we all help each

469
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,220
other out and we knew like it perfectly

470
00:20:51,638 --> 00:20:56,829
was going to do this and and Berkeley

471
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:59,319
goes this way you know a lot of other

472
00:20:56,829 --> 00:21:00,908
people are going to use as an excuse to

473
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:03,908
loop their city or their counting in

474
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:07,059
that direction too and so we sort of

475
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:08,590
banded together with people that no

476
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:10,960
don't necessarily have a stake in the

477
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:12,819
city of berkeley but see that if

478
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,278
something happens in berkeley it could

479
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:18,519
happen it could start a domino effect

480
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:20,169
that would be really bad because Alameda

481
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:23,919
County and San Francisco and Berkeley

482
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:26,320
declaring these as essential most likely

483
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,049
set the path for all of these other

484
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:31,298
states that later issued children place

485
00:21:29,048 --> 00:21:33,750
orders to declare cannabis as essential

486
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:36,700
yeah absolutely

487
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,470
so thank you for that and always

488
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,389
appreciative of all the hard work you

489
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:42,250
guys are doing I see your team at so

490
00:21:40,388 --> 00:21:44,619
vocal in the industry so that's that's

491
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,519
really really nice um the next thing

492
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:47,798
that I thought was really interesting

493
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,679
that I wanted to look at was like any

494
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:52,509
changes and consumer preference so I

495
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:54,070
know from a data standpoint and looking

496
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:55,960
at all the adult you cells we've seen

497
00:21:54,069 --> 00:21:57,970
this shift away from free rolls we've

498
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,190
seen negative declines in three rolls

499
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:03,058
um and then we've seen this extreme

500
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:07,240
growth or when I say extreme 28% growth

501
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:10,629
over a 30-day period in edibles and also

502
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:13,329

people in the industry and all that I do

523
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:05,679
like to refer to it as an agricultural

524
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:07,600
marketplace it's maybe better this thing

525
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,710
that we're all participating in thank

526
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,389
you so much

527
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:15,759
you were answer your question more than

528
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:18,820
I can I mean we we do abuse an amount of

529
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:21,730
sales in pre-roll specifically we have a

530
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:23,740
hash yeah give us a breakdown of your

531
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,690
business first who are you guys what do

532
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:28,839
you do just so everyone knows we're a

533
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:31,659
hella Bank we we met we're a hash

534
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:35,099
company and we specifically make hash

535
00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:39,130
from all living slow farms so we're like

536
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:41,619
we're like a small smaller hash company

537
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:44,679
I'd say we're specifically focused on

538
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:48,750
small farms craft farms and and people

539
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:51,880
who have like sustainability in mind and

540
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:54,490
army our main products are hash rosin

541
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,899
and hash and fuels and honestly it's

542
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:58,000
it's an interesting question for us

543
00:23:55,898 --> 00:24:01,178
because hash refuse approvals are

544
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,440
probably our biggest seller out of out

545
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:08,649
of the out of all the different

546
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:11,080
categories but yeah we've we've we've

547
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:14,918
definitely seen some changes throughout

548
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:19,569
this coated situation we haven't seen a

549
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:22,630
full-on decline in pre-rolls

550
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:25,028
like just for us but also we're not like

551
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:27,490
we're not like a huge part of the

552
00:24:25,028 --> 00:24:29,759
pre-roll market yet and we're also a

553
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:34,329
specialized part of the pro market where

554
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:36,220
we only do infused so we're not I don't

555
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:38,918
know that that might separate us to some

556
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:41,230
degree as well we noticed like when the

557
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:45,759
when the when it first hit first day at

558
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:48,940
home order we saw a spike in sales so it

559
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:53,500
was like like that week it was like a

560
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:55,720
bunch more sales I was like have every

561
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:58,630
week was changing though we had like we

562
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:01,528
have trip week followed by a really slow

563
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:06,340
week followed by a pretty normal week

564
00:25:01,528 --> 00:25:08,169
and then as of recently it has been it

565
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:09,730
has been a little slower it's I mean

566
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:11,620
quite a bit slower on it's been like

567
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:14,470
like I feel like

568
00:25:11,619 --> 00:25:22,658
last week was like sixty percent decline

569
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:24,879
in sales is it people aren't like

570
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:27,220
sharing you know passing it around and

571
00:25:24,878 --> 00:25:29,709
they're not sharing and therefore you

572
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:33,028
know can that be attributing to less

573
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:35,440
sales or do you have any thoughts on why

574
00:25:33,028 --> 00:25:38,769
I mean I feel like that could definitely

575
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,210
could be part of it people maybe don't

576
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:45,659
want to smoke a whole deal to their face

577
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:45,659
that make sense present company excluded

578
00:25:45,808 --> 00:25:53,278
by you all and we actually have to smoke

579
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:59,619
all the boobs to make sure they're good

580
00:25:53,278 --> 00:26:01,599
every single before it goes out but hey

581
00:25:59,618 --> 00:26:03,490
I feel like yeah some people could be

582
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,558
cautious but then there's I feel like

583
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:08,649
there's also people at least from our

584
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:10,868
perspective could do the weeks when

585
00:26:08,648 --> 00:26:13,558
we've had spikes in sales or it's been

586
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:17,079
higher than than we would have expected

587
00:26:13,558 --> 00:26:20,528
with the co bid being not a factor I

588
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:22,569
feel like it's it's kind of you know

589
00:26:20,528 --> 00:26:26,099
there's some there's still some users

590
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:28,118
that are buying more even if he rolls I

591
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:30,759
mean there's always going to our users

592
00:26:28,118 --> 00:26:35,349
like us who will smoke you know we're

593
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:37,210
willing to smoke a whole hash tube but I

594
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:39,959
mean we're also we're also kind of

595
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:42,220
behind the scenes I see the numbers

596
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,600
normally we're out in the field doing

597
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:46,210
demos and stuff like that we're not

598
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,998
doing anything like that right now so

599
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:53,619
we're like less less so exposed to the

600
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:55,569
consumer end but I mean I could

601
00:26:53,618 --> 00:26:58,599
definitely be a factor I feel like that

602
00:26:55,569 --> 00:27:01,148
cleanliness and stuff just like people

603
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:03,278
not wanting to share with anybody else

604
00:27:01,148 --> 00:27:05,408
we need to be focused towards more

605
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:08,919
single-use products or products that you

606
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:13,690
can easily divvy up into single servings

607
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:15,249
for a single person Shannon what about

608
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:18,669
from you can you can you tell us about

609
00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:24,129
space gems and wet Wendy Wendy Wendy

610
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:24,980
Oh Wendy sorry hi I'm Wendy and the

611
00:27:24,128 --> 00:27:28,069

612
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:30,289
um can you guys hear me okay okay

613
00:27:28,069 --> 00:27:34,490
awesome car um

614
00:27:30,289 --> 00:27:37,159
guy this coded thing I mean experience

615
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:41,539
it since January actually because I

616
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:44,509
packaging coming in from China and so on

617
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:47,899
like January 20th so I think going

618
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:51,230
through with it ever since then feels

619
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:54,890
like it hasn't stopped but after we got

620
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:56,329
our packaging in February 18th actually

621
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:59,660
is when our packaging got delivered a

622
00:27:56,329 --> 00:28:01,668
month later all of a sudden our sales

623
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:04,960
were huge but that's just because we

624
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:09,140
just came back on market again and then

625
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,390
like right at March 16th our sales were

626
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:13,970
like we put the biggest batches we've

627
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:15,890
ever put through testing and like they

628
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,839
were gone in four days like we could not

629
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:21,049
even believe it like I could not get

630
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:24,558
touch-up you know our struggles are

631
00:28:21,048 --> 00:28:27,859
organic sugar are like our ingredients

632
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:32,690
so that's not awesome either to assigned

633
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:35,569
with all this going on and you know our

634
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:38,960
the truck right before so a truck for

635
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:41,139
4/20 lesson Tuesday the truck before

636
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,548
that was like a really big truck also

637
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:46,610
for the truck before that so three

638
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:49,220
trucks our sales were not that great

639
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:51,589
they were pretty low and the truck was

640
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:54,350
not all the way full either but now all

641
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:56,808
of a sudden the truck is full and I feel

642
00:28:54,349 --> 00:28:58,939
like the stimulus check cuz like these

643
00:28:56,808 --> 00:29:00,829
stands up and unemployment people have

644
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:04,759
gotten money from unemployment cuz a lot

645
00:29:00,829 --> 00:29:07,039
of people you know a lot of our

646
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:09,500
customers are service based so like

647
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:11,808
restaurants and stuff I feel like our

648
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:14,450
sales are doing really well edibles I

649
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:18,349
feel like we can't keep in stock still

650
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:20,360
so that's great I guess I didn't really

651
00:29:18,349 --> 00:29:21,859
say what kind of company I have yeah

652
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:26,079
tell us yeah absolutely

653
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:26,079
of course everyone guess we need to know

654
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,620
[Music]

655
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:35,900
Tony and we do have began Organic gummy

656
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:38,019
neigh with ice water hatch and no

657
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,400
distillate or anything like that

658
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:42,579
so we're completely different from

659
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:45,190
almost all edibles on the market and

660
00:29:42,579 --> 00:29:47,949
they're handmade vegan I'd like a little

661
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:52,360
tin pretty special and you open it

662
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:57,610
little treasure so we have 2 2 th C's

663
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:59,379
and 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 and th these are just

664
00:29:57,609 --> 00:30:02,349
flying the CBDs are doing really well

665
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,970
too but the th these are just flying off

666
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:05,949
the shelf and then we have like a little

667
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:09,569
a drink that you can make drinks with

668
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:12,850
with also and it's doing really well too

669
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:18,909
and Wendy what's the connection I think

670
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:22,839
we met at the new CBA Club and so are

671
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:28,960
y'all connect trees this Waller what's

672
00:30:22,839 --> 00:30:30,399
the connection with Craig he's like my

673
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,670
business partner I guess that's the best

674
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,500
later they're talking trees and all over

675
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:38,860
ice water and everything is from talking

676
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,808
trees so he was in the background before

677
00:30:38,859 --> 00:30:44,619
then he tried to make its own coming in

678
00:30:40,808 --> 00:30:46,539
his office by yeah I'm a Satori right

679
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:49,359

680
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:51,879

excellent um yeah my husband and I are

701
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:35,230
co-founders at after Delors greens and

702
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:39,009
high tide distribution we transition

703
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:42,370
from prop 215 and we were one of the

704
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:46,119
early adopters early prop 64 compliant

705
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:51,609
companies we do some grown cultivation

706
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:53,739
and we make pictures and topicals I'm

707
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:55,899
super excited about the group of people

708
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:57,880
on here because I think we do a little

709
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,470
bit of business with everybody here and

710
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,910
I'm a big fan of Wendy's I was actually

711
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:05,620
going to be able to talk a little bit

712
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:08,440
about her products and we launched our

713
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:11,349
distribution company about a year and a

714
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,210
half ago just because we were having a

715
00:33:11,349 --> 00:33:15,519
hard time finding a distributor that

716
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:19,480
could represent small craft heritage

717
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:22,150
brands so we launched to support the

718
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,029
Fiddler's range products and have

719
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:27,910
recently been onboarding other small

720
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:31,149
brands that have the same sort of ethos

721
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:38,190
we do in terms of sun-grown

722
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:42,100
you know environmentally conscious yeah

723
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:46,360
that's a little bit about us in terms of

724
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:48,339
what we've been seeing that mid March

725
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:50,709
time frame we started seeing the big

726
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:53,529
spike I think everybody was seeing with

727
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:55,569
the uncertainty about whether or not we

728
00:33:53,529 --> 00:33:58,299
were going to get shut down how much we

729
00:33:55,569 --> 00:34:01,419
were going to be shut down as we had

730
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:03,460
some pretty big orders going out also

731
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:05,240
people were preparing for haul of

732
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:09,260
flowers and Coachella

733
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:12,650
and a lot of those types of things we've

734
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,870
seen it level off a little bit the last

735
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:17,389
couple of weeks but things are starting

736
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:18,859
to pick up again so it's it's been

737
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:22,819
really interesting it was fun to see

738
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:24,920
those charts just because I think it's

739
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,100
pretty consistent across the industry in

740
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:29,720
terms of what we're all experiencing and

741
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:31,369
nobody's really sure you know are we

742
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:33,379
staying home and smoking more are we

743
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:36,859
staying at home and stocking up and now

744
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:38,480
we're gonna see a drop-off so yeah it's

745
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,880
kind of hard to plan we just we've been

746
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,659
ramping up production and trying to be

747
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:45,260
prepared

748
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:47,569
most of the Fiddler's greens consumers

749
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:52,700
are medical patients we've got a lot of

750
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:55,130
kids you know with epilepsy and stuff

751
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:56,719
like that and so we're trying to make

752
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,430
sure that we've got product on hand

753
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:02,359
we're keeping our retailer or stocked

754
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:04,339
for those folks can you talk about what

755
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:10,160
your husband's currently doing that's

756
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:13,430
not typical yeah absolutely we just

757
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:17,149
we've been working with partners to do

758
00:35:13,429 --> 00:35:19,039
last mile fulfillment and there been

759
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:21,530
some changes on their side and we've

760
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:23,150
been looking to bring that on anyway and

761
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:28,010
had hired a couple of folks that we

762
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:30,849
wanted to do that but with the Cova and

763
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:34,010
some of the safety concerns we have just

764
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:36,440
we felt better about having Cameron in

765
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:38,360
the van doing the driving and the

766
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:43,220
deliveries he was in the marine corps

767
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:47,019
he's been through hazardous material

768
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:49,939
training and so he's he's very

769
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:52,070
experienced in the suiting up and all of

770
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,079
the precautions and so we've got him

771
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:56,269
running the van he was up at McKinley

772
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,929
bail last week he's in Palm Springs

773
00:35:56,269 --> 00:36:03,699
today was in LA yesterday so we're

774
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:03,699
keeping him from plenty busy right now

775
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:13,129
so um the last thing I guess before like

776
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,769
we close out could we each like go down

777
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:17,840
and talk about and I know this is hard

778
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:18,349
because like we're also in crow but

779
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,028
right now

780
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:21,528
but what are your thoughts on like what

781
00:36:20,028 --> 00:36:23,358
does the cannabis industry look like

782
00:36:21,528 --> 00:36:26,119
after kovat for your business in

783
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:27,588
particular and I can kind of start out

784
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:31,579
with something that I've been thinking

785
00:36:27,588 --> 00:36:34,369
about I'm really curious to see the

786
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:35,630
shifts in delivery because I think this

787
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:37,789
is going to be a whole new e-commerce

788
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:39,979
world for us I think people are now

789
00:36:37,789 --> 00:36:42,410
moving into this mindset just like we do

790
00:36:39,978 --> 00:36:44,598
with Amazon and uber and etc we're used

791
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:46,578
to this on-demand and so I'm really

792
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:49,430
curious to see kind of how things shift

793
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:52,449
into delivery so that's when the

794
00:36:49,429 --> 00:36:55,788
business side and then for me personally

795
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:57,559
I'm really interested after this post

796
00:36:55,789 --> 00:37:00,769
open world I think one of the things

797
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:02,839
that I'm learning is that I'm seeing a

798
00:37:00,768 --> 00:37:05,778
lot more of our community kind of coming

799
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:07,369
together out of necessity because we had

800
00:37:05,778 --> 00:37:09,289
to to like fight some of these city

801
00:37:07,369 --> 00:37:11,180
policies and to make sure that there

802
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:13,969
wasn't this reversal of cannabis being

803
00:37:11,179 --> 00:37:15,639
essential language so I think that we're

804
00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:17,958
gonna continue to see more collaboration

805
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:19,940
among different like sides of our

806
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:21,618
industry and then taking on some of

807
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:23,749
these bigger challenges that we have

808
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:26,959
like taxes you know within cannabis

809
00:37:23,748 --> 00:37:29,509
opening up banking etc so I think for me

810
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:31,429
it's really from the business side

811
00:37:29,509 --> 00:37:33,259
looking at ecommerce and kind of how

812
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:34,940
things are gonna shift there and from a

813
00:37:33,259 --> 00:37:39,099
personal side I just think it's gonna be

814
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:39,099
more collaboration amongst the industry

815
00:37:40,568 --> 00:37:45,259
Sabrina maybe if we could start with you

816
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:49,639
and then go to go to Tom and work our

817
00:37:45,259 --> 00:37:51,619
way down sure it's definitely hard to

818
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:56,150
speak with anyhow second legs it's gonna

819
00:37:51,619 --> 00:38:01,489
look like post COBIT I'm trying to start

820
00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:07,489
to visualize what the slow return to the

821
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:10,099
new normal is going to be I you know my

822
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:13,539
first thoughts are sort of the what's

823
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:16,400
gonna happen in terms of like in-store

824
00:38:13,539 --> 00:38:21,469
safety sanitation and social distancing

825
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:23,838
protocols that has been stepped up in

826
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:25,999
under these new orders you know I think

827
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:31,940
there's going to be some practices that

828
00:38:25,998 --> 00:38:36,559
will you know probably remain for

829
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:38,300
a while it's not permanently and I can't

830
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:40,219
I don't know you know all of this is

831
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,590
obviously based on on science and our

832
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:44,809
health experts and our doctors and what

833
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:47,360
they tell us and because it sounds like

834
00:38:44,809 --> 00:38:50,239
this is going to unroll in multiple

835
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:53,000
phases I'm kind of I can only see like

836
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:56,750
one or two days is forward I think from

837
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,389
what I know now but yeah I think the

838
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:03,739
those sort of protocols the protocols of

839
00:38:59,389 --> 00:39:09,349
like distributor to retail you know

840
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:13,969
vendor relations and drop-off as well as

841
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:18,409
you know face masks and and temp checks

842
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:20,839
and things like that that I don't know

843
00:39:18,409 --> 00:39:23,539
if that's going to flap forever I don't

844
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:24,920
know how post we're talking but it's far

845
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:26,449
into the future as I can see which at

846
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,889
this point it's probably three to six

847
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:30,739
months I have no idea what's going to

848
00:39:27,889 --> 00:39:37,909
happen after that but I also think that

849
00:39:30,739 --> 00:39:41,619
it's exposed a significant weakness and

850
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:47,000
and challenge and limitation from our

851
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:49,819
federal status as an illegal industry

852
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:52,809
and right now we're having all of these

853
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:56,870
challenges of not being able to access

854
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:58,519
federal release packages that are being

855
00:39:56,869 --> 00:40:00,349
given to all of their businesses and

856
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:03,949
especially for essential businesses and

857
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:06,110
these PPP program which is the payment

858
00:40:03,949 --> 00:40:08,509
protection program and they and it leave

859
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:12,320
and all of these requirements that are

860
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:15,380
have been put in place to support these

861
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:18,830
mitigation and social distancing

862
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:20,240
protocols that you know can the cannabis

863
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:24,880
industry which is required to follow

864
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:28,219
these rules may not get the commensurate

865
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,410
financial relief that is attached to it

866
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:35,019
or purportedly attached to it for all

867
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:37,489
businesses so this is exposing a lot of

868
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:39,440
contradictions on the federal level and

869
00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:43,639
I think we're hopefully going to see a

870
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:46,570
lot stronger broader momentum on a

871
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:46,569
federal level

872
00:40:48,548 --> 00:40:54,079
Tom we didn't even really get say we

873
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:55,400
didn't get anything from from your

874
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:00,769
background and all that stuff could show

875
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:05,450
our patient yeah I'm the patient

876
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:08,088
consumer on the panel today I've been in

877
00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:11,719
the industry since about 2015 I'm the

878
00:41:08,088 --> 00:41:16,219
founding editor of Mg magazine which is

879
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:19,098
a b2b publication covers the cannabis

880
00:41:16,219 --> 00:41:21,649
industry I'm not affiliated with them

881
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:25,369
anymore but I've spent these years

882
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:29,150
writing you know new mobile number of

883
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:32,298
articles and interviewing people from

884
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:37,068
you know CEOs of publicly traded

885
00:41:32,298 --> 00:41:40,460
companies to politicians Fiona MA and

886
00:41:37,068 --> 00:41:43,909
others to craft growers and and everyone

887
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:46,369
in between and I couldn't agree with

888
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:49,539
Sabrina more I think that COBIT has

889
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:52,490
exposed the challenges strengthened and

890
00:41:49,539 --> 00:41:57,798
weaknesses and and certainly the

891
00:41:52,489 --> 00:42:01,578
challenges with with the federal with

892
00:41:57,798 --> 00:42:05,509
the federal government but it's it's

893
00:42:01,579 --> 00:42:07,760
also an opportunity and it and also it

894
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:09,920
kind of puts things into perspective you

895
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,530
know and I think hopefully for many

896
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,389
people that some of the battles that

897
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:17,690
they are things that they were imposing

898
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:21,379
will you know not seem so dire

899
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:23,210
perhaps anymore in Los Angeles they're

900
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,670
opening up you know not just delivery

901
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:29,559
but curbside something people didn't

902
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:33,349
want to do any more or beforehand and

903
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:37,670
you know things like being forced to use

904
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:41,240
cash all the time which is not as a safe

905
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:42,318
a procedure as as other forms of

906
00:42:41,239 --> 00:42:44,298
transactions

907
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:47,449
I think there's that's a very much

908
00:42:44,298 --> 00:42:52,130
stronger argument now that people would

909
00:42:47,449 --> 00:42:54,919
have a real hard time challenging and I

910
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:56,660
know that retailers down here are

911
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:58,440
interested and are having those

912
00:42:56,659 --> 00:43:00,299
conversations with local

913
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:05,429
politicians and hopefully the state

914
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:08,730
level and and so on you know I'm hoping

915
00:43:05,429 --> 00:43:12,169
that that again after this that that

916
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:18,210
that will we'll see a sort of a kind ler

917
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:22,338
gentler retail experience I'm concerned

918
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:25,920
about a costs I have questions about how

919
00:43:22,338 --> 00:43:28,889
how manufacturers are handling their the

920
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,930
changes to their SOPs which are so

921
00:43:28,889 --> 00:43:33,299
important in this industry and so

922
00:43:30,929 --> 00:43:35,940
important in terms of efficiencies and

923
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:39,810
and being competitive and they have to

924
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:42,599
change I would assume that that the

925
00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:44,460
safety of workers would mandate that I

926
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:46,140
don't know the answers to all of that

927
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,880
but those are the questions that are

928
00:43:46,139 --> 00:43:51,150
first and foremost and then also

929
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,640
cultural ones I come out of the

930
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:56,510
traditional or traditional culture going

931
00:43:53,639 --> 00:44:00,838
way back and I don't want to lose it and

932
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:02,940
I I think it's a strong culture and

933
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:06,630
community but those are the challenges

934
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:10,980
that we face and even if you know we see

935
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:13,260
new normals you know we don't want to

936
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,420
see that the the destruction you know is

937
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:17,339
already under threat so these are the

938
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:20,190
things that I think about I'm an

939
00:44:17,338 --> 00:44:28,980
optimist but these are the challenges

940
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:31,108
that we face yeah actually yeah you know

941
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:32,969
I keep going with this and then I I have

942
00:44:31,108 --> 00:44:35,400
a different question after but we're

943
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:36,318
going we're going down the line so we're

944
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:46,920
halfway there

945
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:48,179
okay cool Wendy yeah I I feel like I

946
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:50,130
just learned a lot that we might go to

947
00:44:48,179 --> 00:44:52,739
eat Congress I have to say that I think

948
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:54,269
I was a little shocked at that I think

949
00:44:52,739 --> 00:44:57,750
that we're learning how to deal with

950
00:44:54,269 --> 00:45:01,199
this every day you know I know that the

951
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:03,920
manufacturing and for us personally like

952
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:08,578
we have everyone's six feet away and

953
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:11,519
it's hard but we're doing it and we I

954
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:12,210
was like shifts the people can't have

955
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:15,329
everyone at

956
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:19,289
I can't have team meetings anymore got

957
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:24,329
to have broken up team meetings and I

958
00:45:19,289 --> 00:45:26,250
really is I really and I feel like it's

959
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:29,219
it's great because I had been in the

960
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:33,630
seam since 2013 and have been pushing

961
00:45:29,219 --> 00:45:37,500
space gems since 2013 so have people who

962
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:39,660
love our product but you know you know

963
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,920
with curbside I see a lot because people

964
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:42,389
aren't seeing the product anymore

965
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,970
they're not seeing the display case

966
00:45:42,389 --> 00:45:48,000
they're just looking off an iPad and you

967
00:45:44,969 --> 00:45:50,730
really have to push social media or

968
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,730
anything that you can push Reda stood

969
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:56,280
care packages of a coloring book to

970
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:58,500
everyone with like thicker sheets and

971
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:01,200
stuff just to tell people that we love

972
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:05,210
them and we put a crystal in them and we

973
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:07,980
mailed off like over 300 of them and

974
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:09,210
just to people I think that that's I

975
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:11,179
think we're gonna have to start doing

976
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:13,440
more of that because we can't do

977
00:46:11,179 --> 00:46:15,329
education we can't do demos and that's

978
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,329
what we really focus on especially with

979
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:19,858
the ice water hash and a gummy market

980
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:25,049
where there's a lot of other people in

981
00:46:19,858 --> 00:46:28,139
there but I really hope that every day

982
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:30,570
where we're presented with challenges of

983
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:33,088
like this summer it's going to be hard

984
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:35,940
to wear a mask when cooking over a hot

985
00:46:33,088 --> 00:46:38,369
stove and hot boiling pot like that is

986
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:40,409
we all wear masks but that is something

987
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:42,240
that is going to be hard and we all are

988
00:46:40,409 --> 00:46:46,190
talking about how we're going to go

989
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:50,118
around that because summer does get hot

990
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:53,010
and I don't see this ending soon

991
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:56,039
unfortunately which I like to think all

992
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:59,339
rainbows and unicorns but they don't at

993
00:46:56,039 --> 00:47:02,099
this very moment so we are gonna have to

994
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:03,779
strategize on how to figure out how to

995
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:07,289
stay on the Shelf how to make people

996
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:10,380
still buy our product to make people so

997
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:12,239
you know know us by brand name because

998
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:16,588
they're not seeing us and it's on an

999
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:18,959
iPad or yeah or on the Internet so I

1000
00:47:16,588 --> 00:47:21,420
hope that did that answer your question

1001
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,789
yeah no I think it's such a good point

1002
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:25,369
because um you know we do have so many

1003
00:47:23,789 --> 00:47:27,949
brands here in

1004
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:29,869
I think in Flour particular there's I

1005
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:31,639
don't know the latest number but three

1006
00:47:29,869 --> 00:47:33,710
to four hundred unique brands in

1007
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:36,529
California legal unique brands sold in

1008
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:38,449
shops so this is gonna shift all of

1009
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:41,210
their businesses into thinking yes how

1010
00:47:38,449 --> 00:47:43,429
do we take this digitally in a product

1011
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:45,170
that really does require that that in

1012
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:47,719
person to really get the sense that

1013
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:49,820
product which makes it very hard because

1014
00:47:47,719 --> 00:47:52,849
at a federal level we don't have

1015
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:54,440
advertising at scale Facebook Google you

1016
00:47:52,849 --> 00:47:56,900
know Instagram all the all these

1017
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:59,090
publishers as cannabis businesses we

1018
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,650
can't go advertise them on that scale so

1019
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:02,450
you have to get really creative with how

1020
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:04,010
you're gonna get customer acquisition

1021
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:06,500
and drive them into your digital

1022
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:07,880
property to purchase that product so I

1023
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,639
think everyone's really gonna have to

1024
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:12,050
adapt here quickly and learn from each

1025
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:14,569
other and this is perhaps another

1026
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:15,860
session that someone I think CMA

1027
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:17,660
actually the cannabis Marketing

1028
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:19,670
Association is doing some stuff like

1029
00:48:17,659 --> 00:48:21,529
this that's probably a resource for you

1030
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:23,659
to check out in terms of like what is

1031
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:26,690
allowed in terms of different digital

1032
00:48:23,659 --> 00:48:30,949
advertising to be able to to help your

1033
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:32,510
business with that thank you and I ask a

1034
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:34,250
follow-up question about that because

1035
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:37,220
it's so interesting and we've been

1036
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:40,670
talking about that do do the people here

1037
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:43,429
think now is a good or a bad time to

1038
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:46,280
launch a new product yes it's a

1039
00:48:43,429 --> 00:48:48,769
challenging time but we also have sort

1040
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:51,590
of everyone's attention because you know

1041
00:48:48,769 --> 00:49:00,590
they're all inside so I'm interested in

1042
00:48:51,590 --> 00:49:02,480
people's opinion about that me

1043
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:04,360
personally I would think going to be a

1044
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,219
little challenging because you can't do

1045
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,870
you can't see buyers so it has to be

1046
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:13,579
like this they want to be able to see

1047
00:49:08,869 --> 00:49:15,109
the product you know it would just yeah

1048
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:16,880
I feel like that name is really

1049
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:20,300
important and so that's what people

1050
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:24,039
usually buy on is the name and they

1051
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:26,840
would have a cinnamon smell our anymore

1052
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:30,019
your we have demos all the time in the

1053
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:31,910
dispensary and that yeah that sort of

1054
00:49:30,019 --> 00:49:33,679
person-to-person contact where they can

1055
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:37,639
see the product and then sell the

1056
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:39,019
product and then talk to somebody taking

1057
00:49:37,639 --> 00:49:41,569
that part away

1058
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:44,599
and you know it's gonna be challenging

1059
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:48,440
to figure out how to replace that to

1060
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:53,059
bring on new brand it didn't Ken Besant

1061
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:55,730
just launched a new net not even like a

1062
00:49:53,059 --> 00:50:01,340
value brand yeah yeah a value brand and

1063
00:49:55,730 --> 00:50:04,280
they got skewered for it but uh yeah

1064
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:06,050
this is another I think that we might

1065
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:08,060
have to that brands might have to adapt

1066
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:08,780
to and like a you know if we go into

1067
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:10,460
recession

1068
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:12,440
especially the premium brands thinking

1069
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:14,240
about how are you gonna because some of

1070
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,860
them were seeing them drive value brands

1071
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:18,589
and so we still don't know yet our

1072
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:21,079
consumers willing to purchase these more

1073
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:24,440
premium brands or are they gonna be much

1074
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:25,819
more cost kind of conscious headset just

1075
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,440
did an analysis on this actually

1076
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:29,030
yesterday and it's it's on their blog

1077
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,119
people are still buying premium eights

1078
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:34,430
there hasn't been any change there so

1079
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:36,769
that has been good for for I think the

1080
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:39,789
industry though definitely a shift into

1081
00:50:36,769 --> 00:50:44,090
larger package size for purchases so

1082
00:50:39,789 --> 00:50:47,059
definitely a lot of growth does a

1083
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:49,460
headset or anyone else have any insights

1084
00:50:47,059 --> 00:50:53,509
into demographics I heard from a

1085
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:55,940
retailer last week that his younger

1086
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:58,760
customers had fallen off I guess

1087
00:50:55,940 --> 00:51:02,690
and but his older ones were continuing

1088
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:04,820
to sustain the business yeah actually we

1089
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:07,760
do have a lot of information on customer

1090
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:09,980
demographics um I I have to jump to

1091
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,750
another meeting but I will say this

1092
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,409
because you can find the answer to this

1093
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,559
question

1094
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:18,529
headset on the website there's this blue

1095
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:20,360
teal bar and this our team updates every

1096
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:22,040
single day in the markets they're the

1097
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,660
states that we're reporting on all the

1098
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:25,400
real-time updates that we're finding is

1099
00:51:23,659 --> 00:51:28,369
it pertains to kovat so there's some

1100
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:31,550
interesting trends in there for customer

1101
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:34,190
demographics women actually had much

1102
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:35,840
larger purchases than men probably

1103
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:38,960
because they didn't have item stocked up

1104
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:40,970
on hand generally but we're answering as

1105
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,500
many of those questions as we can and if

1106
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:44,929
they're actually Peter if there's any

1107
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:46,159
questions that you're getting if people

1108
00:51:44,929 --> 00:51:48,949
hit you up after this

1109
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:51,659
our team is is able to kind of look at

1110
00:51:48,949 --> 00:51:53,609
all of this data and kind of report on

1111
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:55,769
so we just need more insight from the

1112
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:57,780
community in terms of what do you need

1113
00:51:55,769 --> 00:51:59,460
to know from this data and your

1114
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:01,830
businesses that would be helpful and we

1115
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:07,050
would be happy to do that investigation

1116
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:09,360

the local level but like Co bid hits and

1129
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:54,599
what's going like it's almost like the

1130
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:56,819
siren sounds in the battleship and like

1131
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:58,589
everybody goes to their post and kind of

1132
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:01,680
what were you guys talking about

1133
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:05,579
internally you're probably on the front

1134
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:13,649
lines of SOPs and understanding what the

1135
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:16,199
government you know and then just for

1136
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:19,380

down but um like what's changed like

1139
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:28,500
Frank you you guys always you have a

1140
00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:30,659
history of you know I see Instagram

1141
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,820
posts you guys going to visit all the

1142
00:53:30,659 --> 00:53:34,980
farms that you deal with and still like

1143
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:39,200
you're obviously probably not doing that

1144
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:42,179
and in taking trim and flower and

1145
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:44,579
showing up the manufacturing facility

1146
00:53:42,179 --> 00:53:47,069
with you know or do you guys have to

1147
00:53:44,579 --> 00:53:49,500
stagger shifts and then totally not the

1148
00:53:47,070 --> 00:53:52,410
distributors and things like that so

1149
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:54,269
just Sabrina Spellman Soph

1150
00:53:52,409 --> 00:53:57,170
well so so let's start with Sabrina but

1151
00:53:54,269 --> 00:54:01,969
just kind of going down the line

1152
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:05,539
okay well let's see it it's been quite a

1153
00:54:01,969 --> 00:54:09,169
whirlwind you know is

1154
00:54:05,539 --> 00:54:12,590
it's been a lot of pivoting and adapting

1155
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:15,079
and and shifting and interpreting you

1156
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:18,800
know going from shelter-in-place are we

1157
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:21,019
essential to you know where in what

1158
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,850
capacity can we operate and we want to

1159
00:54:21,019 --> 00:54:24,469
be equal to every other essential

1160
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:27,650
business and then fighting that fight

1161
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:30,109
and then you know there are certain

1162
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:32,869
protocols for essential businesses that

1163
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:37,130
are public facing and there was an

1164
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:40,639
initial set of protocols so the store

1165
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:42,860
had to adapt to those and then there

1166
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:45,679
were also you know we had certain

1167
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:47,329
employees that had to had children that

1168
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:50,779
were no longer in school and did not

1169
00:54:47,329 --> 00:54:55,400
have childcare so there was that whole

1170
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:59,030
situation and and then the city and the

1171
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:01,940
county put out new additional protocol

1172
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:04,400
sister protocols for publication

1173
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:08,780
businesses so again the entire

1174
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:10,760
operations team had to pivot again and

1175
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:13,790
they add they put them out at you know

1176
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:17,330
7:00 o'clock at night one night and it

1177
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:21,529
was effective you know midnight I like

1178
00:55:17,329 --> 00:55:26,289
the next day and so you know it's just

1179
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:35,180
been it almost reminded me of the home

1180
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:37,759
sorry my son am I still there okay the

1181
00:55:35,179 --> 00:55:40,009
you know the first few months of 2018

1182
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,770
honestly and just everyone trying to

1183
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:45,440
figure out what would go going on what

1184
00:55:42,769 --> 00:55:47,960
we can do what we can't do how are we

1185
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,610
interpreting these rules properly you

1186
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:53,599
know there's what the state says there's

1187
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:55,370
a city says you know just kind of

1188
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,710
pivoting and then it's all there was

1189
00:55:55,369 --> 00:56:04,130
also you know making sure that everybody

1190
00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:05,690
has the proper PPE and you know how

1191
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:08,079
making sure that we can source that

1192
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:13,909
which has become increasingly

1193
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:16,358
challenging and and now it's just sort

1194
00:56:13,909 --> 00:56:19,088
of like kind of on

1195
00:56:16,358 --> 00:56:22,509
we're on edge because it's in terms of

1196
00:56:19,088 --> 00:56:24,369
like SOPs I mean also well I would

1197
00:56:22,509 --> 00:56:28,059
include like scaling up delivery like I

1198
00:56:24,369 --> 00:56:29,880
mentioned earlier where basically none

1199
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:32,950
of the dispensaries in the city were

1200
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:36,068
prepared to go to delivery only

1201
00:56:32,949 --> 00:56:39,338
operations and we were we had one or two

1202
00:56:36,068 --> 00:56:41,670
cars I'd literally just started delivery

1203
00:56:39,338 --> 00:56:43,869
like a day or two earlier we kind of

1204
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:46,059
assumed something like this was going to

1205
00:56:43,869 --> 00:56:48,059
happen we had already done the curbside

1206
00:56:46,059 --> 00:56:50,890
oh and then there was also the BCC

1207
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:53,789
getting approval from the Bureau of

1208
00:56:50,889 --> 00:56:57,719
cannabis control to implement these new

1209
00:56:53,789 --> 00:57:01,930
protocols and invoking their emergency

1210
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:05,018
section in their regulations to allow us

1211
00:57:01,929 --> 00:57:09,489
to curbside to put in Plexiglas to do

1212
00:57:05,018 --> 00:57:13,629
all of these mitigation and efficiency

1213
00:57:09,489 --> 00:57:19,210
requirements that were all made to

1214
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:23,858
follow and so it's yeah it's just been a

1215
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:27,880
constant scaling and shuffling and

1216
00:57:23,858 --> 00:57:30,130
adopting and readapting to you know this

1217
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,869
new environment and you know hourly

1218
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:34,180
right like I said it was very

1219
00:57:31,869 --> 00:57:38,349
reminiscent of 2018 and the beginning of

1220
00:57:34,179 --> 00:57:40,568
2018 but I feel like this was this was

1221
00:57:38,349 --> 00:57:42,730
more challenging and a smaller more

1222
00:57:40,568 --> 00:57:47,588
compact period of time coupled with like

1223
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:49,778
a global pandemic and a sheltering in

1224
00:57:47,588 --> 00:57:53,288
place and and every other aspect of our

1225
00:57:49,778 --> 00:57:55,960
life being disrupted as opposed to 2018

1226
00:57:53,289 --> 00:57:58,480
where it was just our our businesses and

1227
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:00,338
and how those operate was very

1228
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:07,059
disruptive and very stressful but this

1229
00:58:00,338 --> 00:58:11,498
is some next-level stressful so that's

1230
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:14,160
that's sort of where to see my

1231
00:58:11,498 --> 00:58:16,808
experience and our experience has been

1232
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:20,528
you know obviously experiencing the same

1233
00:58:16,809 --> 00:58:25,180
trends that have been mentioned before I

1234
00:58:20,528 --> 00:58:29,710
think that the curb size definitely more

1235
00:58:25,179 --> 00:58:30,259
active than the delivery there's a big

1236
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:38,300
debate

1237
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:40,880
whether or not delivery that but if yeah

1238
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:42,440
it's yeah I'm kind of on guard I'm just

1239
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,780
waiting for the another shoe to drop in

1240
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:47,470
another another rule from some level of

1241
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:51,080
government oh and then there's a federal

1242
00:58:47,469 --> 00:58:53,000
you know relief spills and tears and all

1243
00:58:51,079 --> 00:58:56,329
of those things that have these like I

1244
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:59,300
have mentioned the labor requirement for

1245
00:58:56,329 --> 00:59:01,670
employees and businesses and and links

1246
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:05,240
so also understanding how we fit into

1247
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:09,320
that and where where we can tap into

1248
00:59:05,239 --> 00:59:11,359
relief and and lobbying the state to see

1249
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:13,300
if we can access relief there that we

1250
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:15,860
can't get from the federal government so

1251
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:18,380
it's always something with some level of

1252
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:21,410
government and and figuring out where we

1253
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:24,769
fit in what how to comply what's the

1254
00:59:21,409 --> 00:59:31,429
right interpretation is and path forward

1255
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:34,429
right right we will pretend and Frank

1256
00:59:31,429 --> 00:59:37,549
and Igor as we get on the line they can

1257
00:59:34,429 --> 00:59:40,069
join twins what can you talk about kind

1258
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:43,760
of things that have changed in the past

1259
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:46,250
month or so in terms of dealing like

1260
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:48,800
looking backwards down the supply chain

1261
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:50,750
and forwards up the supply chain and how

1262
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:57,019
you kind of interact and deal with each

1263
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:59,780
part of it yeah I mean you mentioned you

1264
00:59:57,019 --> 01:00:03,349
know visiting farms yes we're not we're

1265
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:05,180
not when I visit any farms right now for

1266
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:07,819
safety reasons but also it's just like

1267
01:00:05,179 --> 01:00:10,279
not the right time of the season I spent

1268
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:16,460
three months like borderline living in

1269
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:18,470
home all like three to five days where

1270
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:20,420
we're uh we're still in our startup

1271
01:00:18,469 --> 01:00:22,939
phase and we're we're a really small

1272
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:27,470
team of just like five people at the

1273
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:31,519
office we all live together as roommates

1274
01:00:27,469 --> 01:00:33,049
in a day it's in addition to working

1275
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:37,190
together so we're not really like

1276
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:39,380
exposing ourselves to people out there

1277
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:41,840
our comes into our office the main

1278
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:43,539
things I've noticed have changed as yeah

1279
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:45,370
we're not doing any demos

1280
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:47,469
I've personally have been out there

1281
01:00:45,369 --> 01:00:48,969
doing a lot of our own demos we have a

1282
01:00:47,469 --> 01:00:51,219
brand ambassador as well but obviously

1283
01:00:48,969 --> 01:00:55,480
cut all that off so we're trying to

1284
01:00:51,219 --> 01:00:58,149
focus more on digital media and we are

1285
01:00:55,480 --> 01:01:00,519
we have been starting to you know kind

1286
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:02,519
of target more delivery services and

1287
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:08,139
stuff like that when it comes to sales

1288
01:01:02,519 --> 01:01:10,150
but things have been semi normal for us

1289
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:11,529
I'd say just because we're way more

1290
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:14,530
engrossed in the manufacturing process

1291
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:16,450
and then the sales but we do we do sales

1292
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:18,790
as well as far as manufacturing we're

1293
01:01:16,449 --> 01:01:20,679
kind of like you know we're we're all

1294
01:01:18,789 --> 01:01:22,840
staying healthy we're all trying to stay

1295
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:25,569
clean Li and things like that but we're

1296
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:27,309
also just we're we're able to stay safe

1297
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:30,670
because we're not constantly exposed to

1298
01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:33,099
like the customers or anything like that

1299
01:01:30,670 --> 01:01:36,480
when we we've been minimizing the amount

1300
01:01:33,099 --> 01:01:38,920
of material going in or out

1301
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,289
unless it's something that needs to

1302
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,849
happen and we've been practicing social

1303
01:01:41,289 --> 01:01:46,269
distancing and stuff like that so just

1304
01:01:42,849 --> 01:01:48,369
normal stuff that people you know

1305
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:52,349
working in any in any business right now

1306
01:01:48,369 --> 01:01:54,789
are experiencing I will say though

1307
01:01:52,349 --> 01:01:57,190
there's I feel like there's a shift in

1308
01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:59,320
mentality for people since people are

1309
01:01:57,190 --> 01:02:00,490
you know more anxious more afraid and

1310
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:05,110
stuff like that so it's something that

1311
01:02:00,489 --> 01:02:08,279
we're kind of anticipating as we proceed

1312
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:10,660
in cannabis which is which is really

1313
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:13,210
kind of a bummer I feel like I'm like

1314
01:02:10,659 --> 01:02:16,239
I've been making hash for 12 years in a

1315
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:20,079
cannabis nerd for significant longer

1316
01:02:16,239 --> 01:02:21,189
than that but cannabis is kind of a

1317
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:22,929
thing that kind of brings people

1318
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:24,429
together I feel like it's like really

1319
01:02:22,929 --> 01:02:26,169
been like a communal thing people are

1320
01:02:24,429 --> 01:02:27,969
used to smoking with each other and

1321
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:31,150
getting close I feel like it brings

1322
01:02:27,969 --> 01:02:33,449
people together you know in America I

1323
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:36,130
feel like there's been a bit of like

1324
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:37,179
even before this like oh good thing I

1325
01:02:36,130 --> 01:02:38,440
feel like there's definitely some

1326
01:02:37,179 --> 01:02:40,119
programming out there where everybody

1327
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:41,679
kind of wants to distance just weren't

1328
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:42,909
quite you know we're not quite to level

1329
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:44,199
of like Italy or where people are

1330
01:02:42,909 --> 01:02:46,359
kissing each other three times before

1331
01:02:44,199 --> 01:02:48,730
they depart but then also you know

1332
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:50,500
things like this this go big hit Italy

1333
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:54,190
especially hard maybe partially due to

1334
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:55,380
that but I think that cannabis has been

1335
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:57,240
like kind of that for

1336
01:02:55,380 --> 01:03:01,710
in America that's brought people

1337
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:04,500
together so it's um I really I really

1338
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:06,028
hope that that we can overcome this in a

1339
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,440
way where we're not going to come out of

1340
01:03:06,028 --> 01:03:09,028
it being like I don't want to touch

1341
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,440
anybody I want to keep my distance from

1342
01:03:09,028 --> 01:03:14,099
everybody I'm not gonna smoke with

1343
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:16,650
anybody ever again and then as far as

1344
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:19,259
like as far as the the currency is

1345
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:23,000
concerned I'm actually pretty concerned

1346
01:03:19,259 --> 01:03:24,659
if we go to fully e-commerce you know

1347
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,278
yeah I agree

1348
01:03:24,659 --> 01:03:29,639
money is a little bit a little bit

1349
01:03:26,278 --> 01:03:31,768
dirtier thing but are we gonna really

1350
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:33,989
give up all our freedoms all like total

1351
01:03:31,768 --> 01:03:37,439
to a level where all all money is

1352
01:03:33,989 --> 01:03:40,558
tracked forever forever a a super big

1353
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:43,259
big brother level if we're to go to

1354
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:45,900
fully Commerce so personally I feel like

1355
01:03:43,259 --> 01:03:47,369
yeah I just I feel like we should we

1356
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:49,639
should definitely try to hold on to some

1357
01:03:47,369 --> 01:03:52,710
humanity through all this I feel like

1358
01:03:49,639 --> 01:03:54,989
you know before we're like yes you know

1359
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:56,789
money is too dirty let's let's get on

1360
01:03:54,989 --> 01:03:59,068
the bandwagon let's get rid of it

1361
01:03:56,789 --> 01:04:03,089
I mean in general what its gonna do as

1362
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:05,190
far as just to the level of doing that

1363
01:04:03,088 --> 01:04:09,150
we're gonna have on our financial system

1364
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:11,039
if we go to full full e-commerce I'm

1365
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:14,220
more of a you know power to the people

1366
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:16,589
type person so I'm not really gonna I

1367
01:04:14,219 --> 01:04:18,179
personally don't support that I prefer

1368
01:04:16,588 --> 01:04:19,858
to agenda I feel like that's the that's

1369
01:04:18,179 --> 01:04:23,088
the thing that that they wanted

1370
01:04:19,858 --> 01:04:29,068
beforehand before before kovat hit

1371
01:04:23,088 --> 01:04:31,920
there's regular currencies for kovat hit

1372
01:04:29,068 --> 01:04:33,719
they've been trying to get us you know

1373
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,369
not connect catalyst yeah

1374
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:37,558
not connect with each other on a

1375
01:04:35,369 --> 01:04:40,410
personal level and this is just reason

1376
01:04:37,559 --> 01:04:43,259
that another reason that about there now

1377
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:46,170
that people have and it's it's them than

1378
01:04:43,259 --> 01:04:49,980
fear so I feel like everybody be safe

1379
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:53,278
everybody you know be cleanliness we get

1380
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:54,809
over this thing don't as a message that

1381
01:04:53,278 --> 01:04:58,289
out to the people I'd say don't don't

1382
01:04:54,809 --> 01:04:59,548
let it rule your life for the rest of

1383
01:04:58,289 --> 01:05:01,528
for the rest of your life you know we

1384
01:04:59,548 --> 01:05:04,619
had the Spanish flu a hundred years ago

1385
01:05:01,528 --> 01:05:06,929
and before COBIT hit you know people

1386
01:05:04,619 --> 01:05:09,160
weren't walking around masks because of

1387
01:05:06,929 --> 01:05:12,068
what happened in 1918

1388
01:05:09,159 --> 01:05:14,170
so same thing here I feel like we need

1389
01:05:12,068 --> 01:05:17,190
to come out of this just human still and

1390
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:20,170
not as just some like fear-mongering

1391
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:24,670
like wish like part of some crazy fear

1392
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:26,318
machine but I'd like to really fast just

1393
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:33,278
address the last question that you there

1394
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:34,719
you guys were asked about the just like

1395
01:05:33,278 --> 01:05:36,548
where you see things after this and some

1396
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:39,459
of that like what you know I I think

1397
01:05:36,548 --> 01:05:41,679
that like where we are at where we're

1398
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:44,108
specifically doing is we're we're

1399
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:46,000
working with sustainable agriculture and

1400
01:05:44,108 --> 01:05:47,858
regenerative farming practice isn't

1401
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,989
stuff so to see more of those farms come

1402
01:05:47,858 --> 01:05:51,548
out of this more more people more

1403
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:52,778
organic farms to taking the next step

1404
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:54,699
and going to regenerative and

1405
01:05:52,778 --> 01:05:56,318
sustainable you know that's like what I

1406
01:05:54,699 --> 01:05:57,460
want to see out of this whole thing and

1407
01:05:56,318 --> 01:05:59,139
that's like the only input I actually

1408
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:00,909
had in this whole discussion and stuff

1409
01:05:59,139 --> 01:06:03,818
because basically it's like what I think

1410
01:06:00,909 --> 01:06:06,159
about all day and this has been a major

1411
01:06:03,818 --> 01:06:07,538
catalyst for information to be spread

1412
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:09,518
and it's an opportunity for people to

1413
01:06:07,539 --> 01:06:11,259
either you know go the opposite way and

1414
01:06:09,518 --> 01:06:13,179
surrender and actually depend on the

1415
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:14,588
government hardcore or you know go the

1416
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:16,989
opposite and be sustainable like

1417
01:06:14,588 --> 01:06:18,788
cannabis has taught a lot of people all

1418
01:06:16,989 --> 01:06:19,989
the heroes that I have in this industry

1419
01:06:18,789 --> 01:06:21,460
are people that came out here didn't

1420
01:06:19,989 --> 01:06:23,528
know what was gonna happen you know or

1421
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:24,880
you know grow up here and and just

1422
01:06:23,528 --> 01:06:26,710
really put their all in every bit of

1423
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,759
their effort into making a good product

1424
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:29,440
and then that's what they have their

1425
01:06:27,759 --> 01:06:31,240
name for you know it reminds me of all

1426
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:33,009
the crafts and like the goods that you

1427
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:34,868
know this this United States used to be

1428
01:06:33,009 --> 01:06:36,639
bad asked for for doing so I feel like

1429
01:06:34,869 --> 01:06:39,759
we have we have an opportunity here to

1430
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:41,618
seize you know the food industry will

1431
01:06:39,759 --> 01:06:43,960
combine with the cannabis industry when

1432
01:06:41,619 --> 01:06:46,690
everything goes big and whatever and I

1433
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:50,829
know I'm a romantic optimist in that but

1434
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:54,389
that's my little piece of Frank is not

1435
01:06:50,829 --> 01:06:58,450
an advanced nutrients brand ambassador

1436
01:06:54,389 --> 01:06:58,449
[Laughter]

1437
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:09,609
Shannon yeah I'm I don't exactly

1438
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:12,220
remember what the question was i I think

1439
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:13,929
it's just kind of adding anything so

1440
01:07:12,219 --> 01:07:16,058
kind of short like you had mentioned you

1441
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:18,460
know Cameron's down making deliveries

1442
01:07:16,059 --> 01:07:21,550
which was out of the out of the ordinary

1443
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:23,260
for you guys what what kind of

1444
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:29,950
some of the things that have been going

1445
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:32,530
on recently related to Tobin 19 yes so

1446
01:07:29,949 --> 01:07:35,589
you know because we're tested to such

1447
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:38,260
high standards I think for cannabis it

1448
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:40,329
was a little bit easier like there was

1449
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:43,720
no shortage of gloves or isopropyl

1450
01:07:40,329 --> 01:07:46,210
alcohol in my facility so you know those

1451
01:07:43,719 --> 01:07:47,739
were things that we did are ready the

1452
01:07:46,210 --> 01:07:51,179
things I think we're struggling a little

1453
01:07:47,739 --> 01:07:53,739
bit with Armour on the community side

1454
01:07:51,179 --> 01:07:57,099
you know we're a small close-knit group

1455
01:07:53,739 --> 01:07:58,779
too like everybody hugs and says I love

1456
01:07:57,099 --> 01:08:00,789
you at the end of the day when they're

1457
01:07:58,780 --> 01:08:02,769
leaving Sophia that's been a little

1458
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:05,590
weird you know

1459
01:08:02,769 --> 01:08:07,840
Cameron was up at Trinity colony picking

1460
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:09,670
up flower at soul spirit last week and

1461
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:11,380
he's like you know I'm seeing an 8 10

1462
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:14,230
feet away from them while we're like

1463
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:16,600
counting the inventory and wearing

1464
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:18,369
gloves than masks and normally we'd be

1465
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:21,039
sharing joints and hugging and

1466
01:08:18,369 --> 01:08:26,048
high-fiving so those kinds of things

1467
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:29,109
have been really challenging but in

1468
01:08:26,048 --> 01:08:33,509
terms of I don't know it's it's been a

1469
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:37,390
really weird strange world and I think

1470
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:39,399
we're gonna have to battle to to

1471
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:42,310
preserve the community side of it

1472
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:44,949
through this and you know I'm a bit of

1473
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:47,109
an introvert but I really have been

1474
01:08:44,949 --> 01:08:49,838
missing hugging and sharing a joint with

1475
01:08:47,109 --> 01:08:52,109
my friends you know that's been really

1476
01:08:49,838 --> 01:08:54,670
weird for me

1477
01:08:52,109 --> 01:08:56,259
but we've also you know like the

1478
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:58,088
teachers are great because you don't

1479
01:08:56,259 --> 01:09:00,189
have to if you're not looking The

1480
01:08:58,088 --> 01:09:02,519
Dropper late you can still medicate

1481
01:09:00,189 --> 01:09:04,838
edibles are great we're working with a

1482
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:08,910
company called O'Meara

1483
01:09:04,838 --> 01:09:13,600
and so Sonoma and they're single serving

1484
01:09:08,909 --> 01:09:15,759
individual pre-packed whole flower vape

1485
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,980
products and so you know I think some of

1486
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:22,390
those innovative products we're going to

1487
01:09:17,979 --> 01:09:24,818
be seeing higher use of we've seen sales

1488
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:27,548
go up on those we also work with herbal

1489
01:09:24,819 --> 01:09:29,440
Buena who makes a quiver which is a

1490
01:09:27,548 --> 01:09:33,789
personal lubricant we've seen sales on

1491
01:09:29,439 --> 01:09:34,639
that go ups you know it just it's it's a

1492
01:09:33,789 --> 01:09:37,130
shift

1493
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:40,190
and we just we can't forget where we

1494
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:42,199
came from we can't forget the human side

1495
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:47,449
of things but we've also got to be safe

1496
01:09:42,199 --> 01:09:50,119
and it's weird I'm not gonna lie this is

1497
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:52,250
a weird world that you know Cameron's

1498
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:56,390
also been joking he's like never wasted

1499
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:58,670
going in crisis and Sonoma County is a

1500
01:09:56,390 --> 01:10:00,440
really good example of that we were one

1501
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:02,630
of the first counties to put out a

1502
01:10:00,439 --> 01:10:05,689
cannabis ordinance a couple of years ago

1503
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:09,159
and then they pulled back and you know

1504
01:10:05,689 --> 01:10:12,769
really hurt a lot of operators but when

1505
01:10:09,159 --> 01:10:14,630
the corona staff happened Sonoma County

1506
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:17,000
was the first one one of the first ones

1507
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:19,210
to put out an ordinance and they listed

1508
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,560
cannabis as an essential business as

1509
01:10:19,210 --> 01:10:24,439
agriculture and medicine and they

1510
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:26,840
haven't back down from that so you know

1511
01:10:24,439 --> 01:10:30,139
we have to keep fighting we have to keep

1512
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:32,029
being loud and vocal and pushing on our

1513
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:35,270
regulators you know they're calling us

1514
01:10:32,029 --> 01:10:37,340
an essential business give us access to

1515
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:40,760
banking don't make us handle dirty cash

1516
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:43,279
give us access to the things that are

1517
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:45,260
gonna make us be sustainable businesses

1518
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:49,159
stop trying to tax us into oblivion

1519
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:52,610
now's the time to push and really you

1520
01:10:49,159 --> 01:10:54,170
know say we're here like ya'll said were

1521
01:10:52,609 --> 01:11:04,939
essential stop treating us like

1522
01:10:54,170 --> 01:11:11,779
criminals Wendy do you want to go after

1523
01:11:04,939 --> 01:11:20,509
that so good I can't say it looks like

1524
01:11:11,779 --> 01:11:23,149
so awesome yeah like where do I see this

1525
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:26,270
go either one I I think is kind of like

1526
01:11:23,149 --> 01:11:28,219
what what has been going on like what

1527
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:32,510
was one of the last conversations you

1528
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:35,420
and Craig had today yesterday last week

1529
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:39,590
about just dealing with crazy shit

1530
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:42,109
that's going on we just had it as I were

1531
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:47,890
on this I was telling Craig like all the

1532
01:11:42,109 --> 01:11:52,119
stats that she provided and yeah

1533
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:54,130
we I think both of us are a little bit

1534
01:11:52,119 --> 01:11:59,140
in denial I think that that's okay to

1535
01:11:54,130 --> 01:12:01,539
say and but we really see it's happening

1536
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:04,930
and any we're using the mass where

1537
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:07,899
everyone has the gloves all of our

1538
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:11,970
places are six feet with like just

1539
01:12:07,899 --> 01:12:17,769
social distancing and everything but

1540
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:20,770
yeah I definitely see that we have to

1541
01:12:17,770 --> 01:12:21,630
figure out how to keep present and keep

1542
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:26,110
moving

1543
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:28,000
especially both of our brands and it is

1544
01:12:26,109 --> 01:12:30,789
great because we are a big family I

1545
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:34,210
think that there's 80 hundred ten people

1546
01:12:30,789 --> 01:12:37,539
that work for Craig all together so we

1547
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:42,579
all there's a lot of there's a lot of us

1548
01:12:37,539 --> 01:12:43,659
and you know how it's cool because we

1549
01:12:42,579 --> 01:12:46,059
have distribution and retail

1550
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:51,789
manufacturing in the farm so we get to

1551
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:55,390
see all the different things and we all

1552
01:12:51,789 --> 01:12:57,519
all of us managers are reacting it's

1553
01:12:55,390 --> 01:13:02,950
great that we only personally I only

1554
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:05,050
lost one person to all this team member

1555
01:13:02,949 --> 01:13:07,710
and everyone else was adaptable and

1556
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:12,400
flexible to change their schedule and

1557
01:13:07,710 --> 01:13:14,470
everything like that but you know right

1558
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:17,799
when this started I do have to say it

1559
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:21,550
was really high intensity just like

1560
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:27,150
Frank said anxiety to keep the team

1561
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:30,220
going but we made it through and yeah I

1562
01:13:27,149 --> 01:13:32,109
just really hope organic sugar is like

1563
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:36,789
my biggest struggle I can't even say

1564
01:13:32,109 --> 01:13:39,039
that enough like I am like fighting and

1565
01:13:36,789 --> 01:13:41,079
then we get organic sugar from a

1566
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,760
different source and it's contaminated

1567
01:13:41,079 --> 01:13:46,600
and the lab calls me to tell me it's

1568
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:49,119
contaminated you know where we buy all

1569
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:50,890
of our supplies is those places are open

1570
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:53,319
but they're only open at a skeleton

1571
01:13:50,890 --> 01:13:58,060
scale and that's what keeps pace I'm

1572
01:13:53,319 --> 01:14:00,789
great yeah I work with them and please

1573
01:13:58,060 --> 01:14:01,750
bear orders and started keeping

1574
01:14:00,789 --> 01:14:06,789
ingredients you

1575
01:14:01,750 --> 01:14:10,180
we work with oh just just my ingredient

1576
01:14:06,789 --> 01:14:12,399
suppliers okay you know well and what

1577
01:14:10,180 --> 01:14:15,340
Wendy's saying is really important for

1578
01:14:12,399 --> 01:14:18,129
people to understand is cannabis

1579
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:23,170
products are tested at a standard that

1580
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:25,150
organic food products cannot pass as an

1581
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:28,359
edible maker the fact that you can see

1582
01:14:25,149 --> 01:14:30,579
completely organic product and it's fine

1583
01:14:28,359 --> 01:14:32,559
and she adds cannabis to it and the

1584
01:14:30,579 --> 01:14:36,609
cannabis is clean but the sugar causes

1585
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:38,350
her to fail like that is absurd so these

1586
01:14:36,609 --> 01:14:40,719
are things we need to be fighting right

1587
01:14:38,350 --> 01:14:42,789
now while we've got people's attention

1588
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:45,310
and they're calling us essential and

1589
01:14:42,789 --> 01:14:47,260
trying to get some of these laws and

1590
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:50,070
regulations change so that they're not

1591
01:14:47,260 --> 01:14:50,070
so ridiculous

1592
01:14:50,189 --> 01:14:58,869
yeah okay yeah I have to say I got the

1593
01:14:56,529 --> 01:15:02,979
lab called this morning about the sugar

1594
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:06,819
about yeah the sugar is not good on an

1595
01:15:02,979 --> 01:15:08,649
RD that is not good because the sugar I

1596
01:15:06,819 --> 01:15:10,750
would usually get would be from Costco

1597
01:15:08,649 --> 01:15:14,439
I'm gonna say that I don't mind saying

1598
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:17,470
that organic sugar from Costco and you

1599
01:15:14,439 --> 01:15:23,739
know you could only buy one bag and they

1600
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:25,750
will not let me buy anymore I send my

1601
01:15:23,739 --> 01:15:29,529
whole team in just to get so we just can

1602
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:31,510
keep moving yeah good these are the

1603
01:15:29,529 --> 01:15:33,550
weird things going on right now we're

1604
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:35,980
not a full ounce and we went to like

1605
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:37,930
five shops trying to get paper towels we

1606
01:15:35,979 --> 01:15:40,119
tried to order paper towels from Uline

1607
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:42,010
but because we had never ordered paper

1608
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:44,979
towels from Uline they wouldn't send

1609
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:49,119
them to us these are the weird things

1610
01:15:44,979 --> 01:15:52,089
that are gonna break us right now yep

1611
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:54,599
totally gloves too well is this a big

1612
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:58,900
thing too it's really hard to find cause

1613
01:15:54,600 --> 01:16:01,110
mm-hmm look at Frank showing off like

1614
01:15:58,899 --> 01:16:05,219
Saul

1615
01:16:01,109 --> 01:16:08,979
don't Lysol disinfectant hand sanitizer

1616
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:13,090
yeah we're making our own but yep gotta

1617
01:16:08,979 --> 01:16:15,579
keep it yeah and then I also like to say

1618
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:17,199
I like a whole staff member washing her

1619
01:16:15,579 --> 01:16:18,670
doors and making sure we're doing all

1620
01:16:17,199 --> 01:16:21,220
these protocols of washing all the

1621
01:16:18,670 --> 01:16:23,649
tables and washing the door handles and

1622
01:16:21,220 --> 01:16:28,380
you know making sure everyone's wearing

1623
01:16:23,649 --> 01:16:32,109
a mask and no yeah a whole Kovac person

1624
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:37,960
non-stop just to make sure for six feet

1625
01:16:32,109 --> 01:16:40,299
away yeah everyone's safety right so I

1626
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:42,609
think cannabis has a long history of

1627
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:45,010
meeting these challenges especially

1628
01:16:42,609 --> 01:16:54,609
coming you know people who come out of

1629
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:57,159
the traditional industry this

1630
01:16:54,609 --> 01:17:00,309
conversation has been really valuable

1631
01:16:57,159 --> 01:17:03,489
for me one of the things I'm thinking is

1632
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:05,500
that I think that the activists in the

1633
01:17:03,489 --> 01:17:07,960
industry and lobbyists are gonna come

1634
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:10,659
out of this feeling their oats because

1635
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:14,890
if anything the cannabis industry has

1636
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:18,849
proven itself during this time and its

1637
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:22,750
value and its responsibility and so

1638
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:27,730
there's there's many strong arguments to

1639
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:32,409
be made for moving forward taking the

1640
01:17:27,729 --> 01:17:36,929
foot off its neck and I'm hopeful that

1641
01:17:32,409 --> 01:17:36,930
legislators may start to hear that

1642
01:17:37,109 --> 01:17:43,869
because of this event not in spite of it

1643
01:17:40,949 --> 01:17:45,970
well yeah I think over the last two

1644
01:17:43,869 --> 01:17:50,170
years we've proven we're really good at

1645
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:52,480
jumping through hoops and so it's one

1646
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:55,659
more thing like it's not something

1647
01:17:52,479 --> 01:17:58,569
that's devastating to us it's just one

1648
01:17:55,659 --> 01:18:01,269
more hoop we're jumping through yeah I

1649
01:17:58,569 --> 01:18:05,289
agree it's it's you know we've we've

1650
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:08,440
survived federal prohibition wildfires

1651
01:18:05,289 --> 01:18:13,000
earthquakes you know this is just a

1652
01:18:08,439 --> 01:18:17,039
pandemic but I'm saying it's a you know

1653
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:21,130
like 28 the transition and 2018 was like

1654
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:23,140
so extreme and and just really this

1655
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:25,949
reminds me so much of that just in terms

1656
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:29,710
of like overnight protocol changes and

1657
01:18:25,949 --> 01:18:33,670
and and so many so

1658
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:37,569
I'd spread protocol changes that yeah I

1659
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:39,579
think of any industry it's going to come

1660
01:18:37,569 --> 01:18:42,519
out okay and is resilient and adaptable

1661
01:18:39,579 --> 01:18:45,939
enough to to survive this it's going to

1662
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:47,800
be the cannabis industry just given

1663
01:18:45,939 --> 01:18:50,559
everything we've been through I would

1664
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:52,810
agree with dust I'm even hoping more

1665
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:56,830
that the that the craft side of the

1666
01:18:52,810 --> 01:19:01,300
industry also sees a resurgence you know

1667
01:18:56,829 --> 01:19:04,960
as a consumer who walks into retail

1668
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:07,690
shops and has forever the move towards

1669
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:10,689
you know just the CPG and everything

1670
01:19:07,689 --> 01:19:14,379
package it's been a little depressing

1671
01:19:10,689 --> 01:19:17,169
for me I think real cannabis people want

1672
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:19,210
a live through their noses they like

1673
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:22,329
that the types of illness is really

1674
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:26,109
important I'm hoping as a people as a

1675
01:19:22,329 --> 01:19:28,390
nation you know as a world that we out

1676
01:19:26,109 --> 01:19:30,250
of this that we you know we realize that

1677
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:33,730
we've been fucking things up we move

1678
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:36,760
more towards more sustainable practices

1679
01:19:33,729 --> 01:19:39,879
that's the rational reaction to what has

1680
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:42,909
just happened and you know cannabis just

1681
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:46,239
works right into that especially the the

1682
01:19:42,909 --> 01:19:49,059
crap side of the industry and so many

1683
01:19:46,238 --> 01:19:50,889
people that we know and their voices can

1684
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:54,039
continue to be heard I think it's going

1685
01:19:50,890 --> 01:19:56,700
to be a challenge but I what we want to

1686
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:59,710
do that's whom we love talking to and

1687
01:19:56,699 --> 01:20:02,139
getting those practices we're seeing

1688
01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:04,359
some of that already I think we've seen

1689
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:06,369
two or three of the multi state

1690
01:20:04,359 --> 01:20:08,439
operators announced that they're pulling

1691
01:20:06,369 --> 01:20:09,969
out of California in the last couple of

1692
01:20:08,439 --> 01:20:12,579
weeks you know we're seeing the

1693
01:20:09,969 --> 01:20:16,270
struggles that med men are going through

1694
01:20:12,579 --> 01:20:18,760
and what I'm hoping is that the small

1695
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:20,830
operators on this call and you know the

1696
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:23,320
small operators we work with that have

1697
01:20:20,829 --> 01:20:26,199
been staying lean focused on trying to

1698
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:27,189
get profitable we step in and we fill

1699
01:20:26,199 --> 01:20:29,590
that gap

1700
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:33,609
this was our industry this wasn't that

1701
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:35,529
their industry those are the ones that

1702
01:20:33,609 --> 01:20:38,409
can adapt yeah yeah

1703
01:20:35,529 --> 01:20:42,179
they they tried to change our industry

1704
01:20:38,409 --> 01:20:43,510
to fit their idea of it and yeah where

1705
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:45,489
were you

1706
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:52,210
to this environment or more eager than

1707
01:20:45,488 --> 01:20:57,939
bad maybe 30 years of experience yeah

1708
01:20:52,210 --> 01:21:00,399
that place you know you just want to say

1709
01:20:57,939 --> 01:21:03,159
that I'm here with a buyer at Satori and

1710
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:05,439
you know he's mentioning about how he's

1711
01:21:03,159 --> 01:21:08,439
wiping down all the boxes and then

1712
01:21:05,439 --> 01:21:11,259
letting them sit for 24 hours before he

1713
01:21:08,439 --> 01:21:13,059
puts them into the system feel like I

1714
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:16,800
have to say that because we wonder about

1715
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:18,810
that too as a consumer and stuff so yeah

1716
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:21,820
yeah I mean that's kind of like my

1717
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:24,340
protocol where packages land on the

1718
01:21:21,819 --> 01:21:27,849
front step I leave them there for like

1719
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:29,560
12 hours then I put them in the yard and

1720
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:32,289
let them sit for you know it's like

1721
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:34,840
groceries come in they go in one place

1722
01:21:32,289 --> 01:21:41,920
for like nothing gets nothing good

1723
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:57,670
nothing gets it for like 24 hours the

1724
01:21:41,920 --> 01:22:00,819
violet light yeah let's let's wrap on

1725
01:21:57,670 --> 01:22:03,760
that but I appreciated everyone this is

1726
01:22:00,819 --> 01:22:06,189

1727
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:10,270
serie and my whole thing I mean my whole

1728
01:22:06,189 --> 01:22:13,569
thing you're all small that was wouldn't

1729
01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:17,080
like I don't want to mess it on here or

1730

Mednick on here kress go to tell us how

1731

1736
01:22:33,340 --> 01:22:38,190

1737
01:22:36,010 --> 01:22:44,050
want to check out those space gem

01:22:38,189 --> 01:22:49,139
candies with all due respect Berkley

1739
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:49,140
patients group is not small in my mind I

1740
01:22:49,470 --> 01:22:56,640
guess it's relative to I mean we're

1741
01:22:52,750 --> 01:22:56,640
certainly not Cresco or

1742
01:22:56,649 --> 01:23:03,219
madmen I guess in terms of a violin here

1743
01:23:00,430 --> 01:23:06,010
though we have a good yeah we we have a

1744
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:12,789
good solid following that we we spent

1745
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:14,350
decades building up yeah I didn't mean I

1746
01:23:12,789 --> 01:23:17,769
didn't mean in terms of square footage

1747
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:19,690
but in terms of its purpose its meaning

1748
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:49,090
and the value its brought to this

1749
01:23:19,689 --> 01:23:53,039
industry to people all right thank you

1750
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:53,039
everyone thank you
