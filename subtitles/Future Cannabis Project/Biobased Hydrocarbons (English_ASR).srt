1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,919
our industrial life has led us to the

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:09,209
worlds and industry has led us to this

3
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:12,089
place where we take fossil fuels we take

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,480
fossil you know oil and natural gas coal

5
00:00:12,089 --> 00:00:17,850
oil and natural gas and we we do things

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,670
with them for industry and it's a sink

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,550
it's a linear conversation we extract

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,949
400 million year old hydrocarbons out of

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,830
the earth and we burn them turn them

10
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:31,019
into plastic any number of things we

11
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:33,359
destroy them and then we're destroying

12
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:35,219
mother nature and in the extraction part

13
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,590
but then in the use part we're putting

14
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,140
that carbon in the atmosphere so what

15
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,370
doesn't end up in the ocean as plastic

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,070
ends up in the atmosphere as carbon

17
00:00:41,369 --> 00:00:45,899
dioxide and that's what's choking us

18
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,570
right now so we can do the hydrocarbon

19
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,640
management without extracting it from

20
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:54,409
that we can do four month old or four

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,840
year old hydrocarbons from bio-based

22
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:59,939
biomethane but we can we don't have to

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,579
extract from 400 million years ago we

24
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:06,118
can produce the bio carbons that we need

25
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,489
for our life here for billions of people

26
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,618
living on this earth and we can do that

27
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:12,810
in a way that's sustainable more

28
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:15,000
sustainable so let's move in that

29
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,090
direction yeah and the conversations of

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,840
recycling and the conversations of hemp

31
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:25,500
as an important biological source for

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,299
these hydrocarbons that's the these are

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,040
the answers that are that get you there

34
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,890
can you explain that a little bit more

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,259
how do you extract four year old

36
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,790
hydrocarbons through anaerobic digestion

37
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,099
okay you can also do it through

38
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:42,170
gasification if you wanted to but

39
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:45,419
essentially you you make a soup you hire

40
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:48,680
you put biologicals in there from human

41
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,000
waste to any kinds of organic food

42
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,399
trimmings if you if you have a pure

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,569
source of organics then you're going to

44
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,189
get three things out of that you're

45
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:58,228
going to get gases you're gonna get

46
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:01,319
liquids and you're gonna get solids the

47
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:02,759
gases are hydrocarbon gases and the

48
00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:04,199
trick is the hydrogen we all love

49
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,599
hydrogen right it's number one it's the

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,539
first element right so we love hydrogen

51
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:11,810
we're here we go the hydrogen so the

52
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:14,179
hydrogen you're getting the hydrogen

53
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:17,370
from the wall

54
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,560
the the bugs the little microbes are

55
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:22,379
consuming the organics in the water and

56
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,769
they're giving you ch4 you know four H's

57
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:27,870
in 1c one carbon four hydrogen's that is

58
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:30,509
we're lucky that we can do that that

59
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:33,000
that's an important element that we need

60
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:35,128
access to and it's in it we're getting

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,289
it almost for free from these microbes

62
00:02:35,128 --> 00:02:38,429
well we have a waste product the quote

63
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:40,408
unquote that we use things we used to

64
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,360
throw away now or things that we can

65
00:02:40,408 --> 00:02:44,578
grow and the byproducts of some of these

66
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,040
we can channel into the bio energy

67
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:48,750
conversation and this gets us out of the

68
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,179
fossil fuel conversation so it's a

69
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,068
one-for-one exchange for natural gas for

70
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,140
fracking for natural gas you can get

71
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:59,128
that not renewable natural gas or

72
00:02:55,139 --> 00:03:01,408
biomethane from today so that's the four

73
00:02:59,128 --> 00:03:03,568
hundred million years ago four-year-old

74
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:06,358
40-year old tree whatever it's gonna be

75
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:08,759
you can get bio gases from that and with

76
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:11,099
the same hydrocarbon gases you can make

77
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:12,449
plastics you can we can make the things

78
00:03:11,098 --> 00:03:15,539
that we use today that we find

79
00:03:12,449 --> 00:03:18,479
convenient or helpful you know a heart

80
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:21,870
valve or something or you know there are

81
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,399
some you know good things for if you you

82
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,659
know if you need to use plastics there

83
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,510
are reasons to use it but it could be

84
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:30,439
bioplastic bio-based it doesn't have to

85
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:30,439
be from the fossil fuels
