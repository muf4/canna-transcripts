1
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:23,920
yeah please it is absolutely absolutely

2
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:26,349
so anyone who brings so we have we have

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,720
our nursery which is a commercial

4
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:30,039
nursery we sell plants mostly b2b

5
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:32,049
licensed the license to licensed

6
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,729
cultivators we occasionally do like

7
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:37,169
clone drops at festivals and at

8
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:39,879
dispensaries as well but we also have

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,859
services that we offer to other private

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,600
individuals and that's all done through

11
00:00:41,859 --> 00:00:45,369
what we call our non propagation

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,140
agreement and that's ultimately spelled

13
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:50,619
out by the client if they can spell

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,420
exactly who they want to have access to

15
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:54,429
the genetic materials and most of the

16
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,439
time we propagate stuff for people we

17
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:58,659
can't even grow it ourselves you know

18
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:04,349
it's all contract based absolutely

19
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:06,250
absolutely so yeah I mean the only buddy

20
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:08,530
and they kind of screwed them over they

21
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,390
were totally dying they were mutating

22
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:12,640
they were covered in past and he brought

23
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:15,609
us like the saddest-looking slips like I

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,590
had never seen and he was desperate and

25
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:19,030
we did we on a handshake deal it was

26
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:21,280
like look we'll take an animal take care

27
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,390
of you you mean we took in his pink

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,218
panties as acai

29
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:27,099
his original sunset sherbert all of this

30
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:28,809
parent material to you know love the

31
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:30,519
pipe shit that people are talking about

32
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,909
right now again sorry pardon my language

33
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:35,349
but the so yeah that was the first time

34
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:36,939
and luckily it worked out well we did

35
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:38,739
eventually put a contract in place over

36
00:01:36,938 --> 00:01:41,559
time but it was a handshake deal that we

37
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:43,419
did with him and now we're providing for

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,888
a lot of his farms that are contracted

39
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:49,170
grow his products were providing all the

40
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:49,170
clones to those so

41
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:57,658
[Music]

42
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:14,860
so is it that depends it ultimately

43
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,210
depends on how much so it depends on how

44
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:20,770
many plants you have that you want a

45
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:22,480
bank it depends on what your so I'm

46
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,830
sorry let me back up to clarify your

47
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,829
question are you saying is it economical

48
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,660
to use us as a germ plasm is a genetic

49
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,490
banking of material or is it economical

50
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:34,509
for us to be a propagator for you

51
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:38,560
[Music]

52
00:02:34,509 --> 00:02:41,109
I'd say the the latter must much more

53
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,199
likely the germ plasm process again the

54
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:48,730
initiation like what we because it takes

55
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:50,409
a it takes a lot of time to when a plant

56
00:02:48,729 --> 00:02:53,079
comes into culture to our India to

57
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:56,259
figure out what media grows healthily on

58
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,450
there's a big rnd expense that we incur

59
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:02,229
bringing in new varieties in the culture

60
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:03,909
we're trying to shorten that process up

61
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:06,369
and streamline that process by starting

62
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:08,739
to do genetic screening and being able

63
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,000
to look and see hey this new variety

64
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:12,909
that we're bringing in how does it look

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,590
genetically similar to other varieties

66
00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:16,150
that we have does it have some of the

67
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:19,420
same genetic markers that this other

68
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,099
cultivar has so if it does let's try it

69
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:23,439
on this media first and save ourselves

70
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:26,349
three months of having plants not grow

71
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,250
and die on the wrong media to back up

72
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:28,629
for a second that was one of the things

73
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:34,949
that we were really really surprised

74
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:37,329
about is there was a huge variance in

75
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:39,939
cultivar to cultivar to how they

76
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,790
performed and grew on media much more so

77
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:44,919
than other agricultural crops like

78
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:46,810
there's a there's a great media and

79
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,030
there's a banana media and there's an

80
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,340
orchid media and you can grow cymbidiums

81
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:53,860
and Phalaenopsis and lady slippers all

82
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,420
in the same orchid media we didn't find

83
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,330
that with cannabis which was pretty

84
00:03:55,419 --> 00:04:00,988
interesting each cultivar really seemed

85
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:06,420
to want a specific media

86
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:08,158
to grow on so the the initiation process

87
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:09,899
is expensive I'm not gonna sugarcoat it

88
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,639
for you it's expensive you know I mean

89
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,549
it's thousands of dollars to take one of

90
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:19,319
your varieties and come in you know so

91
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:21,780
banking that material yeah absolutely

92
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:24,569
yeah and we have insurance as well so

93
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,799
this is the and backup facilities all of

94
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:27,360
that you know I mean we keep multiple

95
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,970
copies not all on the same site you know

96
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,860
I mean but um yeah I mean it is it is

97
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,479
certainly what we've found at least for

98
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,160
economical even for smaller people

99
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:40,019
within the ten thousand square foot

100
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,310
range who either don't want to don't

101
00:04:40,019 --> 00:04:43,049
want to mess around with propagation

102
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,240
anymore it's like dude you can devote

103
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:46,860
all your square footage to all the other

104
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,269
production you don't need a team to do

105
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,669
propagation you don't need to keep moms

106
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:52,560
that are out anymore either use choose

107
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:56,939
from our genetic library which is over

108
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,620
120 cultivars or we'll take your your

109
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:00,629
genetics in and we'll propagate them

110
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,280
from you in next season we'll give you

111
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:06,300
all the plants you need you know I mean

112
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:12,989
exactly exactly

113
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:15,030
absolutely yeah yeah yeah exactly I mean

114
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:16,530
and you it's volume it's obviously a

115
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:18,269
sliding scale volume independent you

116
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:22,259
know I mean but yes no we should we sell

117
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:24,598
the clones back so I just got the word

118
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,009
that we've got five minutes left I'm

119
00:05:24,598 --> 00:05:30,000
just gonna look real quick to see if

120
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:33,300
there's anything that I didn't hit and

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,829
if I mean yeah the one thing that I did

122
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,900
want to say like being back up in here I

123
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:40,050
think it's just a really it's a really

124
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:43,158
good time for the kind of communities to

125
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,810
come together I really really hope that

126
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:47,009
through my work with finance and my work

127
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,470
in the industry that I can try to be a

128
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:50,970
bridge between the scientific community

129
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,400
and the grassroots cannabis community

130
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,720
because that's where I came from and I

131
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,399
think it's really important that these

132
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,889
two communities work together to

133
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,329
preserve this industry and put it on the

134
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:02,879
right track the track that we all want

135
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:04,709
to see it on and with that said I'll

136
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,899
I'll open it up if there is any more

137
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:10,069
questions that people have that we can

138
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,069
hopefully be able to answer

139
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:17,459
no good awesome

140
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:17,459
ball thank you all guys

141
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:30,569
you
