80
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,169
that's no test for that for sheer cost I

81
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:23,120
mean that terpenes off the nodes match

82
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:25,100
the terpenes and your mouth is amazing

83
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,420
how it's all best of the best ready to

84
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,100
talk about Turkey and speaking of

85
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:30,830
terpenes actually over here we have the

86
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:34,160
true terpenes these are some of their

87
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:36,229
most expensive terpene combinations that

88
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,030
they have available this one on the end

89
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,430
is one of my favorites balancing its

90
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:42,889
found in Valencia oranges mainly you get

91
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,420
your nose on that man that for that

92
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:46,759
ounce right there is four hundred and

93
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,280
thirteen dollars in that little vial Wow

94
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,709
one of the more rare and what do you do

95
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,379
with this so you would I'm just using

96
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:55,430
this tonight as a nose exercise so we're

97
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:57,399
kind of pairing this with some of the

98
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,180
concentrates so you get a nice sensory

99
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:01,489
experience you smell some of the

100
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,810
terpenes go to along side with it can

101
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,220
really affect what you taste after you

102
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,449
smell like that once you trigger that in

103
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,690
your brain for sampling but all wine

104
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:10,639
guys yeah or we could take a little dip

105
00:05:08,689 --> 00:05:11,959
of the Terps and mix it into your

106
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,459
concentrate to give you a little bit of

107
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:15,739
it I am you'll hold out I'll be this

108
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:17,599
first round those works saving the big

109
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,960
stuff for later my friend for a big

110
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,430
diamond yeah example thanks Ange I

111
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,169
appreciate that no problem I can't wait

112
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,189
to go back

113
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,259
typically this is gonna be the workhorse

114
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:28,819
right so this is gonna be banging out

115
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:31,149
the dabs super quick in and out

116
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:34,459
depending on how long the line is

117
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:36,529
but as far as taste goes I don't really

118
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,819
have one that's better than another it's

119
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:39,589
gonna be depending on the experience

120
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:43,370
that you want right so if you want more

121
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:44,750
of a traditional nail and rig experience

122
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,750
come to this guy if you want something

123
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:50,810
brand new try the vape exhale I would go

124
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,870
this route this one does deliver a much

125
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,470
bigger hit with a

126
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:57,600
our amount of concentrate so this one is

127
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,310
also good for beginners too so you can

128
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,680
just take a tiny tiny little hit off of

129
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:04,290
it and walk away and be okay with that

130
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,850
so you don't have to finish all of your

131
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:08,640
your dab out of something like this over

132
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:11,430
here and then this guy we have a nail

133
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,659
with a torch so depending on if we are

134
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:14,310
allowed to have open flame in here or

135
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,439
not we'll figure that out and that will

136
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,740
dictate how this one runs tonight so

137
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:21,990
kind of giving a hodgepodge of different

138
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:29,910
devices and experiences for people in

139
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:32,150
the night at the Groff I can't believe

140
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,150
this
