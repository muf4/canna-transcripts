[Music]

2
00:00:15,108 --> 00:00:20,759
essentially the question is problems in

3
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:23,518
the regulated era that farmers are

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,750
facing as far as rigorous testing

5
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:31,500
procedures failing for contaminants that

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,179
we didn't even know existed and maybe

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,219
some possible ways that we can mitigate

8
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:40,500
those difficulties so a little

9
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,200
background about myself I guess

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:47,009
I use a microscope to analyze soil

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,039
biology I've been working with Elena him

12
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:52,229
for the past three years very closely

13
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,480
she offers some classes online I took

14
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:57,448
those early on and then continued with

15
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,878
everything she put out there I took the

16
00:00:57,448 --> 00:01:02,460
online classes that dr. Laningham

17
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:03,599
offered and at a certain point if you

18
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,609
finished all the classes you have the

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,390
opportunity to work on a one-year

20
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:11,129
mentorship where you become certified

21
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,750
when I started that it was in the

22
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:16,829
infancy of the program so I got to work

23
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:18,989
directly with her on that and she

24
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:21,030
literally walked me through a lot of the

25
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:23,548
procedures of helping some of these

26
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,040
larger scale farmers make it at this new

27
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,590
scale so that was a very valuable

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,570
experience to have her interpret what I

29
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,670
was seeing in the field so I think

30
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:35,609
there's a really unique opportunity for

31
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:39,030
me that was extremely valuable and it's

32
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:41,310
turned into some really fantastic

33
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,649
insights as to where the problems are

34
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,920
starting and what are some rational

35
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,049
cost-effective solutions to get through

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,540
that process and actually produce

37
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:55,190
material that can be tested afterward

38
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:58,740
and make it through the process

39
00:01:55,189 --> 00:02:01,379
so how we use the microscope in that

40
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:03,359
situation is we can count the organisms

41
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:06,030
in the soil and based on different

42
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:09,118
populations or different ratios of

43
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,610
organisms to different organisms it can

44
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:15,530
speak to the volatility or the stability

45
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:17,880
of the system which can also tell us

46
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,610
where past their disease pressure is

47
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,319
likely to come from and so when we move

48
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,030
to this larger scale we can look really

49
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,329
tightly and specifically with this

50
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:30,120
microscope and say we actually have a

51
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,950
problem in group 2 in Bay 3 we don't

52
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,870
need to send employees in to spray

53
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:35,280
everything every Monday we need to

54
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,780
address the underlying issue at the

55
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,340
environment in the corner of the

56
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,629
greenhouse and being able to

57
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,209
mathematically quantify what's happening

58
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:47,039
in the soil it's led to an intense

59
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,019
understanding of how the environment was

60
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,939
negatively affecting the soil that is

61
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,200
negatively affecting plant health which

62
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:56,699
is leading us to use really toxic

63
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:59,669
chemicals by looking very precisely the

64
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:02,369
groups of plants across the facility we

65
00:02:59,669 --> 00:03:07,018
can then zoom way out of that and look

66
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:09,810
at it on a macro scale as like a an F

67
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,030
grade a C grade in an A grade and F

68
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:16,920
grades become red boxes on the thing and

69
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:19,590
we can we can zoom out and an example

70
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:22,949
that I just saw is is five long beds in

71
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,900
a greenhouse and the water comes in at

72
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:28,109
the center between bed 2 and 3 and the

73
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,789
pressure is highest there and so beds 2

74
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,579
&amp; 3 get over watered and slightly

75
00:03:29,789 --> 00:03:35,489
saturated and so they spend more time of

76
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:37,069
the day not producing nutrients because

77
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,200
the organism is a really specific

78
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:42,359
specialist and they operate during very

79
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:43,828
tight tolerances of moisture and so

80
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,170
those two beds are creating an

81
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:48,840
oversaturated event that shuts down

82
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:51,539
nutrient cycling and negatively impacts

83
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,979
soil stability and so we can see that

84
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:54,719
mathematically with the different

85
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:57,419
organisms that are there or are not

86
00:03:54,719 --> 00:04:00,449
there and percentages of disease-causing

87
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,979
fungi to beneficial fungi so we've been

88
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:04,619
able to use the microscope to

89
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:06,329
mathematically quantify the organisms in

90
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,599
the soil which can give us an indication

91
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,280
as to where

92
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:10,718
the problem is coming from whether it's

93
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,688
a hostile environment that's negatively

94
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:15,699
impacting the soil environment or an

95
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:17,788
over watering event which is suffocating

96
00:04:15,699 --> 00:04:20,949
the aerobic oxygen living organisms

97
00:04:17,788 --> 00:04:23,079
creating a mold pressure or from over

98
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:25,360
feeding constantly over stimulating the

99
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:28,120
system which is 99% of living soil

100
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,189
farmers they are way over doing it yeah

101
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,168
because there's not enough to process

102
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:34,079
this massive amount of nutrients we're

103
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:36,819
trying to cram into the top of the pot

104
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,228
right so so we have this really

105
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:39,848
beautiful shift that's happening from

106
00:04:38,228 --> 00:04:42,430
people going from these really toxic

107
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:44,800
really harsh growing styles to more

108
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,439
sustainable respectable farming styles

109
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,210
and literally genuinely the biggest

110
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,038
obstacle to doing that is changing your

111
00:04:49,209 --> 00:04:53,319
mindset and we're coming from a nutrient

112
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:55,810
quantity style farming where we need to

113
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,399
put this many PPM's into a reservoir to

114
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:59,769
get a certain plant growth response and

115
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:02,379
yield and turn that into a harvest and

116
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:04,120
if we take that mentality into the

117
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:06,699
living soils we're constantly throwing

118
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,769
way too many nutrients on top to cram

119
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:11,740
them into the system and if we have a

120
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:13,329
deprived biological system meaning we

121
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,009
only have bacteria because that's all

122
00:05:13,329 --> 00:05:17,288
that's available in over the table

123
00:05:15,009 --> 00:05:19,538
products and most compost lacks an

124
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:22,000
actual soul food web so most people are

125
00:05:19,538 --> 00:05:24,759
growing with just bacteria in the soil

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,839
bacteria mineralized nutrients and store

127
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:28,479
them in their body so they're the

128
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,189
fertilizer bags of the soil and so for

129
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:32,319
those to become plant available and do

130
00:05:30,189 --> 00:05:35,199
something beneficial for our plant we

131
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,819
need a predator to eat it and rip the

132
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,408
top off of that bag and make it plant

133
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:39,550
available for our plant and that's

134
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:41,469
literally what's happening it's a bunch

135
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,500
of things eating other things creating

136
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:48,630
nutrients and almost everything that

137
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:53,439
we're doing is hindering that thing and

138
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:56,829
also this thing that is not there and so

139
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,569
we can zoom in really closely count the

140
00:05:56,829 --> 00:06:00,519
organisms and zoom out and go what is

141
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:02,978
about the layout of this facility that's

142
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:05,649
causing this situation what is about our

143
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:08,620
process that is creating a disturbance

144
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:10,198
event in group two that is leading to

145
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:14,408
pest pressure and disease susceptibility

146
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:17,139
an example of this would be standard 30

147
00:06:14,408 --> 00:06:18,259
by 96 greenhouse with five long beds in

148
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:21,449
it

149
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:23,339
water comes into the center between bed

150
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:25,379
2 and 3 and that's where the water

151
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:26,969
pressure is highest so out of the drip

152
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:28,889
tape those beds get slightly

153
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:32,220
oversaturated compared to the other five

154
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:33,990
beds this effect in its own can lead to

155
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,870
pests and disease pressure later on in

156
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,500
the life cycle of the plant for two

157
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,750
reasons

158
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:44,339
organisms are really specific when they

159
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:47,040
operate with moisture percentages being

160
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:48,479
a big important factor so as moisture

161
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,400
gets to high these organisms that are

162
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,140
producing nutrients go to sleep and they

163
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:56,250
go dormant and they wait till conditions

164
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:58,050
become ideal for them to execute and so

165
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,670
when we overwater those beds it puts

166
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,410
everything to sleep and they're slower

167
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:05,490
to wake up so those plants have nutrient

168
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:08,400
cycling issues and if the water amount

169
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:10,949
is too much after a certain threshold

170
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,870
you actually start to deprive oxygen so

171
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:15,329
much that the dormancy becomes death and

172
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,819
the fungi and these other organisms that

173
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:20,990
create soil structure naturally to allow

174
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,990
the natural storage of the water

175
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:26,159
die soil structure collapses and now it

176
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:29,580
is the same effect to your root system

177
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,130
as if a hydroponic reservoir took the

178
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:33,329
aeration out it's the same effect so the

179
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:34,920
same problems we see over here in

180
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:36,599
hydroponics and we don't have enough

181
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,189
aeration to the root zone that same

182
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,530
thing is happening in our living soil

183
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:41,910
bed but we can't pick that plant up and

184
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:44,609
look at the roots and see that they're

185
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,020
brown and look like dready ropes because

186
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:52,620
that's under the soil and we don't look

187
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:54,629
at it that way and so so in that

188
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,579
situation with the five beds we just

189
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:58,860
adjust the water and then we can count

190
00:07:56,579 --> 00:08:00,539
the organisms again and see that the

191
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:04,319
tides have changed or if they haven't

192
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:06,689
changed typically we can see if in

193
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,939
effect or if a change was effective

194
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:12,800
within seven to ten days and you can

195
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:12,800
take a soil that is please

196
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:25,079
straight up most problems are from

197
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:27,449
excess saturation right now I'll answer

198
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:30,000
this more thoroughly but an actual

199
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:33,240
usable answer is we have an intense

200
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,639
pressure on farmers from the investors

201
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,680
to produce widgets and so people are

202
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,879
feeding twice a day people are feeding

203
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,870
multiple times a day they're upping

204
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:41,129
they're upping they're pushing the

205
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:44,339
pushing and pushing they're pushing and

206
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:46,200
from a biological standpoint the floor

207
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,180
of that abandoned Rose grower house is

208
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,370
loaded with disease-causing fungi and

209
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:53,789
spores and we can count those and see

210
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:55,919
that and we just pour water all over

211
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:59,399
this facility that the soil is loaded

212
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:01,559
with water molds and those things pour

213
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:04,620
and germinate and attack your plant and

214
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:06,629
literally it's because their water molds

215
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,850
and they can only transfer on a film of

216
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:11,220
water so the more times we leave a film

217
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:12,450
of water everywhere that's the more

218
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:15,899
we're spreading proliferating and

219
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:20,640
creating disease to fight so that's a

220
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:22,339
specific answer but mathematically

221
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,958
[Music]

222
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:26,220
depending on depending on the

223
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,088
populations of the disease-causing

224
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,589
organisms we've just seen enough now

225
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:33,779
that most people are following the same

226
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:38,100
four trends most people are following

227
00:09:33,778 --> 00:09:39,750
the same four recommendations that have

228
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,509
worked you know they have merit I'm not

229
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,039
discounting things we do because we're

230
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:51,299
able to do the more than once so there's

231
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:54,269
a component of effectiveness that allows

232
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:56,639
the technique to keep going but as we

233
00:09:54,269 --> 00:09:57,929
move into the regulated era the material

234
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,199
we're producing is being more tightly

235
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:03,870
analyzed and a proactive approach can

236
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,910
avoid costly errors in the end and and

237
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,769
that's essentially when we've really

238
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:10,980
done the most work is after somebody

239
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:12,480
just had a confiscation really and so we

240
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,730
talked about the confiscation try to

241
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,589
identify where the problem came from try

242
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:19,170
to change the soil environment so it's

243
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:21,529
more conducive to thriving and not

244
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:21,528
disease

245
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:38,769
