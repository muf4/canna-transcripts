1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,990
um also in you know dealing with

2
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:10,230
solutions in cannabis the the two bigs

3
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:13,138
are in front of us the big the big AG

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,109
and Big Pharma you know that's something

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:20,368
as small farmers as small produce

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:21,810
production people as educators about

7
00:00:20,368 --> 00:00:24,868
regenerative farming we're really

8
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:27,899
looking at and Dale we wanted you to

9
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:32,780
talk a little bit about standing up to

10
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:39,149
counterbalance big AG and just you know

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:41,399
how can how can we help this okay well

12
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,770
one thing we have to realize is we can't

13
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,590
make big AG go away it's there it's

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,590
gonna get bigger and it'll enter into

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,129
this industry even more and if you look

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,899
at what big AG the threats it poses

17
00:00:52,128 --> 00:00:57,210
first of all it's it's always going to

18
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:02,070
have superior efficiencies in terms of

19
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,750
commodity production so if you're in

20
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,569
something that looks like it's evolving

21
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,118
toward a commodity market you got to

22
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:11,250
emphasize ways of of differentiating

23
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,069
yourself from the typical commodities

24
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,228
because it's very unlikely that you

25
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:20,069
could ever have the economies of scale

26
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:21,989
that big AG can have and so either stay

27
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:26,359
out of commodity markets if you can and

28
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:28,969
if you can't then focus on

29
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:31,170
differentiators so that you're not stuck

30
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:34,200
selling the very same thing that big AG

31
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,810
is selling that's not very satisfying to

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,299
hear but it's reality the other thing

33
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,719
that big AG has is just massive money

34
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,670
and firepower and that results in two

35
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:46,828
kinds of things that they they will

36
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:50,879
accumulate a lot of patents in this

37
00:01:46,828 --> 00:01:52,828
space and I'm a patent attorney so I can

38
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,989
talk about that a little bit and I have

39
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:57,269
some ideas for that and then the other

40
00:01:54,989 --> 00:02:00,000
thing is they will have a lot of

41
00:01:57,269 --> 00:02:01,530
research firepower and their research is

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,228
likely to be in things like

43
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,228
marker-assisted breeding to identify

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:13,889
genotypes that are going to be resistant

45
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:16,979
to pests or diseases and so

46
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:19,199
we have to be prepared for a day that

47
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:21,840
will come that that big AG has some

48
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,829
patent rights in something like that and

49
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:29,039
we also have to be aware that big AG is

50
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:30,060
accumulating patents and that in the in

51
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,560
the industry right now there's a

52
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,310
fundamental problem with patents and

53
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,259
that is that when you apply for a patent

54
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,539
it's a patent examiner's job to do a

55
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:40,649
search look for the closest thing they

56
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:43,229
can find that's out there in the

57
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,510
literature and use that to reject your

58
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,340
application it'll tell you it's either

59
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:49,409
new or it's not obvious or it's either

60
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,090
new or it's not new or it's obvious and

61
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:53,189
so I'm gonna reject the application

62
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,870
that's just the beginning of a process

63
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:56,099
and this this is the same thing that

64
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,080
happens with big AG when they apply for

65
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:00,090
a patent that's the beginning though of

66
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,660
a process of arguing that the Patent

67
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:05,219
Office about whether it really is what

68
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:06,870
they see in the literature the big

69
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:10,169
problem though in the cannabis industry

70
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:12,209
is there's almost no literature so when

71
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:14,369
a patent examiner is looking to the

72
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:16,020
literature either prior commercial

73
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,789
activity that's been published and this

74
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,950
you know we know that our commercial

75
00:03:17,789 --> 00:03:23,729
activity has been emphatic ly not

76
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:25,649
published or prior academic papers and

77
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:27,419
there's not very many of those the

78
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,890
problem that that has turned into and

79
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:31,919
we've seen some really egregious

80
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:33,479
examples of that is that patent

81
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,000
examiner's are flying blind they're not

82
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:38,189
bad people they're not even necessarily

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,389
favoring a particular applicant but if

84
00:03:38,189 --> 00:03:44,939
they don't know that that a certain

85
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:49,018
chemo type has been around for a long

86
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:50,579
time in the unregulated market and that

87
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,959
it has this particular profile they

88
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,910
can't find that in literature they'll

89
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,800
grant a patent on and they have they've

90
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:58,139
granted some chemo type patents that put

91
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,769
a lot of existing cultivars at risk of

92
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:04,229
at least technical patent infringement

93
00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:05,870
and so as the patenting activity ramps

94
00:04:04,229 --> 00:04:09,149
up we're going to see more and more

95
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,739
really invalid patents but it costs a

96
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,409
lot of money to prove that a patent is

97
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:15,420
invalid and unless you're getting

98
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:18,418
involved during the process of either

99
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:22,319
pre grant or post grant some of some

100
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:25,019
things that you can do proactively use

101
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,610
have to wait to be sued and then when

102
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:27,659
you're sued you get a chance to prove in

103
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,670
court that the patent is in

104
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,740
Aled never should have been granted so

105
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:36,540
okay those are the problems there are

106
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:38,400
some solutions though an example that I

107
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:40,530
draw from is the the electronics

108
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,810
industry there are some huge players in

109
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:45,479
the electronics industry massive numbers

110
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,680
of patents but there aren't and we hear

111
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,360
about the ones that do happen but there

112
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,800
aren't that many lawsuits for patent

113
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,199
infringement because what these players

114
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,060
do is they cross licensed each other

115
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,759
they know that they have equal firepower

116
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,079
it will be mutually assured destruction

117
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,730
so instead of suing each other they give

118
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,029
each other licenses to their essential

119
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:07,680
technologies so ok now how do we apply

120
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:10,169
that to this for for any individual farm

121
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,340
any individual small company to stand up

122
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:17,189
to big AG is an impossibility but we can

123
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:19,500
form a coalition that will have enough

124
00:05:17,189 --> 00:05:22,079
aggregate effect to have a chance at

125
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,319
least of counterbalancing big eggs

126
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:27,990
patent portfolios or at least having a

127
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,269
defense pool so that when somebody does

128
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,970
get sued for infringing a big AG patent

129
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:35,099
we have the firepower to go to court

130
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,240
with them and say alright here's why

131
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,020
this patent never should have been

132
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,389
granted prove it aggregate evidence from

133
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:44,370
the community and win in court and and

134
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:46,050
make see what's really important is when

135
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,329
a patent is invalidated in court it

136
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,370
can't be used to to assert against

137
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:52,139
anyone else that's a little bit of

138
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,939
shorthand because it's really claim by

139
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,949
claim but once a patent claim is

140
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:58,620
invalidated that claim is gone forever

141
00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:02,370
it can't be asserted against anyone else

142
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:05,129
so if one defendant wins in an in a

143
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,290
patent validity contest everyone wins

144
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:12,180
because no one's at risk of that anymore

145
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:15,120
so what I'm trying to organize is a

146
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,910
couple of things one is well I want to

147
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:22,139
have a pool of ethical cannabis

148
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:25,800
companies that promise to cooperate with

149
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:27,509
each other in litigation defense that if

150
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,470
they have patents they put them into

151
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:34,259
that pool so that if let's say someone

152
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,940
Sue's a member of that coalition for

153
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,409
patent infringement we look to the

154
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:39,959
entire patent pool to see if there's

155
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,460
anything owned in the pool that that

156
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,138
plaintiff is in

157
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:44,969
fringing sometimes you can make a

158
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,650
lawsuit go away by by filing a

159
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:48,150
counterclaim for infringement of your

160
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:52,888
patent is like oh we didn't think

161
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:54,478
about that you you want to you you want

162
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:55,800
a lot you want to sue us for infringing

163
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,300
your patent maybe we'll just make this

164
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,919
whole thing go away it's not as simple

165
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,228
as it sounds but it's it's the best

166
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:03,000
chance I think that a lot of small

167
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:06,120
businesses have to stand up to big AG

168
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,110
the other thing that I'm working on to

169
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:12,209
the point of actually pricing this is a

170
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:15,660
group insurance policy that would

171
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:20,129
provide a certain significant warchest

172
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:23,370
to to spend on litigation defense if a

173
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:25,379
member of the coalition got sued it's

174
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,449
not it's definitely not free it's pretty

175
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:29,668
pricey but if it's spread across enough

176
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:31,319
companies it wouldn't have to it

177
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:35,689
wouldn't be it would be a relatively

178
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:37,649
cheap insurance for each company I

179
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:40,500
hesitate to say the numbers because

180
00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:42,120
nothing's final but it looks like and

181
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,800
this could be completely wrong I've just

182
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,680
talked with one insurance company so far

183
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,090
but it looks like we could have several

184
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,550
million dollars worth of litigation

185
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:53,668
insurance for any member of the

186
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,348
coalition for probably maybe two hundred

187
00:07:53,668 --> 00:07:56,668
thousand dollars which would mean okay

188
00:07:55,348 --> 00:07:59,098
if we have two hundred members it's

189
00:07:56,668 --> 00:08:02,399
$1,000 a member if we have five hundred

190
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:03,839
members it's even less it can be

191
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,769
prohibitively expensive if we only have

192
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:10,198
ten members but I think if we can find a

193
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:13,168
way and those prices could be completely

194
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,908
wrong I'm hoping they'll come lower and

195
00:08:13,168 --> 00:08:17,158
then we have to find a way for for

196
00:08:14,908 --> 00:08:19,079
members to enough members to join that

197
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:22,468
it makes sense and of course this has to

198
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,709
be run as a non-profit nobody can be no

199
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:26,639
give me nobody can use this as a way to

200
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:29,549
build their own business I guess

201
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,579
somebody could but that won't be me but

202
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,320
if we if we find a way to to actually

203
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:35,519
make that work it would be nice that

204
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,528
people could sleep at night and know

205
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,449
that among all the other problems are

206
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:44,549
gonna face they're not going to get sued

207
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:46,470
to death by big AG now one other thing

208
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:51,719
to say about that is if that Coalition

209
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:53,009
has all of this power as a group they

210
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,410
could also have some collective

211
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:57,059
bargaining power let's to pay that

212
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:58,379
suppose a big AG with its research

213
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:00,419
funding really does come up with

214
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:03,060
something that everybody needs in order

215
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:06,179
to stay viable in the industry then we

216
00:09:03,059 --> 00:09:11,128
have the power to negotiate with them

217
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:14,250
for a group license and to assert all

218
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:18,089
kinds of pressure on them if they don't

219
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:21,208
grant the license public pressure public

220
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:23,189
perception pressure PR pressure so none

221
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:25,109
of these solutions is easy none of them

222
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:27,419
but I think there are some viable

223
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,039
solutions and that's something that I'm

224
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:30,628
really committed to and working on and

225
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,188
and not just by myself there are some

226
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:34,620
really good people involved in this but

227
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:37,559
that's just maybe a statement of the

228
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:42,060
problems in a ray of hope that we can

229
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:44,388
this won't be a an obstacle we can

230
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:44,388
sermon
