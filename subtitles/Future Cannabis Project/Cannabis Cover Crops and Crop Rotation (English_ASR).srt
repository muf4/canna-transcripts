1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:08,669
so topic I'm speaking on is cover crop

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:11,699
rotations I believe yeah so initially I

3
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:12,960
thought I was speaking out cover and but

4
00:00:11,699 --> 00:00:15,268
it's kind of good cuz they they really

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,560
are intertwine in our system so

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:21,269
basically we do cover cropping I'm sure

7
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:22,799
most of the one I say here is already

8
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:31,198
second nature to a lot of people here so

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:33,510
so bear with me if I sell elementary we

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:42,750
we do cover cropping for a number of

11
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:46,320
reasons one of them is just you know it

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,179
really helps with erosion and preventing

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,509
erosion and a lot of our ground is in

14
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:56,369
the floodplain so it kind of keeps the

15
00:00:51,509 --> 00:01:00,929
soil more intact and secure also another

16
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:03,899
reason is the blooms in particular are

17
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:05,579
really they fix nitrogen from the air so

18
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,340
we really boost our fertility levels

19
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:12,000
with good cover cropping and we usually

20
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:15,030
mix grasses in with the legumes because

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,549
the grass is kind of create a cover

22
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,129
immediately choke out existing weeds and

23
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:25,229
allow the legumes to come to later over

24
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:27,179
the winter and then finally probably one

25
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:30,679
of our main focuses with with cover

26
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:34,829
cropping is for our weed control so

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:39,240
that's generally how it the cover

28
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:41,849
cropping and in crop rotations really

29
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:44,399
work hand in hand because for example

30
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:47,669
the first season on new ground we're

31
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,500
going to we're going to get into crops

32
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,390
that are a lot more labor-intensive when

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,659
it comes to weeds like longer-lasting

34
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,950
crops like carrots onions things like

35
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,350
that that are in the ground for a really

36
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,000
long time we find that it's almost

37
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:02,399
pointless to try to grow them in a first

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,200
year area that was fallow with nice

39
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,599
cover crops for a few seasons before we

40
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,750
get into that ground so crops that are

41
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:12,180
more have a big canopy and a quicker

42
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,889
like corn for example brassed a lot of

43
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,069
brassicas

44
00:02:12,889 --> 00:02:17,750
please let us head lettuce that's a

45
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:21,530
really good first-year crop because we

46
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:24,590
can get in plant our plants then do a

47
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:27,860
combination of mechanical cultivation

48
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,629
followed by in row hand weeding and put

49
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,630
depending on the crop one the two times

50
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:36,979
doing that then the plant can take off

51
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:40,310
and then the native weeds and brought in

52
00:02:36,979 --> 00:02:43,519
weeds they'll start popping but they'll

53
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,860
be one step behind the crop so generally

54
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,739
the first few seasons doing crops like

55
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,290
that then you're our weed popular seed

56
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:53,959
populations will will reduce drastically

57
00:02:51,289 --> 00:02:56,269
then we can get into the more the labor

58
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:59,689
intensive crops like carrots and beets

59
00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:04,370
and onions and things like that another

60
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:06,889
so in it in conjunction with that when

61
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,620
our style of crop rotating we find that

62
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:12,169
not doing the same family of crops in

63
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,360
the same area in less than ideally a

64
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:16,458
four year period and some crops even

65
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,180
longer so four to five is generally our

66
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:21,500
sweet spot where you know when I say

67
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,299
families the crops we don't break it

68
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,219
down by each vegetable but we'll do like

69
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:28,250
root crops you break that into carrots

70
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:31,219
and beets will do brassicas and we'll do

71
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:33,680
leafy greens and salad and corn like

72
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:38,120
those are the kind of our main break

73
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,579
down some crops and what we find is that

74
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,879
any time in any crop once I push that

75
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:46,370
threshold of an acre or more we

76
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:48,259
generally have problems where you have

77
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,180
to but I'm we're certified organic but

78
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:52,459
what I still consider being the heavy

79
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,019
artillery is cops in a more disease

80
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,120
prone or a lot harder to pull off

81
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:58,670
without having to go under the war chest

82
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,519
or having really time the applications

83
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:03,169
once we push that acre boundary so if we

84
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,620
can keep everything smaller than that

85
00:04:03,169 --> 00:04:09,500
with good rotation I see a lot of

86
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,909
examples you know an Instagram opossum

87
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,709
of you guys were a lot of people doing

88
00:04:10,909 --> 00:04:13,639
more like a poly culture type of thing

89
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,519
like where everything is kind of

90
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:19,009
intermingle which is awesome on ours

91
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,329
kind of you know we still consider so

92
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,490
small-scale but we definitely like a

93
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:25,800
production farm in the vegetable side

94
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:27,978
supports a lot of fat for families

95
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,918
and we crank out a bunch of produce

96
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:33,839
being like sorta focusing on our

97
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:37,258
regional food security within 100 miles

98
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:39,119
of where we are that being said the

99
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:40,610
margins are really slim when you're

100
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,908
trying to make a living growing produce

101
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:47,430
so we and we pressure will make or break

102
00:04:44,908 --> 00:04:49,250
us so like how we deal with our weeds so

103
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:57,509
that that's kind of how we overall

104
00:04:49,250 --> 00:05:02,370
attack attack weeds and so when in

105
00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:03,870
relating to to so basically after that

106
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,418
we get our crop out in the fall

107
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,780
generally or late summer or whenever it

108
00:05:06,418 --> 00:05:11,459
is we get our ground prepared for

109
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:16,348
whatever cover crop you do usually I

110
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:20,310
like to do a rye grass or oats and mix

111
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:22,379
with a few other legumes and generally I

112
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:25,500
like to let that ground that cover crop

113
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:27,810
go as late as it possibly can before the

114
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:32,370
crop goes to seed late spring early

115
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:34,680
summer and deciding when I whack the

116
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,360
crop in or you know incorporated in has

117
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,810
everything to do with the crop that I'm

118
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:43,020
going to plant their next leg round we

119
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:45,629
might not get much you know much time to

120
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:47,728
get really good like 3 4 feet tall the

121
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:49,978
later ground I like I like to

122
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:52,110
incorporate it a solid month before

123
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:53,339
we're gonna be wanting to plan that

124
00:05:52,110 --> 00:06:01,710
ground they get plenty of time to break

125
00:05:53,339 --> 00:06:03,718
down I want to see one more thing in

126
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:05,939
relation to ganja is that we have been

127
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:10,019
having really good success both in our

128
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:13,800
cannabis and are handled with under

129
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:15,538
sowing clovers so we we once our plants

130
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,408
be established and we kind of scrog out

131
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:22,079
the area give enough airflow we we're

132
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:24,418
I'm a really big fan of New Zealand

133
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,658
clover and Dutch white clover New

134
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:28,948
Zealand clover work I'm leaning more

135
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:31,500
towards because it's a little bit more

136
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:33,509
drought tolerant so both of them they'll

137
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,759
tell you they they go about this big in

138
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:36,830
ganja we say they've got more about this

139
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,090
big we have

140
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:44,120
little beds and then that that creates a

141
00:06:41,089 --> 00:06:46,219
great habitat for all beneficials chokes

142
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,949
out other weeds and then if we can get

143
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,710
to over winter and not incorporate it

144
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:56,360
till it flowers it like it pops off the

145
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:59,500
continent and when it comes to pet it's

146
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,500
a really great alternative
