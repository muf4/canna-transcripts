[Music]

3
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:27,778
and she's a policy and advocacy director

4
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:30,570
for the multidisciplinary Association

5
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:32,159
for psychedelic studies maps and that

6
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,738
she's psyched passionate about

7
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:37,019
psychedelic therapy because it works by

8
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:38,250
addressing the root causes you know

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,520
something that really interests me about

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,920
her work is her focus on

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,450
intergenerational trauma as well as

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,160
using psychedelics for something I never

13
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,039
thought possible community conflict

14
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:51,328
resolution and restorative justice

15
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:57,179
something that we had started to kind of

16
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:59,120
discuss a bit earlier is when kind of

17
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:01,229
the progression of cannabis to

18
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:02,820
psychedelics and and that is something

19
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:06,179
that comes you know we're already seeing

20
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:10,978
state-level initiatives right now coming

21
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:13,890
around psilocybin but kind of wondering

22
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:16,469
where that conversation sits among the

23
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,379
broader conversation for drug

24
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:20,879
decriminalization for all substances and

25
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:24,149
and what it looks like when we're

26
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,789
picking out individual substances versus

27
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,070
holding it kind of in this broader

28
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:31,829
broader context this is something I'm

29
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:34,949
really thinking a lot about because we

30
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:37,078
actually saw some polling that there's

31
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,880
much more support for full drug

32
00:01:37,078 --> 00:01:41,908
decriminalization than taking out

33
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:44,599
individual substances and though

34
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,549
cannabis has played such an amazing

35
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:50,069
groundwork and created a pathway for

36
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,570
other things to move forward some people

37
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:53,250
fear that we are you know picking out

38
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:55,618
that this is a good drug and that there

39
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,290
are bad drugs and what that really means

40
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:00,180
and so that's something I think it's

41
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,159
really important for us to hold when of

42
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,350
course psychedelics have so much promise

43
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,280
and I guess we can speak a bit more

44
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:10,649
about that as well but yeah I guess so

45
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,560
I'm curious with how you think that kind

46
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,500
of fits in

47
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,420
to this broader space well I've

48
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,550
experienced exactly what you're talking

49
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:22,419
about like doing criminal defense which

50
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:25,780
I did for I now you know turn 20 years

51
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:28,119
as a lawyer and I remember like

52
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:30,729
prosecutors just like demonizing math

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,640
you know and like math users are evil

54
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:35,848
meth as evil we're okay with some

55
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:38,559
substances but meth absolutely not and

56
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:40,329
when I saw that demonization I thought

57
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,060
like you know we don't want to be like

58
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:45,239
taking sides and saying like some trucks

59
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,250
are the soft trucks and they're okay and

60
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:51,189
meth and cocaine and whatever other

61
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,769
substances LSD are bad and they're hard

62
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:56,379
drugs and it's not a nuanced approach

63
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:59,259
you know Toni Sarah my mentor says there

64
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:01,780
are no bad drugs you know that there's

65
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:05,289
sometimes bad times to use certain drugs

66
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:09,340
but yes every drug can help you explore

67
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:11,109
your own human potential and something

68
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,900
that I kind of forgot to mention is that

69
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,760
in fact the more dangerous that a drug

70
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,379
has the potential to be I believe the

71
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,539
more important it is that that drug is

72
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:21,039
legal and we people have access to

73
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:22,689
information that they can make sure

74
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,569
they're using it in the most safe way

75
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:27,250
possible so it might seem like kind of

76
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:28,930
counterintuitive at first that's

77
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:31,509
something more dangerous we'd actually

78
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:32,709
need to be regulated more but that's

79
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:35,649
something that I hold and that's

80
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:37,629
something I think sometimes we can lose

81
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,239
track of because as you so beautifully

82
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:42,759
laid out our whole system of scheduling

83
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,769
is just complete bullshit excuse my

84
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:46,659
French you know not based on any kind of

85
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:50,530
research not based on anything that

86
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:52,449
makes sense so I think yeah it's we we

87
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,900
got caught up in that and something like

88
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:57,729
cannabis that is so incredibly unsafe in

89
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,000
so many ways and you know it's non fatal

90
00:03:57,729 --> 00:04:02,048
of course seems like extra ridiculous to

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,030
be in that space

92
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:06,280
I guess they refuse to bring up around

93
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,560
cognitive liberty I find really

94
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,379
interesting and also is something that

95
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,599
comes up a lot and so I guess you know

96
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:18,310
to back up on the director of policy at

97
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,139
maps so I'm lucky to travel the world to

98
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,089
go to different conferences be meeting

99
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:25,329
with people that work on drug policy and

100
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:26,918
and psychedelic policy reform

101
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:29,918
and kind of thinking about it from all

102
00:04:26,918 --> 00:04:32,649
different angles so cognitive liberty is

103
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:35,529
definitely a strain that is very present

104
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:39,279
and makes a lot of sense in the context

105
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:41,168
of of psychedelic advocacy but I guess

106
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,089
kind of centering that in and what we

107
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:44,709
are just speaking about it's also

108
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:47,829
interesting to think that some people

109
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:50,370
you know who are as you also went out or

110
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:54,598
currently you know in prison and cages

111
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:57,069
around and around their substance use

112
00:04:54,598 --> 00:04:58,360
feel you know that also cognitive

113
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:00,400
Liberty though it's something they a

114
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,629
hundred percent you know believed so

115
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:06,189
deeply and it's kind of like beyond they

116
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:07,990
you know someone sitting in a cage is

117
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:10,300
like sure of cognitive liberties great

118
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,490
but you know my physical Liberty like

119
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,319
getting in this in this space and when

120
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:15,970
there's so many fewer people arrested

121
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,550
for psychedelics than for other

122
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:22,150
substances like how that kind of comes

123
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:24,310
into play yeah although I don't we'll

124
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:25,810
share one there's kind of a tangent that

125
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,889
is really exciting I just learned

126
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:33,550
recently that apparently LSD is finding

127
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:36,788
some more ground and use in the prison

128
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:38,590
system because it's I guess easier to to

129
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:41,228
access and it's really providing a lot

130
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:43,119
of people it's a lot of healing which I

131
00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:44,829
thought was just really interesting oh

132
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,228
it's easier to introduce into the

133
00:05:44,829 --> 00:05:50,740
prisons because how compounds not in a

134
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:53,800
legal right now there is no you know

135
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:57,490
legal use of LSD that I'm aware of

136
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:00,360
that's in the research setting yeah and

137
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:05,199
can you tell us about LSD research like

138
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:08,080
sure yeah so right now there's actually

139
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,330
not a ton of LSD research going on

140
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:13,089
there's a ton of psilocybin research and

141
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:15,508
MDMA research going on but there has

142
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:19,359
been LSD research in the past maps

143
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:20,788
conducted a study using LSD therapy to

144
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,169
work with people who have anxiety

145
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:25,360
associated with the end of like a

146
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:28,299
terminal illness I mean you saw really

147
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,569
great results with that there are also

148
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:35,069
some kind of companies starting to

149
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:38,160
develop LSD for creativity right now

150
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:41,790
kind of not really a super public about

151
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,880
it and I'm trying to think but I guess

152
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:49,050
the majority of OSD itself for LSD

153
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:51,180
analogs I think I've heard of both

154
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,520
actually and just like with psilocybin

155
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,410
where it is suicide in itself and not

156
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:58,370
the analog that's being developed both

157
00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:01,500
by a nonprofit called

158
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,079
you sono and also for our company called

159
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:08,100
compass it's also developing psilocybin

160
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:11,509
now to treat depression and then Maps is

161
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:15,270
is is developing mdma-assisted

162
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:18,149
psychotherapy to treat PTSD and all

163
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:21,719
three groups that I just named about FDA

164
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:22,439
approval to continue doing this research

165
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,880
Maps

166
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:29,670
expects by 2021 will have MDMA therapy

167
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:34,949
approved to treat PTSD which is really

168
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:37,140
really exciting and we have some people

169
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:40,529
working on our studies here who can

170
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:42,870
speak of it about that later

171
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:46,769
and P tell us about the FDA approval

172
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:48,360
process you know how onerous is it you

173
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:52,529
know do they make it easy for research

174
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,060
sure so the FDA process there's a

175
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:56,099
process of drug development that you

176
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,610
have to take anything through in order

177
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:03,330
to make a substance into a medicine so

178
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:05,129
it is onerous but it is also quite just

179
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:06,839
like here are the steps and that those

180
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:09,449
were the frameworks that map you know

181
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,939
Maps was founded over 30 years ago when

182
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:14,009
MDMA was first made illegal based on

183
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:17,490
ridiculous research that was actually

184
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:19,500
not MDMA research so we have kind of

185
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:23,160
taken this path and the FDA is actually

186
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,990
quite insulated from politics because

187
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:27,570
they're really protecting this ability

188
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:31,050
to innovate on substance research

189
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:33,059
however it's really expensive to conduct

190
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:36,240
there's a phase 1 phase 2 and phase 3

191
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:39,629
trials and you have to complete phase 3

192
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,610
to have full approval but it costs a lot

193
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:43,289
of money and so our whole system right

194
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,750
now is created so that you know you have

195
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,069
big pharmaceutical companies or the only

196
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,470
ones able to

197
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:52,259
research in order to make something into

198
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,930
a medicine maps is a non-profit and

199
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:57,000
we've started a benefit corporation but

200
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:59,789
when we were a non-profit we were able

201
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,970
to afford to do this MDMA research

202
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:04,679
because we basically there's so much

203
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,170
MDMA research sponsored by the

204
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:09,899
government to try to demonstrate the

205
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:11,729
harms of MDMA but in fact they failed so

206
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,828
that's like the safety and efficacy data

207
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:15,959
we've also used that for our cannabis

208
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:18,838
research so we basically like Aikido

209
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:21,268
that into like saving us millions of

210
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:25,110
dollars worth of research and were able

211
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:27,629
to fundraise to do Phase two and also of

212
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,370
Phase three and in Phase three we have

213
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:33,419
started a benefit corporation because

214
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:35,490
post-approval and MDMA is for sale we

215
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:37,078
can't function as a non-profit but as a

216
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,360
benefit corporation it's really

217
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:43,198
essential to us that you know the social

218
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,899
benefit is our priority and not profit

219
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:48,088
maximization because we've seen how that

220
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:50,578
impacts other pharmaceutical companies

221
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:52,199
and our healthcare industry and that's

222
00:09:50,578 --> 00:09:54,870
something I'm really proud of with maps

223
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:56,549
were one of the very first benefit

224
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,440
corporations that our pharmaceutical

225
00:09:56,549 --> 00:10:00,509
companies which is like mind-boggling

226
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,029
like if anything to me should be a B

227
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:05,100
Corp it would be a pharma company but um

228
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:09,059
so we're right now just working on

229
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:11,670
developing like a standards of ethics to

230
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:14,669
be evaluating a beautful company so if

231
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:17,068
anyone's interested in that I mean can

232
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:19,289
you talk about like the funding for

233
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:22,139
psychedelic research has it shifted now

234
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:26,338
that cannabis legalization has happened

235
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:29,190
in many funders minds do you see people

236
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:32,100
getting more and more open like kind of

237
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:33,779
coming from the cannabis world or you

238
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:37,800
know picking up a Michael Pollan book

239
00:10:33,778 --> 00:10:40,318
and being inspired I would say that also

240
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:42,299
the fact that now the compass for

241
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:45,539
example is one company that is taking

242
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:47,698
investors to developing psilocybin that

243
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:49,370
also pulls away some donors you know

244
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:52,229
we're trying to do it in a different

245
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:54,929
context and some people might rather

246
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:57,879
prefer to invest than donate some people

247
00:10:54,929 --> 00:11:00,039
do both so

248
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,899
I would say if anything were just it's

249
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:04,750
continuing to grow a lot of the

250
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:07,269
cryptocurrency community has been really

251
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:09,519
supportive you had like multiple

252
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:13,840
anonymous million dollar Bitcoin

253
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,519
donations which was really incredible so

254
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,259
yeah I think just the more and more

255
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,689
people are learning about these things

256
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:23,649
the more supporters we are having we are

257
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:27,570
finding are there any legislative

258
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:31,240
efforts you know to start reforming the

259
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:33,220
psychedelic prohibition there are there

260
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,879
are ones that I'm really encouraged by

261
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:38,139
or actually initially I mean I'm all for

262
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:40,299
referendums and state initiatives but

263
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:42,370
actually legislators in a number of

264
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:46,000
states have introduced bills around

265
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:48,580
ibogaine research iboga is a West

266
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,769
African route bark that's used in the

267
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:54,970
blue tea tradition and as a really

268
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:59,559
powerful spiritual guide and medicine

269
00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:03,700
and it the extract ibogaine and iboga

270
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:06,039
are very effective in stopping opiate

271
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:09,490
withdrawals and the psychedelic piece is

272
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:13,990
very healing for people struggling with

273
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:16,210
substance use and the physiological

274
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,399
component of really blocking your opiate

275
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,560
withdrawals makes it like extra and

276
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,720
powerful there's also research being

277
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:25,629
done and then in iboga for parkinson's

278
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,519
it's a really powerful medicine but

279
00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:30,159
because of the opiate crisis right now

280
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,350
there's a lot of interest so there are a

281
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,509
few states where we've had state

282
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:37,300
legislators including Republican state

283
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:39,519
legislators introduced ibogaine research

284
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:41,109
bills we're talking to people in

285
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,949
California who are really interested

286
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:47,680
again I actually have a Republican from

287
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,810
Iowa state legislature like reaching out

288
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:53,469
I have a call tomorrow so it's like

289
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:55,299
there definitely is interest I think

290
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:59,019
right now what's going to be most

291
00:12:55,299 --> 00:13:02,769
feasible around that will be research

292
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:05,049
focused initiatives and I also you know

293
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:08,529
I decided I'm all for those legalization

294
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:10,029
regulation and decriminalization but in

295
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:10,889
terms of psychedelics I think that's

296
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:14,549
going to make most

297
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:17,819
in that broader context and so you think

298
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:19,889
just choosing to repeal psychedelic

299
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:22,800
prohibition foresight psychedelics alone

300
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:25,379
it's not going to be as effective as a

301
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,359
broader strategy yeah I think that both

302
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:29,580
it won't be as effective because there

303
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,180
won't be as much support but also

304
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:35,879
because it won't be targeting the like

305
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:37,889
to me you know the greatest harms of all

306
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:41,370
drug prohibition are you know those

307
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:43,769
being incarcerated those and and I just

308
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,629
think that I mean it's not and I also

309
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:47,159
want to take a step back I am pausing

310
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:48,899
because even when you say psychedelic

311
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,189
prohibition you know as you saw in the

312
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,169
schedules it's not like they're like

313
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,390
here the psychedelics right like which

314
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:56,129
what's the sake of that like even MDMA

315
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:58,019
you know many people around and the

316
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:59,879
secretary conferences will tell me I'll

317
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:02,909
be a is not a psychedelic and you know

318
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,830
to Maps it is it means mind manifesting

319
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:07,049
but the point is that these things are

320
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,610
you know there isn't they're perfectly

321
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:10,409
defined categories they're already

322
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,169
psychedelics like ketamine that are not

323
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:15,689
schedule one right and so this process

324
00:14:13,169 --> 00:14:17,969
is already starting and to happen and I

325
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,350
certainly like support anything moving

326
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,759
through the scheduling system I

327
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:23,670
personally is work getting completely

328
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:25,679
rid of the scheduling system the country

329
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:27,659
I just that doesn't even make sense so

330
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,870
that's another frustrating part to keep

331
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:35,129
working and within this system that's

332
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:38,070
not really serving but yeah I guess to

333
00:14:35,129 --> 00:14:39,689
me when there are you know groups like

334
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,700
psychedelic societies that are really

335
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:45,240
excited around you know psilocybin state

336
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:47,370
initiatives I think that it would be

337
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,190
really awesome to focus on ways to make

338
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:52,679
psychedelic access safer right now like

339
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,840
things like MDMA use for example as much

340
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:57,299
there's the most common psychedelic

341
00:14:54,840 --> 00:15:01,470
besides you know not including cannabis

342
00:14:57,299 --> 00:15:04,199
but MDMA is often adulterated with many

343
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,540
other substances and people don't have

344
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,860
access and outside of US and Europe

345
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:10,289
there are many countries that actually

346
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,360
have drunken government-sponsored drug

347
00:15:10,289 --> 00:15:14,699
checking the u.s. does not quite have

348
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:16,649
that yet but we are working towards that

349
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,180
and actually it says can you tell us

350
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:21,209
more about that government sponsored

351
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:23,129
drug testing drug testing to tell you

352
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:25,410
what's in your powders or

353
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:27,330
in your liquid or whatever it is so like

354
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:29,669
in Barcelona I literally went to a

355
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,560
center that the government sponsors you

356
00:15:29,669 --> 00:15:34,079
can drop off some substances and they'll

357
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,639
they'll give it back they'll send mail

358
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,620
it back to people in the US they were

359
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,389
showing me but then like in other

360
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,580
countries they actually have them set up

361
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:43,799
at festivals so you can go drop off a

362
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,330
pill and then they'll put a report so

363
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:46,919
there'll be all these pills that are at

364
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,750
the festival so you can even go by and

365
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:50,339
check like if you happen to have that

366
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,919
same thing you can check it and it's

367
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:54,629
been really successful and reducing you

368
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:56,279
know people find out there's other stuff

369
00:15:54,629 --> 00:15:58,529
in there substances they're less likely

370
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,209
to use it and that kind of actually

371
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:01,679
helps me to kind of connect to what I

372
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,200
keep saying about psychedelics being

373
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,659
connected to everything in the US now

374
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,330
the for the first time drug checking is

375
00:16:06,659 --> 00:16:12,419
being decriminalized because it's used

376
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:13,950
for in the opiate crisis it's used to

377
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:15,959
check opiates for if they're

378
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:18,870
contaminated with fentanyl which is a

379
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,639
much stronger opiate that's killing with

380
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,590
so many people so there's been this big

381
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,600
move around decriminalizing drug testing

382
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,399
for opiates and because of that then

383
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,290
that makes them decriminalize for MDMA

384
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,059
and for everything right so like that's

385
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:31,860
like a just one example of ways that

386
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:34,739
we're actually much more connected to

387
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:37,320
all of this and then we like to think is

388
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,870
there any a chance of progress on the

389
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:42,480
federal front what does that look like

390
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:44,759
well I mean federally is what we're you

391
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,670
know taking through this medical route

392
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:49,559
so yes you know 2020 one will have MDMA

393
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:52,439
as medicine so to me that's pretty

394
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:54,479
exciting I do think that we can be

395
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,990
pretty optimistic about cannabis on a

396
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,379
federal level too but you know then

397
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:03,299
again that has its own set of

398
00:17:00,379 --> 00:17:05,849
complications but I would say that you

399
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:07,980
know eventually we can have hope in the

400
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:10,859
longer term I wouldn't be expecting like

401
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,930
full although you know as I say that

402
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:15,269
again like I could see a context for

403
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:17,939
maybe for drugs are decriminalized in

404
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:20,879
the not-so-distant future I certainly

405
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:24,000
hope so I so it really does look like

406
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,370
MDMA will will it be rescheduled or D

407
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,519
scheduled what will happen after that so

408
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:31,469
when a substance is as a medical value

409
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,920
then it's moved to the schedule like two

410
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:35,610
or three um but what they've done with

411
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,289
other subs

412
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:39,329
like this is like very well could just

413
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:41,909
say well for this medical use it's

414
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:44,189
scheduled to but MDMA any other context

415
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:46,440
is scheduled one so that's something

416
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:48,660
that's complicated because usually drugs

417
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,580
going through the system are patent new

418
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,798
molecules that a pharmaceutical company

419
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:55,289
can patent and then make a lot you know

420
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:57,960
probably like they have more financial

421
00:17:55,289 --> 00:18:00,029
incentive in that space so that there

422
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,069
are always new substances but with it

423
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:05,700
something like MDMA or cannabis that's

424
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:07,769
this widely used substance it's not

425
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,200
clear like for you know with for the

426
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:11,339
other substances they've actually taken

427
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,900
like they've had their can be to

428
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:14,548
schedule they can be in to schedules

429
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,740
unfortunately so I've got to get rid of

430
00:18:14,548 --> 00:18:17,970
the whole system well and that happens

431
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,710
with cannabis like you know canvas

432
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,200
itself as scheduled want or Navin all

433
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,579
the schedule 3 that other thing I forgot

434
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,590
what it's called the syndrome is

435
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:28,798
scheduled to and so it's all over the

436
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:32,490
place and I guess it remains to be seen

437
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:34,470
now the history of the scheduling of

438
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,480
MDMA I think was the medical community

439
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,980
thought initially that if it was gonna

440
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,839
be scheduled at all it should be

441
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,390
scheduled for you know there was a kind

442
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:45,089
of like a consensus actually that my

443
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:49,080
boss and founder and director of maps

444
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:51,178
Rick Doblin he when MGM a was first made

445
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:53,250
illegal which was actually in the early

446
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:57,630
80s and after some of these other

447
00:18:53,250 --> 00:19:00,690
substances he gathered a group of like

448
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:05,250
faith leaders therapists doctors to kind

449
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:07,110
of protest and and they're DEA like was

450
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,900
moving to schedule it they forced them

451
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:11,639
to have a hearing and so they're DEA

452
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,280
administrative law judge had this

453
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,559
two-year hearing on MDMA and whether it

454
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:18,839
deserved to be in schedule 1 the judge

455
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:21,329
decided did not and a moved to schedule

456
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:23,759
it to another schedule and then the head

457
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:25,109
of the DEA rejected their own judge's

458
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,390
ruling and it was like nope it's

459
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:28,889
Schedule one and this was in the 80s you

460
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:32,160
know and the height of drug war hysteria

461
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:34,230
with Reagan so it was really like I mean

462
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,019
the MDMA especially was just really not

463
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:40,169
based in anything it was it had been

464
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:43,599
used in therapy in the 70s and a lot of

465
00:19:40,169 --> 00:19:46,450
couples therapy and for phobias and then

466
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,949
early 80s a group and it was legal at

467
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,080
this point and it was called Adam and

468
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,929
then a group decided to rename it

469
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:55,509
ecstasy and sell it to a Dallas like

470
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:58,419
nightclub scene and so that quickly

471
00:19:55,509 --> 00:20:00,490
helped it skyrocket and then emits the

472
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:01,840
war on drugs you know what is this new

473
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,750
drug everyone's using and then

474
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:07,000
immediately move to schedule it and the

475
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:09,190
crazy thing is this actions in the u.s.

476
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,869
like for MDMA and all other substances

477
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,220
really reverberate throughout the world

478
00:20:10,869 --> 00:20:15,459
we've exported this war on drugs

479
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,620
everywhere so at the UN the same thing

480
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,419
happened a little year later with MDMA

481
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:22,209
and they moved to schedule it just based

482
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:24,490
on faulty Rhian research with MDA and

483
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:26,919
rats like it literally wasn't even MDMA

484
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:29,640
research they were citing so it's pretty

485
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:29,640
crazy

486
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:41,769
