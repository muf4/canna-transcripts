1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,388
I am actually super carrot here about

2
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:10,529
you guys as thoughts and uncaring

3
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:11,789
because you're a sink you're a single

4
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:14,489
season

5
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:16,108
I guess maybe where I've like talked

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,579
with him about this and I just something

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,320
I talk about a lot of people about it's

8
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,809
like and we're producing the majority of

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,609
our volume you know you know October

10
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:25,618
really for most of us maybe September

11
00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:28,529
November but like in this small window

12
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:30,448
what are different methodologies that

13
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,159
like maybe an indoor even like I'm you

14
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,179
know all your greenhouse car isn't

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,439
really worry about of course they

16
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:37,229
process because they're moving in it

17
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:42,628
before the next one's coming in but for

18
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:44,729
us it's like the levels this leaving

19
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:48,179
herb untrimmed on the stock with all the

20
00:00:44,729 --> 00:00:49,529
leaves is the least invasive and then it

21
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:53,670
gets more and more invasive all the way

22
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:56,070
to pre rolls and how it degrades the

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,780
product faster and faster trimmed units

24
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:02,759
yeah all the way yeah

25
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:07,950
viii jars all right kids

26
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:10,319
take it away well I just I was wondering

27
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,740
what you guys his thoughts were on on

28
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:16,258
this like storage of the product and

29
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:17,699
degradation for us with where the

30
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,829
majority of the flowers were bringing in

31
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,478
our October maybe September November but

32
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,900
it's this small window and we're like

33
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:27,150
working across the whole year and maybe

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,650
a greenhouse or certainly indoor guard

35
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,329
isn't have that and they're working

36
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:34,920
through these batches to get to their

37
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:39,030
next batch but that I see that by by

38
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:42,150
keeping our product on on the stock with

39
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,099
leaves minimal oxygen in a you know a

40
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,079
room that's taking care of humidity and

41
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:48,989
temperature wise it's you the best way

42
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:52,438
to store the flower and then from there

43
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:54,509
as we go to trimmed units or that the

44
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:56,758
least their conquer dated together then

45
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,379
when we move to eighth jars they've got

46
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,700
a lot of airspace in them and they're by

47
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:02,188
themselves and we see the further

48
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,760
oxidation faster oxidation and then

49
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:07,559
pre-rolls got awful

50
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:12,120
so just wondering what you guys thoughts

51
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:15,360
are on on storage and kiri yeah and the

52
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,009
curing and the maybe how terpenes are

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,420
the structure the flower different

54
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:22,829
cultivars factor in to the longevity or

55
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:26,159
when you when you introduce them to the

56
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:31,020
market or in well one thing I think is

57
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:34,500
important about store especially

58
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:38,370
long-term storage we we do one harvest

59
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,050
year so we plan to store it you know for

60
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,409
a whole year it should last that long

61
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:46,530
and a big part of it have to do with it

62
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:49,229
is how how has it been dried and has it

63
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:53,459
been bruised and so whether it's trimmed

64
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:56,399
or not I actually prefer to store it

65
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,800
trimmed because it's smaller and it

66
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,270
takes up less space but it's important

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,750
that if you're gonna store it trimmed it

68
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:07,409
hasn't been it's properly dried and not

69
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:10,409
bruised so like if I don't like to store

70
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:12,539
weed that squishy you know because I

71
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:18,389
feel like a lot of your color

72
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:22,979
degradation happens from from too much

73
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:26,458
moisture in the herb permeating for too

74
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:28,259
long of a time and also that has to do

75
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:31,199
with the bruising too so if it's been

76
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:33,090
bruised you know by a rough trim job

77
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,449
that's been cut into the bud or too

78
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:39,530
close you're not going to be able to

79
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:41,879
keep that fresh look for quite the same

80
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,120
same amount of time or even in the

81
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:48,090
handling during the harvesting process

82
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,370
you can really affect how that flower is

83
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,650
going to dry in the way you handle it

84
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,069
from the minute you cut

85
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:59,610
to the minute it hangs and the sooner

86
00:03:56,068 --> 00:04:01,439
and as smoothly and delicately as

87
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,220
possible as you can get that flower from

88
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,439
cut to hanging the there's a big effect

89
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:09,949
that's going to have on on how it drives

90
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,509
but when you want a cure for long term

91
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:16,469
we have noticed that when we keep things

92
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:19,079
on the stem and and don't trim it all

93
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:22,290
the way it does preserve it really well

94
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,600
in the right environment if you as

95
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:28,080
you're saying and when it's properly

96
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,629
cured out but in that state it's

97
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:33,359
properly dry and it's not bruised you

98
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:36,899
know what I mean so that definitely but

99
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:41,129
I feel like a big part of it is is what

100
00:04:36,899 --> 00:04:43,109
happens after the harvest how is that

101
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:45,418
going to affect the long-term storage

102
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,850
you know so every moment of handling is

103
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:50,639
like has an impact on and how it's

104
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:53,720
handled because we have dry flowers that

105
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:58,470
are covered in little tiny balls of

106
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:02,760
resin on little tiny stalks you know and

107
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:08,820
so too much resin being knocked off too

108
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:11,750
many leaves even like in the trimming I

109
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:15,029
feel like too many leaves being left on

110
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:18,240
with the weed will we you know like if

111
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:22,469
the it's not cleanly trimmed and the

112
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:28,019
leaves will affect them yeah you know

113
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:30,240
and I see I see that too and and that's

114
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:33,418
kind of where I go into structure and

115
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:37,949
maybe even terpenes as well because I

116
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:39,839
noticed that with the certain cultivars

117
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:43,020
certain varieties that I work with that

118
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:46,698
they have an ability to store much

119
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:46,698
better than others and

120
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,280
oh if we're talking about nose I do

121
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:55,529
notice that there's certain varieties

122
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,119
like I see it with a lot of my sours

123
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:59,459
that I don't really want to consume them

124
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,259
right away and I typically don't in that

125
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,489
type of realm and that after a few

126
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:06,269
months they're really primed for me to

127
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:08,189
consume and then other ones that certain

128
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:10,589
I see it a lot with citrus with the

129
00:06:08,189 --> 00:06:12,779
orange where initially I'm like wow

130
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:14,989
that's that's amazing that's great crazy

131
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:19,139
it's really different than than other

132
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:22,829
varieties and that that amazing feature

133
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:24,899
that single very specific nose it kind

134
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:26,939
of flashes off and so those varieties

135
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:29,299
yeah I might like to get to market all

136
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:33,209
different urban snow piles

137
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:36,470
terpenes are molecularly so volatile and

138
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:39,899
so sensitive to the environment and so

139
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:42,630
they do evolve over time and it takes a

140
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:45,899
minute to really see where it's going to

141
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:51,050
settle out what that's part of the art

142
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:54,599
of the Cure is letting it cure into its

143
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:58,770
really optimal proportions of where

144
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:02,640
everything molecularly is is gonna sit

145
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:06,029
but to hold that some-some terpenes are

146
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,529
extremely volatile and others turn into

147
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:10,919
other ones that are also really

148
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:12,269
interesting over time so when you're

149
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,790
talking about how the flavor changes

150
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:17,099
over time we'll go through the whole

151
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:19,830
year and we'll taste our cannabis that

152
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:24,150
we're storing and what to change and

153
00:07:19,829 --> 00:07:26,729
it's really love it different stages and

154
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:29,819
it's it does change a little bit but I

155
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:33,300
love it in all those different forms of

156
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,800
itself so you get like in addition to

157
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,750
the different experiences you're getting

158
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,910
with between your varieties it's like

159
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,250
you're getting even more experiences and

160
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,170
variety yeah absolutely great yeah

161
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,689
that's that's a cool thought I like that

162
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:49,090
and some of them transform very richly

163
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:51,550
some of them at ten months they're just

164
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:53,699
getting to like where I'm like this is

165
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:56,710
getting better and better and better

166
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,909
this is really hitting its peak wow I

167
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:59,560
didn't even know it could be like this

168
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02,350
and of course when you get it again the

169
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,889
next entry comes out and I feel like

170
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,879
it's a year-long thing you know

171
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:10,719
experience that goes the whole year

172
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:14,250
until the new flowers come and then you

173
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,440
get excited about them because they're

174
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:20,079
that doesn't mean that just because

175
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:22,029
depths start coming out now in the early

176
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,159
summer I don't think that means that the

177
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:27,549
outdoor suddenly isn't good at nine or

178
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,920
ten or even a year which it depends on

179
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:34,330
how good of a job you did at your job

180
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:36,250
which used to be which it is part of our

181
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,719
job I think when you're putting out

182
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,059
batches all the time and they're going

183
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:43,270
straight to market it's a totally

184
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:45,039
different scenario as far as it's a cure

185
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:48,340
you don't even have the opportunity to

186
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:51,250
do the kind of cure that you would to

187
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:53,379
make it really amazing all year long but

188
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,720
it's possible and I think it's a myth

189
00:08:53,379 --> 00:08:59,230
and fallacy and it's also like you have

190
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,690
to say I'm planning to try and cure this

191
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:04,889
to store for a whole year you know and I

192
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:08,610
mean we have a small root cellar we

193
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:11,590
restore everything we're not like

194
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:15,850
immediately smoking in you know so it

195
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:22,240
stays out of like a 55 in the dark and

196
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:24,240
it's you know it definitely I feel like

197
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:28,870
if you want to go longer than a year

198
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:32,799
then you need to think about separating

199
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:38,080
the resin and curing just the resin you

200
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:40,719
know what I mean but yeah what one thing

201
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,290
that like just from like my experience

202
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:48,009
in like how we looks and what what I see

203
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:50,099
is like a lot of people trim too close

204
00:09:48,009 --> 00:09:54,120
or too loose

205
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:57,060
and they also don't dry it quite enough

206
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,830
to get past the first few months because

207
00:09:57,059 --> 00:10:03,329
for the first few months it looks really

208
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:06,600
great but then after that you know like

209
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:09,740
maybe it'll get dry but it wasn't dried

210
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:15,330
to preserve the color and the freshness

211
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:17,100
to last you know and so like if it's a

212
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:22,020
little squishy and you leave it like

213
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:28,019
that from drying that I think will

214
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:29,789
degrade quicker shelf shelf life hazard

215
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:32,819
and something that was a little bit more

216
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:35,189
dry at the beginning or it kind of

217
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:39,720
locked in the freshness because I feel

218
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:43,260
like with cannabis you know it's not

219
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,000
tobacco it's not like a leaf you know

220
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:47,669
you're actually what you're hearing is

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,950
the resin up on the plant so and that's

222
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:53,849
what we where all the flavor comes from

223
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:56,370
and all of the cannabinoids and and some

224
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:58,980
of that is intermingled with the with

225
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:04,980
the plant tissue but most of it is just

226
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:08,720
in the resin and so when you are curing

227
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:12,960
you're not necessarily curing the plant

228
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,149
material you're curing the resin and so

229
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,379
for like a long-term storage if you

230
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:24,389
think about resin as your main

231
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:29,610
ingredient then that you want the plant

232
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:31,740
material to be like less emphasized yeah

233
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,570
oh absolutely and I mean I think that

234
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,100
that plays back in the dissipation of

235
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:39,540
the chlorophyll that you're getting with

236
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:41,730
that long-term dry and in tech texture

237
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:43,379
as opposed to structure there like

238
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,550
structure ties into the visuals when

239
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:47,429
you're talking about that a lot but like

240
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:50,429
I I deal with texture a lot and it's

241
00:11:47,429 --> 00:11:53,969
when I start breaking down so it's gonna

242
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:58,078
keep yeah it's kind of clogged up again

243
00:11:53,970 --> 00:12:01,649
a good good sign but like that that when

244
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,508
it's when it's been dried really slowly

245
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:05,519
you get to this point where though the

246
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:07,740
stem snaps and you're like wow it's

247
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,970
incredibly dry yet somehow this kind of

248
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,209
magic trick has happened where it's

249
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:13,730
still gooey on the flower when it first

250
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:16,138
is when it happens the other way and

251
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:18,120
people are like no it's totally dry cuz

252
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:20,610
the flower feels so dry but you know

253
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,500
there's still moisture in that stem that

254
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,970
products degrading in a few months and

255
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,948
they're bagging it like that

256
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:31,230
your stems have to stuff like hard and

257
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:33,269
yet at the same time have that kind of

258
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:36,060
suppleness to the flower itself and I

259
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:37,860
think that translates into some of

260
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:39,899
that's varietal differences but some of

261
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,659
it into how it's gonna break the feeling

262
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:44,399
of how it's gonna break down not

263
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:46,588
necessarily just like whether that

264
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,929
whether it's oily or sticky and the in

265
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:51,569
the resin but the actual plant material

266
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:54,239
that's left I don't know it has this

267
00:12:51,568 --> 00:12:56,399
certain part that it peels apart for me

268
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,778
if it's actually really cured out the

269
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,110
way you guys were talking about versus

270
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:03,808
when they it's dried too fast it like it

271
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:08,430
kind of crumbles in this certain way I

272
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:10,350
noticed and it's in relation to the

273
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:11,789
chlorophyll it's just something that's

274
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,850
where I think what they're talking about

275
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:17,219
about this this phenomenon of the

276
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:20,790
product that's gonna in a three or four

277
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:22,500
months just be totally fine and I'm just

278
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:24,838
seeing one one thing that I correlate

279
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,490
with that is the texture the feeling of

280
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,670
this I know it's the same variety as the

281
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:32,308
one over there but there's it breaks

282
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:34,588
down into more crumbly fashion and I

283
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:37,289
don't know exactly what that is but it's

284
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:40,470
something that I see that that tends to

285
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:43,649
tie with the product browning out faster

286
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:46,019
I think it's the preservation of the

287
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:48,568
integrity of the cellular structure and

288
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:50,919
the handling and the damaging and the

289
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:54,238
bruising are also ways that kind of

290
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:58,798
negatively impact that and so I think

291
00:13:54,239 --> 00:14:02,230
the brittleness could be an impact

292
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:05,289
similar from you know in a lot plays

293
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:13,928
into it and what picking it at the right

294
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:16,028
time definitely plays into it and yeah I

295
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:20,798
think you know when we're thinking about

296
00:14:16,028 --> 00:14:22,869
drying we're thinking about about what

297
00:14:20,798 --> 00:14:26,528
nine days you know and I mean I don't

298
00:14:22,869 --> 00:14:28,119
think I think five days is very fast to

299
00:14:26,528 --> 00:14:32,619
dry them in five days they're never

300
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:34,329
either fully dry or they're too dry and

301
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:38,259
you know like powder

302
00:14:34,328 --> 00:14:40,948
yeah but then fourteen days is too long

303
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:43,418
and too soft you know what I mean

304
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:45,308
doesn't mean you're still not but drying

305
00:14:43,418 --> 00:14:48,068
and curing that after the nine days

306
00:14:45,308 --> 00:14:51,338
because because then at that point

307
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:53,048
you're like putting them in some kind of

308
00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:55,360
getting them ready to trim cream in a

309
00:14:53,048 --> 00:14:57,428
tote or a bag and then and burping them

310
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,909
from there burping a lot you know we're

311
00:14:57,428 --> 00:15:02,198
still releasing constantly they're not

312
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:04,379
you know they're you know finishing

313
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:07,088
process also when you're talking about

314
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:09,899
oxidizing and things like that I'm a

315
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:12,129
strong believer in fresh air flow

316
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:15,578
constantly you know what I mean I don't

317
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:18,579
I always have a window open in my dry

318
00:15:15,578 --> 00:15:20,558
room you know like just cracked like if

319
00:15:18,578 --> 00:15:23,738
there's not fresh air I feel like that's

320
00:15:20,558 --> 00:15:25,319
when you can get stale and kind of wreck

321
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:27,480
your cure

322
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:31,889
but there has to be a good flow to the

323
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:37,379
errors yes I even cracked two windows on

324
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:41,639
both sides of the room and our airflow I

325
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:48,000
think is really important you know

326
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:48,448
keeping your flavors fresh what were you

327
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,129
saying

328
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:52,019
we think we sort of got into a little

329
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:54,000
bit you're talking about texture when

330
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:56,190
you're breaking bud down and what you're

331
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,370
looking for what do you want a roll

332
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:02,819
joints yeah it's yeah I don't know it's

333
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:04,500
it's just this this texture there's so

334
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:06,958
many variables that I'm not gonna speak

335
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,480
to specifically what I see but I just I

336
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:13,638
do like for most tendency somewhat

337
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:18,209
difficult for me to break down by hand

338
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:20,639
that I just usually herb that can

339
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:22,888
crumble out really easily and it could

340
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,209
be just that the structure of that

341
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:27,000
variety so I don't want to make this a

342
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:29,429
universal blanket statement but if I if

343
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,769
I see two varieties and they were both

344
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:34,679
they're both the same variety and they

345
00:16:31,769 --> 00:16:40,409
have that textural difference is really

346
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:41,909
extreme yeah and the other one maybe

347
00:16:40,409 --> 00:16:45,149
it's even still sticky but it just

348
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:46,889
somehow is able to crumble down I like

349
00:16:45,149 --> 00:16:49,679
what they said about the drier this

350
00:16:46,889 --> 00:16:53,698
structural because there's like a point

351
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:56,309
where like it's is it because the the

352
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:59,818
weed should be a little firm or like it

353
00:16:56,309 --> 00:17:01,289
shouldn't be like oh really squishing at

354
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:03,360
least in my opinion you know two people

355
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:06,088
have different opinions of course but

356
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,220
like at least if you're gonna store it

357
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:10,379
all year long and smoke this one

358
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,650
harvests like all year long it should be

359
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:16,370
more dried to be more firm yeah I agree

360
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:18,990
we we started it will crumble a little

361
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:22,859
right before but then the question

362
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:25,318
becomes also like what environment is it

363
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,289
going to be introduced into when it like

364
00:17:25,318 --> 00:17:28,420
when you

365
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:30,369
you bring it out so like I don't know

366
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,920
the specifics and study of high-end palm

367
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:34,509
but like when you guys bring your herb

368
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:37,300
out if it's been stored in a dry whether

369
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:38,710
it's trimmed or untrimmed what is it

370
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:40,180
typically going into a more moist

371
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:43,240
environment in your house or in your

372
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:52,900
bedroom or in your whatever our general

373
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:55,990
climate is more dry when you were

374
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,550
talking about like a nine-day drying can

375
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:00,430
you talk about now the next stage of

376
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:01,839
curing and are you curious of ours for

377
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:05,650
different amounts of time and can you

378
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:09,220
talk about some of that well we're very

379
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:11,470
small so we kind of some are cured

380
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,779
longer just because it takes the next

381
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:23,279
step of processing things gets you know

382
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:23,279
takes tell us its story

383
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:36,449
so what we're smoking is pink cashmere

384
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:36,450
and so we harvested this on October 14th

385
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:42,480
from there we dried it it hung for nine

386
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,480
days

387
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:52,030
at what temperature humidity roughly we

388
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:54,879
usually I go for as cold of temperatures

389
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:58,990
as I can manage we don't use a lot of

390
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:02,890
power to manage the room but it's a

391
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:08,890
darkroom and basically we keep it at 45

392
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:14,140
and 55 temperature are 55 degrees at 45

393
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:23,530
humidity for nine days until the stems

394
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:25,120
snap and then we'll take it down no and

395
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:27,670
then usually what you'll do is you'll

396
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:34,109
take it down and you'll put it in a in a

397
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:36,850
bag or a tote and and close it and

398
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:41,189
usually we'll do that for like three

399
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:45,129
days or so and a lot of the moisture

400
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:46,900
that's still in it will come up come you

401
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:49,300
know like it'll rehumanize

402
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,190
in the container from its own thing so

403
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:53,649
you have to be careful about not making

404
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:56,650
fun of your product mold by just

405
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,790
forgetting about it but in those short

406
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,250
amount of time after that and then

407
00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:01,990
you'll open that up leave it open for a

408
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:03,460
little bit let them dry out and you'll

409
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:06,940
just kind of keep doing that until they

410
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:15,700
reach like an equilibrium that now they

411
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:16,960
are I guess at a stable you know and

412
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,569
work the thing is we're doing it with

413
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:24,660
all of the strains as they come down and

414
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:30,149
so this didn't get trimmed until a

415
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:43,210
couple weeks ago so it's like

416
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:45,640
you know yeah wait no wait that's that's

417
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:53,410
my that's my philosophy on it but like I

418
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:55,480
think close to sale yeah but I think his

419
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:59,110
point I think some of the factors that

420
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,390
he's talking about like at whoever's

421
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:02,500
prop doing the processing being really

422
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,059
careful I like particularly you're

423
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,038
talking about that already good so just

424
00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:07,750
scissors yeah the scissors aren't too

425
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:10,058
close to the flower or too far away from

426
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:13,089
the flower and that they're touching the

427
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:17,230
flower as little as possible the more of

428
00:21:13,089 --> 00:21:19,779
that stuff that happens I think provided

429
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:22,210
that the flower was grown well is that

430
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:24,548
that it allows it to after it to be

431
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:26,470
trimmed just still preserve itself and

432
00:21:24,548 --> 00:21:28,569
not start showing this because I think

433
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,250
some of the oxidation that I see and we

434
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:32,019
talked about is the micro bration from

435
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,450
the scissors and the fingers that time

436
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:36,639
it's a bruising so bruising it yeah it's

437
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,679
like if you if you drop an apple on the

438
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,559
ground it's gonna bruise right like if

439
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:43,509
you do rough it up and it's not gonna

440
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:45,940
keep as long as something that you and

441
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:48,369
you keep well like I guess the

442
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,890
difference between the the wet the wet

443
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:54,009
bruise and the dry bruise so like if

444
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:56,080
we're using totes for harvesting how

445
00:21:54,009 --> 00:21:58,450
much is stacked in how vertically are

446
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,129
they truly is there like the first ones

447
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,590
that are put in it's not that that

448
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:04,270
corner is that a pressure point how long

449
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:06,149
are they left in that bin between when

450
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:08,889
they're harvested and when they're hung

451
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:11,140
like there's ideals that none of that

452
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:13,630
would happen but if it does how can we

453
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,669
at least mitigate it to be as least

454
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:17,409
damaging to the product as possible yeah

455
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:20,980
actually prefer to use flexible

456
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:22,149
containers on shelves but nothing is

457
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:26,618
like stack

458
00:22:22,148 --> 00:22:29,648
too high or heavy lack names well like

459
00:22:26,618 --> 00:22:32,348
there's a series of shelves and all of

460
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:33,338
the usually we put them in like a food

461
00:22:32,348 --> 00:22:37,479
grade bag

462
00:22:33,338 --> 00:22:40,208
that's not translucent you know what I

463
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:43,088
mean and so we can easily open that and

464
00:22:40,209 --> 00:22:45,489
close them this is problem the show

465
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:47,438
everyone is dry yeah once you take it

466
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:50,469
off and it's still on the stem and on

467
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:53,499
the leaf ready to be trimmed like

468
00:22:50,469 --> 00:23:03,609
transferring between your garden and the

469
00:22:53,499 --> 00:23:07,629
dry rooms as quick as possible and we we

470
00:23:03,608 --> 00:23:10,269
just cut and carry the basket it's not

471
00:23:07,628 --> 00:23:12,568
very far just right from the garden for

472
00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:12,568
the dryer

473
00:23:13,239 --> 00:23:17,078
there's no sleds they're the perfect

474
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:23,469
shape and that kids sleds like that

475
00:23:17,078 --> 00:23:26,338
they're like the long that like a

476
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:30,849
toboggan like that but it's just like

477
00:23:26,338 --> 00:23:32,828
that it's like shallow shallow and long

478
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:34,479
so you can put or you would be but you

479
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:37,118
would yeah you would almost picked them

480
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:38,709
down in the future you like that design

481
00:23:37,118 --> 00:23:41,558
it makes me liked it because it was like

482
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:43,479
long and you know you could you could

483
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:45,818
put more and fill the whole thing but

484
00:23:43,479 --> 00:23:47,048
not stack them too high I really like it

485
00:23:45,818 --> 00:23:49,209
it's it's um you know it's something

486
00:23:47,048 --> 00:23:51,398
that I think a lot of her amount is when

487
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:54,339
we're cutting branches how we put them

488
00:23:51,398 --> 00:23:55,928
like if when we use bins like I really

489
00:23:54,338 --> 00:23:57,969
like when guys just start off as

490
00:23:55,929 --> 00:24:02,259
vertical as possible because if they got

491
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:04,509
an angle well we are at same with me I'm

492
00:24:02,259 --> 00:24:07,259
just like I when I get to the end if

493
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:10,538
I've stacked a bin and I don't take any

494
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:12,699
damage just those first flowers

495
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:14,858
that's what you said like shallow and

496
00:24:12,699 --> 00:24:17,769
long so you can put longer you can just

497
00:24:14,858 --> 00:24:20,678
cut your colas you can just cut your

498
00:24:17,769 --> 00:24:24,098
colas and lay them like a like it's like

499
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:26,919
a bouquet of roses but you can just lay

500
00:24:24,098 --> 00:24:29,198
them without having you know you can

501
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:32,829
just make everyone cut their colas down

502
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:34,329
and then you're not there yeah I mean

503
00:24:32,828 --> 00:24:39,038
because it makes a difference and then

504
00:24:34,328 --> 00:24:44,548
we don't we don't cut so much that it's

505
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:44,548
sitting there all in the pile we just

506
00:24:45,028 --> 00:24:50,138
like you know all the colors are however

507
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:53,739
far we're cutting and to the basket and

508
00:24:50,138 --> 00:24:57,698
then that gets hung so we don't pile

509
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:59,318
like Toni some stuff up for hours before

510
00:24:57,699 --> 00:25:02,798
it goes into the dry room it makes a

511
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:08,618
huge difference to us it's like a little

512
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:10,868
bit like roses and wine and tea you know

513
00:25:08,618 --> 00:25:12,548
because like roses are you want to look

514
00:25:10,868 --> 00:25:15,249
at it they're beautiful flowers they're

515
00:25:12,548 --> 00:25:17,288
not just like I mean you can be like oh

516
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:20,019
yeah it's just her but you know we think

517
00:25:17,288 --> 00:25:23,729
of them as beautiful sacred flowers a

518
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:27,249
little bit they're gorgeous so like

519
00:25:23,729 --> 00:25:30,219
they're not for making high tax no and

520
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:32,348
that's just you know but they they're

521
00:25:30,219 --> 00:25:35,619
beautiful and we like to preserve that

522
00:25:32,348 --> 00:25:38,249
beauty you know and that's important to

523
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:41,019
us so we are very gentle with the way we

524
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:42,489
grow like when we try to make sure we

525
00:25:41,019 --> 00:25:44,949
make sure everything that is done in a

526
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:48,459
gentle way it's so that resin isn't

527
00:25:44,949 --> 00:25:51,909
being rubbed off or shaken or anything

528
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:55,500
like that knocked around and dropped too

529
00:25:51,909 --> 00:25:58,470
much on the market you guys

530
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:02,809
- or this flower it's just flour and

531
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:02,809
we're gonna be doing some dry see
