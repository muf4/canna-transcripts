00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,109
[Music]

2
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:11,160
so with that I'm gonna go ahead and

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,320
introduce myself in the panel

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,780
I'm Jen Hensley I work for the Sierra

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,760
Club I worked there for twenty-two years

6
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:20,219
worked for a host worked on a host of

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,060
issues from water pollution to energy

8
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:25,710
use I'm one of our lobbyists so I worked

9
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:27,809
in the Illinois State House for many

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,699
many years and then transitioned to

11
00:00:27,809 --> 00:00:32,159
working with our state lobbyists all

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:33,989
across the country so if you're working

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,750
in a particular state chances are you're

14
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:39,030
working with somebody from my team and

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,950
they're the folks talking about hey what

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,910
about water pollution and hey what about

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:48,200
your energy use so welcome and I'm gonna

18
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:48,199
kick off to Brian here

19
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:58,039
hi good afternoon Brian Anderson I'm an

20
00:00:54,649 --> 00:01:01,340
architect in Massachusetts I think a set

21
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:04,189
me up pretty well I practice in the

22
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:07,390
cannabis space for six years our firm is

23
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:12,170
located in Cambridge and now recently

24
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:14,810
Fullerton California and we focus on

25
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:16,310
energy issues we have worked with state

26
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,469
of Massachusetts in this some of those

27
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:25,909
behind-the-scenes roundtables in giving

28
00:01:18,469 --> 00:01:34,219
feedback to the state yeah that's that's

29
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:35,899
me thank you yeah so Molly Polygram I'm

30
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:38,329
a senior program manager at the Midwest

31
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:40,340
energy efficiency alliance where I focus

32
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:42,319
on commercial building energy efficiency

33
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,049
programs market transformation

34
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:47,839
initiatives and most recently cannabis

35
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:49,250
energy efficiency opportunities I'm a

36
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,859
little bit newer to the cannabis space

37
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:53,599
I've been working on it for maybe about

38
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:55,368
the last two years but have been deeply

39
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:58,038
engrained in energy efficiency for about

40
00:01:55,368 --> 00:02:01,340
the last six Mia is a membership-based

41
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:04,039
organization so my role is really just

42
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:07,340
to bring resources and best practices to

43
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:09,110
our members in the Midwest and so that's

44
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,270
why I attend conferences like these to

45
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,270
learn and and just bring information to

46
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:16,280
the Midwest so people can form utility

47
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:20,890
energy efficiency programs and shape

48
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:22,640
better policies thanks Molly

49
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:25,848
good afternoon my name is Michael

50
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:28,399
wheeler and previously I was a energy

51
00:02:25,848 --> 00:02:32,568
policy professional I spent the majority

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,459
of my career working partly in the

53
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:37,039
private sector for a large solar

54
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:39,800
developer and partly in the start in the

55
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,439
in the public sector also probably

56
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,569
private anyways also working for

57
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:46,340
California State Public Utilities

58
00:02:44,568 --> 00:02:50,479
Commission designing energy efficiency

59
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:53,150
programs for utility for utilities here

60
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,878
in the state the last three years I've

61
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,260
been a cannabis policy professional and

62
00:02:55,878 --> 00:02:59,239
so this is actually my first energy

63
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:00,620
conference in three years I'm excited to

64
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,780
be here and excited to see these two

65
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:07,050
issues come together finally look

66
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,699
for to the conversation today everybody

67
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,439
Derek Smeath resource innovation

68
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:12,689
Institute you know a little bit about us

69
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:15,359
so I'll just keep it focused on the

70
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:18,318
policy dimension of what we do our role

71
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,770
is really to make sure that as policy

72
00:03:18,318 --> 00:03:24,389
comes too controlled environment AG that

73
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,890
the right people are around the table to

74
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:28,109
make sure that we have an inclusive

75
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:30,229
dialogue that is capturing all the

76
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,430
interests and really thinking

77
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:35,879
comprehensively about how we establish

78
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:39,300
good policy that will actually make sure

79
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,979
that it has industry input and a

80
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,050
well-rounded approach so that all the

81
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:47,009
market actors are considered in the

82
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,959
outcome and you know obviously that data

83
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:51,750
can help inform the right decisions and

84
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,689
we have flexibility and and innovation

85
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:58,590
and just again as I said this morning

86
00:03:54,689 --> 00:04:00,599
like we want to make sure that if the

87
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,099
focus is on carbon as an example then

88
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:04,919
let's let's really make sure we talk

89
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:06,568
about carbon focuses on energy great

90
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,030
let's let's be clear about that let's

91
00:04:06,568 --> 00:04:10,649
let's focus on energy but just make sure

92
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,269
we're having the right dialogue we're

93
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,439
setting up the right metrics cuz this

94
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:18,870
industry this whole new thing has the

95
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:21,930
opportunity to leapfrog if we get it

96
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:24,149
right at the from the very start of all

97
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,139
of this so unique opportunity and and

98
00:04:24,149 --> 00:04:27,269
we're just really thrilled to have you

99
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:29,550
all here because obviously you are the

100
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:31,740
type of folks that will ensure a good

101
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,720
outcome here please engage I'll just

102
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,038
point you to the URL that's on the

103
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,750
bottom of the screen here we are running

104
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:42,389
a policy survey and we will we want you

105
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,639
all to just do that as you want

106
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:46,649
throughout this session we will report

107
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,418
the findings tomorrow as we have as we

108
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:49,819
enter our conversation about energy

109
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:51,839
codes and how they will affect

110
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:55,339
controlled environment AG thank you

111
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,869
again and thank you Jennifer coming yeah

112
00:04:55,339 --> 00:05:00,418
okay so we're gonna dive right into some

113
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:03,060
questions that we talked about as a

114
00:05:00,418 --> 00:05:05,099
group but then we're gonna offer you

115
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,209
plenty of time to ask your own questions

116
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:11,820
so can I move to the slide please Brian

117
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:13,500
so this is your slide can you kick us

118
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:16,019
off with the current discussions

119
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,660
happening around canopy use

120
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:21,359
as an architect working in Massachusetts

121
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,210
and now I work nationally and

122
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,889
internationally this question came up on

123
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:32,849
an online forum and it's something that

124
00:05:28,889 --> 00:05:34,829
I deal with in every in every project so

125
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,410
it has there's some minutiae here so

126
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:39,689
I've got text I'll go through I've got

127
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,820
some graphics here that you know are

128
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:43,259
maybe hard to read and so I want to take

129
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:47,550
the chance to kind of walk through them

130
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:49,289
with you one of the things about sort of

131
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:51,750
being an architect is that you know I'm

132
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:54,830
in a room full of policy people utility

133
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:57,269
people and scientists engineers

134
00:05:54,829 --> 00:06:00,109
architects tend to speculate on things

135
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:01,859
much of what I do is not always

136
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:08,310
scientifically rooted but I'm trying to

137
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:10,139
balance the science the policy and in in

138
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:12,629
the case of cannabis workflow efficiency

139
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:15,779
how does work get done how do we do

140
00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:17,719
everyday what we're doing and so these

141
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:22,409
I've got two slides here to talk about

142
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:24,180
hopefully quickly there's confusion on

143
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,500
how and I think this can help but I'm

144
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,250
hoping it can help with your feedback

145
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,839
how do we define canape gets indirectly

146
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:34,410
to how we shape policy that affects

147
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:37,619
energy use so this confusion came about

148
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:39,510
a few weeks ago maybe a month ago or at

149
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,240
least it came about as a forum that the

150
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:43,469
confusions been there for a while and

151
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,579
there's a definition on the top which

152
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:49,200
comes from our state law in

153
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:51,870
Massachusetts 935 CMR 500 and the

154
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,789
below-the-line is a is an X is a

155
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:57,300
clarification document that came out in

156
00:06:53,790 --> 00:07:00,319
January in which the definitions here

157
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,030
now we're using specific language

158
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,209
specific language meaning new new new

159
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:10,229
three and four letter acronyms

160
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:12,120
horticultural lighting power density and

161
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,530
now we do get into some math here we got

162
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,250
numerators and denominators to figure

163
00:07:13,529 --> 00:07:19,919
out horizontal lighting equipment and

164
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:21,389
horizontal lighting square feet divided

165
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,230
gives you horizontal lighting power

166
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:29,389
density the confusion has come about is

167
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,390
how do we define canopy and

168
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,310
so I get back into wool @y as an

169
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,050
architect I tend to speculate on things

170
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:36,819
I read codes all the time and I have to

171
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,069
make proposals I don't always get to

172
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:41,019
talk to the people who wrote the code

173
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:44,349
and understand what their intent was but

174
00:07:41,019 --> 00:07:46,479
I always have to offer my opinion I

175
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:48,970
always have to sort of speculate on the

176
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,060
behalf of my customers how we're going

177
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:56,470
to move through this so some of the

178
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:59,199
confusion is here canopy maybe

179
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:03,430
non-contiguous well I'll go from the top

180
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,599
canopy is Illinois is also dealing with

181
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,500
this so we want to give some perspective

182
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:11,140
Illinois has adopted the same law for 10

183
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,910
ILS F for whatever the law is they've

184
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:16,899
adopted this so this is going to come up

185
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:19,480
in and I think it's canopy is to be

186
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:23,229
calculated square feet measured using

187
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:24,970
clearly identifiable boundaries of all

188
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,860
areas will contain mature plants so

189
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:31,900
mature plants right there has led to

190
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:33,399
confusion at any point in time including

191
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:35,559
all of the spaces within the boundaries

192
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:37,750
canopy may be non continuous you can

193
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:41,319
have lots of different rooms containing

194
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:44,649
canopy so they're non contiguous but

195
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,170
each unique area included in the total

196
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:49,149
canopy calculations shall be separated

197
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:51,579
by an identifiable boundary those

198
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:53,799
boundaries may include interior walls

199
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,050
shelves greenhouse walls hoop house

200
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:58,809
walls garden benches hedgerows so lots

201
00:08:56,049 --> 00:09:00,429
of stuff right and then this last

202
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:02,189
sentence also has caused some confusion

203
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:06,099
if mature plants are being cultivated

204
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:08,410
using a shelving system then the surface

205
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:16,690
area of each level shall be included in

206
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:18,338
the canopy calculation the so that I'll

207
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,660
let that sit so then horticultural

208
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:23,200
lighting equipment we know what that is

209
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:24,819
any fixture that uses energy for the

210
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,790
cultivation of plants so not your

211
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,970
general lighting not your egress lights

212
00:09:26,789 --> 00:09:34,809
right just the cultivation dedicated

213
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:37,740
fixtures at any stage of growth so that

214
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:40,088
includes cloning germination cloning I

215
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:43,509
think these pieces helped me to

216
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:49,360
understand or formulate my speculation

217
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:51,340
which I'll show in the second slide it's

218
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,879
it's important that right so these words

219
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:57,040
that I'm latching on to our interior

220
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:59,980
walls interior walls are used to define

221
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:03,240
the space in which the plant grows and

222
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:06,820
that and it so in including

223
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,830
horticultural lighting at any stage of

224
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:14,430
plant growth I think is also impactful

225
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:17,800
to calculate as an understanding why

226
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:19,779
mature plants I feel as a is lending

227
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:20,529
confusion because in Massachusetts or in

228
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:23,949
other places

229
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:27,429
when using metric the system for seed to

230
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:30,040
sale we don't put the collar on a plant

231
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:31,719
when it's under 8 inches because there's

232
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,860
there's just waste of time right the

233
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,470
plants are gonna die you've got a

234
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,850
certain attrition rate so when mature

235
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:39,430
plant is defined as something you can

236
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,860
put a collar on 4 metric purposes after

237
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:44,409
it reaches a certain level of maturity

238
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:46,600
that is not I believe that is leading to

239
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:48,850
confusion so we're not using that same 8

240
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,230
inches in the horizontal in the

241
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,620
horticultural lighting power density

242
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:58,269
equations what we're using are typically

243
00:10:53,620 --> 00:11:01,990
than room area so if you're growing on a

244
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:09,250
roll-top bench in a traditional scenario

245
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:12,639
with a with a light over it then the

246
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:16,710
area to be calculated so the denominator

247
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:19,179
is your square feet your horticultural

248
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,980
lighting square footage would be the

249
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:24,639
floor area of the room in which you're

250
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,110
cultivating including the bench area but

251
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,120
not in addition to you wouldn't add

252
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:31,720
bench area to floor area to calculate

253
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,460
the bench area plus the area around the

254
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,320
bench that would include that would be

255
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:38,950
your whore whore toe cultural lighting

256
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,930
square footage if you're growing on a

257
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:43,180
multi-tiered then you would add the

258
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:47,429
square footage of the bench above the

259
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:47,429
first second third etc

260
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,970
you would take the lighting power of

261
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,070
each of the fixtures at each level

262
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,769
whether the interstitial and you know

263
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:59,590
bench areas or simply hanging from the

264
00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:05,710
ceiling those all become your into your

265
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:08,470
numerator all of your square footages go

266
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:10,450
into the denominator so I go back to say

267
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,300
well if horticultural lighting equipment

268
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:17,140
must be all lighting equipment that uses

269
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:20,049
energy at all stages of growth then it's

270
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:22,509
unfair to pack all of lighting in and

271
00:12:20,049 --> 00:12:26,349
not be able to use all of the area in

272
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:29,350
which plants are grown so I think all

273
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:31,509
right so if you take whether this is a

274
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,659
veg or a flower room plus a clone room

275
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:37,419
all of the all of the areas stock plants

276
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:40,049
clone plants vegetative and flower all

277
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:42,039
added together become your

278
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:46,419
horticulturist lighting square footage

279
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:50,079
and all of the wattages added up from

280
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:53,019
all the rooms become your lighting

281
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:55,120
equipment and that's the interpretation

282
00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:56,740
so it's very different equation if you

283
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,919
don't count the square footage of the

284
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:02,680
room it becomes very difficult to in

285
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:06,549
some cases hit the 36 watts or for

286
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:08,379
smaller grows 50 Watts wheeze as a

287
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:12,059
design office have done facilities that

288
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:15,370
have had high pressure sodium lights and

289
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:18,369
still passed the 36 watts per square

290
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:25,690
foot that's a 16,000 square foot a

291
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:27,700
canopy and that's the essence of how our

292
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:32,170
proposal works so I'm curious to hear

293
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:34,240
feedback so keep that in mind but before

294
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:37,629
we do that before we start asking

295
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:41,049
questions we're gonna keep going and I

296
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:42,610
just want to address Molly you're part

297
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:46,990
of the implementation that Brian

298
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:48,370
referred to in Illinois and in 2019 they

299
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:50,769
passed their new law based on the

300
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:52,450
Massachusetts law what were some of the

301
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:53,980
challenges that you saw in developing

302
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,900
that law and what are some of the

303
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,330
ongoing challenges that you're facing in

304
00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:01,340
Illinois yeah so for those who aren't

305
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:04,160
familiar the Illinois legislation

306
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:07,160
included environmental components in the

307
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:09,289
actual legislation itself and so those

308
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:10,639
were the 36 watts per square foot

309
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:13,009
lighting power density from

310
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,960
Massachusetts however that's for all

311
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:16,970
facilities even though smaller grows

312
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,670
have to comply with the 36 watts

313
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:23,750
unlike Massachusetts and then there's an

314
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:27,319
HVAC component that was entirely new and

315
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:29,889
what that states is that for facilities

316
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:33,740
with 6,000 square feet of canopy or less

317
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:35,990
they can use a ductless mini-split to

318
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,850
obtain heating and cooling and anything

319
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:40,580
larger than that needs to use a variable

320
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:42,889
refrigerant flow system those are two

321
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:46,310
prescriptive requirements the other

322
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:49,309
option is or more energy efficient

323
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:51,769
equipment which as probably all of you

324
00:14:49,309 --> 00:14:53,989
know that's very nebulous how do you

325
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:56,299
define what is more energy efficient

326
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:59,840
than two pieces of equipment that have

327
00:14:56,299 --> 00:15:01,729
varying levels of efficiency so that's

328
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,899
the world that we're operating in right

329
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:05,450
now

330
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:08,059
I think a challenge with implementing

331
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:11,089
the law in in the beginning was it was

332
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:12,349
well intended we wanted to you know

333
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:13,970
there was a lot of stakeholders involved

334
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:16,279
a lot of cooks in the kitchen everyone

335
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:20,089
wanted to make sure that there was a lot

336
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:21,649
of focus on environmental considerations

337
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:24,230
and making this one of the greenest

338
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:26,569
cannibus legislations across the country

339
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:28,820
but I think it got a little out of

340
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:32,360
control it was a fast-moving freight

341
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:33,920
train the newly elected governor was

342
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,129
putting pressure on legislators to pass

343
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:41,059
a bill quickly and so it became like a

344
00:15:37,129 --> 00:15:42,879
monster bill 700 pages huge focus on

345
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:45,139
social equity and justice which is

346
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,700
amazing but that means environmental

347
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:49,789
components were kind of thrown in

348
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:53,290
secondary or tertiary with little room

349
00:15:49,789 --> 00:15:56,870
for any revisions once they were put in

350
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:59,019
so once those HVAC requirements that I

351
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:02,629
think are probably pretty problematic

352
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:04,490
were included we were unable to kind of

353
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,929
amend that language although I've been

354
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,450
told that there may be an opportunity

355
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:10,359
for a trailer bill in the future right

356
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:14,790
now that's kind of what we're stuck with

357
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,560
so that was the development side and now

358
00:16:14,789 --> 00:16:19,649
as of January 1st we are now

359
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,359
implementing that law so the Department

360
00:16:19,649 --> 00:16:23,399
of Agriculture is actually the

361
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,039
enforcement agency that is overseeing

362
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:29,159
the cultivation side of cannabis in

363
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:32,459
Illinois they released some emergency

364
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:33,959
rules in December we were hoping that

365
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,420
they're gonna clarify some of that

366
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,430
nebulous language but they just copied

367
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:41,189
and pasted directly from the legislation

368
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:45,419
so there's still a lot of questions on

369
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:47,400
how to meet these new efficiency

370
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:49,769
standards that you have to in order to

371
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,069
get a license I think some of the

372
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:54,210
challenges can be seen in just

373
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,710
interpretation and the only

374
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,300
interpretation that matters right now is

375
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:59,250
the Department of Agriculture they're

376
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:01,370
the one that's going to be enforcing

377
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:04,190
this so understanding how they interpret

378
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:06,390
what would meet that requirement is

379
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:09,269
extremely important and we've got to see

380
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,920
what that means as well as what was the

381
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:14,400
legislative intent and how do we stay

382
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:18,959
within that enforcement is going to be a

383
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:20,759
big question Department of Ag is not you

384
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,730
know they're not experts on HVAC system

385
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:25,529
design they're not lighting experts and

386
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,470
so how are they going to be recognizing

387
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:32,039
systems that are not a mini-split or a

388
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:35,190
vrf but still are efficiently designed

389
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:36,299
and should qualify just helping them

390
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:38,279
understand that it shouldn't be a

391
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:39,899
checkbox like yes you have them in e

392
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:41,069
sweater yes you have a V RF and if you

393
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,500
don't have one of those too then you

394
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:44,849
shouldn't be awarded a license there's

395
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,029
going to be a lot of systems that will

396
00:17:44,849 --> 00:17:50,189
meet or exceed those efficiency levels

397
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:52,109
we've also put set a pretty high

398
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:54,630
baseline that takes some utility

399
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:56,579
incentives off the table which increases

400
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,680
the cost to participate in this market

401
00:17:56,579 --> 00:18:01,039
so that is something that we're dealing

402
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,450
with right now is how do you till --'tis

403
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,069
understand if there is an opportunity to

404
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,690
offer some sort of equipment incentive

405
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:09,509
given the high baselines that are set

406
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:11,759
and finally I think this has been

407
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:15,329
mentioned so many times but this policy

408
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,980
didn't really align with the industry we

409
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:19,799
see a lot of times probably suit policy

410
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,180
makers are you know creating policies

411
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,450
that are well intended but aren't

412
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,799
necessarily taking the industry's

413
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:27,509
practice into consideration and that's

414
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,829
definitely the world that we're living

415
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:30,859
in

416
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:33,139
right now yeah those are some of the

417
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,428
challenges that we're facing and I look

418
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,679
forward to hearing some of your thoughts

419
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:38,570
on how we can overcome them and how we

420
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:40,970
can take kind of some lessons learned

421
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:43,009
into new states in the Midwest that

422
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,950
might be considering legislation so that

423
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:48,250
we're not repeating some mistakes

424
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:50,600
thanks Valli we're gonna keep going

425
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:52,819
Michael can you talk about some of the

426
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:55,730
structural market challenges emerging

427
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:58,819
for growers and any lessons learned by

428
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:02,778
the industry to date ok I have a new set

429
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:06,648
of slides please sure thing

430
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:10,038
thanks Jen so all breeze through these

431
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:12,018
three slides for you all real quick so

432
00:19:10,038 --> 00:19:14,329
as I mentioned I started my career in

433
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:17,450
energy policy and then moved into

434
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:21,740
cannabis policy the odd part of that

435
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:23,240
story is that I started in I came over

436
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,250
from solar development and I was

437
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,638
interested in selling renewable energy

438
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:32,960
to cannabis growers because hey you know

439
00:19:28,638 --> 00:19:35,449
you guys may want to lock in a cheap

440
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,829
rate for clean energy and then shed any

441
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:44,860
of the criticism of being a high energy

442
00:19:39,829 --> 00:19:47,418
use producer I ended up moving over to

443
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:51,408
cannabis and now I work primarily in

444
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:56,440
sun-grown cannabis but that aside it

445
00:19:51,409 --> 00:19:59,630
struck me as I was moving through the

446
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,440
landscape of policy issues that one

447
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,370
thing is certain and I'm gonna probably

448
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,409
divide the crowd here with this

449
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:08,388
statement but one thing is certain is

450
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:11,269
that at some point the federal

451
00:20:08,388 --> 00:20:15,259
government is going to legalize cannabis

452
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:19,009
and when that happens this industry will

453
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:21,619
get much much bigger however it will

454
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:23,720
look much much different when that

455
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:28,518
happens because when you move from a

456
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:32,028
system of 30 or 40 different individual

457
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:34,788
markets that must produce and consume

458
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:37,179
all of the products within their

459
00:20:34,788 --> 00:20:41,629
boundaries and you move into a

460
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:44,240
capitalist economy where goods can

461
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:49,700
across state boundaries efficiently

462
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:51,769
based upon the cost of production then

463
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,720
you have a entirely different market

464
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:55,400
structure and so what we're building

465
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,779
towards today with all of this

466
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:03,470
conversation around energy and energy

467
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:06,619
consumption from indoor environments in

468
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:09,079
states that either require indoor indoor

469
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:11,449
grow operations or that's all that's

470
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:13,519
gonna work if you know say Maine or

471
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:16,940
other states where it's just what's

472
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:19,190
gonna work and you move into an

473
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:22,789
environment where you can't start to

474
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:26,299
import cost becomes a key consideration

475
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:28,309
and we start to see it's almost like a

476
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:30,559
postcard from the past right from the

477
00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:36,169
old good old days of the illicit market

478
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:41,990
when cannabis primarily is produced on

479
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:44,600
the west coast in some of the pro that

480
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:46,970
the massive amounts of outdoor grow

481
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:51,709
operations in California and Oregon and

482
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:55,059
Washington and moved eastward via

483
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:59,870
underground distribution channels to

484
00:21:55,059 --> 00:22:02,329
your neighborhood I'll call them a

485
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:05,539
retailer on the corner

486
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:09,289
those those traditional movements of

487
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:13,389
cannabis were kind of based on economics

488
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:15,409
also and so as you as you eliminate the

489
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:18,110
boundaries and you eliminate the

490
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:22,070
barriers to commerce across these

491
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:25,429
different markets you see a lot of what

492
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:27,529
I say collision of investment

493
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:30,920
pre-existing investment in grow

494
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:32,869
infrastructure and the economics of of

495
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,259
moving products across state boundaries

496
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:38,479
so what I'm going to setup for you is

497
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:40,460
sort of a thought exercise which is the

498
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,680
federal government is going to legalize

499
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,480
at some point maybe it's in two years

500
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,000
maybe it's in four years maybe it's in

501
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,990
six years lots of investment is going to

502
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:54,259
go in to grow environment infrastructure

503
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:55,558
and what if you had that you could

504
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:57,619
either live that future and

505
00:22:55,558 --> 00:23:01,259
let the walls come down in the future or

506
00:22:57,619 --> 00:23:03,239
you could set up a situation today where

507
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:07,710
the same way that the federal government

508
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:09,628
has allowed States acting as policy

509
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:12,269
laboratories to create their own

510
00:23:09,628 --> 00:23:14,638
cannabis marketplaces this the federal

511
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:17,038
government could equally allow states

512
00:23:14,638 --> 00:23:19,558
that have their own cannabis laws to

513
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:21,808
choose to enter into trading

514
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:23,579
arrangements with each other and do

515
00:23:21,808 --> 00:23:25,888
business with each other across state

516
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:31,199
boundaries they don't even have to be

517
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:33,178
contiguous and if that were an option

518
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,369
now put yourself in the policymakers

519
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:39,389
position you're an elected official if

520
00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:42,898
you could choose to allow to import with

521
00:23:39,388 --> 00:23:46,589
another state that already has

522
00:23:42,898 --> 00:23:49,349
established cultivation is it better to

523
00:23:46,589 --> 00:23:52,829
let to insulate your state from that

524
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:56,548
import and let grow infrastructure and

525
00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:59,460
other business infrastructure receive

526
00:23:56,548 --> 00:24:01,528
investments only to have it potentially

527
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:05,869
crash in the future or is it better to

528
00:24:01,528 --> 00:24:09,960
start your your new cannabis economy

529
00:24:05,868 --> 00:24:12,959
with some reasonable amount of imports

530
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,519
coming from other states to help even

531
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,298
out supply and demand fucking

532
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:19,740
fluctuations and even get at some of

533
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:21,450
these energy environmental

534
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,460
considerations so since this is an

535
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:25,139
energy and environmental crowd I'm gonna

536
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,329
take the conversation in that direction

537
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:32,189
if we can just slip to the next slide

538
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:35,519
here California Oregon and Washington

539
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:38,399
are three states that like I said

540
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:42,409
primarily historically have been known

541
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:45,089
for their outdoor cultivation and

542
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:46,769
there's no statement about better or

543
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:49,230
worse or anything like that but it is

544
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:52,798
cheaper let's just agree that outdoor is

545
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:56,519
a lot cheaper to grow the cost inputs

546
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:59,970
are much lower and in an environment

547
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:01,950
where you know the products that are

548
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:04,288
being purchased by consumers are I'd say

549
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:06,269
on average about half manufactured

550
00:25:04,288 --> 00:25:07,919
products and half flower based products

551
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:09,240
that means half of the product base

552
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,470
that's being sold you

553
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:16,410
your states are agnostic as to the

554
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,950
appearance of the flower in the first

555
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:19,290
place

556
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:22,049
so you're just harvesting cannabinoids

557
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:24,720
and those harvested cannabinoids when

558
00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:28,049
those walls come down are going to be

559
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,329
purchased based on price and so

560
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:33,599
something to consider at the early

561
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:36,960
stages here but so with regard to the

562
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:38,490
energy and environmental angles here if

563
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,829
you're a state that does care a lot

564
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:43,650
about energy and environment of your

565
00:25:40,829 --> 00:25:47,759
cultivation environments and you had the

566
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:50,070
option to import you could start to

567
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,650
import some grown cannabis from states

568
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:55,669
like California or Oregon that would

569
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:58,560
carry much less carbon footprints than

570
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:01,440
even even cannabis that's grown indoors

571
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:05,849
using you know renewable energy quite

572
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,799
honestly we regard to pesticides use

573
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:10,139
pesticide use is important to a lot of

574
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:12,089
people as well and while I've seen it

575
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:14,790
done before that you know beneficial

576
00:26:12,089 --> 00:26:18,899
insects are used in indoor controlled

577
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:22,049
environments that can be challenging if

578
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:25,680
you're also using pesticides for for

579
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:26,849
other pests and it it also limits your

580
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,810
you know you're kind of not doing

581
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:32,129
companion planting or any kind of

582
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:35,099
regenerative agriculture or any of those

583
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:39,510
methods that sun-grown agriculture is

584
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:41,609
better equipped to accomplish and it

585
00:26:39,509 --> 00:26:44,660
just gets back down to capitalism quite

586
00:26:41,609 --> 00:26:48,809
honestly where the efficient movement of

587
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:50,880
goods from areas of the country or

588
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:54,569
frankly the globe where they are

589
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,180
produced most efficiently are are also

590
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:59,460
those products that are rewarded with

591
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:03,150
increased business there's a reason why

592
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:05,940
we don't grow oranges in Illinois I'm

593
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:07,380
sorry it's because they just grow much

594
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,480
better in other places and that's where

595
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:11,730
we get those oranges from you can grow

596
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,750
oranges there but people haven't made a

597
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,610
business out of it

598
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:16,859
and so that's that's sort of one of

599
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:18,809
these messages here just to avoid all

600
00:27:16,859 --> 00:27:20,909
the questions about what about the

601
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:22,168
federal government the last slide speaks

602
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:24,630
too

603
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:28,080
some of the barriers and obviously the

604
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:29,220
same way that states needed to hear from

605
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,439
the federal government to feel

606
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,720
comfortable about initiating their own

607
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,548
cannabis marketplace there is a federal

608
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,089
trigger to interstate commerce as well

609
00:27:35,548 --> 00:27:41,548
you do need to have either an attorney

610
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:44,639
general say you know in a memo we're

611
00:27:41,548 --> 00:27:48,119
okay with this or Congress could pass

612
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,860
what is it HR 3 5 4 6 which was authored

613
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:54,000
by representative bloom an hour from the

614
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:57,240
state of Oregon those things do need to

615
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,419
happen for interstate commerce pre D

616
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:03,058
scheduling to be a reality and you can

617
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:05,880
if that were the case move products

618
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:09,000
across states that even don't have any

619
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:11,549
legal market say Idaho for example via

620
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,548
rail if you're on the ground you can

621
00:28:11,548 --> 00:28:17,009
always transport it in the air as well

622
00:28:13,548 --> 00:28:18,509
these are both federal in federal

623
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:21,298
jurisdiction and so if they act we asked

624
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:23,669
if they say yes you may then in

625
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:25,470
inherently they're also identifying that

626
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:29,190
you can do it via one of those two

627
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:32,480
methods as well so that's that's the

628
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:36,210
topic that I have to kind of throw some

629
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,028
shock and awe into the discussion huff

630
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:41,548
you know lighting efficiency in Illinois

631
00:28:39,028 --> 00:28:43,409
and Massachusetts and in other places is

632
00:28:41,548 --> 00:28:45,960
that in the future

633
00:28:43,409 --> 00:28:48,990
there very well may be a lot more

634
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:51,899
commerce from other markets not just

635
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:53,548
internal to the states Thanks great

636
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:56,339
thank you Michael

637
00:28:53,548 --> 00:28:58,440
so Derek you've heard from your fellow

638
00:28:56,339 --> 00:29:01,528
fellow panelists about some of the

639
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:04,620
challenges as the industry continues to

640
00:29:01,528 --> 00:29:07,169
grow in states adopt new regulations how

641
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:09,719
do you assess the success of policy and

642
00:29:07,169 --> 00:29:12,360
adapt a flexible framework for future

643
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,569
States and/or an eventual adoption of

644
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:17,009
policy at the federal level great

645
00:29:15,569 --> 00:29:18,928
question

646
00:29:17,009 --> 00:29:20,849
well this came up a little bit yesterday

647
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:25,230
in the technical advisory council summit

648
00:29:20,849 --> 00:29:27,678
we had a policy discussion and we are

649
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:30,179
going to start a policy working group

650
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,000
coming out of this conference to begin

651
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:34,080
to address these issues but we have

652
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,288
assembled

653
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:39,148
basic policy template and resource

654
00:29:37,288 --> 00:29:41,729
innovation Institute that we are have

655
00:29:39,148 --> 00:29:43,648
been peer reviewing it includes the

656
00:29:41,729 --> 00:29:46,558
actual statutory language it's

657
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:49,498
essentially borrowing from States and

658
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:51,089
offering language and essentially just

659
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:53,098
cataloging all the issues that need to

660
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:55,439
be considered as you can hear there's a

661
00:29:53,098 --> 00:29:58,378
lot of issues that need to be considered

662
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,629
both at tho macro level with a

663
00:29:58,378 --> 00:30:03,089
tremendous amount of uncertainty as well

664
00:30:00,628 --> 00:30:04,709
as the micro level with like the nuance

665
00:30:03,089 --> 00:30:07,079
of language around how you define

666
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:10,558
certain things that will be key metrics

667
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:12,898
that will govern all this and I all of

668
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,940
this obviously is setting the blueprint

669
00:30:12,898 --> 00:30:17,329
for not just cannabis I think we're

670
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:20,369
primarily talking about cannabis but

671
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:22,168
policy builds on policy and and this is

672
00:30:20,368 --> 00:30:25,228
where it's starting so this is all

673
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:28,499
relevant to see EA how canopy gets

674
00:30:25,229 --> 00:30:30,778
defined is relevant to the way

675
00:30:28,499 --> 00:30:33,440
California will roll out their current

676
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:35,429
codes that they're considering so

677
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,440
essentially we're asking states

678
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:39,359
generally to think about these issues in

679
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,759
three different categories based on

680
00:30:39,358 --> 00:30:45,538
where they are in their evolution toward

681
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:47,819
cannabis legalization so those pre

682
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:49,919
market considerations in market

683
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:53,368
considerations and then sort of

684
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,320
continuous improvement from there so pre

685
00:30:53,368 --> 00:30:56,878
market considerations we would and I

686
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:58,259
won't go into any detail on these but

687
00:30:56,878 --> 00:30:59,338
I'll just kind of throw these out there

688
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:02,098
I think we're all just trying to be

689
00:30:59,338 --> 00:31:06,178
provocative and tee you up to ask us

690
00:31:02,098 --> 00:31:09,868
questions so pre market I'm a state I'm

691
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:12,419
thinking about regulating I'm have a

692
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:14,368
little bit of understanding or concern

693
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:15,409
about energy and environmental issues

694
00:31:14,368 --> 00:31:17,878
what should I do

695
00:31:15,409 --> 00:31:20,309
what we what we would say and it this

696
00:31:17,878 --> 00:31:23,158
kind of considers all of the input that

697
00:31:20,308 --> 00:31:25,618
we've provided so far think first about

698
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:28,229
how much cultivation infrastructure you

699
00:31:25,618 --> 00:31:31,648
believe will be economically viable in

700
00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:34,288
your state you want to go all out and

701
00:31:31,648 --> 00:31:37,408
you know invest in this market and you

702
00:31:34,288 --> 00:31:39,329
believe that you can win maybe a state

703
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:42,440
like Vermont which is starting to do all

704
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:44,689
this which has some sort of

705
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:46,730
Historical Association and brand

706
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:48,470
identify identification with cannabis

707
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,538
maybe they want to go real big I'll just

708
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:53,750
go for it they want to build a lot of

709
00:31:50,538 --> 00:31:55,609
infrastructure ok cool other states you

710
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:59,329
know we see Oklahoma right now as an

711
00:31:55,609 --> 00:32:00,709
example unlimited licenses basically you

712
00:31:59,329 --> 00:32:02,569
know just like I guess you would think

713
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,669
stereotypically of Oklahoma wild wild

714
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:08,240
west right like you can do anything you

715
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:13,220
want there any size anywhere pretty much

716
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:15,589
right well not very thoughtful right

717
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:17,538
about their long-term tax revenues about

718
00:32:15,589 --> 00:32:20,119
the energy and environmental impact

719
00:32:17,538 --> 00:32:22,579
about the competitiveness about much but

720
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:23,779
there guns a-blazing going for it and

721
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:25,548
they're gonna clacks collect some

722
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:26,240
short-term tax revenue for sure which

723
00:32:25,548 --> 00:32:28,099
will be great

724
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,169
I guess but they might have a ton of

725
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:33,759
stranded assets in the real estate

726
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:35,690
market might actually depress the

727
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,929
horticultural lighting market because a

728
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:40,279
secondary market for lighting systems

729
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:42,679
that were barely used

730
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:45,619
now floods the market and actually

731
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:48,740
depresses the you know primary market

732
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:49,879
pricing there's a lot of things like

733
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,409
that that need to be thought but

734
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,720
nobody's really thinking cuz everybody's

735
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:56,299
moving so quick right on so many issues

736
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,429
and there's so much pressure the other

737
00:32:56,298 --> 00:32:59,629
point I'll make it as what are you

738
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:00,919
actually talking about like I said

739
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,659
earlier are you talking about energy or

740
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:03,770
you're talking about carbon totally

741
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:06,590
different things and as we heard this

742
00:33:03,769 --> 00:33:08,629
morning from Bryan Energy it doesn't

743
00:33:06,589 --> 00:33:12,168
necessarily connect with carbon and

744
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:13,520
increasingly it may not so be really

745
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:16,640
clear about what you're thinking about I

746
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:19,759
would say I would argue don't ban any

747
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:23,750
method of cultivation we see for example

748
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:25,879
Illinois has billed itself as the most

749
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,558
environmental cannabis regulation

750
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:30,590
because they took Massachusetts there

751
00:33:27,558 --> 00:33:32,298
out of the few improvements in terms of

752
00:33:30,589 --> 00:33:36,829
efficiency but they also banned outdoor

753
00:33:32,298 --> 00:33:38,029
cultivation so I don't know most

754
00:33:36,829 --> 00:33:42,259
environmental I don't know that I would

755
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:44,869
agree with that but also we see local

756
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:47,058
jurisdictions doing the same thing here

757
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:48,798
in California you know there was a

758
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:51,190
coordinated effort by the League of

759
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:52,908
Cities to essentially ban cultivation

760
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,650
extend and there were just a few

761
00:33:52,909 --> 00:33:55,010
jurisdictions that popped up and said

762
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:57,860
we're

763
00:33:55,009 --> 00:34:00,140
okay with it so you've got almost like

764
00:33:57,859 --> 00:34:01,399
the us like a little mini us situation

765
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:05,870
happening in California it's not a

766
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:07,940
really clear market and then you know

767
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:10,730
there's all these bands and a lot of

768
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:13,340
that's just because it smells like weed

769
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:15,469
and now it's actually even more in him

770
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,480
right now we've got hemp everywhere and

771
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:19,789
so everybody's freaking out cuz oh my

772
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,869
god it smells so horrible but I'll Drive

773
00:34:19,789 --> 00:34:24,139
by this manure

774
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:26,239
you know operation in this Purina dog

775
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:28,940
food thing in Denver which is actually

776
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,349
right by right by all the cultivation in

777
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,760
Denver and it's you know what I'd rather

778
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:33,619
smell weed I don't know about you

779
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,590
terpenes good right

780
00:34:33,619 --> 00:34:41,929
but odor issues are totally terpenes are

781
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:44,360
in every DEA facility right so also set

782
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:47,289
standards on lighting at least and we

783
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,190
would argue in Commissioner Doyle didn't

784
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:51,469
didn't emphasize this at her

785
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:53,840
presentation but Massachusetts did

786
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:56,029
evolve so it was they weren't only

787
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:58,090
thinking about 36 watts per square foot

788
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:00,530
and I hope that we had a little bit of

789
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:02,150
impression on that with Massachusetts

790
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:03,710
cannabis energy roundtable that we

791
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,930
brought together included Brian a bunch

792
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:07,519
of other folks to actually help the

793
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:09,589
state think about it differently than

794
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:12,739
just watts per square foot which is more

795
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:16,340
of a commercial building application of

796
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:18,349
energy policy or energy code but we know

797
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:21,620
now that photon efficacy is really what

798
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:23,150
is driving efficiency and can be paired

799
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:27,889
with watts per square foot but needs to

800
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:30,349
be you know done thoughtfully in market

801
00:35:27,889 --> 00:35:33,139
collect more data established continued

802
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:37,429
savings targets over time based on the

803
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:40,909
data to continue to drive more

804
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:44,779
efficiency but most important what we

805
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:47,899
see and what we hear is that every

806
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:50,030
facility is different every cultivators

807
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:53,570
and methods are different there

808
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:55,820
literally are no best practices we just

809
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:58,430
produced best practices on HVAC and

810
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:01,730
lighting peer-reviewed like I described

811
00:35:58,429 --> 00:36:03,919
to the tech summit yesterday but the

812
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:06,530
educational component is so critical

813
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,250
like you can't just throw a lot out

814
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,530
there and expect

815
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:12,469
people to comply with so much pressure

816
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:14,330
in the market just generally and also so

817
00:36:12,469 --> 00:36:18,109
much confusion about different terms and

818
00:36:14,329 --> 00:36:20,750
whatnot it's going to be a mess you need

819
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:22,400
to provide education and we need to make

820
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:24,619
sure that incentives are part of the

821
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:29,000
conversation and essentially what states

822
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:30,949
are doing unlike California is kind of

823
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,079
writing codes without going through a

824
00:36:30,949 --> 00:36:36,919
code proposal process that actually

825
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:39,469
fully has for example here in California

826
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,940
a three-year review process where

827
00:36:39,469 --> 00:36:42,769
there's a ton of stakeholder engagement

828
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:45,320
quick commercial we have a California

829
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:45,949
code dialogue tonight 6:30 you all

830
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,809
should come

831
00:36:45,949 --> 00:36:49,609
anybody who's caring about California

832
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:52,940
codes you should come grab drinks grab

833
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:54,410
food come in eat really important and

834
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:57,530
we'll have a final code conversation

835
00:36:54,409 --> 00:37:00,699
tomorrow but what's happening when these

836
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:03,590
states essentially de facto codes on

837
00:37:00,699 --> 00:37:06,289
technology is then it tells the

838
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:08,390
utilities well you can't the utilities

839
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:10,730
think they can't provide incentives on

840
00:37:08,389 --> 00:37:12,170
that because it sets a new baseline and

841
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:15,829
they can only provide incentives on what

842
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:17,300
is below that baseline because they get

843
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:21,920
measured on cost effectiveness of their

844
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:25,310
incentives and so but there is precedent

845
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:28,099
that incentives can be part of new code

846
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:31,190
adoption especially when the technology

847
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:33,019
is not incumbent in the market and LED

848
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:36,909
technology is not incumbent in this

849
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:39,590
market its increasing but what we see

850
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:41,569
all over the place is that people don't

851
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:43,850
know how to operate it efficiently they

852
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:45,530
then they need support on how to address

853
00:37:43,849 --> 00:37:45,829
HVAC and nutrient water and blah blah

854
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,620
blah

855
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:50,389
I also promote renewables in tandem with

856
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:52,099
efficiency which I Massachusetts is

857
00:37:50,389 --> 00:37:54,859
clearly doing a good job in focusing on

858
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:57,199
also supporting recognition programs and

859
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:59,390
amplifying equity and just making sure

860
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,639
that we're considering for jacking up

861
00:37:59,389 --> 00:38:03,289
the upfront cost and we don't have

862
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:05,539
financing available in this marketplace

863
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:07,639
and we're trying to also encourage

864
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:10,730
people of color who have been impacted

865
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:13,099
by the war on drugs to benefit from the

866
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:15,019
new marketplace then we need to actually

867
00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:15,909
think about how they can afford this

868
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:18,818
technology

869
00:38:15,909 --> 00:38:21,190
and have a competitive leg up so it's

870
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:23,318
such a complex set of issues but we're

871
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,818
excited to work with those of you that

872
00:38:23,318 --> 00:38:28,808
want to join our policy committee and

873
00:38:24,818 --> 00:38:32,079
work with us to put more meat on the

874
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:33,819
bones I hate that term but help us flesh

875
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,500
us who flesh this out oh god I got it

876
00:38:33,818 --> 00:38:39,250
just basically said the same thing weird

877
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:45,338
weird you know what I'm saying let's do

878
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:48,159
it all right thanks um so I guess I'm

879
00:38:45,338 --> 00:38:51,449
gonna kick us off on questions John is

880
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:54,279
gonna be our faithful mic runner a few

881
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:57,788
things I guess I'll continue the an

882
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:59,500
animal analogy I'm from the Midwest and

883
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:02,140
we talked this we have a thing called

884
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:04,659
don't milk the skinny cow and you all

885
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:06,969
been together for a few days so if you

886
00:39:04,659 --> 00:39:09,159
said something in multiple spaces and

887
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:10,989
it's not a question um

888
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:14,679
I'd encourage you to think about how to

889
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:16,989
turn that into a question so we want

890
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:20,139
everybody to walk away with um

891
00:39:16,989 --> 00:39:21,639
engaging in this space so if you can

892
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:23,889
please ask a question

893
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:26,348
that'll help benefit all of you in the

894
00:39:23,889 --> 00:39:31,088
room um with that do I have a first

895
00:39:26,349 --> 00:39:33,250
question all right yeah so I have the

896
00:39:31,088 --> 00:39:35,858
pleasure of working with both Eric and

897
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,838
Michael wheeler and particularly with

898
00:39:35,858 --> 00:39:39,548
Michael at the California cannabis

899
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:40,750
Industry Association and we've obviously

900
00:39:39,548 --> 00:39:44,318
been talking quite a bit about

901
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:45,760
interstate commerce and so I was

902
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:48,338
wondering has there been more

903
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,349
conversation about how we might deal

904
00:39:48,338 --> 00:39:53,288
with states that don't have state

905
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:56,318
regulation if we have to get cannabis

906
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:58,000
from California to Ohio and driving

907
00:39:56,318 --> 00:40:00,338
through states that aren't regulated at

908
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,869
all and then also any talk about the

909
00:40:00,338 --> 00:40:10,318
carbon footprint of that transportation

910
00:40:01,869 --> 00:40:10,318
and what that might look like hi Lindsey

911
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:17,230
so great questions and the great thing

912
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:21,579
about cannabis is that you know if

913
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:24,730
you've got a ton of it 2,000 pounds of

914
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:28,240
it you've got an awful lot but in the

915
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:31,630
world of shipping things shipping in

916
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:34,750
commerce ton just isn't that much and so

917
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:37,690
I don't have exact figures about the

918
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:40,469
amount of carbon that you might see but

919
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:43,500
given the historical nature and that

920
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:46,029
cannabis has been moving westward from

921
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:49,000
from the coastal states the western

922
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:54,030
coastal states to eastern coastal states

923
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:57,068
for the last generation by truck and

924
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:59,920
probably a beat-up old truck at that I

925
00:40:57,068 --> 00:41:02,380
think will probably come out on the plus

926
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,450
side if we put it on rail I don't know

927
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:07,480
about airplanes airplanes certainly

928
00:41:04,449 --> 00:41:09,939
create more carbon likely than beat-up

929
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,650
old trucks but that analysis doesn't

930
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:14,798
need to be done I agree that analysis

931
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:18,690
does need to be done if it's worthwhile

932
00:41:14,798 --> 00:41:21,489
to say I think that probably you know I

933
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:23,679
would imagine that the cleanest and

934
00:41:21,489 --> 00:41:27,189
greenest way to do interstate commerce

935
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:29,608
is to have bulk products move just

936
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:33,940
biomass move across the states to

937
00:41:29,608 --> 00:41:38,348
individual states for final packaging

938
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:41,230
for transformation into manufactured

939
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:45,190
products let those states that invested

940
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:48,548
in the jobs angle of pro cannabis

941
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:50,260
policies keep those jobs so that they've

942
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:53,019
got those manufacturing plants they've

943
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:55,028
got those those good wage jobs in those

944
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:58,960
in those states as well don't need to

945
00:41:55,028 --> 00:42:01,210
take those away as far as moving it

946
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:05,380
though across state lines so that's sort

947
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:07,420
of the so I grew up when they were

948
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:09,240
talking about moving nuclear waste

949
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:11,650
across state lines and there would be

950
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:13,209
protests and you know you can't move

951
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:15,519
that through here and we'll have local

952
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:16,659
referendums and everything and at the

953
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:17,858
end of the day the federal government

954
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,838
still said it doesn't matter what you

955
00:42:17,858 --> 00:42:22,769
think we can still move it across state

956
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:24,420
lines because we're using

957
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:27,059
methods of transportation that are under

958
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:29,780
federal jurisdiction and so that goes to

959
00:42:27,059 --> 00:42:33,539
the trains federal jurisdiction and

960
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:37,500
Errol Errol Airways federal jurisdiction

961
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:40,139
in a approval by the federal government

962
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:42,420
to allow interstate commerce they would

963
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:43,799
need to say and it's okay to use these

964
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,590
forms of transportation because it's

965
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,240
federally controlled you probably want

966
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:55,380
more than that but that might be a beer

967
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:59,219
conversation great thank you hi I guess

968
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:02,010
I one of the with regards to carbon in a

969
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:05,250
standard operating procedure when you do

970
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:07,560
use LEDs which you're recommending they

971
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:11,429
topped the plants we know we need the

972
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:14,250
biomass along with living soil to have

973
00:43:11,429 --> 00:43:17,519
microbes that also help with that I'm

974
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:20,150
just curious how the group is looking at

975
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:22,739
not doing living soil and not having

976
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:25,349
sunlight indoors to do that to really

977
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:27,419
kind of mutate the plants and take away

978
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:31,380
all the areas that carbon would be

979
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:34,920
involved and then the only other comment

980
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:42,530
I have is we do have a light source that

981
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:42,530
does 11 watts per square foot great so

982
00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:51,859
we think that carbons should be a topic

983
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:54,150
Carbon should be considered we are

984
00:43:51,858 --> 00:43:56,250
impacted by climate change we need to

985
00:43:54,150 --> 00:44:00,480
get serious right we have an opportunity

986
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:03,809
to have this industry and the whole cea

987
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,210
industry be a beacon for sustainable

988
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:07,529
enterprise and I think that's what

989
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:09,358
everybody in this room is kind of

990
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:11,580
wanting to happen right so I think we

991
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:15,329
can figure this out but farmers who are

992
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:18,029
doing regenerative soil practices and

993
00:44:15,329 --> 00:44:20,159
not using diesel generators and you know

994
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:23,490
maybe even just doing dry farming next

995
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:25,529
to a riverbed should get credit for

996
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:30,629
having very little impact on the

997
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:32,140
environment a little confused by your

998
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:35,559
always focus on the

999
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:39,400
when you have an indoor electric product

1000
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:41,139
but I'll leave that to the side but we

1001
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,920
need to be obviously focusing on what

1002
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:47,199
has the least environmental impact and

1003
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:53,829
and what we mean by environmental impact

1004
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:57,429
needs to be defined it was said earlier

1005
00:44:53,829 --> 00:45:00,840
but I'll repeat it we we have to change

1006
00:44:57,429 --> 00:45:04,000
legislation that prohibits outdoor grown

1007
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:07,000
it we have to allow states to grow

1008
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,409
outdoors and not force it all to be

1009
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,769
indoors I think this there's space for

1010
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:13,239
both if we're doing distillate only

1011
00:45:10,769 --> 00:45:15,239
great thing to do out step outside if

1012
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:17,589
we're doing fries bud and prized flower

1013
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:19,750
that's a good reason to grow it indoors

1014
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:25,090
I think that would have a lot of effect

1015
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:28,510
on the carbon footprint hello okay good

1016
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:32,500
I'm Lauren from efficiency Vermont I'm

1017
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:35,050
wondering how might we take refrigerant

1018
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:38,019
choice especially as we're looking into

1019
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:41,170
HVAC into consideration in a lot of

1020
00:45:38,019 --> 00:45:43,480
these cases like VXR for example there's

1021
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:46,659
high leakage rates in those systems and

1022
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:48,699
they're leaking things like HFCS so in

1023
00:45:46,659 --> 00:45:50,949
terms of carbon impacts that's really

1024
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:54,399
important and it's a really short scale

1025
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:56,529
that we have to kind of scale up into

1026
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,180
things like natural refrigerants so I'm

1027
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:00,840
wondering if any of you have thought

1028
00:45:58,179 --> 00:46:05,589
about that or how might we be able to

1029
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:08,170
kind of edit our our policies or look

1030
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:10,480
ahead as we do more legalization type

1031
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:13,900
policy work to make sure we're taking

1032
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,099
into that into consideration yeah that's

1033
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:15,910
a really good question I can take a

1034
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:18,429
first stab at it

1035
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:20,379
so the Illinois legislation was

1036
00:46:18,429 --> 00:46:23,349
primarily focused on energy and not

1037
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:25,059
carbon and so from that perspective I

1038
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:28,299
don't think that refrigerants were

1039
00:46:25,059 --> 00:46:30,940
considered there specifically isn't any

1040
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:33,490
sort of requirement to use one sort of

1041
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,960
refrigerant over another but that is

1042
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:36,759
certainly something that I think is

1043
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,909
important and needs to be considered and

1044
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:42,520
so as there's opportunities to amend

1045
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:44,559
language or influence equipment

1046
00:46:42,519 --> 00:46:46,000
purchasing I think that that's something

1047
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:47,679
that needs to be you know

1048
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,030
the conversation when that's happening

1049
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:55,319
so thanks for bringing that up

1050
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:59,470
I just have a general comment about

1051
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:02,800
specifying technology in statute it's in

1052
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:05,500
particular but rules at this stage of

1053
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,000
the game we don't really know what's

1054
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,329
most efficient I mean that's what I hear

1055
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,980
from everybody so I just think again

1056
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:14,170
flexibility allow for the market get the

1057
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:17,230
metrics right make sure we know what

1058
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:19,480
we're talking about and then understand

1059
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:21,550
through data where baselines are and

1060
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,530
what improved performance can be and

1061
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:25,720
then measure based on what you're

1062
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:28,180
actually trying to achieve rather than

1063
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:32,889
just randomly throwing out technology

1064
00:47:28,179 --> 00:47:34,839
and and randomly assigning orders to

1065
00:47:32,889 --> 00:47:37,118
things that may actually not totally

1066
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:40,269
apply right alexei miller with new

1067
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:42,099
buildings institute i have a question

1068
00:47:40,269 --> 00:47:45,280
for really any of you that wants to take

1069
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:48,640
it it seems to me that there may be room

1070
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:50,769
in the policy space for labeling

1071
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:52,598
requirements so that the cut the

1072
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:55,059
consumer the final customer at the

1073
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:57,130
point-of-sale can see what is the energy

1074
00:47:55,059 --> 00:47:59,588
or carbon impact of this product i'm

1075
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:01,838
buying pounds of carbon per gram of

1076
00:47:59,588 --> 00:48:03,789
flour founds a carbon per gram of

1077
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:05,799
product and the cartridge you know i'm

1078
00:48:03,789 --> 00:48:07,779
not sure what the metric is but there's

1079
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,140
probably something there that could be

1080
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:12,369
set up as a consistent market

1081
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:14,108
differentiator that once you put a

1082
00:48:12,369 --> 00:48:15,220
number on it the consumer can see that

1083
00:48:14,108 --> 00:48:18,009
can use it as part of their

1084
00:48:15,219 --> 00:48:22,088
decision-making and acts as a pretty

1085
00:48:18,010 --> 00:48:23,950
potentially pretty significant way for

1086
00:48:22,088 --> 00:48:25,960
the growers to t really kind of buckle

1087
00:48:23,949 --> 00:48:29,379
down on this topic so i want to know

1088
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:31,990
what you think the room is or where we

1089
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:35,250
think that might fit in policy as we are

1090
00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:35,250
now and where we might be

1091
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:45,809
I think that's a area of missing in in

1092
00:48:42,659 --> 00:48:47,639
cannabis is is consumer polling customer

1093
00:48:45,809 --> 00:48:50,099
polling customer data what does the

1094
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:52,409
customer want we need to define their

1095
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:54,839
industry by how we produce what the

1096
00:48:52,409 --> 00:48:57,059
customer actually wants if that can lead

1097
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:58,620
to energy policy I think it will I think

1098
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,570
people will choose based on those I

1099
00:48:58,619 --> 00:49:02,239
think people will choose based on THC

1100
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:04,470
level if they don't really want an

1101
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:08,069
enormous THC low if they want a better

1102
00:49:04,469 --> 00:49:11,609
turkeying profile with very low THC that

1103
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:13,800
deep right customer we need to know that

1104
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:15,240
and that is what is a major piece of

1105
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:20,420
what's missing in our industry is we

1106
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:20,419
don't have good consumer polling right

1107
00:49:21,139 --> 00:49:26,099
I'll just jump in real quick and say

1108
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:29,010
that I think that I think it's important

1109
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:31,559
and it's a little ways off because the

1110
00:49:29,010 --> 00:49:34,560
first thing is consumers are interested

1111
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:36,690
in understanding what these cannabis

1112
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:38,309
products are going to do to them and

1113
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:39,570
whether it's the intended effect that

1114
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:41,210
they're looking for and I think that we

1115
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:43,380
don't have a very good way of

1116
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:46,230
communicating that quite yet either

1117
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:48,750
given the variety of strains and

1118
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:51,030
delivery methods and all of that I will

1119
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:55,920
say that one of the best ideas I ever

1120
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:58,230
heard for a label with regards to carbon

1121
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,230
was to simply identify on their jar or

1122
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:03,900
on your cartridge how what is the carbon

1123
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:07,949
equivalent in number of lighters bic

1124
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:09,900
lighters in the flour or product that's

1125
00:50:07,949 --> 00:50:11,789
in your in your cartridge and that that

1126
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:14,550
would be relatable to the consumer

1127
00:50:11,789 --> 00:50:17,610
because as we all know you know pounds

1128
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:19,650
of carbon just doesn't mean a lot unless

1129
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:21,210
you know how to relate to it and most of

1130
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:24,389
those cannabis consumers can relate to a

1131
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:27,240
lighter so a little-known fact about the

1132
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:28,589
origin of our eye is that are one of my

1133
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:31,889
co-founders and I were sitting at a

1134
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:34,350
picnic table having beers in Sisters

1135
00:50:31,889 --> 00:50:36,509
Oregon thinking okay what are we gonna

1136
00:50:34,349 --> 00:50:38,849
do with our careers cannabis things

1137
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:41,340
coming down the line let's create lead

1138
00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:44,639
for wheat that was literally what we

1139
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:46,200
thought about and then we realized you

1140
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:47,068
can't get you can have a label that

1141
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:48,448
means anything until you

1142
00:50:47,068 --> 00:50:50,880
standards and you can have standards

1143
00:50:48,449 --> 00:50:53,519
until you have data and there's none of

1144
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,670
that in this industry so we've been

1145
00:50:53,518 --> 00:50:57,808
focusing on data and and knowing that at

1146
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:59,759
some point when we get all the data

1147
00:50:57,809 --> 00:51:01,289
right that we could have the ability to

1148
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:03,920
do exactly what you're talking about

1149
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:06,959
so we are now running a bill in Oregon

1150
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:09,358
that I hope gets passed and it's got a

1151
00:51:06,958 --> 00:51:11,129
lot of support but it's to essentially

1152
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,739
begin the process of designing and

1153
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:16,289
piloting what a certification system

1154
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:17,999
would look like on energy and water best

1155
00:51:16,289 --> 00:51:19,979
practices and that would consider carbon

1156
00:51:17,998 --> 00:51:22,259
and everything else so that we can have

1157
00:51:19,978 --> 00:51:23,968
the accounting framework all established

1158
00:51:22,259 --> 00:51:25,829
and and work our way toward

1159
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:28,259
understanding what is the unit the

1160
00:51:25,829 --> 00:51:30,449
denominator and and figuring out how we

1161
00:51:28,259 --> 00:51:31,739
express this to the consumer I agree the

1162
00:51:30,449 --> 00:51:33,989
consumer doesn't care about this right

1163
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:36,208
now so we have a little bit of time in

1164
00:51:33,989 --> 00:51:39,420
that regard to get it right but we also

1165
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:43,348
need to get right ASAP to do the good

1166
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:46,889
stuff that we want to do so I hope

1167
00:51:43,349 --> 00:51:48,989
consumers get there but I think it's

1168
00:51:46,889 --> 00:51:51,958
also fraught with some risk that people

1169
00:51:48,989 --> 00:51:56,909
make claims about carbon neutrality or

1170
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:58,618
carbon whatever so for example it I love

1171
00:51:56,909 --> 00:52:00,778
regenerative farmers but some of them

1172
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:03,329
basically just say because I'm sun-grown

1173
00:52:00,778 --> 00:52:05,789
I am carbon neutral and that's not

1174
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:07,410
necessarily true and we all know the

1175
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:09,059
agricultural sector is a major

1176
00:52:07,409 --> 00:52:10,858
contributor to climate change so just

1177
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:13,349
because you're growing plants outside

1178
00:52:10,858 --> 00:52:15,058
doesn't mean your carbon neutral and so

1179
00:52:13,349 --> 00:52:17,599
we just need to have a thoughtful

1180
00:52:15,059 --> 00:52:17,599
dialogue

1181
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:30,039
hi Nadia from dr. greenhouse

1182
00:52:25,449 --> 00:52:34,669
what about packaging packaging is in

1183
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:36,590
sane around cannabis and every time we

1184
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:38,240
have one of those damn glass containers

1185
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:40,010
and we put it in the recycle bin I think

1186
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:42,589
God why is there not a recycle program

1187
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:47,330
like there is for my glass bottle of

1188
00:52:42,590 --> 00:52:59,840
milk is this being addressed in any way

1189
00:52:47,329 --> 00:53:02,869
packaging as of can you guys hear me

1190
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:05,030
alright so as of January 1st we now

1191
00:53:02,869 --> 00:53:07,759
allow packaging take back programs at

1192
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:12,440
dispensaries in Colorado so it used to

1193
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:14,120
be thank you yeah so the regulation that

1194
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:17,690
prohibited these types of programs

1195
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:20,539
before was the no outside product can

1196
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:21,980
enter the facility even it's your own

1197
00:53:20,539 --> 00:53:25,219
product that already left the door

1198
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:26,240
that's really the intent of that is to

1199
00:53:25,219 --> 00:53:28,819
make sure that we're not getting

1200
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:29,929
black-market product sold through you

1201
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:34,460
know legal Leal

1202
00:53:29,929 --> 00:53:36,889
retail outlets the intent there we were

1203
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:39,559
never intending to prohibit recycling

1204
00:53:36,889 --> 00:53:42,460
and so this regulation change is

1205
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:45,590
basically you can now bring back product

1206
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:47,480
packaging and also vape cartridges to

1207
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:49,910
any dispensary that is participating in

1208
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:51,949
a take-back program and they don't have

1209
00:53:49,909 --> 00:53:53,539
to do anything special to it if the

1210
00:53:51,949 --> 00:53:55,849
intent is recycling there can be trace

1211
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:59,829
amounts of product there so that's very

1212
00:53:55,849 --> 00:54:03,619
exciting also traditional a waste

1213
00:53:59,829 --> 00:54:05,179
recyclers can now accept vape cartridges

1214
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:08,210
to be recycled without any kind of

1215
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:08,980
special marijuana handling license so

1216
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:11,980
we're getting there

1217
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:14,420
I'll just do a commercial for Caitlin's

1218
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:17,570
session which is up next with Lindsay

1219
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:19,460
and the state of Colorado is leading in

1220
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:20,960
a number of different ways and the most

1221
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:23,210
mature market and I appreciate the

1222
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,079
leadership very much and packaging is a

1223
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:29,000
huge issue and government regulation is

1224
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:30,170
based a lot of times in stigma and fear

1225
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,550
the plant

1226
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:37,309
just completely unrealistic situations

1227
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:39,650
that are driving silly silly regulations

1228
00:54:37,309 --> 00:54:41,539
and once again we need data that will

1229
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:43,910
take that we can take back to the

1230
00:54:41,539 --> 00:54:46,369
government and say you're creating all

1231
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:50,149
this waste this amount of waste through

1232
00:54:46,369 --> 00:54:51,589
your policies that you've set and is

1233
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,970
that really what you want to be doing

1234
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:54,680
and I should just say for the rest of

1235
00:54:52,969 --> 00:54:57,319
the CEA world you guys are all packaging

1236
00:54:54,679 --> 00:55:01,549
and a lot of plastic as well and we need

1237
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:04,280
to think about this okay if one

1238
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:05,840
statement on the refrigerant stay tuned

1239
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,370
for tomorrow afternoon session there

1240
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:09,230
will be conversation on that one I think

1241
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:11,150
it can answer that question my question

1242
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:13,010
really starts off with the commissioners

1243
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:15,079
slide program and it was mentioned again

1244
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:17,870
this whole idea on the electrification

1245
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:21,139
and renewable energy how do you guys

1246
00:55:17,869 --> 00:55:24,920
view the regulation of using renewable

1247
00:55:21,139 --> 00:55:27,500
energy for facilities that consume so

1248
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:29,780
much where solar cannot possibly placed

1249
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:32,030
on top of a building to cover it so it's

1250
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:35,090
got to be networked in through the

1251
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:36,980
utility what's the anticipated outcome

1252
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:43,700
from a regulation and policy point of

1253
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:47,269
view weighed in here so this is exactly

1254
00:55:43,699 --> 00:55:51,169
was my exact business proposition to my

1255
00:55:47,269 --> 00:55:53,300
old company was let's build acres and

1256
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:58,550
acres of solar and sell it to the

1257
00:55:53,300 --> 00:56:01,700
cannabis growers and we built a green

1258
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:03,830
tariff program so that your utility

1259
00:56:01,699 --> 00:56:05,419
could let you opt into the program and

1260
00:56:03,829 --> 00:56:10,730
you'd pay a couple cents more a kilowatt

1261
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:13,130
hour and so it's I mean it's feasible

1262
00:56:10,730 --> 00:56:16,849
states can do this it's not impossible

1263
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:19,579
and then you're operating on a hundred

1264
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:21,559
percent renewables it's kind of nice new

1265
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:23,960
renewables at that because that's one of

1266
00:56:21,559 --> 00:56:30,710
the keys right is not just recycling

1267
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:32,179
credits or recs but there is concern I

1268
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:34,130
think the biggest concern quite honestly

1269
00:56:32,179 --> 00:56:39,199
came from that that I've heard comes

1270
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:40,970
from grid operators who are upgrading

1271
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:43,289
both distribution systems and

1272
00:56:40,969 --> 00:56:47,009
transmission systems to handle

1273
00:56:43,289 --> 00:56:50,608
these loads and these interconnection

1274
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:53,760
points for generation and they may or

1275
00:56:50,608 --> 00:56:57,630
may not be needed for the long term and

1276
00:56:53,760 --> 00:57:00,000
who pays those costs of infrastructure

1277
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:02,789
upgrade and do they turn into stranded

1278
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,829
assets over time or are they actually

1279
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:06,480
used for the 40 year lifespan that

1280
00:57:04,829 --> 00:57:07,859
they're projected to have those were

1281
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:11,159
some of the complicated issues that we

1282
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:13,650
got into with with this conversation

1283
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:15,449
it didn't get resolved they still liked

1284
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:19,680
data centers better than cannabis grow

1285
00:57:15,449 --> 00:57:21,179
operations I think from a policy

1286
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:23,399
perspective if you're talking about

1287
00:57:21,179 --> 00:57:27,210
utility scale renewables or on-site

1288
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:29,730
generation there needs to be a emphasis

1289
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:32,818
on efficiency being coupled with that

1290
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:34,980
renewable so that you're not building

1291
00:57:32,818 --> 00:57:38,338
for an increased capacity that you could

1292
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:39,599
be right sizing that equipment and doing

1293
00:57:38,338 --> 00:57:42,440
efficiency first and thinking about

1294
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:46,559
renewables as a packaged policy

1295
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:49,579
mechanism to decrease carbon and energy

1296
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:54,480
waste from these types of facilities

1297
00:57:49,579 --> 00:57:56,010
yeah I'll add working in a state I have

1298
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,380
a lot of work in Massachusetts in the

1299
00:57:56,010 --> 00:58:00,809
kilowatt hour for for electricity is

1300
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:03,030
fairly high we don't have a huge

1301
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:05,220
renewable opportunity from from our

1302
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:09,750
utilities there it's growing it's coming

1303
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:12,480
but it's not there yet and so despite

1304
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:14,130
the sort of irony of encouraging on-site

1305
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:17,309
power generation through through fossil

1306
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:18,720
fuel to gasps specifically many of the

1307
00:58:17,309 --> 00:58:21,030
choices that we have today are higher

1308
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:22,409
efficiency in terms of production of the

1309
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:24,720
equipment that's available to do on-site

1310
00:58:22,409 --> 00:58:26,608
is higher efficiency than the gas-fired

1311
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:29,058
electrical plants that are operating a

1312
00:58:26,608 --> 00:58:31,230
much lower efficiency so while I would

1313
00:58:29,059 --> 00:58:32,519
argue in general that we should be

1314
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:35,460
buying our you know we should be doing

1315
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:38,219
electrical facilities fired by by

1316
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:39,449
renewable resources in the state of mass

1317
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:41,669
we don't have that we don't have

1318
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:44,939
renewable resources providing us enough

1319
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:46,680
energy needed so we do install gas-fired

1320
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:48,720
systems that are that are converting gas

1321
00:58:46,679 --> 00:58:50,569
to electricity on-site at a much higher

1322
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:53,329
efficiency rate

1323
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:54,890
then it's available I fully understand

1324
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:56,449
that those systems have a certain

1325
00:58:54,889 --> 00:58:58,009
lifespan just like the you know hot

1326
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:59,539
water heater in my house it's only in

1327
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:02,030
the last eight years I got to replace it

1328
00:58:59,539 --> 00:59:03,980
so we will be replacing those alike

1329
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:06,440
those gas-fired systems with electric at

1330
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:07,969
a certain point when we have when went

1331
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:11,119
right when the industry matches when

1332
00:59:07,969 --> 00:59:16,279
there is available utilities provided at

1333
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:19,489
a at a with renewable sources hi Doug

1334
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:22,730
with evergreen as I see States consider

1335
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:26,000
bringing on cannabis or horticulture

1336
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:27,650
lighting in general it really surprised

1337
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,150
me that the state got involved with the

1338
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:33,769
law versus a code we're all used to

1339
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:35,510
lighting power densities like in Oregon

1340
00:59:33,769 --> 00:59:38,960
new construction you have to meet a

1341
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:42,140
watts per square foot and AG right now

1342
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:44,059
is exempt but usually when something it

1343
00:59:42,139 --> 00:59:45,589
catches up like manufacturing used to be

1344
00:59:44,059 --> 00:59:50,119
exempt and now there's an LPD

1345
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:52,760
so as States bring this on why wouldn't

1346
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:56,269
they consider the energy codes the state

1347
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:59,660
energy codes versus law and part of it

1348
00:59:56,269 --> 01:00:00,949
is the license to enforce that I just

1349
00:59:59,659 --> 01:00:04,489
wanted to get your opinion on it

1350
01:00:00,949 --> 01:00:07,239
in and in the enforcement one one other

1351
01:00:04,489 --> 01:00:14,149
thing the utility incentive programs

1352
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:16,099
help enforce the codes well I would just

1353
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:18,110
say California did think about codes

1354
01:00:16,099 --> 01:00:21,319
when they created the cannabis law in

1355
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:26,870
that they established targets for when

1356
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:29,840
they knew when they knew that certain

1357
01:00:26,869 --> 01:00:34,059
things would be required based on I

1358
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:36,590
think based on the third year of the

1359
01:00:34,059 --> 01:00:37,759
regulated market existing knowing that

1360
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:39,410
they would need to go through a three

1361
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:42,050
year code cyclers I think they've

1362
01:00:39,409 --> 01:00:43,609
thought about it but I don't know I

1363
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:46,430
think we'll hear more tonight from Kyle

1364
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:48,220
booth and Tao Chow from California

1365
01:00:46,429 --> 01:00:50,480
Energy Commission is here as well

1366
01:00:48,219 --> 01:00:51,219
obviously states should be thinking

1367
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,070
about this

1368
01:00:51,219 --> 01:00:55,779
it's uh it's just crazy it's like

1369
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:57,480
they're blowing up a balloon and knowing

1370
01:00:55,780 --> 01:01:01,269
that it's gonna pop and then and then

1371
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:03,670
waiting for it to pop I think one thing

1372
01:01:01,269 --> 01:01:05,858
also to take into consideration is right

1373
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:09,070
now there is no code for agricultural

1374
01:01:05,858 --> 01:01:11,319
buildings so until that happens does it

1375
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:14,200
make sense to rely on the code which is

1376
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:16,809
meant for human occupants versus plants

1377
01:01:14,199 --> 01:01:18,879
then you're being forced you know

1378
01:01:16,809 --> 01:01:20,650
certain air changes per hour that maybe

1379
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,460
don't make sense for a cannabis facility

1380
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:26,710
so I think until there's some sort of

1381
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:28,780
agriculturally focused code I don't know

1382
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:32,440
how you kind of deal with that in this

1383
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:35,410
situation so that's part of my world is

1384
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:38,440
is dealing with code officials who only

1385
01:01:35,409 --> 01:01:40,750
enforce codes for in for buildings for

1386
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:43,809
people and they have no idea how to

1387
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:46,150
enforce codes in buildings for in

1388
01:01:43,809 --> 01:01:49,029
Billings for plants one example is that

1389
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:50,139
is that greenhouses are classified in

1390
01:01:49,030 --> 01:01:52,150
the building code in the International

1391
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:54,190
Building Code is under the U for utility

1392
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:55,630
is the definition of a greenhouse so if

1393
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:57,970
you look up in a building code what

1394
01:01:55,630 --> 01:02:00,990
you're building so this building is you

1395
01:01:57,969 --> 01:02:04,239
know what its occupancy type is I

1396
01:02:00,989 --> 01:02:06,519
started out designing indoor cultivation

1397
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:08,769
facilities under the definition of U for

1398
01:02:06,519 --> 01:02:11,800
utility and I realized that's not

1399
01:02:08,769 --> 01:02:13,420
correct it's F - one is factory modern

1400
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:16,269
modern hazard is the correct definition

1401
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:18,159
and that brings with it energy

1402
01:02:16,269 --> 01:02:20,469
efficiency requirements that are that

1403
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:22,389
are required for factory not for a for a

1404
01:02:20,469 --> 01:02:24,519
utility billing so a utility building is

1405
01:02:22,389 --> 01:02:27,069
yeah is literally a greenhouse that

1406
01:02:24,519 --> 01:02:28,088
doesn't you know but it's also the shed

1407
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:31,000
that you know the state highway

1408
01:02:28,088 --> 01:02:32,019
department stores salt in right that's a

1409
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:35,079
cute ility building

1410
01:02:32,019 --> 01:02:37,659
you don't need insulation that right but

1411
01:02:35,079 --> 01:02:39,909
in a factory with modern hazard you need

1412
01:02:37,659 --> 01:02:42,190
to take certain precautions so using the

1413
01:02:39,909 --> 01:02:43,989
code to define how we achieve lighting

1414
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:47,050
power density using the code to define

1415
01:02:43,989 --> 01:02:50,439
how we achieve energy efficiency is is

1416
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:52,810
an effective way to use the code I don't

1417
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:54,010
want to venture beyond my professional

1418
01:02:52,809 --> 01:02:55,900
knowledge to say whether that should be

1419
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:57,130
in a policy right should that be at the

1420
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:59,010
state law should there be written in

1421
01:02:57,130 --> 01:03:02,289
state law I see in Illinois some

1422
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:03,400
difficulties there with specifying mini

1423
01:03:02,289 --> 01:03:05,739
splits

1424
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:13,750
in in the cut-in in the law as opposed

1425
01:03:05,739 --> 01:03:15,939
to using the code to define that III I

1426
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:19,630
think that there might be a little bit

1427
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:22,240
of motivational thought that might be

1428
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:26,349
helpful here I think one of the things

1429
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:30,000
that we tend to forget about is that

1430
01:03:26,349 --> 01:03:34,960
this process is inherently political and

1431
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:38,349
the reason that a lot of the situations

1432
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:42,130
that we find ourselves in exist is that

1433
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:45,299
the politicians have discovered that

1434
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:49,650
cannabis control and cannabis regulation

1435
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:51,880
is a really great way to fire up

1436
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:55,240
supporters on both sides of the issue

1437
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:57,880
together and when you do that what you

1438
01:03:55,239 --> 01:04:00,509
do is you promise each side everything

1439
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:03,400
that they want and then you harvest

1440
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:06,610
donations from those sides from both

1441
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:08,889
sides at the same time in order to

1442
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:13,120
further your political ambitions on

1443
01:04:08,889 --> 01:04:15,609
other unrelated items and so I caution

1444
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:18,819
us to think about all of these codes and

1445
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:21,730
and especially the prescriptive things

1446
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:24,750
that we're seeing come up I think the

1447
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:27,699
cost of compliance with these things

1448
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:30,670
causes a lot of the the growers that

1449
01:04:27,699 --> 01:04:33,879
might not be fairly large to essentially

1450
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:35,740
not be able to comply and I don't know

1451
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:37,900
what the carbon footprint of a thousand

1452
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:40,649
lawyers is but I'm sure that we're

1453
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,650
finding at it

1454
01:04:41,139 --> 01:04:47,349
I'm good while people are thinking about

1455
01:04:45,489 --> 01:04:49,629
that I just would encourage everybody

1456
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:54,250
that Brian started this off with how

1457
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:56,920
important that defining canopy is and we

1458
01:04:54,250 --> 01:05:00,519
all not not just cannabis like we all

1459
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:03,869
CEA folks should spend some energy in

1460
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:06,820
that it's critically important and

1461
01:05:03,869 --> 01:05:10,299
regulators and policy experts who are

1462
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:12,880
wanting to push forward on the outcome

1463
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:13,480
that we will have efficiency and low

1464
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,840
carbon

1465
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:18,639
cultivation needs to weigh in on that as

1466
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:20,680
well right we need to be engaged on this

1467
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:22,089
issue because basically there's

1468
01:05:20,679 --> 01:05:23,619
loopholes going on right now and it's

1469
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:25,570
all up to interpretation and we know

1470
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:28,690
that there are people in Massachusetts

1471
01:05:25,570 --> 01:05:32,380
in Illinois that are defining as broadly

1472
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:35,079
as possible the room area squeezing all

1473
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:37,000
the plants into one corner and still

1474
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:39,340
using HPS lighting and because the

1475
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,539
denominator is the full room not where

1476
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:42,760
the plants are and not where the

1477
01:05:40,539 --> 01:05:44,559
lighting is obviously they're still

1478
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:46,690
meeting their targets but they didn't

1479
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:48,070
use a more efficient light source and

1480
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:51,820
they're not in fact they might have

1481
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:53,590
increased the HVAC load in the room and

1482
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:56,289
we just don't know but we need to study

1483
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:57,940
that kind of loophole and close it right

1484
01:05:56,289 --> 01:05:59,619
different again what we're really

1485
01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:03,519
promoting is energy efficiency on the

1486
01:05:59,619 --> 01:06:06,039
low carbon high yes

1487
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:07,869
so one of the things I wonder about us

1488
01:06:06,039 --> 01:06:10,360
you know we're talking about how much

1489
01:06:07,869 --> 01:06:12,159
energy is going to be used there's

1490
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:14,380
market reports out there there's some

1491
01:06:12,159 --> 01:06:16,690
that show you know wide range of

1492
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:18,880
different types of data as far as saying

1493
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:21,460
it's gonna be this much versus this much

1494
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:22,750
I wonder and you know maybe Molly you're

1495
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:25,990
the best person to answer this question

1496
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:28,480
but the other utilities in the room how

1497
01:06:25,989 --> 01:06:31,239
much of the utilities going in and like

1498
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,820
collecting your own data specifically on

1499
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:36,449
cannabis and cea and doing a

1500
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:38,360
forward-looking like either ROI or

1501
01:06:36,449 --> 01:06:40,789
forward-looking analysis

1502
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:42,110
to say this is how many more plants

1503
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:44,000
we're going to have to build in the

1504
01:06:42,110 --> 01:06:46,039
future to meet this demand this is how

1505
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,809
much we're going to have to increase our

1506
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:50,329
infrastructure and what's the payback on

1507
01:06:47,809 --> 01:06:52,519
that versus you know either offering

1508
01:06:50,329 --> 01:06:54,949
incentives now or starting to get

1509
01:06:52,519 --> 01:06:58,369
involved in shaping this policy is that

1510
01:06:54,949 --> 01:07:00,379
something that's being looked at I can

1511
01:06:58,369 --> 01:07:02,779
speak on behalf of some utilities in the

1512
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:04,550
Midwest however I'm not a utility I

1513
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:06,170
would say that it wasn't something that

1514
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:09,890
was proactively being thought about

1515
01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:12,590
before legislation occurred I also think

1516
01:07:09,889 --> 01:07:15,819
in Illinois some utilities are not

1517
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:17,960
worried about the potential energy

1518
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:19,850
additional energy load that's coming

1519
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:22,820
from cannabis facilities in their

1520
01:07:19,849 --> 01:07:26,809
territory I don't know if that is an

1521
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:28,850
incorrect or correct assumption based on

1522
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:31,340
kind of lack of data maybe they

1523
01:07:28,849 --> 01:07:34,039
shouldn't be worried I don't know but I

1524
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:36,200
would say that a lot of utilities don't

1525
01:07:34,039 --> 01:07:39,170
really understand yet

1526
01:07:36,199 --> 01:07:41,210
what the energy load profile of a

1527
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:44,210
cannabis facility looks like let alone

1528
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:45,980
what the average energy use is even

1529
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:47,809
though some of these customers have have

1530
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:48,710
existed in their territory for a little

1531
01:07:47,809 --> 01:07:52,190
while

1532
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:56,599
they're still just so unfamiliar so it's

1533
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:59,030
not really happening yet just just

1534
01:07:56,599 --> 01:08:01,429
piling on because I used to be an energy

1535
01:07:59,030 --> 01:08:05,120
regulator for the state of California

1536
01:08:01,429 --> 01:08:07,039
and the you know utilities jump on both

1537
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:10,549
sides of this issue sometimes they're

1538
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:12,079
interested in new build because there's

1539
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:14,300
a rate of return attached to that and

1540
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:18,109
sometimes they're really aware of the

1541
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:20,029
rate payer cost of that new bill then

1542
01:08:18,109 --> 01:08:22,510
they don't want to so I've found at

1543
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:26,269
least that generation because it can

1544
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:29,510
feed load growth anywhere for the most

1545
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:32,720
part is an easier thing for utilities to

1546
01:08:29,510 --> 01:08:35,300
justify whereas local area upgrades

1547
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:37,250
network upgrades are harder for them to

1548
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:39,100
justify because it's uncertain whether

1549
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:42,170
that load growth is going to stay

1550
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:44,380
certain for a longer period of time two

1551
01:08:42,170 --> 01:08:44,380
cents

1552
01:08:45,109 --> 01:08:50,809
so I think we have just a few like 30

1553
01:08:48,048 --> 01:08:55,458
seconds left anything that the panel

1554
01:08:50,809 --> 01:08:57,079
wants to close with I'll just throw

1555
01:08:55,458 --> 01:08:58,849
something out there that I know there's

1556
01:08:57,078 --> 01:09:02,298
a state right now in the Midwest that is

1557
01:08:58,849 --> 01:09:04,338
currently working on a expanded medical

1558
01:09:02,298 --> 01:09:08,798
bill and a recreational bill its

1559
01:09:04,338 --> 01:09:11,599
Minnesota and so if anybody has any

1560
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:14,028
recommendations or how we can be better

1561
01:09:11,599 --> 01:09:16,159
taking some of these lessons learned and

1562
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:18,409
implementing it in a new state without

1563
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:21,408
kind of stifling the industry or

1564
01:09:18,408 --> 01:09:23,288
creating unintended consequences I am

1565
01:09:21,408 --> 01:09:25,248
all ears

1566
01:09:23,288 --> 01:09:30,588
great thank you all for your

1567
01:09:25,248 --> 01:09:32,059
participation that there were no there

1568
01:09:30,588 --> 01:09:34,158
was no response to the slides on

1569
01:09:32,059 --> 01:09:36,829
lighting power density maybe I was just

1570
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:39,078
completely off and it just didn't work

1571
01:09:36,828 --> 01:09:42,649
but it's curious whether anybody had any

1572
01:09:39,078 --> 01:09:49,639
responses to that I guess I was

1573
01:09:42,649 --> 01:09:50,838
completely off great so thanks so much

1574
01:09:49,639 --> 01:09:53,389
for your participation

1575
01:09:50,838 --> 01:09:55,819
I am it's much more engaging that way

1576
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:57,859
I'm gonna confer with the panel and the

1577
01:09:55,819 --> 01:09:59,988
fabulous prize is a drink or a mocktail

1578
01:09:57,859 --> 01:10:02,389
or whatever your poison is at the end of

1579
01:09:59,988 --> 01:10:04,158
the day so we'll figure out who had the

1580
01:10:02,389 --> 01:10:05,090
best question and I'll come find you and

1581
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:06,289
buy you a drink

1582
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:10,930
so thanks

1583
01:10:06,289 --> 01:10:10,930
[Applause]
