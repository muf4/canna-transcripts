1
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:10,649
I'm mr. sole creator of Cinderella 99

2
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:13,439
and the founder of Brothers Grimm seeds

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,719
Rick we were talking about basically the

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:18,269
Rosetta Stone and how you at first

5
00:00:15,718 --> 00:00:19,469
achieved getting it and it kind of would

6
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:21,448
you like to talk more about that story

7
00:00:19,469 --> 00:00:23,698
it's yeah I think it's a good one

8
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:28,580
because when people see that it's

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:30,868
popular now it's been in the news and

10
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:33,659
highly-rated like that you want to know

11
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:35,820
well more about it right and another

12
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,069
interesting wrinkle to the whole story

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,890
was back when Brothers Grimm first

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,509
started in the late 90s around 2000 I

15
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,850
think it was I released a rosetta stone

16
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:47,339
but it was a different formula but I

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,890
loved the name so much and I found the

18
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,390
new combination that I put together this

19
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,239
time to be something that I thought

20
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,829
would eclipse the old version and people

21
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,718
would just forget about that one and say

22
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:59,340
or maybe never have heard of it you know

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,020
because it's been such a long time well

24
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,340
the old version did make it into the big

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,469
book of buds and for a lot of

26
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,600
connoisseurs in the early ages that was

27
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:09,239
our biblical standpoint for genetics I

28
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:11,368
mean it's it definitely turned some

29
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:13,379
heads well that was one of the sisters

30
00:01:11,368 --> 00:01:16,170
that came from the bud of Jack Herer

31
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:19,079
from Amsterdam where Princess and genius

32
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,140
came from and there was a third female

33
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:26,250
that I called cafe girl and she had a

34
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,670
ginger ale flavor and so that rosetta

35
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,530
stone original combination had that type

36
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,659
of a profile and people liked it

37
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,420
apparently more than I ever realized and

38
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,930
so when I created the new version of

39
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:45,090
rosetta stone I liked this I repeatedly

40
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:48,110
have the jack harries original cut that

41
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,700
was presented to him of the Jack Herer

42
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:53,438
strain from sin sea seed bank and ben

43
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,109
dronkers supposedly gave this cut to

44
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:58,898
to Jack Herer himself so I love that

45
00:01:56,109 --> 00:02:02,459
female and crusted to my best Cinderella

46
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:05,560
99 reversed and so we have a feminized

47
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:07,780
rosetta stone now it also we also do it

48
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,920
in the regular but that's how that came

49
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:14,110
about and it's a amazing improvement

50
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,059
upon the parents you know I really like

51
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,450
to think that whenever I put a seed line

52
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,640
out if something that isn't just the

53
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:24,189
same as one of the parents it has to be

54
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:26,289
an improvement has to have some reason

55
00:02:24,189 --> 00:02:29,439
for being and so in the case of rosetta

56
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:33,009
stone I have if you could kind of put it

57
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:36,340
in a nutshell to say it's Jack Herer

58
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:40,509
flavor and high but in a much bigger

59
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:42,909
yielding faster flowering more stable if

60
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:44,530
you will in other words more uniform

61
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:46,419
plants come out of every pack of seeds

62
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:50,650
than you would ever expect from a real

63
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:54,369
the old school Jack Jack Arab so that's

64
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:56,950
what I've been doing lately and well I

65
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,480
did recently grow the Cindy 99 and I was

66
00:02:56,949 --> 00:03:00,189
very impressed people are still coming

67
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,289
back to me all the time of course and I

68
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:04,659
never will tire of hearing the stories

69
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:06,699
old and new of people who say you know

70
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:10,060
I'd always heard about Cinderella 99 now

71
00:03:06,699 --> 00:03:12,129
it's available again as a you know is it

72
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,539
the same and how did you do it and you

73
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:15,489
know they have to answer all those kinds

74
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:18,548
of questions and explain to people and

75
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:20,590
you and I have talked about how by still

76
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:23,170
having the original clone of Princess

77
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,639
that that's the mother that creates the

78
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,858
seeds and we were talking earlier about

79
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,290
when you create a seed line that really

80
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:31,870
works you should maintain that same

81
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:35,318
mother and father and use them over and

82
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,599
over as like a formula to create that

83
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:38,888
seed or a recipe that a chef would use

84
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,358
or something and some people get a

85
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:42,310
little confused with breeding and they

86
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:43,780
think that well those seeds were great

87
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,879
you know and I want more of them and

88
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,159
maybe I should cross a brother or sister

89
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:49,689
from those seeds but that's not the same

90
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,549
thing as going back in breeding those

91
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:55,770
seeds from the original parents so

92
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:59,290
what I did to recreate Cinderella 99 is

93
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:01,060
having that original female not having

94
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:03,969
the original male but having the seed

95
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,370
pact that the original male came from

96
00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:08,680
and then regrowing them and finding a

97
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:10,870
new male that would be a brother of the

98
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,210
original one it's not a very big

99
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,770
difference and in the end I feel that

100
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,239
the Cinderella ninety-nine today just

101
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,549
stands up every bit as good as the old

102
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,969
one did because they're virtually

103
00:04:18,548 --> 00:04:23,789
identical you know so I love to get that

104
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,440
feedback from people that they will say

105
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,240
wow I didn't think that after all this

106
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:30,370
time it would be possible to recreate a

107
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,439
seed line and you know done right yeah

108
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,240
it's very possible so we've seen that

109
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,519
around the industry too especially with

110
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,129
a lot of reputable reputable breeders

111
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:41,589
with their older genetics not producing

112
00:04:39,129 --> 00:04:45,040
the same quality for different phenols

113
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:46,779
are actually coming out to 30 40 all

114
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,970
kinds of different numbers that have

115
00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:51,009
just destabilized not necessarily their

116
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:53,470
brand but definitely that genome the

117
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:55,899
uniformity of the plants you're getting

118
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:58,690
out of a pack of seeds is influenced a

119
00:04:55,899 --> 00:05:01,299
lot by the variability on both parents

120
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:04,600
sides you know and then it just makes

121
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,189
more of a lottery ticket you know out of

122
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,620
each seed that you're getting because

123
00:05:06,189 --> 00:05:12,639
all those genetic possibilities coming

124
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:16,329
together creates a variability but by

125
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,279
having parents that are the same as well

126
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:20,800
as not having a lot of variability in

127
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:23,259
their own gene backgrounds you know

128
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,509
you're going to really ensure that

129
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:28,539
you're gonna get the same thing every

130
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:29,889
time reliably right which might not be

131
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:31,060
that important to some people because

132
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:32,620
there are a lot of people who believe

133
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,500
like oh I like to buy you know a bunch

134
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,629
of seeds and have a thino hunch and look

135
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,129
for something special out of that group

136
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:40,990
well now nothing wrong with that if

137
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:43,029
that's your goal but many people are

138
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,470
really serious minded professionals

139
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:46,209
coming into this and saying well I want

140
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,710
to grow a crop and I don't want to have

141
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:48,209
to try

142
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:51,329
you know do a lot of guesswork or

143
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:53,339
testing before I find the plant that I'm

144
00:05:51,329 --> 00:05:56,879
going to reproduce and clone and make

145
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:58,409
for production so they would like to be

146
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:00,659
able to say isn't there a reputable

147
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,669
place where I could buy packs of seeds

148
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,439
where they're going to perform as

149
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:04,918
advertised on the description on the

150
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,509
pack

151
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:08,879
you know and I can count on you know

152
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:11,310
nearly all the females being the exact

153
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,478
same thing and that's what I try to do

154
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,759
you know that's what I have on the

155
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:18,089
market and that's why my menu consists

156
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:20,280
of maybe what eight strains is twelve if

157
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:21,899
you count the feminized versions of the

158
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,779
regulars or something like that because

159
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:27,598
I feel keeping control over a smaller

160
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:30,659
menu of strains is a lot smarter than

161
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:33,329
trying to keep up with fads and whatever

162
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,870
is popular now and chasing that sort of

163
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:39,240
thing I have heard of us they call it

164
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:42,209
the Hedgehog effect right or the

165
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,550
Hedgehog principle that Hedgehog has

166
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:46,769
only like one defense but it's a perfect

167
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,288
defense and so when you have that one

168
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:50,728
thing that you do really well

169
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:52,860
concentrate on that specialize in that

170
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:54,750
so well I like the way that you do that

171
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,819
because ultimately with that kind of

172
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,348
destabilization we see a lot of limits

173
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:00,649
hitting the market and really that's

174
00:06:58,348 --> 00:07:03,269
almost a lazy man's breed and in a sense

175
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:05,579
you'll get great things out of it and

176
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:07,978
it's not always that way but if that's

177
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:09,569
your business then ultimately if you're

178
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:12,000
a one-and-done there's no real art to

179
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:14,579
that the real artistry in breeder ships

180
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,649
comes to the long-term stabilization and

181
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:18,959
the recreation of your genetic to make

182
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:20,388
it a timeless genetic and that's what we

183
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,198
see with you that I've really enjoyed

184
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:24,538
when we've cracked the Cindy

185
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,348
ninety-nines I saw three different fie

186
00:07:24,538 --> 00:07:31,439
nose out of 20 seats and that's what you

187
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:34,288
expect out of a regular seed pack back

188
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,939
in 1995 1998

189
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:37,860
I mean these are things we don't see in

190
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:39,719
today's market and the other thing

191
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,538
that's important about when you do have

192
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,030
slight variations in the Cinderella 99s

193
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:47,430
that it's really not anything that's a

194
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:49,168
major trait it's usually like awesome

195
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,810
color like this one got a little more

196
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:53,219
purple and this one didn't you know big

197
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,259
deal can you tell the difference when

198
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,350
you smoke it no you know so I'm

199
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,259
pragmatic

200
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:01,510
yes and I would say like that the things

201
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:04,079
that are most important the potency the

202
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:06,490
resin production you know the flavor

203
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,769
yield all those things should be a

204
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,360
really tight grouping right but then if

205
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:12,969
there's like okay this one had a little

206
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,639
more color of this or color who cares I

207
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,980
had a guy write me this is a funny story

208
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,169
I had an email from a guy who said I

209
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,000
really question whether these Cinderella

210
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:25,870
99 seeds that I got from this

211
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,550
distributor are real because he's still

212
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,019
in veg mind you you know he hasn't even

213
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,360
flowered the plants and already he's

214
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:34,720
convinced this can't be real Cinderella

215
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,180
99 why because the leaf serrations on

216
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,830
the edges of the leaves didn't look the

217
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:40,719
way he remembered them from the last

218
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:42,520
time which was like over 10 years ago or

219
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,800
something like you know hey your memory

220
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,829
is probably fault even even if you had a

221
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:50,589
photograph of it nobody breeds for leaf

222
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,570
serration uniformity I mean that might

223
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,580
vary all over the place in my whole

224
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,620
genetic traits but it's not necessarily

225
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,350
your goal inbreeding for that trait it

226
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,779
doesn't prove you know that it's one

227
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:03,850
thing or another when the breeder has

228
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:07,709
concentrated on creating finished

229
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:12,430
flowers of a certain quality

230
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:14,320
this is Kanak on so the that was

231
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:17,919
actually pretty cool to have him pop in

232
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,780
like that and drop a little reality

233
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,779
reality-tv effect on the whole interview

234
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:26,389
but yeah what was I saying

235
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:28,220
your that just maybe we were we were

236
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:30,679
basically talking about the phenotype

237
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,840
and how important it is that there's not

238
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,279
much variance because when I did say

239
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,550
that I had the three different fee knows

240
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:39,829
I had a teen females now mine doing what

241
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:41,539
slight differences were those three fee

242
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:43,310
knows it's like one was a little more

243
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,949
chunky and one was a little more

244
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:47,209
triangular with the bud formation and to

245
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:49,009
be honest they could have sat in the

246
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:51,680
same bag they had a very similar odor

247
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:53,779
and they were very very subtle and I

248
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,489
mean like single percentage changes on

249
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:57,049
the Rita this is what I'm trying to say

250
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,340
that was what my point was earlier when

251
00:09:57,049 --> 00:10:01,279
I lost track of what I was talking about

252
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:04,190
but the really important characteristics

253
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,449
stay true throughout all the females you

254
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,360
get from a pack of seeds and that's

255
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:10,220
that's what I take pride in and I try to

256
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,720
do in all of my strains is give people

257
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:14,210
something that where you buy the pack

258
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,940
the seeds it's a uniform result that

259
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,570
it's as advertised on the description on

260
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,060
the pack

261
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:27,620
you know and there's and there's a

262
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:30,139
there's a place for that really

263
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:32,120
translating the old ways to the new days

264
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:33,919
and that's really a big important thing

265
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,450
that we don't have going forward we've

266
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,549
got a lot of people getting into this

267
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,680
game without we'll call it an under

268
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:42,199
education of what they're truly dealing

269
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,120
with they don't even have an association

270
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,660
to plants as people some of these these

271
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,820
folks and that is really the biggest

272
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:52,009
kind of connection to genetics that I

273
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,690
found when I can sit here and say these

274
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:55,789
two parents have kids well yes these

275
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,800
kids all look alike but if the mother

276
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:59,209
goes and has a child with somebody else

277
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:01,250
that kid may look completely different

278
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,990
and that goes back to what Rick was

279
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,580
saying about making sure that the

280
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,740
crossbreeding goes back to the original

281
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,930
parents because with that the

282
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,299
consistency of the genetic can stay more

283
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:14,029
true over time and to be totally direct

284
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:16,969
it's one of the only real safe lines in

285
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:19,159
this industry that is of a more

286
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,680
naturalized methodology to get that

287
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:23,449
consistency and to be totally direct the

288
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,849
more natural we can remain in this the

289
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,710
more healthy it remains as well so I

290
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,230
have a great respect for the way that

291
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,280
Rick does his genetics

292
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,810
one of the reasons I'm a long time

293
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:33,809
runner-up I appreciate that

294
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:44,110
I'm really looking for terpenes and so a

295
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:45,730
lot of my terpene inductions have been

296
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,350
kind of moving into the higher THC

297
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,300
strains one of the things that you'll

298
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,490
see in a lot of the 30% plus strains is

299
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:53,589
yes they're 30-plus they'll knock you on

300
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,620
the floor whatever but they're gonna

301
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:58,300
have a very waxy overtone in most of

302
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,029
these strains and it's very rare to get

303
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:03,069
one over 30 with strong terms and so

304
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:04,720
that's kind of something that we've been

305
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:06,790
working on breeding in and it's been a

306
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,700
project of mine and to be honest I'm not

307
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:12,129
sure the limitations yet so it's it's

308
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,500
been an exciting adventure that's a you

309
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:16,840
know very ambitious and bold thing to be

310
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:20,019
diving into so kudos to you to be even

311
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:22,210
trying that and I think that just

312
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:25,090
touching back on I don't want to make

313
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:27,190
this all about you know mr. soul and his

314
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,379
strains or you know the best thing or

315
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:31,900
anything like that because in fact

316
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:35,080
what's happening currently with this

317
00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:38,259
wave of lots of variety and different

318
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,629
hybrids and so on is that it exposes all

319
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:43,419
the possibilities there are in cannabis

320
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:45,340
and maybe the person who created the

321
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:46,990
strain if he's humble and honest with

322
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,840
himself says you know hey I'm no great

323
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:51,279
breeder but I lucked into something you

324
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,500
know I lucked into something at the

325
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,629
beginning but then inspired me to learn

326
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,000
more and work harder over the next few

327
00:12:55,629 --> 00:12:59,860
years and so on but the benefit to the

328
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,809
public that's out there that's now

329
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,490
coming into this and saying well hey I

330
00:13:01,809 --> 00:13:07,739
have a choice I can go with like the

331
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:10,870
gentleman said earlier agricultural

332
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,000
standardized kind of mentality for

333
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:15,340
buying seeds where you get what is

334
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,289
advertised and expect to get you know

335
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:19,980
uniformity and the seeds that you grow

336
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:23,139
and so on and then there's this other

337
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,180
opportunity or a possibility that's out

338
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:27,279
there for people to say hey I could also

339
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:29,079
go for the grab bag you know like hit

340
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,139
who knows what I'm going to get and it

341
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,850
might be wonderful and I see a lot of

342
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:36,699
strange stuff come up and very little

343
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,860
who really said it makes me sad sit back

344
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,089
and take notice and say alright that's

345
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,308
something I

346
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:44,290
know more about but people know in the

347
00:13:42,308 --> 00:13:47,558
past year so I've gotten interested in

348
00:13:44,289 --> 00:13:49,899
the Mack from Kappa later and I really

349
00:13:47,558 --> 00:13:52,659
think that that's in all my 30-some

350
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:55,539
years or whatever in this business it

351
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:57,308
stands out in a way that I sit up and

352
00:13:55,539 --> 00:14:04,509
take notice and there's not many that do

353
00:13:57,308 --> 00:14:06,490
that so if it really yeah I couldn't

354
00:14:04,509 --> 00:14:09,519
yeah look why good question that's the

355
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:12,009
great following the the terpenes the

356
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:17,379
aromas from it are really unique and

357
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:19,808
different and very to me desirable and

358
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:21,819
there are strains like Gorilla Glue that

359
00:14:19,808 --> 00:14:24,129
you know you'll never forget Gorilla

360
00:14:21,818 --> 00:14:28,509
Glue after you smell it once and it's a

361
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:30,610
really amazing heavy-hitting I call it a

362
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:32,050
heavy strain it makes me sleepy it

363
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:36,430
knocks me out it's like a couch lock

364
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:38,229
kind of smoke Josey Wales and the the

365
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:41,349
group from Gigi they called himself Gigi

366
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:43,659
strange now right that's a heavy strain

367
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,519
but the aroma to me is so gassy and

368
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:48,698
heavy that I wouldn't want to have that

369
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,350
all the time you know and and that's the

370
00:14:48,698 --> 00:14:51,758
thing with the turkey strains is there a

371
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,678
double-edged sword because they will

372
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,870
mark you for life but you can't sell

373
00:14:53,678 --> 00:14:56,350
them every day or it can ingest them

374
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,688
every day

375
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,040
I find it a little yet almost

376
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:03,039
heavy-handed a little over overpowering

377
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:05,889
but that Mac maybe I'm the sucker for

378
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:08,169
like subtleties and lots of notes in my

379
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:09,909
nose like wow what is that I can't quite

380
00:15:08,169 --> 00:15:12,428
put my finger on it and that's how this

381
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:15,669
max train strikes me in terms of my nose

382
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:18,669
it's all about like wow what is that I

383
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:20,438
feel like I sense something familiar but

384
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:22,149
I can't quite put my finger on it I've

385
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:23,919
called it like play-doh like when you

386
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:26,379
were a kid you open up a new jar of

387
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:29,378
play-doh it's got that strange salty

388
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:32,350
kind of bicarbonate smell yeah but also

389
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:32,840
with like a floral fruity thing going

390
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,810
through

391
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,340
I mean it's just so sweet I'm not gonna

392
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:39,079
lie there was a time when I grew up

393
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,090
where I ate play-doh so I could there

394
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,680
are happy tones to it and I didn't mean

395
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,480
to make it sound bad by saying that

396
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:48,139
because no I think play-doh is a great

397
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,659
as I recall it was a lovely aroma so

398
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:53,179
anyway so your question was what about

399
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:56,149
the Mac attracts you so much the aroma

400
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:58,129
is just to die and then the the plant

401
00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:00,740
itself when it's growing that grows

402
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:03,470
rock-hard nugs that are both like

403
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:06,379
sparkly with resin as well as like

404
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:10,730
purple splashes come out and it flowers

405
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:13,639
a little long it's probably 65 to 70 day

406
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:15,590
you know but that's not exceptionally

407
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:18,590
long either for what you get but the

408
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:21,290
yield is so amazing in the sense that

409
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:23,720
the buds are so dense that when you

410
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:26,959
harvest the cola that is of a certain

411
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,360
length in diameter and you compare that

412
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,920
to the say another col of a different

413
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,500
strain of the same length in diameter

414
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:36,409
the density on the Mac is so much

415
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:39,409
greater it'll weigh for example I

416
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:41,389
usually dry cure and trim my weed and

417
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:43,399
put it in mason jars as many people do

418
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:46,039
and then you'll weigh the mason jar when

419
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:49,730
it's completely full and a typical jar

420
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:52,519
is like 60 grams when it's full the Mac

421
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:56,269
I've had it hit like 90 grams when the

422
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:59,149
jar is false yeah half again now 50%

423
00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:02,419
crater just to go from 60 to 90 you have

424
00:16:59,149 --> 00:17:05,740
to take 50% of 60 and add to it right so

425
00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:09,349
that's a 50% increase in density over a

426
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:11,359
typical strain so that pays you back big

427
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:14,119
time on your investment of having grown

428
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,439
it and that when it hits the shelf and

429
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:18,319
it's weighed and sold

430
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,209
you've got gold there right and add that

431
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,909
to the fact that it looks super

432
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:25,580
desirable and smells super desirable and

433
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,860
the high is sublime and lovely it's not

434
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:31,159
a sleepy high it's not like an energetic

435
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:33,799
I just drank two two shots of espresso I

436
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,620
have the Durban tie and that's what I

437
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:38,899
use for Derbent I see 99 and that one if

438
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:41,539
you smoke the pure Durban tie

439
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,950
it's like you just shot of espresso and

440
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:44,690
you're running around waxing the

441
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,569
ceilings and yeah that's where the race

442
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:49,970
enos comes from see you know I always

443
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:51,889
say my sending 99 is really nice and

444
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:54,860
heady but it's also like a really wonky

445
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:56,660
cup of coffee and you know it's one of

446
00:17:54,859 --> 00:17:58,759
my favorite daytime smokes as a result

447
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,440
Cinderella 99 was always known for that

448
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:02,329
you know in those days you didn't find

449
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,630
too many strains where it gave me that

450
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:07,789
up high and the energy boost but that

451
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,559
definitely as well back then they were

452
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:11,450
also associated with being lower THC

453
00:18:09,558 --> 00:18:13,519
volumes when they gave you that feeling

454
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,350
which today's market actually and with

455
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,170
the help of your breeding techniques it

456
00:18:15,349 --> 00:18:21,409
kind of astounded Lee changed that resin

457
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:24,289
production the expectation for resin

458
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:26,390
production is so much of a higher bar

459
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:29,470
now you know it's been raised a lot from

460
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:32,179
the days like in the 90s or whatever but

461
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:34,130
Cinderella it's funny I've seen some

462
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:36,440
really great posts where people go

463
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,420
there's nothing outdated about this you

464
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,789
know I thought that wasn't the cutest

465
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,080
things they could say but I should get

466
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:44,569
back to the booth because there's people

467
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:47,769
sure sure they're coming to buy seeds

468
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:47,769
and I'd like to be there for that
