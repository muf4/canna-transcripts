00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:13,199
Casey we've been talking about you know

3
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:16,890
big AG Big Pharma and also the the

4
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,689
corporate reality you know a lot of us

5
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,210
have corporations but when we're

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,939
referring to the corporate entity we're

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,849
talking about you know mergers and and

8
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:29,118
and things that are much larger than

9
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:32,130
anything that we've dealt with as

10
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:35,700
farmers or as small business owners or

11
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:39,000
even as educators Casey could you talk a

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,960
little bit about the uneasy compromise

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,308
in this industry definitely you know my

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,120
farm is about an hour from here

15
00:00:44,308 --> 00:00:50,189
born and raised on the mountain and in

16
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,718
2014 you know we're doing the farmers

17
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:54,808
markets we're doing the collective and

18
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,550
we find ourselves suddenly very public

19
00:00:54,808 --> 00:00:59,820
and we've got the alphabet soup of

20
00:00:56,549 --> 00:01:01,319
various media arriving on the farm you

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,058
know the first the first like

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,790
significant media interaction I ever did

23
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:08,509
was CNN and the story title was doping

24
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,860
the drought and it was essentially like

25
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:13,049
essentially like hey your teams down by

26
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:14,429
about nine runs there's nobody on base

27
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,189
you got two outs you want to swing the

28
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,509
bat or what and and you know so for us

29
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:19,889
at the time you know being food

30
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,709
producers being you know were farmers

31
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,599
market vegetable farmers CSA farmers and

32
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:27,629
small-scale cannabis very small-scale

33
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:29,609
cannabis you know we really felt that

34
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,228
there was this typification of cannabis

35
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:35,069
farming happening and happening in the

36
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:38,310
media that was was very wrong and so you

37
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:40,500
know it was a it was a very difficult

38
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,060
decision in terms of that whole going

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,019
public process but suddenly we found

40
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,290
ourselves like very much in the

41
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:49,408
limelight and still to this day you know

42
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,200
a big part of my social change agenda my

43
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:55,109
focus my goals is to be able to engage

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,990
in a in a conversation that reaches as

45
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:59,340
far out as possible to be able to speak

46
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:00,539
to the values that I hold and the

47
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,040
beliefs that I have around food

48
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:06,540
production around small farming around

49
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,700
regenerative practices and the difficult

50
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,618
part of that is that when you wade into

51
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,780
that center whether it's public policy

52
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:13,539
whether it's public media there's a lot

53
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,259
of compromising

54
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:20,259
parent to that and that is for me one of

55
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:23,078
the great you know philosophical and and

56
00:02:20,259 --> 00:02:25,658
deeply personal questions is like where

57
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:27,700
you know where can the compromises be

58
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:29,919
where are the compromises can we accept

59
00:02:27,699 --> 00:02:31,179
those compromises and it's an emotional

60
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,378
roller coaster you know there are times

61
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:36,219
where I'm like you know what fuck it I

62
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:37,449
quit and there are times where I see

63
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:39,729
something or you know where I received

64
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:41,229
feedback like you said this thing that

65
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:44,138
really touched me from so you know from

66
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:45,938
from Michigan from Illinois you know

67
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:49,780
from all over the country in this this

68
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:51,188
broader perspective and I think one of

69
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,098
the things that's very very important

70
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:55,780
for us as farmers is to is to recognize

71
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:57,668
that we all have different context and

72
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,620
we all have different reality under

73
00:02:57,669 --> 00:03:01,780
which we find ourselves and we make

74
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,539
decisions accordingly and I think

75
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,158
there's a tendency with many social

76
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:08,979
movements in cannabis as a social

77
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:14,370
movement to end up in a place that's

78
00:03:08,979 --> 00:03:17,679
very dogmatic and when we do that we

79
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:21,879
take away something that was possible

80
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:24,280
and for me you know a big part of my

81
00:03:21,878 --> 00:03:27,638
focus is is local food security and food

82
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,889
systems and so I look at ways that I can

83
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:33,549
help to promote local food security and

84
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:36,459
and food sales for food farmers and that

85
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:39,329
was a big part of my initial foray into

86
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:42,189
public policy work was this idea that

87
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:43,419
food farming and cannabis farming here

88
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:45,340
on the north coast of often gone

89
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:46,780
hand-in-hand you know going to the

90
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,430
farmers markets and realizing after a

91
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,430
while like all these other old-timer

92
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,449
farmers are all totally grown weed to

93
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,560
like cuz I'm like hiding around the

94
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:55,769
corner smoking my joints and they're

95
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,180
like hey so you're gonna share or what

96
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:59,379
and that was a big realization for me

97
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,760
and that's part of what drove me into

98
00:03:59,378 --> 00:04:02,918
the public policy conversation was

99
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:04,628
wanting to see food farmers have access

100
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:07,359
to the regulated cannabis market to see

101
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:08,530
it as see it continue as this support

102
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:11,349
tool that it has been for our

103
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:15,098
communities and so all of those things

104
00:04:11,348 --> 00:04:17,348
are still what drive me and I look at

105
00:04:15,098 --> 00:04:19,209
the landscape of the current cannabis

106
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:22,089
regulatory environment and the current

107
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:25,778
marketplace and it's very very difficult

108
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:27,589
and so in terms of being here in a

109
00:04:25,778 --> 00:04:30,949
solutions oriented

110
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:32,479
effective you know is what I see are for

111
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:35,629
lack of better terminology organized

112
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,790
buyers and I see that we still do not

113
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:42,800
have not been able to achieve the role

114
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:44,840
of organized seller and how do we build

115
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,370
that out moving forward and this is one

116
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:47,599
of those points where you know for me

117
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,649
I'm very comfortable doing media

118
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,629
interactions I'm very comfortable

119
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:53,839
talking to the government I'm a terrible

120
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:54,978
businessman and so it's it's kind of one

121
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,019
of these like we each bring our

122
00:04:54,978 --> 00:04:58,250
skillsets to this puzzle you know I sort

123
00:04:57,019 --> 00:05:00,889
of have this an hour to my brain lives

124
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,689
in analogies of there's this puzzle and

125
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:04,819
we all got different pieces of it but

126
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:06,379
somebody took the box away so we're all

127
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:08,810
trying to figure out like what does this

128
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:10,909
puzzle look like where are the pieces

129
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:13,519
who are the pieces what pieces do we

130
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:16,100
need to still pull in and how do we

131
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:19,849
evolve into this arena in which as small

132
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:23,330
farmers we can be organized so that we

133
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:25,430
can negotiate with on a scale the

134
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:28,159
organized buyers because at this point

135
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,560
as a farmer you know for me I faced this

136
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,090
hard choice of like well you know I had

137
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,530
a business model that was a farmers

138
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:35,689
market business model we were doing the

139
00:05:33,529 --> 00:05:39,138
collective it worked really well and now

140
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:41,180
I'm a wholesale farmer and I can choose

141
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:42,889
to either sell my product or not sell my

142
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,180
product and if I choose to not sell my

143
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:48,530
product to go out of business and get a

144
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:51,500
different job so all of those realities

145
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:53,000
pile up on us and and you know it's the

146
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,288
emotional rollercoaster at any given day

147
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,430
like I can totally do this

148
00:05:54,288 --> 00:06:00,079
oh fuck and we're all in that at the

149
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,978
same time and like I think that's one of

150
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:02,930
the things that's really important about

151
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:04,519
these gatherings is that you know we're

152
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,019
all at different places on the emotional

153
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:07,250
roller coaster in any given day and the

154
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:09,709
gathering gives us the ability to

155
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:13,069
modulate and and go back forth to

156
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:14,959
continue to do the work so long story

157
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:18,168
short you know what I see looking at the

158
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,129
playing field is there are giants you

159
00:06:18,168 --> 00:06:20,870
know we've talked about these huge

160
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:23,269
multinational corporations the publicly

161
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,129
funded marketplace there are giants

162
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:28,000
within our space which are massively

163
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:30,889
larger than us and then there's us and

164
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,509
you know I I wish I could say like I've

165
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:34,699
got the answer silver bullet and I don't

166
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:36,168
but it's it's the reality that we're all

167
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:41,060
facing and trying to figure out how to

168
00:06:36,168 --> 00:06:43,069
navigate as very small players in a war

169
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:45,470
that is essentially based on corporate

170
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,360
and government super structures and so

171
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,710
one we're trying to find our places

172
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,310
within it and figure out how to navigate

173
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,139
it

174
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,780
but two we're trying to figure out how

175
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:55,789
to change it and there's the old saying

176
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:56,959
like don't change a paradigm build a new

177
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:01,189
one and the old one will cease to exist

178
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:03,620
and I definitely resonate that but for

179
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:05,680
me and in my role I've always been more

180
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,180
of a centrist and so it's been my job to

181
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,410
go and talk to policymakers and and

182
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,490
generally to be able to come to an

183
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,410
agreement yeah I see where you're at

184
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,259
this is where I'm at okay this is our

185
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:17,390
compromise in the center and so I think

186
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:19,189
it again comes down to each of us has

187
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:22,729
our own specific paths in our work that

188
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:24,439
we must do and where we are called to

189
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,840
fit into that puzzle we must find that

190
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:28,069
place and go forth and do so and so you

191
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:29,810
know one of the things that I've

192
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:32,990
struggled with a great deal from a

193
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:37,160
personal perspective is the judgment

194
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:38,960
that comes with and from this process in

195
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,880
which we're dealing with both ideology

196
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,229
we're dealing with business and we're

197
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,110
trying to figure out how to navigate

198
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,640
those things and and that for me is the

199
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,069
heaviest burden and the thing that is

200
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,439
the hardest about the process is that I

201
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:52,909
often don't feel like I have the right

202
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,589
answers but I feel like I have to

203
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:56,990
continue on the path to try to figure

204
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:58,789
them out and I think that's the the same

205
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,340
for all of us and so one of the things

206
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:04,120
that I really want to call in for our

207
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:07,250
community is is to remain supportive and

208
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,280
to hold space and understanding for each

209
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,230
of us for where we are and and be able

210
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:14,839
to come to a commonality around that and

211
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,939
continue to move forward because this

212
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:18,169
whole thing is is you know watching the

213
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:20,149
changes in the last five years has

214
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:24,470
really ripped us apart and in some ways

215
00:08:20,149 --> 00:08:26,569
and I think if we are not able to create

216
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,550
space for people to be where they are

217
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:30,740
while we try to put together what we

218
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,430
want to be we're gonna have a really

219
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,430
tough time with it

220
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:47,649
what is with this whole process is that

221
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:49,179
public policy is always iterative and so

222
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:53,339
you know we started off with the very

223
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:55,269
vague SB 420 collective cooperative so

224
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:57,339
2016-2017 I'm part of a project that's

225
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:59,320
operating an agricultural cooperative

226
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:05,290
and that was you know it's great it's

227
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:09,129
Sunkist it's the organ value what is it

228
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:11,559
nevermind but there's there's a ton of

229
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:13,389
like big AG coops that you know Pacific

230
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:15,729
Coast producers controls 80% of fruit

231
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:18,220
packing and tomato packing in the

232
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,800
country and it from California and

233
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,180
they're cooperative farmer owned and so

234
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:23,588
you know we moved into this this

235
00:09:22,179 --> 00:09:25,028
iteration of like yeah we're gonna do

236
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:26,290
cooperatives gonna be amazing and then

237
00:09:25,028 --> 00:09:27,850
the state said well actually we made a

238
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:30,159
cooperative rule and you can only be

239
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,079
four acres in cultivation to be in the

240
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,969
quarter to have your cooperative can't

241
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:35,588
exceed that and so we've kind of gone

242
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:40,660
back to the drawing board in which well

243
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:42,760
okay can we do a c-corp that is you know

244
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:46,419
that has be core principles and

245
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:48,399
cooperative bylaws you know and so this

246
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:51,578
is very much the solution I hope to see

247
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,708
in us becoming an organized seller and

248
00:09:51,578 --> 00:09:55,299
the hard thing about it for me is having

249
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:56,979
gone through three iterations of it like

250
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:58,778
I've come to realize like I want to join

251
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,569
it and follow in it and put energy

252
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:02,980
towards it I can't lead it and so that's

253
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:04,568
really again you know I said it in the

254
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,310
panel earlier today and I'm gonna call

255
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:08,169
it out again like those of us in this

256
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:10,719
community who have those business skills

257
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:13,299
to lead that type of project like we we

258
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,680
need you because that's that's the

259
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:16,769
biggest part of it is that it's farmers

260
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:20,049
we're pulling in a million directions

261
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:22,240
and when you start a cooperative it's a

262
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:26,859
whole nother layer of business you got

263
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:30,879
to do and as farmers were like man so

264
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:32,980
you know I think that this is the time

265
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:35,110
and opportunity for us to organize with

266
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:38,110
the limited resources that we have to

267
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,430
try to become an organized seller and I

268
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,259
think you know you have to be really

269
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:42,938
careful in that conversation I'm not

270
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:46,149
talking about violating antitrust laws

271
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:46,809
but that we be able to engage in

272
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:49,090
aggregation

273
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:51,129
grading if as small farmers we had

274
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:52,810
aggregation and grading so we could say

275
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:54,639
these facilities have this weed at this

276
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:56,319
grade that would change the marketplace

277
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,059
completely and that's something that

278
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,740
given the number of locally owned

279
00:10:58,059 --> 00:11:01,449
businesses that we have now who have

280
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,730
facilities you know we're starting to

281
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:06,610
have the pieces on the board to be able

282
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:09,070
to do that and it just requires enough

283
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,629
leadership and impetus to be able to

284
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,810
draw those pieces together into

285
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:16,360
something cogent that's really the

286
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:19,329
difference between the big corporate

287
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,039
structure they have this you know bottom

288
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,970
line and the thing about our community

289
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:28,120
is that our line is bottomless we are

290
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:30,490
going to be forever trying to figure out

291
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,950
solutions and how we're going to be

292
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,899
putting medicine out to the people

293
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,300
because it's what it's what it is that

294
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:39,579
we inherently do we're here to do that

295
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:44,679
and as a collective we have to keep our

296
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:48,730
revenue streams rolling in a way that is

297
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:51,309
productive because when each farm is is

298
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:53,740
doing well financially then the entire

299
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:57,129
community is doing well financially and

300
00:11:53,740 --> 00:12:03,549
I wanted to start to move into the idea

301
00:11:57,129 --> 00:12:06,039
of creating revenue and revenue streams

302
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:07,750
as a collective and one thing that I

303
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:10,529
have thought about that that I think

304
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:13,570
could be very poignant and very

305
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:16,209
accessible to us right away is that many

306
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:18,520
many many of us have secondary products

307
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,560
that we produce on our farm whether we

308
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:23,939
produce chicken eggs whether we produce

309
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:28,149
gorgeous jewelry whether we produce

310
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:31,780
consulting services education whether we

311
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:34,600
are coming to your local zone an area as

312
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:37,480
a group I believe that we can take all

313
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,700
of these secondary products that we have

314
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,889
and put it on an international

315
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:47,830
marketplace that is a pure certified

316
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:51,309
marketplace that could be easily put up

317
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:54,670
that people could ship products from

318
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:58,838
their own location they could you know

319
00:12:54,669 --> 00:13:00,159
go online to book their consulting and I

320
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,310
just think that I would like

321
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:05,019
put that on the front burner as a

322
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:08,169
discussion in moving forward for this

323
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:10,120
collective and start talking to the

324
00:13:08,169 --> 00:13:13,568
people here in this room that are

325
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,278
absolute wizards at helping to create

326
00:13:13,568 --> 00:13:18,929
something this is this could be

327
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:22,389
education forward education number one

328
00:13:18,929 --> 00:13:26,469
and there's a lot of people in this room

329
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:29,409
who already have incredible successes

330
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:31,480
with multiple products as well as

331
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:34,328
secondary products outside of the

332
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,449
cannabis industry and forest and

333
00:13:34,328 --> 00:13:41,078
Patricia you guys are really on top of

334
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:43,479
it with your secondary products and what

335
00:13:41,078 --> 00:13:45,370
you offer from the community could you

336
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:50,289
talk a little bit about that and how you

337
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:56,198
can see that as something to move for in

338
00:13:50,289 --> 00:14:00,610
the collective I love that this got

339
00:13:56,198 --> 00:14:02,799
brought up because I do actually yeah I

340
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,449
love I wanted to bring this up before

341
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,490
that really on this international

342
00:14:04,448 --> 00:14:09,370
marketplace we should be as part of

343
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,289
education and as part of what we are

344
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,350
allowed to do is be selling other

345
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:16,688
products such as tea blends and you know

346
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:20,589
using the diversity that you have on

347
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:24,969
your farm not just tea blends you can be

348
00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:27,040
creating canned products and ferments

349
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,240
and all these different creations that

350
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,068
you do it doesn't even have to be with

351
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,698
food it can be some kind of blend or

352
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:36,909
some kind of wizard ear magic that you

353
00:14:32,698 --> 00:14:39,818
truly embody and can put out there so

354
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:42,969
like on our farm we have a lot of

355
00:14:39,818 --> 00:14:45,219
products that I sell mostly at one place

356
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:48,370
which is a little co-op in our town and

357
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:51,430
we hope to start extending it like the

358
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:54,339
tincture making and the herbal tea

359
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:58,479
blends and fermented food products from

360
00:14:54,339 --> 00:15:01,000
our farm selves anything that we can get

361
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,620
creative with and that does lead in part

362
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,389
to the education because there's so many

363
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:06,730
people and times that I've heard from

364
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:08,438
city folk who I work with and I grew up

365
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,659
in the city so I have that kind of

366
00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:13,389
connection where people just want to be

367
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:16,029
tapped into a different source of Metis

368
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:18,159
and it's not just about cannabis its

369
00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:20,110
food as medicine there's herbs as

370
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,759
medicine there's earth medicine spirit

371
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,700
medicine there's all these different

372
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:29,080
facets of what we're doing on our farms

373
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:30,460
that connect us back and we can share

374
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,580
and put it out there as part of the

375
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:37,030
story that it's not just one little

376
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:40,389
portion it's all of it encompassed so

377
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:42,789
Kate and Bobby got it you all really are

378
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:45,730
doing a lot of multiple products in

379
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:49,059
cannabis and you're really diversifying

380
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:51,039
your brand you're creating more products

381
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:54,789
than I've seen a lot of other people

382
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:57,279
create and I'm seeing huge successes so

383
00:15:54,789 --> 00:16:00,849
how can that help other farmers and

384
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:04,199
moving further into the industry and and

385
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:08,200
for the success of multiple products

386
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:10,360
okay so I'm a silversmith by trade I

387
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,730
haven't quite figured out the link for

388
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,399
between cannabis and plants and silver

389
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:17,830
smithing yet so that's kind of something

390
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:21,970
that remains very close to my heart but

391
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:24,570
very much on the back burner so we

392
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:27,610
primarily started out producing flowers

393
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:30,550
from there we moved into extracts we do

394
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:35,139
co2 because we were finding we needed

395
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:38,229
more revenue streams so currently we

396
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:41,949
produce a line of THC products in a

397
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:44,950
separate line of hemp CBD products the

398
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:47,190
reason for this is because the THC

399
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:50,470
products are not I have a hard time

400
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:54,060
distributing them our market is mostly

401
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:57,730
the end consumer we are in a few stores

402
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:59,109
we will be gaining momentum in 2020 we

403
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:01,779
just got product liability insurance

404
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,088
this process took us over six months and

405
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:06,099
it was just a whole lot of back and

406
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:07,990
forth and now we're like insured all

407
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:11,859
over the place like in case something

408
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:13,509
happens everybody can feel good about

409
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:17,948
knowing that our products have

410
00:17:13,509 --> 00:17:20,019
insurances so with that being said we

411
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:23,589
have picked up a few new stories we

412
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:25,629
create a salve that's like our main

413
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:26,720
product actually every product we've

414
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:30,559
created has been

415
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,490
for his mother she is basically like our

416
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,220
guinea pig

417
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:37,339
she's always she has more ailments than

418
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:38,960
anyone can imagine so I've always been

419
00:17:37,339 --> 00:17:41,389
making things and testing them out on

420
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,000
her we started with a sow that fixed her

421
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:46,820
sciatic nerve one of our other products

422
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,470
we make a elderberry medicated sleep

423
00:17:46,819 --> 00:17:50,359
elixir this got her off sleep

424
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,190
medications this has gotten several

425
00:17:50,359 --> 00:17:55,788
family members off of sleep medication

426
00:17:52,190 --> 00:18:01,700
and then these people tell other people

427
00:17:55,788 --> 00:18:02,990
so yes we should be mostly selling to

428
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,569
people with a medical card this is not

429
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:08,480
always possible so you know our products

430
00:18:05,569 --> 00:18:13,220
are kind of expanding this way and I'm

431
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:15,620
able to make products CBD products and

432
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:17,509
sell those over the internet so we just

433
00:18:15,619 --> 00:18:20,899
keep diversifying this is how we're

434
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:23,690
growing we do other things we have

435
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,429
vegetables for sale sometimes we're

436
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,929
working to open a farm stand on the

437
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:29,870
property this year so we can give people

438
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:31,429
an address to come to because meeting up

439
00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:33,229
and delivering is just not really

440
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:35,298
fitting in our schedule so if you if you

441
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,829
can come to our farm and you know buy

442
00:18:35,298 --> 00:18:37,908
our products from us and we can stop in

443
00:18:36,829 --> 00:18:40,428
the middle of the day and sell them to

444
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:45,380
you like yes this is this is what we're

445
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:47,210
doing or ancient green farm yes

446
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,150
yep the products are all branded under

447
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:52,038
ancient green farm I do all the product

448
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:54,500
labeling and marketing so I do put my

449
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:55,970
art school degree to use you can have

450
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,380
the greatest product in the world but if

451
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,038
your label looks like shit you're really

452
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,039
not going to sell it

453
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:11,609
yeah this is something I will get to I

454
00:19:08,729 --> 00:19:16,769
have a lot of ideas it comes down to

455
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:19,739
time I'm creating also a brand that's

456
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:22,578
really recognizable I'm I'm looking in

457
00:19:19,739 --> 00:19:25,048
this room and I'm seeing incredible

458
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:28,709
recognizable brands and people that have

459
00:19:25,048 --> 00:19:31,618
put out a lot of energy to to create a

460
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:36,778
brand that that people see and want to

461
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:38,908
have Steve and quani and you all have an

462
00:19:36,778 --> 00:19:41,159
incredibly recognizable brand and I know

463
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:42,809
that it's the both of you and quani and

464
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:45,659
you're definitely a lot of the backbone

465
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:49,499
of this so I'd love for you all to talk

466
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:52,019
a little bit about how other companies

467
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:55,229
here in this room can put out a brand

468
00:19:52,019 --> 00:19:58,739
that is really recognizable and that the

469
00:19:55,229 --> 00:20:00,899
community is asking for its kind of its

470
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:03,629
kind of touches on which it caught me

471
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:05,748
off guard with earlier today but yeah

472
00:20:03,628 --> 00:20:07,468
building a brand is extremely important

473
00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:09,899
especially if you don't have a

474
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:12,379
storefront you gotta be able get your

475
00:20:09,898 --> 00:20:16,078
product to market and if no one knows

476
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:18,718
you know my lavender versus you know Joe

477
00:20:16,078 --> 00:20:20,969
blows lavender it's really hard for me

478
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:22,739
to to get in the store if they don't

479
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:27,058
want it so building a brand that people

480
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:29,519
can trust is been key for us so just to

481
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:30,058
give some an idea where we're at we were

482
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,288
in Nevada

483
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:32,668
we started off into that about five

484
00:20:31,288 --> 00:20:34,048
years ago when this whole regulatory

485
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:37,278
system really kicked off and got really

486
00:20:34,048 --> 00:20:40,078
stringent for us microbial testing was

487
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:41,429
what was just this this horrible thing

488
00:20:40,078 --> 00:20:43,618
that no one could really get past it

489
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:45,479
even even the synthetic hydro guys are

490
00:20:43,618 --> 00:20:48,749
having a hard time let alone indoor

491
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:50,879
no-till but again we stayed true to it

492
00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:52,379
we adapted I think that's really

493
00:20:50,878 --> 00:20:54,148
important in this industry right now is

494
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:55,648
just being have the ability to adapt to

495
00:20:54,148 --> 00:20:58,918
some of these regulations and not being

496
00:20:55,648 --> 00:21:01,828
so stuck in your ways but anyways so

497
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:04,499
yeah we we designed this trustworthy

498
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:06,989
brand we we're really able to connect

499
00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:11,098
with the the local scene at a more

500
00:21:06,989 --> 00:21:13,108
organic way versus trying to go big and

501
00:21:11,098 --> 00:21:14,729
get billboards and TV ads and things

502
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:16,009
like that we would do simple things like

503
00:21:14,729 --> 00:21:21,620
shirts and

504
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:22,970
that's in and something we did at the

505
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:26,089
beginning that was pretty cool that no

506
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:28,480
one really did was we would host little

507
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:31,339
gatherings like these at dispensaries

508
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,490
called know your farmer because a lot of

509
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:37,519
the people in Nevada in Las Vegas needed

510
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:38,630
education as to what cannabis was the

511
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,329
way we grow

512
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:43,700
so we these gatherings inviting the

513
00:21:41,329 --> 00:21:45,949
community to these dispensaries and

514
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:49,009
teaching them about permaculture

515
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:51,410
teaching them our methods what we did to

516
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:54,769
be them pure clean green certified and

517
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:56,690
just growing clean cannabis was a key

518
00:21:54,769 --> 00:22:01,009
thing to getting our brand out there and

519
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:04,039
just like still to this day I think 70%

520
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:05,859
of our consumers are still local so

521
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:09,649
getting the local communities involved

522
00:22:05,859 --> 00:22:16,399
was a key thing to again dig our brand

523
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:17,990
out there and loyalty that I'm producing

524
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,490
a good crop you know a good crop with

525
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:23,420
good branding I heard someone say having

526
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:25,339
a good packaging is obviously key not to

527
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,480
to go there but yeah you really got to

528
00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:28,669
address your product up to today's

529
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,930
market is extremely competitive but you

530
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,370
know also taking a consideration when

531
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,810
you're putting on the effort into

532
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:35,029
packaging make sure that you're also

533
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:38,809
still thinking more generally and how

534
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:40,099
can we minimal or keep our or our carbon

535
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:42,980
footprint and low as possible

536
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:47,689
at the same time make a statement but

537
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:53,690
yeah awesome and right now we we have

538
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:55,789
the the attention of more young people

539
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:59,630
that want to go into farming than ever

540
00:22:55,789 --> 00:23:03,559
before all of a sudden now cannabis has

541
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:06,380
become this beautiful amazing catalyst

542
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:09,319
for young farmers to one out to want to

543
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:11,150
go out there and learn about planting

544
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:13,069
crops and and wanting to do it right

545
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:16,090
they know that there's problems within

546
00:23:13,069 --> 00:23:19,700
the big AG model and they want to do it

547
00:23:16,089 --> 00:23:23,809
correctly and you know there there's so

548
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:25,700
many problems and and hoops that we have

549
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:28,759
to jump through in order to become a

550
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,610
regulated cannabis seller but one thing

551
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:32,069
that we can do

552
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:34,379
when we first start our farms is we can

553
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:36,689
be producing food and there's a lot of

554
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:39,270
you here in this room that are producing

555
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:42,600
food and I know that that sometimes is

556
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:44,879
often the backbone of how we're able to

557
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:49,259
pay our mortgages and how we're able to

558
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,870
move you know paying for the paperwork

559
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:54,450
basically of becoming regulated in the

560
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:58,739
cannabis market so Daniel Stein I'd love

561
00:23:54,450 --> 00:24:03,390
for you to talk for a minute about you

562
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:07,710
know producing food ok great

563
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:10,259
producing food on your farm that that

564
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:13,410
that's helping your family and not only

565
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:16,919
bring in fertility but it in the soil

566
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:21,090
but but fertility in your economics as

567
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:23,040
well yeah you know economically it was

568
00:24:21,089 --> 00:24:24,949
it was kind of the opposite of what you

569
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:27,869
were just saying that the cannabis

570
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:29,610
supported getting our food farm and that

571
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:33,529
business model to a point where it was

572
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:37,048
actually a viable business I started

573
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:39,089
about 25 years ago food farming on a

574
00:24:37,048 --> 00:24:41,910
little lettuce farm in Hawaii the same

575
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:44,579
lettuce farm that that Daniel of radical

576
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:47,910
herbs also farmed on a long time ago but

577
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:51,269
I was passionate about it and I loved it

578
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:52,710
but it didn't buy me any weed so I

579
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:55,470
started growing weed around the same

580
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:57,269
time and and noticed that that like

581
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,529
could supplement my income enough so

582
00:24:57,269 --> 00:25:01,980
that I so that I could have that

583
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:06,029
lifestyle and now we've been doing a

584
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,919
commercial production food farm about an

585
00:25:06,029 --> 00:25:10,740
hour west of here in braceland

586
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,840
for ten years and we started really

587
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,269
small with the space that we had doing a

588
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:18,509
lot of sprouts doing sunflower sprouts

589
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:20,250
and pea shoots and sauerkraut and things

590
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:22,169
like that that we could on a small scale

591
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:25,640
while also devoting the small amount of

592
00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:28,820
area we had to to cannabis and and we've

593
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:31,620
expanded slowly trying to incorporate

594
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:34,519
what what we consider best practice is

595
00:25:31,619 --> 00:25:37,769
the whole time and we've in the last

596
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:39,900
eight years we discovered no-till and

597
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:42,480
trying to implement a lot of these

598
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,710
regenerative practices on a production

599
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,620
scale of food far

600
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:50,759
and they're finding it the most

601
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:53,129
rewarding thing in the world like last

602
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:54,419
night I almost called Brassica in into

603
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:56,640
the circle there was a gentleman that

604
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,890
did and and every time we were talking

605
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,330
about potatoes which came up a lot I was

606
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,429
just like in the broccoli that goes on

607
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:05,250
top of them with some butter and cream

608
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:08,700
in because this time of year there's

609
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:10,528
like this is this testament to the soil

610
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,600
we've built and I've never seen anything

611
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:14,369
like it where the brassicas we grew up

612
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:15,898
in the summer when we were busy with our

613
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:18,209
kids and taking care of our house and

614
00:26:15,898 --> 00:26:21,028
all this homestead stuff sat and start

615
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:23,700
trays in the in the greenhouse for such

616
00:26:21,028 --> 00:26:25,500
a long time that they were almost dead

617
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,000
they looked all purple they were

618
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,548
nutrient deficient we put him in this

619
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,409
living soil out in the farm and and we

620
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:33,480
do about an acre of this kind of

621
00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:34,860
production and we put him in and forgot

622
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,019
about them and then there was a drought

623
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,548
and I didn't have any water to water all

624
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:41,220
through the fall until it recently

625
00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:43,558
rained and you know we have cauliflower

626
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,110
and broccoli heads that are the size of

627
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:48,329
my head and and cabbages and all this

628
00:26:46,109 --> 00:26:49,648
food for us through the winter and we're

629
00:26:48,329 --> 00:26:54,359
not doing it as much commercially

630
00:26:49,648 --> 00:26:56,668
anymore but the the food and and the way

631
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:58,648
you get rewarded in the quality of your

632
00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:01,259
cannabis from doing these practices is

633
00:26:58,648 --> 00:27:03,750
the same for food so we have this market

634
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:05,669
we do two farmers markets and we feed a

635
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:06,960
lot of people that come to us first when

636
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:09,899
they come to the farmers market because

637
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,390
you can taste this quality you can taste

638
00:27:09,898 --> 00:27:14,668
the medicine in food that's grown in

639
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,190
these systems and it's it's a natural

640
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:19,169
overlap and one of the challenges with

641
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:21,330
it right now in the California market is

642
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:23,700
I'd love to be selling cannabis to the

643
00:27:21,329 --> 00:27:26,220
same people I'm selling food to because

644
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:29,130
they taste it they understand that and

645
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,899
then that naturally bridges across to

646
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:33,990
what's this other product you're growing

647
00:27:30,898 --> 00:27:36,269
and how's that but we're working on

648
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:40,349
solutions for that do so by medicine

649
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:45,389
yeah so totally important I'm also Blair

650
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:48,928
oh Claire you all are also doing a lot

651
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:52,100
of secondary products as well as ethical

652
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:54,450
raising of livestock for meat and

653
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:56,990
vegetables would love to talk to you

654
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,990
about it too

655
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:04,099
hi everybody I'm Blair from radical

656
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:06,479
herbs and yeah totally

657
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:09,000
everything you said really resonates

658
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,860
about growing food and I think there's a

659
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,569
lot of farmers out there these days and

660
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:14,549
commodity farming and everything who

661
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:16,859
have to talk about having a second job

662
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:19,379
to fund their farm and I like to say we

663
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:21,000
get to farm to be able to farm and so I

664
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:24,990
think that's a beautiful gift that

665
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,349
cannabis has been able to give to us we

666
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:32,400
have a very diversified farm we raise

667
00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:35,969
sheep cows chickens sheep for wool and

668
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:38,880
meat we have a variety of vegetables

669
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:42,329
that we grow and herbs as well we do our

670
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,760
little farmers market out in Koval oh

671
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:47,759
and sometimes we don't quite get there

672
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:49,740
right on time but we always have a line

673
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,569
at our booth and people are constantly

674
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:56,569
telling us that they're addicted to our

675
00:28:51,569 --> 00:29:00,659
vegetables and I'm like me too so it's

676
00:28:56,569 --> 00:29:01,980
people calling us when it's raining just

677
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,370
the other day because we didn't do

678
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:07,079
farmers market prepping for this and you

679
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:09,659
know just needing to get our their

680
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:11,759
vegetables that week so that's like such

681
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:13,680
a good feeling and I think that is in

682
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,329
cannabis we're disconnected in that way

683
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,850
with the way that the system is we're

684
00:29:15,329 --> 00:29:19,679
not being able to be face to face with

685
00:29:17,849 --> 00:29:22,139
the consumers and that I think that

686
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,330
there's a beautiful story to tell there

687
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:29,130
and a beautiful connection that in

688
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:31,889
contrast you can see like you know I

689
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:34,440
think we have a lot to gain and learn

690
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:36,330
from how just the organic vegetable

691
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,570
production is comparing you know

692
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:42,210
cage-free chickens versus pasture raised

693
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:45,569
chickens we have like amazing imagery

694
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:51,600
that we can use like you know sun-grown

695
00:29:45,569 --> 00:29:54,480
versus indoor or like smart pots versus

696
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:56,639
in the ground like there's people see

697
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,130
that imagery I think it would easily

698
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,940
tell a story of like what we're doing

699
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:04,920
that's different and just like people

700
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,650
can taste that and what we're producing

701
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:10,730
they taste it in the vegetables and the

702
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:10,730
cannabis and the meat

703
00:30:12,869 --> 00:30:23,439
a bunch of CSA stuff and that's sort of

704
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:25,869
a whole other commitment that you make

705
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,420
to your community in that could you tell

706
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:29,949
us about it yeah so you know I think one

707
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,420
of the things that's very important to

708
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:33,880
me in terms of this local food security

709
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:36,340
question is the fact that it inherently

710
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,780
builds community and so in this last few

711
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:39,279
years in this time of transition the

712
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:40,960
farmers market has been kind of one of

713
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,730
those anchor points for us we're like we

714
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,558
all get together and like sometimes

715
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:46,058
we're having the same conversation again

716
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:48,129
and again and it's did you hear what the

717
00:30:46,058 --> 00:30:51,099
county did i Budda Budda Budda but it's

718
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:53,230
we're still coming together and you know

719
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:55,928
I think that for a lot of us cannabis

720
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:58,599
was the portal back to agriculture and

721
00:30:55,929 --> 00:31:00,480
so as we walk through that portal we see

722
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:04,359
that it becomes this ever-expanding

723
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,679
bounty and you know farming is a huge

724
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:08,319
amount of work and Edie

725
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,190
you know Daniel Taylor and us are you

726
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:11,230
know we've kind of in this funny

727
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:14,110
mirror-image northern Mendo southern

728
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:15,880
humble and seeing you know you get to a

729
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:18,579
certain point and you see the holy shit

730
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,100
this is working and so we just you know

731
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:22,058
for instance we just got a plow and

732
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:23,919
rotary plow that I'm using to put in

733
00:31:22,058 --> 00:31:25,539
swales and I'm gathering up seeds from

734
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,058
all over the garden it's like oh good I

735
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:29,589
can gather up two dozen three dozen four

736
00:31:28,058 --> 00:31:31,500
dozen different species and put them in

737
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:33,609
the in the swales and so you see

738
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,029
biodiversity becomes self-replicating

739
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:39,219
and I think that those types of systems

740
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:41,759
create foundations on the farm for

741
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:44,980
diversity in crops and diversity in

742
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:46,420
value-added products and then from that

743
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:49,329
foundation how do you get it to the

744
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:51,490
consumer and so the CSA model has always

745
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:53,470
appealed to me a lot because there's no

746
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:55,779
choice involved it's whatever I

747
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:58,720
harvested that day that's what goes in

748
00:31:55,779 --> 00:31:59,920
the CSA and so and and it can be

749
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,210
difficult from the consumer perspective

750
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,190
cuz it's exactly that you don't get a

751
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,630
choice so if you don't like eggplants

752
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:08,200
and I put eggplants in three weeks in a

753
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:09,730
row so but one of the things that I

754
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:11,470
really become fascinated by is this idea

755
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:14,920
of institutional CSA purchases and

756
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:17,890
weights working with a canvas company or

757
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:20,140
a hospital or a school district or you

758
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:23,180
know any place in which employees come

759
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:25,790
to every day if part of the employee

760
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:28,250
benefit or wellness program is a csa

761
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:30,079
purchase then it takes out that you know

762
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,119
for the for the average consumer buying

763
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,710
a csa you're always stacking up the

764
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:35,419
valuation of I paid twenty bucks for

765
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:38,299
this and I don't like eggplant so maybe

766
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:40,100
it's not so good for me but if it's part

767
00:32:38,299 --> 00:32:41,240
of your employee benefit program then

768
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:42,740
you essentially don't have that

769
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,150
valuation and you say to yourself well

770
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,220
either I'm gonna eat it or not but I'm

771
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:48,320
gonna try to figure it out and and this

772
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,329
bag comes every week from the farmers

773
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:51,439
perspective I take all the stuff and I

774
00:32:50,329 --> 00:32:53,149
drop it off I don't have to do

775
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,460
distribution I don't have to do billing

776
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:57,620
all I have to do is provide it and

777
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,259
that's a significant and packaging into

778
00:32:57,619 --> 00:33:02,089
something that people can take home and

779
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:04,519
so that changes the dynamic dramatically

780
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:06,199
in terms of from my farm having to do a

781
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:08,720
bunch of individual accounts and

782
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,009
individual interactions and you know Bob

783
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,990
didn't make it to the farmers market

784
00:33:10,009 --> 00:33:14,210
because he was busy bob went to work on

785
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,460
Friday and so when the thing was at work

786
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,890
when he left work on Friday then he can

787
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:22,250
take it home and so you know the CSA

788
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:24,620
model in terms of looking at systems

789
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,720
thinking how do we fit into this modern

790
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:28,489
bifurcated convenience driven society

791
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,950
with the types of products that we

792
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:34,069
produce and so that's something that is

793
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:35,690
to me very important and when you look

794
00:33:34,069 --> 00:33:38,119
at value adds like right now in the in

795
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:40,460
the winter local the local food system

796
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:42,979
in the winter there's it's wide open

797
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,840
like there's not enough production and

798
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,880
there's all kind of value adds that can

799
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:49,879
be sold and so for instance like we do

800
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,070
salty Susie seasoning salts and we bag

801
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,840
up you know we dry out herbs all season

802
00:33:52,069 --> 00:33:55,159
and then we mix them with salt and and

803
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,179
sell them in the winter and so there's

804
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,279
you know there's all kind of little

805
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,840
niche you know we used to do salad like

806
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:02,359
Dana said sauerkraut at market is

807
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,709
phenomenal and so essentially just

808
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:05,240
figuring out like these are the things

809
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,110
that I want to do for myself that I like

810
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,579
to consume

811
00:34:06,109 --> 00:34:14,569
I bet other people would like to also

812
00:34:09,579 --> 00:34:17,779
talking about all of these value-added

813
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:19,760
products is and and and the thread that

814
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,140
we have between all of our value-added

815
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,060
products and in something that we're

816
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:26,900
going to wrap up this session with and

817
00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:29,630
and go to lunch is Holly you you you

818
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:31,579
were talking to me and I know a lot of

819
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:34,849
the work that you have and putting

820
00:34:31,579 --> 00:34:36,940
forward is how do we achieve a higher

821
00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:40,838
value-added product

822
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:43,869
by utilizing this stream of ethics that

823
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:46,029
we call regenerative at this time put it

824
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:49,809
on our packaging or how can we better

825
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:55,750
highlight that to help us out in in

826
00:34:49,809 --> 00:34:58,630
gaining better revenue streams certainly

827
00:34:55,750 --> 00:35:00,818
the certification your certification the

828
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:03,338
jump your certification mark the Sun in

829
00:35:00,818 --> 00:35:05,349
earth mark these certification works

830
00:35:03,338 --> 00:35:09,599
that are able to get out to a broader

831
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:14,260
audience helps to inform the consumer

832
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:18,550
however I think that Appalachians are

833
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:24,490
going to provide a broader framework for

834
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:26,950
the world helping to identify cannabis

835
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:31,439
that is produced in alignment with the

836
00:35:26,949 --> 00:35:35,799
environment and at the same time to

837
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,630
protect our practices is this that

838
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:43,150
should I talk about Appalachians now is

839
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:45,490
that tomorrow okay so I I really believe

840
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:48,068
that Appalachians are going to be a the

841
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:52,568
bus framework for putting the

842
00:35:48,068 --> 00:35:55,779
certifications and putting the farms

843
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:58,239
together in greening recognition very

844
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:04,450
easily for the consumer very easily at

845
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:06,729
the retail space I am sorry my expertise

846
00:36:04,449 --> 00:36:08,439
is not in economics so I don't think I

847
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:10,088
have a lot to say about this other than

848
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:12,550
I think Appalachians are going to be a

849
00:36:10,088 --> 00:36:16,989
very good tool for everybody consumer

850
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:19,450
and producer in to help us to elevate

851
00:36:16,989 --> 00:36:23,229
the value of the primary and secondary

852
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:24,879
products we see it and with other

853
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:28,119
agricultural products that are produced

854
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:31,088
even in Appalachians even if they're not

855
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:34,660
produced by those methods but earn the

856
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:37,480
appellation so excellent thank you all
