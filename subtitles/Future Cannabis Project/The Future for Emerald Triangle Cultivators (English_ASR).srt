1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,609
if Sacramento got their act together the

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:10,949
BCC what do you see could be the future

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:13,079
in the next five to ten years in

4
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:16,138
Humboldt County and the Emerald triangle

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,350
in a perfect world if if things got

6
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:22,528
better if if somehow they started

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,380
getting the regulatory act improved and

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:27,750
making it work for farmers I think that

9
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:30,089
the and and I and I believe that it will

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,009
work over time if I didn't see any

11
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:34,049
future I wouldn't know what's so hard at

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,420
it and just that I didn't see this

13
00:00:34,049 --> 00:00:38,939
little bump but I still have the same

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,859
long-term view and I think that what

15
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:43,378
you're gonna see is a radical change in

16
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:45,600
in stores just like retail in general so

17
00:00:43,378 --> 00:00:47,519
retail in general is knows no more store

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,340
fronts but people love to buy things on

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,050
online they love Amazon they love the

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,579
simplicity people don't like to deal

21
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:55,189
people when people tell me that I go

22
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,270
well go tell that to Blockbuster and

23
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:59,939
explain to me how much they love going

24
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,649
in buying CDs and DVDs to watch their

25
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:02,849
movies because they don't they would

26
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,060
rather have it delivered right through

27
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,650
the phone cannabis will be the same way

28
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,228
where I think that the delivery model

29
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,630
will be the model of the future by far

30
00:01:10,228 --> 00:01:15,359
and storefronts will only be like

31
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:17,849
flagships the places that you can come

32
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,799
to for certain things it represents a

33
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:22,199
company it's in geographic areas that

34
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,680
have huge traffic flow but otherwise

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,500
you're done because it mirrors all

36
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,439
retail sales in general right so once we

37
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,509
start to have the distribution and

38
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:35,908
delivery that is really well organized

39
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,560
through California then what you'd be

40
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,299
able to have is companies that

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,609
specialize been working with Humboldt

42
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,530
County products and you started to be

43
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:45,840
able to go forward you're going to have

44
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:49,349
very differentiated genetics in terms of

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,420
its stamped as its own well then those

46
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:52,978
companies might have those forms and

47
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,750
they want you to cultivate it I'm sure

48
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:56,519
the Sunkist doesn't let you just grow

49
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,069
whatever orange you want they give you

50
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,500
the orange they tell you what orange

51
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:03,298
they want they they control and if

52
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,989
you're in tobacco you're controlled if

53
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,770
you're in one

54
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:09,090
and champagne you're growing a very for

55
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:11,430
different type of grape that's it

56
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,709
and so each region to me would produce

57
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,840
things that were distinctive to this

58
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,330
region that were that shined in the

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,069
region that let the cultivators produce

60
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,170
common product so that you had the

61
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:24,238
ability to have enough product from

62
00:02:22,169 --> 00:02:26,549
Humboldt move across the whole state and

63
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,969
then eventually over throughout the US

64
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:32,910
in a level that gave them the ability to

65
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:35,039
buy it over and over again and what you

66
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:36,599
then would have is you have cultivators

67
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,909
that then would have little tiny niche

68
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,829
gardens on their bigger picture farm

69
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,870
that would then let them release a

70
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,700
seasonal kind of like breweries do a

71
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,349
seasonal beer release where they hey we

72
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:48,208
only brew this lambic once a year

73
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:51,989
because it's expensive to make we charge

74
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:53,849
more but we make less and I think that

75
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,080
that will follow suit because it does

76
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,829
with all these other things now the

77
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:01,200
cannabis is no longer held by us it's

78
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,510
open it'll follow like every other

79
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:05,729
product and I think that for us is we

80
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:07,018
just have to understand those changes

81
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:09,449
are going to occur by think we like it

82
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,769
or not and that what we need to do is is

83
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:15,479
build the farms build the infrastructure

84
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:18,599
Humboldt County produces world-class

85
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:19,949
cannabis period it always will the

86
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,108
climates to good

87
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,310
it just is ideal for really good or a

88
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:24,750
production you don't get it in the

89
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,430
Central Valley you don't get it in

90
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,810
Southern California you got to run

91
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,489
indoor there you've got to run in during

92
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,509
the desert you got to run indoor in the

93
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:32,969
Central Valley with it's the

94
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:34,530
contaminants you have to run into around

95
00:03:32,969 --> 00:03:37,439
the East Coast you got to run indoor in

96
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,120
Florida you got to run into a Texas you

97
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,699
can run outdoor through this all these

98
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,500
regions in this Northern California area

99
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,409
all the way into the Sierras so from the

100
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,180
Sierras north it's some of the best pop

101
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:50,449
grill and you can imagine till you get

102
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,389
up into like middle Oregon so that

103
00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:55,289
Southern Oregon Northern California

104
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:58,290
cluster is probably some of the best

105
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:59,400
cannabis growing on the planet I mean

106
00:03:58,289 --> 00:04:00,900
it's unbelievable all the other

107
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,099
countries you know we talk about these

108
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,079
other countries but they have humidity

109
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:05,818
issues too and so the things that grow

110
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,829
there are attractive to the customer any

111
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:10,500
more time wills will switch they'll be

112
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:13,019
great for biomass but for us for flower

113
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,770
for exquisite smoke these are the

114
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,510
regions where

115
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:17,610
you gonna get those outdoor products and

116
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:19,529
so humble just really has to come

117
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,000
together and it is you you're seeing all

118
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:23,039
these who these groups get together to

119
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,300
learn regenerative farming you're there

120
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,920
everybody is getting together you're

121
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,620
part of it you are putting together

122
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,480
groups to do combined buying for add

123
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,790
products so that's why everybody can get

124
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,439
a cheaper price you're getting people to

125
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,030
come in and say hey this is what I think

126
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:37,800
would move because I'm looking at the

127
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:40,229
data this is something that's no longer

128
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,480
moving instead of holding that

129
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:43,920
information you share it and you share

130
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,300
it with the clusters you're in because

131
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,430
you're all going to compete in a

132
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,410
different little realm and I think that

133
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,240
the positive part of poverty is that it

134
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,720
brings people together and I don't think

135
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,250
I've ever seen Humboldt so United which

136
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,310
is telling me because we've never been

137
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:02,790
so broke but we are all trying hard to

138
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,350
work together to figure it out and most

139
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,360
of us intend to stay here for the

140
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:09,000
duration I mean my goal is to die here

141
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,710
and hopefully not tomorrow but you know

142
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,079
when I'm older and I want to see the

143
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:15,389
farm that I built produce the cannabis

144
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:17,519
that I used to produce and I want to see

145
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:19,409
my kids be able to be part of that

146
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:22,079
industry in the future so that they have

147
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:24,120
something of value that took a lot of

148
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,490
work to get and I think that I'm no

149
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,410
different than anybody else I mean that

150
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,730
we're on the same exact bone and the

151
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,310
only differences I have is I have

152
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,810
multiple licenses so the multiple

153
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,639
licenses give me a different perspective

154
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,170
than most people because they see it

155
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,449
from either one of the other and I'm

156
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:43,830
seeing it for many at the same time and

157
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:47,149
I just know that right now why would you

158
00:05:43,829 --> 00:05:49,719
better be careful financially so beware

159
00:05:47,149 --> 00:06:03,188
all right thanks so much Kevin well

160
00:05:49,720 --> 00:06:03,189
