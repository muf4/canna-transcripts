1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,109
[Music]

2
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:09,300
well first of all nice bullet I gotta

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,759
mention that right off the bat

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,250
thank ya we were talking about different

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,780
psychedelics yesterday and guys do me a

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,500
favor to introduce yourselves yeah oh

7
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:22,829
sure yeah I'm Thane Evans and I'm Bryan

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,410
Jungers awesome

9
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:27,719
and we were talking about you live in

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:34,469
southwest area and grow San Pedro's

11
00:00:27,719 --> 00:00:36,420
yourself and I yeah in the backyard

12
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:41,910
under the mesquite trees got a lot of

13
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:43,170
Peruvian cacti and that region you know

14
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,398
there's there's peyote that grows but

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:47,489
it's really rare and it grows really

16
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,250
slow and you know peyote contains mescal

17
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:52,259
and just like the san pedro does san

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,570
pedro is a lot more amenable to

19
00:00:52,259 --> 00:01:01,558
cultivation as it grows very quickly you

20
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:04,019
can water every day and it's fantastic

21
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:07,250
yeah and I think Peruvian torches seem

22
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:10,020
to be more available generally speaking

23
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,030
and different horticultural centers

24
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:14,280
where you can pick up such unique plants

25
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,420
there's a place called companion plants

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,590
in Athens Ohio where I'm located and

27
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,269
yeah they have different things like

28
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:22,140
that

29
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:24,359
Peruvian torch is great because it's

30
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,250
consistently higher alkaloid content to

31
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,560
exam page was vary a lot and tend to be

32
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,849
a lower concentration but San Pedro is

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,118
more common

34
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:34,769
they're everywhere in the you often just

35
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:37,640
find them growing in people's yards or

36
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:41,340
you know in the parking lot at the bank

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,930
so do you create a garden have you build

38
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:44,640
a garden to grow them or what's the

39
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,868
growing environment that you've created

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,019
yeah I have raised beds and can you talk

41
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:56,430
a little bit about that sure yeah

42
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:59,060
so amended amended beds with a little

43
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,100
structure over the top so you can throw

44
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,370
some plastic over it during the winter

45
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:05,929
keep them warmer and happier

46
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:07,880
and then take it off in the summer when

47
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,950
it's hot I mean Tucson gets pretty hot

48
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:13,129
in the summer and you don't want to have

49
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:15,919
it you know under under plastic for the

50
00:02:13,129 --> 00:02:17,960
summer but no I mean I've grown them

51
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,539
just in pots too or you know bring them

52
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,300
indoors I used to live at 9,000 feet in

53
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:25,189
Colorado and had San Pedro up there and

54
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,719
you know you'd have to we didn't bring

55
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:28,819
him inside during the winter because it

56
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,800
was just too cold so is there a special

57
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:33,199
soil or what are you growing now well

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,850
the cacti really like calcium so you

59
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,709
want to have plenty of calcium in your

60
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:39,590
soil but other than that you actually

61
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:42,379
can't put too much nutrients in they'll

62
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,300
burn really quickly so like even I used

63
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:46,069
to make compost tea and I put it on all

64
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,780
my other plants all the plants love the

65
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:49,159
compost tea but you put it on the cacti

66
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,110
and the character I would actually start

67
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,490
to get these little scabs on them and so

68
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,810
you have to like back it way off and

69
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,730
like dilute the hell out of it to

70
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,349
actually make it something that cacti

71
00:02:55,729 --> 00:03:00,500
would like so like you got to be careful

72
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:01,969
with nutrients you can water even water

73
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,860
them every single day as long as your

74
00:03:01,969 --> 00:03:05,930
soil drains well they'll just grow and

75
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:08,120
grow and grow don't grow like a foot a

76
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:12,020
year or more depending on the size of

77
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,340
the cacti yeah you were saying you've

78
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:17,959
been through different methods of

79
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:20,360
consumption just raw and now often dry

80
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,629
out and put in capsule form yeah have

81
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,640
you ever seen a Christian raschi's Book

82
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:28,159
Encyclopedia of psychoactive plants yes

83
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:30,889
yeah that's what got me into this of

84
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,359
course I was in grad school at UC Davis

85
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:35,059
and I was wandering through the library

86
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,640
and I found his book and I pulled it out

87
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:40,280
on my what is this you know I'm like 20

88
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:42,199
to 23 years old and I start flipping

89
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,370
through it and I'm like I found San

90
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,958
Pedro and they're like wow that's

91
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,000
growing in the garden at the co-op's

92
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,580
where I live I'm like I had no idea this

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,370
was psychoactive and you know Christian

94
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,810
in his book he's got all these you know

95
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,710
recommendations on how people use it

96
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,810
like

97
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:59,939
historically and like the folk use of

98
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,670
these plants but also his own personal

99
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:04,409
context he's used it and you know so one

100
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:06,299
of the things he said was he would dry

101
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:08,009
and take capsules and gave

102
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,240
recommendations on dose of dosage so I

103
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:13,530
started trying that but I also will brew

104
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:17,430
brews with friends and we'll go out and

105
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:20,040
go on journeys in the nature and that's

106
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:22,230
a lot of fun so do you cut pieces of the

107
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,689
plan off or do you harvest the whole

108
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:27,480
cactus or how does that work oh yeah

109
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:31,079
always just cut cut pieces well cut cut

110
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,970
lengths of it and depending on what so

111
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,370
if you're going to like brew it you can

112
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,560
cut it cut a section chop it up into

113
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:39,480
little slices and brew it for six or

114
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,089
eight hours or whatever I'm gonna dry it

115
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:43,560
i'll you know define it cut it into tiny

116
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:45,659
little pieces to put a dehydrator for a

117
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,209
few days and dry it till it's like

118
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,710
crispy and then powder it in a like a

119
00:04:48,209 --> 00:04:51,899
coffee grinder and then put it in oil

120
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:54,659
capsules and so with the brew then would

121
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:58,819
you add alcohol or anything to help with

122
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,820
an extraction sort of lime juice

123
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:14,019
okay this is incredible so so how how

124
00:05:10,088 --> 00:05:20,740
powerful is this like how do you how do

125
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:22,899
you dos yeah so it's not I I find some

126
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,478
Peter to be really gentle as far as

127
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:28,179
psychedelics go it's really an emotional

128
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:31,028
experience and so if you take like one

129
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,439
gram of powder dry powder it just has

130
00:05:31,028 --> 00:05:34,689
like some sort of tonic effects like

131
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:36,189
it's a slightly notice perceptional

132
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:38,860
change if you're sensitive

133
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:40,718
but like it's it's more just like kind

134
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:41,649
of therapeutic cleansing if you take

135
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:44,139
four grams

136
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:46,509
you'll should notice like an emotional

137
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:48,819
response and heightened energy like it's

138
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:50,788
it's got you know mescaline is actually

139
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:53,740
a lot like MDMA it's actually got this

140
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:55,870
energy energizing sort of interesting

141
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,838
yeah sounds like more like an empath

142
00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:01,478
agent type experience yeah very much so

143
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:03,759
and like six grams is much more

144
00:06:01,478 --> 00:06:06,248
heightened more even like party and

145
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,319
dance and at 10 grams or 12 grams you're

146
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:11,409
talking full-on psychedelic experience

147
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,990
usually for most people so but it is

148
00:06:11,408 --> 00:06:16,360
conducive to micro to it 12 sort of

149
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,189
micro extent and that's that's typically

150
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,560
how I use it and you know unless I've

151
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:26,919
got other intentions to be popular these

152
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:31,538
days my so so just so I understand the

153
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:33,370
plants the the cactus will remain there

154
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:37,120
if the entire plant isn't cut down so

155
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:41,588
you're just constantly it continues to

156
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,689
grow and you just harvest from it so so

157
00:06:41,588 --> 00:06:47,110
so an individual doesn't need to

158
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:48,729
continuously plant new plants no it's I

159
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:52,088
mean it's a great plant to work with

160
00:06:48,728 --> 00:06:54,158
because you cut it and it will it'll dry

161
00:06:52,088 --> 00:06:56,228
and scab will the cut or the cut part

162
00:06:54,158 --> 00:06:58,509
will continue to grow you'll have

163
00:06:56,228 --> 00:07:00,668
usually like two or more will grow out

164
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:02,860
of that same spot and if it falls over

165
00:07:00,668 --> 00:07:05,709
it will usually start to grow again I've

166
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,959
had cuttings sitting in my garage for

167
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:09,668
six months or longer and I take them out

168
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,930
and they're growing new growths like

169
00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:12,029
they're still alive and they're still

170
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,340
trying to put out

171
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:15,989
like you can't stop these things they've

172
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:17,879
got so much life in them so if someone

173
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,319
wanted to grow some of these what would

174
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:21,540
they do how would they go about doing

175
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,909
that did you do you you go grow from a

176
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,280
cutting from yeah you would you go out

177
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,350
and find it wild and it would you do

178
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,239
hard-to-find while you might find it

179
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:31,530
growing and like I said like landscaping

180
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,980
that you sent landscaping all the time

181
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:37,769
you go to Home Depot or any nursery they

182
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:39,629
usually have them but even if you just

183
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:41,099
took a cutting from someone the only

184
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:42,750
thing you really need to make sure to do

185
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,950
is let it scab over before you try to

186
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,339
plant it so wait let me get this

187
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:49,610
straight

188
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:49,609
Home Depot is selling psychedelic cacti

189
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,909
I mean I'm sure some people working in

190
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,319
taking all the ones that don't look so

191
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:09,569
good after a while it's getting a huge

192
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:11,040
collection and starting them up you

193
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:12,689
don't want to put it directly in the

194
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,819
ground if you've just cut it fresh

195
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:15,779
because they can rock the bottom can rot

196
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,370
and it won't root well

197
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,379
so usually you let it sit for a few days

198
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,970
in scab and be totally you know scabbed

199
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,350
and dry and then you can put it in and

200
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,290
then it'll start to put roots right out

201
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:29,580
so to have it refocus its energy after

202
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:31,500
it's healed itself back are there other

203
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:34,279
people that you know of that are into

204
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:42,330
this particular plant I mean is this

205
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:43,110
like it's becoming a lot more popular in

206
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,780
recent years

207
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:48,090
you ever watch Hamilton's pharmacopoeia

208
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:51,149
I'm assuming here you like Hamilton is a

209
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,889
big fan like he went in the last episode

210
00:08:51,149 --> 00:08:57,629
I've seen of that show he went down to

211
00:08:52,889 --> 00:09:00,059
Peru and studied under a shaman who's

212
00:08:57,629 --> 00:09:02,070
the San Pedro shaman and the guy asked

213
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:03,539
him just like so are you religious he's

214
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,590
like well I'm kind of an atheist but if

215
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:07,889
I had a religion it would be in this

216
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:09,930
campus so so you had mentioned altitude

217
00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:12,720
and obviously Peru is like you know

218
00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:16,589
pretty much up and down so does altitude

219
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:19,350
have an effect on how this cactus grows

220
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:21,030
or flower producers or

221
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,320
question I actually really don't know I

222
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:23,939
mean it would have been nice if I had

223
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,850
known more about it when I was living at

224
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:30,870
9,000 feet and compared to live down

225
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:33,120
lower but I just know it if where I live

226
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,190
in Tucson if I leave them out in the

227
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,810
direct Sun like full Sun they get

228
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,970
unhappy to start to yellow because it's

229
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:40,739
just too intense so they really like to

230
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,970
be under the mesquite and they love

231
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,139
especially when it's hot it allowed to

232
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,070
be watered every day and they'll just

233
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:48,689
grow grow so they they they love water

234
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:51,540
yeah because if in brew it rains a lot

235
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,740
where they grow but it's a cactus but

236
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:54,089
it's a cactus yeah which is confusing

237
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,409
for a lot of people they're like you

238
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,360
know you don't want to overwater cactus

239
00:09:55,409 --> 00:10:00,089
but that's not a problem with San Pedro

240
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,759
as long as the roots drain drain well if

241
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:05,790
the roots get soggy then they will mold

242
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:08,129
and and get mushy so what are you guys

243
00:10:05,789 --> 00:10:11,039
seeing overall just in general in terms

244
00:10:08,129 --> 00:10:13,019
of the psychedelics movement like you

245
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,990
know because it's really happening right

246
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:18,090
well I mean it's fantastic Oakland

247
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:21,450
you know extending the language to

248
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:24,240
entheogen is at large which is in Santa

249
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:28,340
Cruz yeah so kind of taking you know

250
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,149
again Denver's lead on legalization here

251
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:33,060
transforming it and expanding it is

252
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:36,659
fantastic ayahuasca ceremonies obviously

253
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:38,759
becoming more popular in the States

254
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:41,250
yeah it's very interesting and like you

255
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:42,809
said micro dosing of course is now you

256
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,519
know on the rise as far as trying to

257
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,179
understand the therapeutic potential

258
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,179
there

259
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:52,229
of course consciousness potential is

260
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:54,750
just pretty much off the charts I mean

261
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:57,889
are you guys who believe that you know

262
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,370
done right it could make for a better

263
00:10:57,889 --> 00:11:01,590
world

264
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,379
oh yeah there's no question right I

265
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:06,750
definitely believe that and I mean I

266
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:09,269
believe the only reason it's illegal is

267
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:13,200
because it pose so much of a threat to

268
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:15,360
the oppressing classes and you know now

269
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,250
that it's coming back around and we have

270
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,740
that opportunity to have it done right

271
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,779
and use properly and and get the

272
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,149
benefits from it what about commercial

273
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:26,419
pretend like commercial like on the

274
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:30,620
market you know is that gonna happen

275
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:34,529
I've heard rumors about yeah

276
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:38,669
yes there's a company silo that has

277
00:11:34,529 --> 00:11:42,240
first nasal-spray actually suicide so

278
00:11:38,669 --> 00:11:44,699
it's more of a micro dose administration

279
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,710
so I think you know if you've had enough

280
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,470
micro doses you could probably get out

281
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:52,530
of Colorado or more I forget where

282
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:54,269
they're based out of the yeah relatively

283
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:56,459
new company the research I believe was

284
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:59,789
done in Jamaica where apparently there's

285
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:02,970
a extremely wide variety of psychedelic

286
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:04,769
mushroom species and so some research is

287
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,710
going on there now it's pretty pretty

288
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:10,259
incredible so but so you're dabbling

289
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:11,850
this for your own purposes and friends

290
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,789
and stuff like that do you have any

291
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:18,110
plans to expand your garden and you know

292
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:18,110
to grow other types

293
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:23,639
yeah I mean I would I've grown my

294
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:25,559
shrooms before neither problem with

295
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:27,419
mushroom growing for me was it was very

296
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,729
interesting and fascinating at first in

297
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:31,979
these very sterile environments right

298
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:34,230
like oh just the ability to do it and

299
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,220
then once you've done it then you have

300
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,480
to keep doing it over and over

301
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:38,040
everything has to be so sterile because

302
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,259
you don't want to be get contamination

303
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,549
right and I didn't like having to

304
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,950
sterilize the shit

305
00:12:41,549 --> 00:12:46,709
my the grow environment constantly and

306
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:48,180
if I could grow outdoors like again

307
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,879
Hamilton's pharmacopoeia one of the

308
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:52,319
episodes he's he's down in in South

309
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,240
America and he goes and finds this guy

310
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,190
growing mushrooms and actually he's in

311
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,560
Oaxaca and he's there growing mushrooms

312
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:00,570
on sugar cane scraps and the mushrooms

313
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:16,619
are insane like they're growing so well

314
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:18,600
and it's like so they need do they need

315
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:22,860
also a moist environment like a lot of

316
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:25,080
so put particular environments like yeah

317
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:27,210
like outside I I don't really I mean

318
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:29,220
could they grow wild don't they these

319
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:31,320
over a while and it's you know different

320
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,320
varieties obviously want different

321
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,090
environments or grow in partnership with

322
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,550
different types of trees right so they

323
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,889
want to be like companion growing along

324
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:44,549
with the root systems of these different

325
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:46,350
trees so it's it can be really hard to

326
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:48,559
actually cultivate certain types of

327
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:51,090
mushrooms sure morels come to mind

328
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:53,250
yeah symbiotic relationship that's

329
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,740
imperative to their growth that's why

330
00:13:53,250 --> 00:14:01,769
they're you know very hard to grow

331
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:05,070
commercially psychedelic side there's

332
00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:07,199
very difficult to replicate so it would

333
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,910
only make sense to do it because if

334
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,640
there's a cost associated with that

335
00:14:08,909 --> 00:14:13,980
there's the effort you know the time and

336
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:16,350
you'll all the yields are are not

337
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,470
massive right no and so that's what most

338
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:21,330
people focus on like the cubensis right

339
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,800
because the yields are good and it's

340
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:25,680
consistent it's rate well it sounds like

341
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,659
your cactus has nice yields - yes the

342
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,539
cactus is very it's very favorable and

343
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:32,980
it's just not really known or really

344
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:36,669
widely applied

345
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:39,610
outside of Peru quick question in terms

346
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:42,250
of dosing so that five grams 10 grams 12

347
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:44,800
grams range is that dried then yeah

348
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:46,269
dried count that's that's a lot yeah

349
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,389
that's pretty incredible when you

350
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:52,778
consider you know five grams of cubensis

351
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:55,180
is the big boy dose you know terence

352
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:58,870
mckenna's notion of that being in a

353
00:14:55,179 --> 00:15:00,609
full-ride if you will so that's you know

354
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:02,679
double that so that's just kind of

355
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,899
interested you know wonder if back to

356
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:07,899
the environment and like genetic

357
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:10,799
expression maybe of the cacti if it

358
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:14,049
varies in its in Peru and if the

359
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:17,229
altitude actually plays into the level

360
00:15:14,049 --> 00:15:19,448
of you know psychedelic compounds that

361
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:22,320
are produced mescaline that's produced I

362
00:15:19,448 --> 00:15:25,379
do so is that is that the active

363
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,540
ingredient in this plant masculine

364
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:31,689
masculine most famous there are other

365
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:34,179
alkaloids as well that are present but

366
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:36,010
you know like I said like that the

367
00:15:34,179 --> 00:15:39,099
masculine content in San Pedro is much

368
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:40,720
lower than in peyote it's lower than in

369
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:42,970
Peruvian torch so if you were going to

370
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,528
do the same thing as improving torch you

371
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:50,920
probably use half the dosage so San

372
00:15:47,528 --> 00:15:55,389
Pedro is relatively you know low

373
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:57,189
concentrations but so with that with

374
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:59,078
that with that well how many grams worth

375
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:17,079
five grams of dried what would you do

376
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:21,399
make a tea I you know it may be a little

377
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:25,399
brew as well you don't have to can you

378
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:29,509
make cookies can you make

379
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:37,549
you know use it baking sonic I could

380
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:39,110
have dishes dishes savory yeah because I

381
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:45,529
mean you can brew it for hours and hours

382
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:47,539
and hours and makes me think too if

383
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:49,009
there's other alkaloids that you know we

384
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:51,079
aren't really even aware of yet that

385
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:53,929
creates sort of the synergy or entourage

386
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:56,270
as with cannabis cannabinoids and

387
00:16:53,929 --> 00:17:00,019
turkeys and flavonoids and if there's

388
00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:03,829
maybe something going on there that sort

389
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:08,690
of influences more of the empathic genic

390
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:14,269
experience versus psychedelic experience

391
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:16,459
with I would imagine yeah I mean I think

392
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:17,930
it's virtually unstudied and and like we

393
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:22,490
were talking about like which things

394
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:24,410
affect you know your alkaloid content we

395
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,660
really have no idea at this point

396
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,620
because there's all these different

397
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:29,960
studies that have been done since like

398
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:31,429
the 50s and assays and they all come up

399
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,259
with different results even from the

400
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,789
same stand of plants interesting

401
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:36,619
different results so they have no idea

402
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:38,629
that that you know that implies that

403
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:40,849
there are meant there's a lot at work

404
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:43,160
here all different variables that could

405
00:17:40,849 --> 00:17:47,029
be elevation it could be any number of

406
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:50,029
factors if the results are different I

407
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:53,000
mean how could it be otherwise that's

408
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:54,920
really interesting which sort of also

409
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,220
implies there's like more potential you

410
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,779
know within this plant you know once

411
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,870
it's understood how do you know about

412
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:04,519
the mescaline content then and those

413
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:06,729
different Out Boy's with somewhere some

414
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:09,650
studies done some studies have been done

415
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:13,490
you know there are some that are in the

416
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:16,810
Christian Ross book there is trout's

417
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:16,809
notes are you aware

418
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:22,700
remember it's like stories from trout

419
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:27,109
there's a guy named trout who's done a

420
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:29,000
lot of work around San Pedro more than

421
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:31,339
just about anybody in like the in the

422
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:37,279
lay field and so he's published a lot

423
00:18:31,339 --> 00:18:40,189
under it synonym or what yeah just a

424
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:43,668
false name yeah what does the plant look

425
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:47,240
like what is yeah oh it's a colander

426
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:51,288
cactus it grows up very phallic tall

427
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:54,650
green sometimes very very big usually

428
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:57,230
one name will grow from one main stalk

429
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:58,820
and you'll usually get a few coming out

430
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:02,960
of the base or sometimes just one

431
00:18:58,819 --> 00:19:03,950
they'll grow next to each other but and

432
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,909
what color is it

433
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:11,380
it's it's a fairly bright green bright

434
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:14,740
green yeah is it flower

435
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:18,110
yeah these beautiful white trumpeting

436
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:20,659
flowers when it does flower and do they

437
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:23,168
have any use the flowers I don't know

438
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:25,429
they tend to wilt and die very quickly

439
00:19:23,169 --> 00:19:28,820
they're gorgeous they smell wonderful

440
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:31,009
but I have no idea they're useful for so

441
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:34,759
they so that this plant contains

442
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:37,720
terpenes as well with the flower dude

443
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:44,230
you know though I don't know

444
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:47,200
zhenia fragrance yeah yeah most plants

445
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:57,710
yeah interesting you pick witness

446
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:59,930
compounds where is this happening in

447
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,890
Arizona I'm based in Tucson in Tucson

448
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:04,070
yeah okay

449
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,780
yeah and Tucson has a community a fairly

450
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:07,369
significant community of folks that are

451
00:20:05,779 --> 00:20:09,849
in this space you know we're like the

452
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:12,739
epicenter of where the the bufo alvarius

453
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:16,069
toads the Colorado River toad that has

454
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,690
the five amino DMT and poison sacs yeah

455
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:20,240
that's that's where they're indigenous

456
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:22,910
to yeah so interesting I wonder if

457
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,569
there's other plants with similar you

458
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:28,429
know capabilities that we don't know

459
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:30,439
about growing out in the desert there's

460
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:34,309
a ton of suspicion around the acacia

461
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:36,500
--is in DMT content right so a lot of

462
00:20:34,308 --> 00:20:38,539
occasions have been found to have DMT

463
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,420
and there are all these acacia trees

464
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:44,960
that have not been studied or profiled

465
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:50,750
yet and so I haven't haven't dug into

466
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:52,610
the science of it too much well thanks

467
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,529
you guys anything you want to add about

468
00:20:52,609 --> 00:20:58,419
those stages just a couple more things

469
00:20:54,529 --> 00:21:01,160
yeah hilarious grass is another you know

470
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:03,860
opportunity cool yeah likewise haven't

471
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:07,610
really done anything with it but fun to

472
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:09,109
grow and speaking of Mao lies which we

473
00:21:07,609 --> 00:21:10,658
were talking about yesterday maybe just

474
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:13,148
a brief note on

475
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:15,909
what people could seek out to

476
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:20,858
potentially expand and extend a

477
00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:23,259
psychedelic experience through sure yeah

478
00:21:20,858 --> 00:21:28,798
and I'm actually growing a Bannister

479
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:40,929
offices cap I as well yeah likewise

480
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:43,148
the secretary yeah I mean it's a

481
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:45,700
tropical plant it really likes just to

482
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:48,128
be under like an understory growing up

483
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,379
on other on trees at the plants so it's

484
00:21:48,128 --> 00:21:51,908
a little it's out I have it outdoor it

485
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:54,339
hates the winter as soon as it starts to

486
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:56,619
get cold it dies back but I've had it

487
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:59,199
for I think it's like ten years old at

488
00:21:56,618 --> 00:22:02,259
this point so how big is it how many

489
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,970
leaves are on oh I could show you some

490
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:06,639
pictures it's gotten it got really big

491
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:08,259
this year it was finding out like taking

492
00:22:06,638 --> 00:22:10,118
over the whole whole area if it had

493
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:11,798
stayed warm I wouldn't just kept going

494
00:22:10,118 --> 00:22:14,079
it was super happy and it was the

495
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:16,868
compost tea that I was using on that one

496
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:19,178
it just loved it so because I was using

497
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:20,769
bat guano and the back one oh just was

498
00:22:19,179 --> 00:22:23,830
exactly what it wanted and it just went

499
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:25,929
crazy but yeah I mean vanna stream is

500
00:22:23,829 --> 00:22:28,329
great other mm eyes like we were talking

501
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:30,519
about passiflora the passionflower it to

502
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:32,618
be a little careful with that but it

503
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:34,329
works really well toxic in high doses

504
00:22:32,618 --> 00:22:36,608
yeah it's the same way nutmeg is very

505
00:22:34,329 --> 00:22:39,308
similar like toxic and high doses but

506
00:22:36,608 --> 00:22:40,058
it's a very effective Mao I you know

507
00:22:39,308 --> 00:22:42,038
when use properly

508
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:45,908
what's an MAOI monoamine oxidase

509
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:48,069
inhibitor essentially it inhibits

510
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:51,489
enzymes in your stomach so that you were

511
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:54,649
able able to process and then bring to

512
00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:57,350
your brain other psychoactive

513
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:59,960
without them breaking down along the way

514
00:22:57,349 --> 00:23:02,959
and so yeah expanding and extending your

515
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,450
experience essentially yeah it's very

516
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,230
it's economizing to really reduce how

517
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:12,558
much you take those in conjunction with

518
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:13,579
other with your with your psychedelic is

519
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:18,950
that how that works

520
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:21,919
yeah yep and and so does it make desert

521
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:24,590
does it increase the intensity or just

522
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,480
prolong your experience or it really

523
00:23:24,589 --> 00:23:28,369
depends what you're taking and also this

524
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,490
is I just want to say this is a very

525
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:33,439
sensitive area because right absolutely

526
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:39,890
there's some there's some dangerous

527
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:41,808
aspects to combining meos with just like

528
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,370
it's sort of like don't do this at home

529
00:23:41,808 --> 00:23:45,170
unless you know what you're doing

530
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:46,159
yeah no you definitely need to know what

531
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,410
you're doing if you're playing with ma

532
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:52,340
rice because they because they inhibit

533
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:54,470
your your digestive tract people there's

534
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:56,959
they call it toxic cheese syndrome or

535
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,970
like there's certain ferments wines

536
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,519
cheese's that can actually kill you if

537
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:05,960
you are if you're have a high dose of

538
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:07,789
maoi and you consume these foods so and

539
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,890
there's contraindications so often like

540
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:10,940
if you are on an MAOI there's lots of

541
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,970
other drugs they tell you not to take

542
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,650
we're not using so very good side yes

543
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:19,970
yeah more of a you know just a

544
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:21,769
conversation about potential right

545
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,140
anyone you know interested in this

546
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:26,170
subject obviously you know a lot of

547
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,460
research is is required before

548
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:32,330
experimentation and so it's not really

549
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:33,860
advocating necessarily the use but the

550
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:37,009
conversation is very intriguing

551
00:24:33,859 --> 00:24:39,649
obviously and the notion that Oakland

552
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:40,910
Santa Cruz now have again expanded that

553
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,860
language kind of back to where we

554
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:45,529
started here to include in theo jhin's

555
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:47,479
at large is is the notion that you know

556
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:49,099
society is interested in exploring these

557
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,769
compounds and trying to determine their

558
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:53,750
therapeutic potential and how they can

559
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:54,859
really help shape the world that we live

560
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,829
in

561
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:59,990
contribute to what touching out you

562
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:04,339
mentioned earlier seems to be sort of a

563
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:05,900
spiritual battle in a way and so that's

564
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:10,009
really what the conversation is about I

565
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:11,980
think at large just to be clear light

566
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:15,349
disclaimer

567
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:17,539
we've disclaimed we're just talking here

568
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:20,629
but but but but the insider talk you

569
00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:22,519
know is a value in P and and it's not

570
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:24,050
like people aren't using these in doing

571
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:29,389
these that's why the conversation is

572
00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:32,089
important right yeah actually what a lot

573
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:33,620
of it comes down to for me and people

574
00:25:32,089 --> 00:25:35,509
should have the opportunity to do what

575
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:37,369
they want within their their own skull

576
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:39,379
but but we but it's providing

577
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:41,349
information you know so that people

578
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:44,930
don't go out there you know without the

579
00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:47,480
proper knowledge that they need

580
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:51,650
not everybody is necessarily as careful

581
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:53,930
so you know really speak away yeah it's

582
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,519
the psychedelic reticence of sorts

583
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:57,259
happening and we're and that means we're

584
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,539
coming out of the Dark Ages so there's

585
00:25:57,259 --> 00:26:03,259
lots of misinformation and just total

586
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:07,180
absence of information that for a minute

587
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:10,789
because what do you think are the

588
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:13,820
largest bullet points or misinformation

589
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:15,289
like that people in general or that you

590
00:26:13,819 --> 00:26:19,429
know for a fact might misunderstand

591
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:21,819
about you you know this this area I mean

592
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:25,460
one of my big one for me is the

593
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:27,950
psychedelic determinism that this drug

594
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,620
does this thing to this person always

595
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:34,220
right that like I took this drug so

596
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:36,309
therefore I must do XY and Z almost like

597
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:39,350
you have no choice or no control over

598
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:41,779
over yourself yeah think of reefer

599
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:44,569
madness and how cannabis is a gateway

600
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:47,538
drug to heroin addiction which is you

601
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:50,329
know what the narrative was

602
00:26:47,538 --> 00:26:52,878
mid-1900s exactly it's very complicated

603
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:54,710
and that's part of the other words

604
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:59,569
you're saying you're not in control of

605
00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:01,608
this experience the the product or

606
00:26:59,569 --> 00:27:04,608
whatever it is is controlling you and

607
00:27:01,608 --> 00:27:06,288
that's not I think it's a product of the

608
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:08,298
fear-mongering honestly you know there's

609
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:10,878
all these scare stories that have been

610
00:27:08,298 --> 00:27:13,908
out there you know every drug scare

611
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:17,748
story PCP and I mean you can name so

612
00:27:13,909 --> 00:27:20,239
many crocodile from from Russia it's

613
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:22,038
always as if like this drug it's just

614
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:24,200
controlling this person and making them

615
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:25,489
do crazy things right and and often you

616
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,098
know people that do really crazy things

617
00:27:25,489 --> 00:27:30,798
on drugs we're in a fairly fragile or

618
00:27:28,098 --> 00:27:33,378
maybe a really bad spot before the drugs

619
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:36,348
were introduced to the situation so I

620
00:27:33,378 --> 00:27:39,288
mean yeah there's a lot of things at

621
00:27:36,348 --> 00:27:41,358
play and so it's it's kind of it's very

622
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:45,019
naive it's like drug naivete it should

623
00:27:41,358 --> 00:27:47,239
just be like the idea of the

624
00:27:45,019 --> 00:27:49,909
predetermine ISM with psychedelics is

625
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:51,288
that as especially problematic but but

626
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:54,320
is that especially acute with

627
00:27:51,288 --> 00:27:57,919
psychedelics this idea that that I'm not

628
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:59,960
in control of my ultimate experience is

629
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,340
that is that the pet peeve I think I

630
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,679
think it's very common yeah because it

631
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:05,749
is a very intense experience and and

632
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,419
there's this ego death experience part

633
00:28:05,749 --> 00:28:10,249
piece of it and yeah and sometimes you

634
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:12,799
aren't you aren't in control but you did

635
00:28:10,249 --> 00:28:15,139
make a choice and you just have to like

636
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:17,358
set setting dose are very very important

637
00:28:15,138 --> 00:28:18,709
with psychedelics right so knowing where

638
00:28:17,358 --> 00:28:21,618
you are who you with what your

639
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:25,788
intentions are what your initial mindset

640
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:27,949
was before you went into it as

641
00:28:25,788 --> 00:28:31,548
anecdotally I said last night of years

642
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:33,979
ago not not not willfully of my own

643
00:28:31,548 --> 00:28:36,950
accord but I ended up tripping with my

644
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:39,409
mother and maintained and everything was

645
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:42,919
fine and and then in fact you you you

646
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:46,669
can control your experience and and and

647
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:48,739
and that's just a fact but you might

648
00:28:46,669 --> 00:28:49,460
need to you know be experienced a little

649
00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:51,980
bit

650
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,309
yeah and you your willpower is very

651
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,309
strong

652
00:28:55,869 --> 00:29:02,859
yeah maybe we'll do a part two sound

653
00:28:59,569 --> 00:29:02,859
thanks you guys
