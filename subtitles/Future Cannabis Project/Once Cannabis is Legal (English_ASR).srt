1
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:20,899
our topic of course for the next hour is

2
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:22,460
once it's legal I'm getting into the

3
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:25,038
business and we're lucky because we have

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:27,859
a good panel here this afternoon those

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,230
panelists come from a bunch of diverse

6
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:31,759
backgrounds for better for worse there's

7
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,170
three attorneys up on stage right now

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,379
but we'll do our best to keep you awake

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:40,370
for the next hour so let's get started

10
00:00:36,378 --> 00:00:42,108
Matt with perhaps and grab a microphone

11
00:00:40,369 --> 00:00:44,088
if you would please please give us a

12
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:48,198
perspective very very general overview

13
00:00:44,088 --> 00:00:51,888
perspective on how business and land use

14
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:56,509
issues come down upon the marijuana

15
00:00:51,889 --> 00:00:58,940
industry when you're a new operator I am

16
00:00:56,509 --> 00:01:01,878
a primarily a corporate and tax lawyer

17
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:03,829
and have some regulatory experience but

18
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:06,259
I rely upon my my partners and our

19
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:08,478
government and land-use practice groups

20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:11,870
to kind of do the heavy lifting in that

21
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:13,429
area if we're focusing on California

22
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,859
only is that is that kind of what we're

23
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,480
talking about I think California is a

24
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:19,519
good aspect of it but let's talk

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,260
generally because I think folks here

26
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,909
really want to hear about what's

27
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:27,380
happening from a broader perspective as

28
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:29,479
well well I think the you know people

29
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:31,310
are calling this a Green Rush they want

30
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,350
to jump into this industry and I think

31
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,079
it's important to take a step back and

32
00:01:33,349 --> 00:01:40,369
really explore the regulatory land-use

33
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,950
side of the equation before going

34
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:45,859
full-bore and submitting applications

35
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:49,370
and raising funds from investors or even

36
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:53,780
worse spending your own money yeah is

37
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:55,609
that better thank you so I mean it in my

38
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:59,090
personal experience and doing deals

39
00:01:55,609 --> 00:02:04,370
because that's what I do i do deals like

40
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:07,060
Donald Trump I guess and we we've done a

41
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:10,610
lot of transactions in multiple cities

42
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:13,370
in Southern California now

43
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:20,270
in desert hot springs in cathedral city

44
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:22,700
in adelanto in Santa Ana doing some some

45
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:25,790
transactional work first of its kind in

46
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:29,329
lynnwood Cudahy but the common

47
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:31,879
denominator is really with the land use

48
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:34,010
piece you know most of this stuff these

49
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,750
are discretionary entitlements in some

50
00:02:34,009 --> 00:02:38,299
cases you don't even have permits or

51
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:43,310
licenses you have development agreements

52
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:46,280
and it's it's complicated stuff and I

53
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:50,469
think it's very very important to grasp

54
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,489
that side of it if you want to be a a

55
00:02:50,469 --> 00:02:56,209
regulated you know legal cannabis

56
00:02:52,489 --> 00:03:00,200
business whether you're a producer you

57
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:04,819
know retail testing you know extraction

58
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:07,969
processing type stuff and you know every

59
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:12,560
especially now while we're in this sort

60
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:16,069
of new regulated world that's coming our

61
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,009
way every local jurisdiction is

62
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:22,819
different and we've had a lot of clients

63
00:03:19,009 --> 00:03:25,519
that have you know tried to go about

64
00:03:22,819 --> 00:03:28,159
this on their own or went to kind of

65
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:32,030
like a criminally sort of a criminal

66
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:35,840
lawyers you know / repurposed cannabis

67
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:41,269
lawyer and they've they've been gravely

68
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:43,069
disappointed in in going down a you know

69
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:45,860
sort of a circular path and spending

70
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:48,669
lots of money and then either running

71
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,630
afoul hula or simply not getting

72
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:53,859
entitlements to do what they want to do

73
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:56,150
so just as a general recommendation

74
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:58,130
survey the landscape and make sure you

75
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,640
have a really really good regulatory

76
00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:04,699
sort of land use professional to to

77
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:07,099
guide you from from the beginning so so

78
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:08,899
mad that's a good point ultimately when

79
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:11,090
you're looking at legal services for the

80
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:14,180
marijuana industry one thing to think

81
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:17,329
about is and this sort of happens in a

82
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,949
standard way state by state by state and

83
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:20,590
that is

84
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:22,269
at the beginning the attorneys that tend

85
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:23,979
to be popular if you will in the

86
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:26,949
cannabis industry are those that were

87
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:29,500
criminal defense attorneys or perhaps

88
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:31,539
activist attorneys or perhaps folks that

89
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,639
worked in various local government or

90
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,860
state government offices and those folks

91
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:38,319
are our quality and you need them to get

92
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:40,449
along the way but as these issues become

93
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,730
more complex when you have a regulatory

94
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:44,500
structure and local regulations you

95
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:47,500
really need to drill down and find that

96
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:50,949
area of expertise expertise to apply the

97
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:53,319
different standards that apply so Leslie

98
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:56,889
let's talk about standards why our

99
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:59,709
standards important for the cannabis

100
00:04:56,889 --> 00:05:01,689
industry moving forward and perhaps you

101
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:03,719
can start with what to standard how does

102
00:05:01,689 --> 00:05:07,959
the standard to differentiate from a

103
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,280
regulation or statute sure and so the

104
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,459
difference between a standard and a

105
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,619
regulation is the regulations are

106
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:17,949
created by government agencies licensing

107
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:20,050
agencies and they have the the force of

108
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:22,599
the law behind them standards are

109
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:25,210
actually guidelines that just give a

110
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,300
business owner the right foundation to

111
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:31,000
assure quality safety and consistency in

112
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:34,620
any other industry outside of cannabis

113
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:38,470
if its food drug pharma device

114
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:40,870
ag-related there's a division of the

115
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:42,430
federal government that licenses those

116
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:46,360
businesses and they do that through good

117
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:48,040
manufacturing practices because cannabis

118
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,990
is scheduled one the federal government

119
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,030
has stepped out of this situation so as

120
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,879
the industry has developed across the US

121
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:58,029
state by state state regulators and

122
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:59,560
business owners are left to decide what

123
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:01,179
the rule should be how we should do this

124
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:03,730
without any guidance from a good

125
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,590
manufacturing practice standpoint so

126
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,360
what we've done is create good

127
00:06:05,589 --> 00:06:09,250
manufacturing practice guidelines for

128
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,610
all aspects of the industry whether its

129
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:15,759
cultivation retail extraction infused

130
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:19,270
products lab security sustainability

131
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:22,420
packaging and labeling to help business

132
00:06:19,269 --> 00:06:24,219
owners protect their liability to reduce

133
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,960
costs and to ensure that they're

134
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,390
producing a safe and consistent product

135
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,769
as well as to help regulators understand

136
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:31,800
how to better regulate because

137
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:34,329
if the regulation is based on a standard

138
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,970
your very standards have to be

139
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:38,500
continually updated every three months

140
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,419
so you don't have to change the

141
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:44,470
regulation every time the industry grows

142
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:46,089
you just change the standard so is

143
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,979
everyone in this room ripped by a show

144
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:51,519
hands familiar with the nutraceuticals

145
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:53,348
or the natural product industry so the

146
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:56,680
nutraceuticals industry is a good

147
00:06:53,348 --> 00:06:59,288
example in terms of a model for where

148
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,228
the cannabis industry is going for folks

149
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:05,050
in California you might look at this

150
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:07,269
top-down regulation with mercy and

151
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:08,978
ultimately the potential don't use

152
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:10,810
recreational ballot measure in November

153
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:12,250
and how that will affect things what you

154
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:14,228
need to understand is when you

155
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,209
effectuate this top-down regulation

156
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:18,370
things are going to change but going

157
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:20,068
back to the nutraceuticals model now

158
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,930
this is an industry that's effectively

159
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:25,270
self-regulated self policed how did that

160
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:27,759
happen it happened because it created

161
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:30,339
its own standards it created its own

162
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,129
rules so that consumers were protected

163
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:35,079
so that there was no miss classification

164
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:36,908
or misrepresentation of what was in the

165
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,189
product by way of labeling and those

166
00:07:36,908 --> 00:07:42,370
standards ultimately what they became

167
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:44,348
adopted by the federal government as the

168
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,389
regulations for the state so it's

169
00:07:44,348 --> 00:07:48,819
critically important to a embrace

170
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:51,250
regulation but even further than that

171
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:53,468
these local governments are going to in

172
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,439
effect create regulations that are

173
00:07:53,468 --> 00:07:58,718
minimal at the beginning it's important

174
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:01,870
to embrace the idea that standards need

175
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:04,449
to be enacted and achieved across the

176
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,459
board so that the regulations can can

177
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:08,770
actually be meaningful and so that you

178
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:11,888
can police the industry yourself and not

179
00:08:08,769 --> 00:08:13,899
ultimately have things imposed upon you

180
00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:16,180
that will you know make the cost of

181
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:17,769
business the example I always give of

182
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,598
that is if you look at the fracking

183
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:22,598
industry right nobody really thinks

184
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:26,468
fracking is a good thing its fracking

185
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:28,209
bad right but they've got tons less

186
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:31,329
regulations than anybody in the cannabis

187
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:33,848
industry why because as an industry they

188
00:08:31,329 --> 00:08:35,588
got together and adopted standards and

189
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,539
then the regulations are based on the

190
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:39,039
standards so

191
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:42,639
and sometimes it's not good enough to

192
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:45,069
say for example they want to treat us as

193
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,230
the cannabis industry differently that's

194
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,430
something to be cognizant of but they

195
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,959
are going to treat this industry

196
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:52,120
differently and you have to embrace that

197
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:54,099
god yeah i'd really like to ask a

198
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,068
question of exactly what you're dressing

199
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,620
I think there's a situation going on we

200
00:08:57,068 --> 00:09:01,599
can categorize as blowback okay there

201
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,129
are people who are just angry about the

202
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,120
fact that we're getting what we want and

203
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:09,250
so that's preventing them from it's just

204
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,470
it's skewing their thoughts from having

205
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,850
sensible regulation and I think that

206
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,129
going into this we have to be a little

207
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,589
bit wary of that as well that we are

208
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:18,759
being prejudiced against and that there

209
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:22,089
is no other industry that they would

210
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:25,659
consider taxing twenty five percent so

211
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:28,240
I'm all for rent regulation legalization

212
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:29,649
through taxation same as any other

213
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,318
industry but I would just like everybody

214
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:36,789
to be aware that we are with we are

215
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:39,879
being being prejudiced against and that

216
00:09:36,789 --> 00:09:41,318
we have we we can't be weak or modest

217
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,689
about that we have to be able to stand

218
00:09:41,318 --> 00:09:45,669
up and say twenty-five percent how can

219
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:48,850
you do that to us what you know I just

220
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:53,349
wanted to why do you think we are

221
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:55,810
getting proposals that are so so you

222
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,959
know truce in the amounts that they're

223
00:09:55,809 --> 00:10:00,578
asking us to pay big black yeah well

224
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,929
that's right that's very well said thank

225
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:03,129
you so the point was we're going to be

226
00:10:01,929 --> 00:10:05,049
treated differently for those of you

227
00:10:03,129 --> 00:10:06,789
that may not have heard that and

228
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:08,708
fundamentally it is something that you

229
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:09,879
need to recognize me cagas it up but you

230
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:12,219
can be on the leading edge of it if

231
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:14,350
you're creating standards on how the

232
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,990
industry moves forward at the same time

233
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:19,300
these regulations are being created so

234
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,188
let me move on down the line here and

235
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:23,500
shift topics and then all of this will

236
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:27,698
tie together over the next 50 some odd

237
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:29,740
minutes Mary talk talk about the the

238
00:10:27,698 --> 00:10:31,479
fact that we now have a legal industry

239
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,549
or we should we certainly will here in

240
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,519
the short term in cali california with a

241
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:39,159
top-down regulatory structure why is IP

242
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:41,539
protection so critically important

243
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:43,879
well first let me start with defining

244
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:46,909
what the acronym IP is for those of you

245
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:49,309
who might not be acronym friendly IP is

246
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:52,039
intellectual property there are four

247
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:54,500
basic forms of intellectual property one

248
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:56,149
is patents the second is copyrights and

249
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,639
the third is trademarks and the fourth

250
00:10:56,149 --> 00:11:02,028
is trade secrets I'm a trademark and

251
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:05,000
copyright expert so I will focus on that

252
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:08,689
mostly but but in terms of answering

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,549
Bob's question you are creating new

254
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,410
business models you are creating new

255
00:11:10,549 --> 00:11:16,328
products you are creating new

256
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:18,169
manufacturing products and so

257
00:11:16,328 --> 00:11:20,088
intellectual property is really

258
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:22,219
important because that is the area of

259
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:24,410
law that is going to protect you now

260
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:27,790
there's a few there's a few twists here

261
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:30,319
so patents and copyrights were

262
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:32,569
referenced in the Constitution so they

263
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,050
have their own basis and it was

264
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:38,060
basically so that creation creativity

265
00:11:36,049 --> 00:11:42,399
would be fostered and that there was an

266
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:44,809
incentive for the creators to create

267
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,778
trademark law is a little bit different

268
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:50,929
and I overlap a bit with with Leslie

269
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:53,328
because trademark law comes from a basis

270
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:56,149
of public policy for consumer protection

271
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:58,309
and so it's not a strict property right

272
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:00,620
the way patents and copyrights are and

273
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:02,629
it's a different animal patents and

274
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,419
copyrights are also only exists under

275
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:07,100
the federal law trademarks exist under

276
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:08,929
both federal and state law and

277
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,540
international but I realize we're not

278
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:13,189
going there right now and trade secrets

279
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:15,769
is also something up until recently that

280
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:17,959
was only state law protected but that

281
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:20,740
has recently as i mentioned changed so

282
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:24,439
why is important because your creators

283
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:27,528
and you have business models that you

284
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:30,470
want to protect and you have brands that

285
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:32,409
you want to protect I felt like Steve

286
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:35,480
DeAngelo mentioned earlier today about

287
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:37,129
competitive intensity that is the

288
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,899
industry that we're in he talked about

289
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:41,149
the bell curve and you know we're all

290
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:43,519
we're all moving forward and that's

291
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:44,850
really great but you need to really

292
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,589
think about what you're

293
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,110
tentative advantage is going to be in

294
00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:50,880
the marketplace going for forward so it

295
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,350
could be something like a patent that

296
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:55,019
you own and that you can exclusively

297
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:58,319
control that's a competitive advantage

298
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:00,149
it could be your brand and that's

299
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:02,729
another competitive advantage in terms

300
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:05,009
of how you are viewed in the marketplace

301
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:06,899
so that's why I think intellectual

302
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:09,600
property is so important because this is

303
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:12,240
a emerging industry with a lot of

304
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,670
creativity going on so I'm going to ask

305
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,079
you what I think is the perhaps million

306
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:20,490
or maybe the 10 million dollar question

307
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:23,879
in the room and that is can you get IP

308
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:26,579
protection for a particular strain of

309
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:28,019
cannabis it's genetics if you if you

310
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:31,439
have some thoughts i'm sure you do on

311
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:33,389
that topic ah i actually can't answer

312
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,699
that question as a trademark attorney

313
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:36,990
I've been focusing on the well you did

314
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:38,639
say intellectual property protection

315
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,639
I've been focusing on the branding

316
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,850
aspects of strains is that an acceptable

317
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:49,919
absolute direction okay so here's the

318
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:53,519
thing Leslie your favorite favorite

319
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:56,578
strain oh you said not to ask you that I

320
00:13:53,519 --> 00:14:00,629
don't have one okay gentlemen in the

321
00:13:56,578 --> 00:14:07,469
front GDP okay we got we got a volunteer

322
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:09,990
her GDP GDP may not be GDP when you get

323
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,430
in a dispensary that's what somebody

324
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,198
said it was when they brought it in to

325
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:17,068
the dispensary but that may not be what

326
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:19,198
it is and so a lot of what trademark law

327
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:22,919
is about is about quality control and

328
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:26,729
standards we want a patient who comes in

329
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:29,938
to get GDP to get GDP we want a patient

330
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:33,688
comes in for GDP to get GDP that's been

331
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:35,549
tested for THC and CBD and every other

332
00:14:33,688 --> 00:14:38,669
cannabinoid that we're testing for as

333
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:40,889
well as mold and pesticides we want we

334
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:43,019
want to have strong quality controls and

335
00:14:40,889 --> 00:14:45,778
that's what trademarks are about so

336
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:48,959
what's happened over the decades because

337
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:51,149
it was an industry that was more or less

338
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:55,078
completely underground for a very long

339
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:57,688
time and now is really bubbling up over

340
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:58,208
the radar there are lots of people who

341
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:01,028
set

342
00:14:58,208 --> 00:15:03,789
there's no quality control over the name

343
00:15:01,028 --> 00:15:05,078
GDP so if you're going to start out and

344
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:06,368
you're going to want to develop a strain

345
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:08,378
or if you're going to want to sell

346
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:10,329
exclusive strains there's things that

347
00:15:08,379 --> 00:15:13,420
you need to know to make sure that you

348
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:14,859
can have the confidence that what you're

349
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:17,469
selling is what you're what you're

350
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,089
saying you're selling and if you look to

351
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:22,269
another industry like the horticultural

352
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:24,220
industry in terms of strains in terms of

353
00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:27,490
protection if you look at roses or if

354
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:30,579
you look at tulips there are many brands

355
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:33,549
that are well established so it's not

356
00:15:30,578 --> 00:15:36,729
that it's not it's not impossible but it

357
00:15:33,549 --> 00:15:38,378
is challenging particularly to kind of

358
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,269
claw back something that's been in the

359
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:42,039
marketplace for a long time but if

360
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:44,139
you're starting out going forward there

361
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:46,208
are some steps that you can take and I

362
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:50,649
am actually in the middle of writing an

363
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:52,599
article on protecting strain names no

364
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,009
well said and it's my understanding i'm

365
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,209
not a patent attorney but we have a

366
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:58,928
patent attorneys that work in our office

367
00:15:55,208 --> 00:16:00,578
and botanical strains in other context

368
00:15:58,928 --> 00:16:02,678
are something you can protect from a

369
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:06,159
patent perspective huh can you apply

370
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:09,039
that same standard to cannabis is is in

371
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:13,058
fact that a big question listen common I

372
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:15,698
just want to add sorry I just wanted to

373
00:16:13,058 --> 00:16:18,490
add that part of being able to get a

374
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:19,719
patent IP whatever kind of copyright

375
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,999
that you're looking for is being able to

376
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,629
produce that strain the same way over

377
00:16:21,999 --> 00:16:28,178
and over right so everybody's making all

378
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:30,278
sorts of girl scout cookies or you know

379
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:32,078
blue dream or whatever whatever it is

380
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:34,659
and it's different but it's also

381
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,128
different in the dispensary from the

382
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:38,980
person growing it because they don't

383
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:41,709
have standards in place that control for

384
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:45,009
all the individual variables from people

385
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:46,239
to electrical failure to training to

386
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:48,188
anything else and so that's what

387
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,438
standards do is they allow you to

388
00:16:48,188 --> 00:16:51,938
control for outside variables so that

389
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:53,318
you can do something like a patent

390
00:16:51,938 --> 00:16:54,849
because that's you'll know that your

391
00:16:53,318 --> 00:16:58,149
product is going to be the same over and

392
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,829
over no that's well said so the topic

393
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:02,678
for this hour again now that marijuana

394
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:04,928
is legal what comes next Matt let's

395
00:17:02,678 --> 00:17:06,519
start with the concept of what is legal

396
00:17:04,929 --> 00:17:07,048
I mean ultimately legal could be medical

397
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:08,459
marij

398
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:10,618
on illegal could be the collective

399
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:13,318
system legal could be don't use

400
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:14,970
marijuana how do you recognize that and

401
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:21,959
then what steps do you take to protect

402
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:24,929
yourself well first time I start out it

403
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,339
may not be the most popular view point

404
00:17:24,929 --> 00:17:30,600
especially from a lot of people in this

405
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:33,178
room but i think what and I'm never too

406
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:34,738
praiseworthy to people up in Sacramento

407
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,690
I don't think he generally did a very

408
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:40,108
good job but what I think they've

409
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:44,489
finally done here with mirza an adult

410
00:17:40,108 --> 00:17:47,970
use was a monumental step in moving this

411
00:17:44,489 --> 00:17:52,139
industry out of the shadows grey market

412
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:53,730
the the you know cartel drug trades all

413
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:57,658
the things we don't like here in

414
00:17:53,730 --> 00:18:00,899
California without any without any tax

415
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:03,450
increment revenue you know just just the

416
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:05,548
bad things and what what my colleagues

417
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:08,009
here talked about in terms of of

418
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:10,230
standards and doing what's best for

419
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:12,509
consumers and making sure you're not

420
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,940
consuming products that are written with

421
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:18,028
mold and pesticides and you know what

422
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:23,340
kind of THC concentration levels are and

423
00:18:18,028 --> 00:18:25,259
CBD etc etc so my point is that you know

424
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:26,939
the speaker was in here earlier saying

425
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:29,808
you know this is this is terrible

426
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:33,899
fifteen percent excise tax plus you got

427
00:18:29,808 --> 00:18:36,349
you know state local county level City

428
00:18:33,898 --> 00:18:39,959
level taxes and you know then you got

429
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:41,219
nine bucks and change of foot tax on

430
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,509
growers and it's going to make

431
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,999
everything more expensive and people

432
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:47,368
won't get their medicine etc etc so

433
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:51,720
those are all you know sort of valid

434
00:18:47,368 --> 00:18:53,548
viewpoints but in terms of the system

435
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,909
actually working and benefiting the

436
00:18:53,548 --> 00:18:58,499
people here in the state of California I

437
00:18:55,909 --> 00:19:00,210
I don't know what we were doing for 20

438
00:18:58,499 --> 00:19:03,179
years with our heads in the sand with

439
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:07,739
prop 215 and 420 watching Colorado

440
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:10,590
passes by I think we've we've taken the

441
00:19:07,739 --> 00:19:13,350
best of other state statutes and

442
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:14,558
ordinances and we've given it a lot of

443
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:16,418
thought and

444
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:19,808
think the the latest initiative is a

445
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:22,720
pretty thoughtful 60 Plus page you know

446
00:19:19,808 --> 00:19:25,538
fairly well reasoned attempt for

447
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:30,220
comprehensive regulation taxation and

448
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:32,919
you know control of use I think it's a

449
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,589
challenge for businesses now to set

450
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:37,149
themselves up for what's going to be in

451
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:39,819
the next two to three years and whether

452
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:42,518
they want to focus on medical whether it

453
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:47,769
will focus on recreational assuming that

454
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:50,079
passes whether medical recreational

455
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:54,368
willfully merge at some point in the

456
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:56,378
next few years so I personally think

457
00:19:54,368 --> 00:19:59,349
it's it's incredibly challenging and

458
00:19:56,378 --> 00:20:02,378
that for now I think trying to do

459
00:19:59,349 --> 00:20:03,519
something as legal as possible in a

460
00:20:02,378 --> 00:20:05,579
jurisdiction that you're comfortable

461
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:08,409
with that does have a comprehensive

462
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:13,658
regulatory scheme in place is probably a

463
00:20:08,409 --> 00:20:15,549
good start but you're going to want to

464
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:20,919
be pretty strategic about this and there

465
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:23,230
are no perfect answers but a long-winded

466
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:25,269
way of saying that I think we're on the

467
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:28,210
right track and we're going to have a

468
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:30,278
fully recreational west coast you know

469
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:32,619
top to bottom very soon so I'm pretty

470
00:20:30,278 --> 00:20:36,308
enthusiastic about it especially as a

471
00:20:32,618 --> 00:20:38,408
lawyer you know if we have legal

472
00:20:36,308 --> 00:20:40,778
cannabis business operators here in

473
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:45,129
California then they're pretty aware of

474
00:20:40,778 --> 00:20:48,308
the nonprofit sham is really what it is

475
00:20:45,128 --> 00:20:50,259
in terms of you know organizing your

476
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:52,118
business that way in a mutual benefit

477
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:54,278
corp thats really taxable as a c-corp

478
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:55,898
and you got to have an arms like

479
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:57,308
management services agreement in place

480
00:20:55,898 --> 00:21:01,439
and a management company and that's

481
00:20:57,308 --> 00:21:05,528
fraught with risk and you don't have the

482
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,778
the certainty you want there so as a as

483
00:21:05,528 --> 00:21:10,450
a deal lawyer as a corporate tax lawyer

484
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:14,440
I'm very excited to switch over to

485
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:16,778
for-profit still get the patients the

486
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,940
high quality medicine they want but you

487
00:21:16,778 --> 00:21:21,638
know be able to legally profit from the

488
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:24,390
business and advise our clients with you

489
00:21:21,638 --> 00:21:26,949
know reliable

490
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,140
predictable structures you know that

491
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,840
that are regulatory compliant here in

492
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:33,580
California so let's face it the cat was

493
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,740
out of the bag before state regulation

494
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:37,929
right so how do you take literally

495
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:40,599
hundreds if not thousands and thousands

496
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:42,730
of these businesses and then jam them

497
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:45,879
into a state top-down regulatory model

498
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:47,890
and get folks license how do you do that

499
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,740
so maybe you can kind of Matt just

500
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,780
briefly on the idea that there is a way

501
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:56,259
to sort of preserve your place in line

502
00:21:52,779 --> 00:22:00,160
for state licensure there is you know

503
00:21:56,259 --> 00:22:02,829
and again I regulations not my strong

504
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:05,019
suit but but certainly there is this you

505
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:07,210
know a piece of legislation that's

506
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:13,180
that's ready to be once it's funded that

507
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:14,470
that fixes a B 266 that you know cities

508
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,289
aren't going to necessarily have to have

509
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,360
an ordinance adopted today in order to

510
00:22:17,289 --> 00:22:21,519
get in the queue then we've got there

511
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:25,329
you know you're September first deadline

512
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:27,609
that passed for for adult used to be

513
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:32,769
legally compliant to get first in line

514
00:22:27,609 --> 00:22:37,179
to get a recreational type license I

515
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:42,220
mean I think the key is there there will

516
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:44,140
be some some preference and deferential

517
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:47,200
treatment if you're operating today

518
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:50,650
period you know is sort of like measured

519
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,440
d here in City Los Angeles if you were

520
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:55,570
if you had your tax registration

521
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:57,820
certificate than and you you know you're

522
00:22:55,569 --> 00:23:00,460
at a location where our landlord accepts

523
00:22:57,819 --> 00:23:02,169
you and you know you're a prop D client

524
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,900
dispensary there's a pretty darn good

525
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:09,310
chance that you're going to continue to

526
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:12,009
exist postma MRSA post adult use so in

527
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:13,419
other words it's it's entirely up to in

528
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:15,519
effect the local governments to provide

529
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:16,900
you some sort of licensing or

530
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,660
certification that you're operating

531
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:21,910
lawfully which in fact preserves your

532
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:24,400
place in line for state licensing and

533
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:26,019
what I've been told and you know

534
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,940
that talk to you some of it some of you

535
00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:29,769
folks after this what I've been told is

536
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,259
less than thirty three percent less than

537
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:34,450
one-third of existing operators in the

538
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:36,910
state of California will be licensed

539
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:39,190
under the state regulatory scheme what

540
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:41,950
the heck is going to happen litigation

541
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,840
our folks just burning the midnight oil

542
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,819
making as much money as they can closin

543
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,709
up shop moving on elsewhere back to the

544
00:23:45,819 --> 00:23:48,669
black market a variety of things are

545
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,200
going to happen but it's going to be

546
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:52,509
really really interesting but i think

547
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:54,370
this also segues to why sort of having

548
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:55,930
standards are important but if you want

549
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:57,279
to comment on that well and it's the

550
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,450
same comment i was just going to say

551
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,450
that you know this industry has

552
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:03,340
developed quickly without regulation on

553
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:06,340
a national level but it's not the first

554
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:07,720
time that that's happened when i sat

555
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:09,639
down to figure out how to write

556
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,680
standards for an inner industry

557
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:13,600
internationally I had no idea I have a

558
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,160
pharma background and a non-profit

559
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:16,929
background and I opened the first

560
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:19,450
licensed in Phoenix so I started looking

561
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:21,220
to other industries well in the 80s when

562
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:23,470
the heroin epidemic swept throughout the

563
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,720
United States methadone clinics had

564
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:28,000
popped up all over the place and within

565
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,430
two years they were in every state

566
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,380
working under different state city &amp;

567
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,610
county regulations and the federal

568
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,500
government took a look at that and said

569
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:37,599
whoa there's no way to protect for

570
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,420
health and safety here we need somebody

571
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:42,519
to develop voluntary consensus standards

572
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:45,279
and a third party certification system

573
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:46,960
so that these businesses can assure the

574
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,619
regulator's that they're doing things in

575
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,940
a safe quality and consistent manner so

576
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:54,069
standards and making sure that you're

577
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,360
and it goes back to Kyle's question even

578
00:24:54,069 --> 00:24:57,189
that came up about stigma right

579
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:59,109
everybody is a little bit afraid of this

580
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:01,299
industry there even the people that are

581
00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:03,039
pro-cannabis on the regulatory side

582
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:04,809
still are fearful they want to do it

583
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,220
they see the benefit you know some

584
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:08,619
better than others but they're still

585
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,240
fearful and so the best way in my mind

586
00:25:08,619 --> 00:25:13,479
for us to move this industry forward as

587
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,789
a whole is to be able to prove that we

588
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,349
have quality safe consistent products

589
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:19,149
that were responsible business owners

590
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:21,459
that we're not ending up with another

591
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,900
news story about you know this happening

592
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,059
or that happening that looks bad for us

593
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,070
so what is the right time to start

594
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:28,659
talking about standards is it when the

595
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:31,990
we've got our legs underneath of us for

596
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:34,660
a couple years as an industry or for now

597
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:35,650
so there's never a wrong time we have

598
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,259
businesses that have been in operation

599
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,340
for five or six years that are now going

600
00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:41,619
through this process with us but

601
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:44,169
certainly at the beginning whether

602
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:45,729
you're a regulator or an operator you

603
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,410
want to start as early as possible

604
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:49,210
because we can help build out your

605
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:51,100
structure and make sure that it meets

606
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,440
the standards we can control for all the

607
00:25:51,099 --> 00:25:54,519
variables within your facility and it

608
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,690
will save you money in the long run

609
00:25:54,519 --> 00:26:00,279
versus having to go back and do that

610
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:01,360
Mary what about go ahead if you'd like

611
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:04,920
to comment on that I also have a

612
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:09,219
question for you I want it to comment so

613
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:11,170
it's it seems to me based on my

614
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,549
experience with trademarks and branding

615
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:16,300
something that would be important for

616
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:18,369
you all to know is that if you want to

617
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:21,279
expand you have different if you have a

618
00:26:18,369 --> 00:26:23,259
business you get a business you want to

619
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,058
grow the business and you want to expand

620
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:27,910
you have different options of ways that

621
00:26:25,058 --> 00:26:29,558
you can do that you can partner with

622
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:34,090
somebody in a different state to get the

623
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:35,440
license you can you can partner with

624
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:36,609
somebody after they've gotten the

625
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,279
license before they've gotten the

626
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:40,419
license or you can license your brand to

627
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,428
them and that means you're going to have

628
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:45,070
to have some levels of quality control

629
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:49,059
and that goes back to the issue of

630
00:26:45,069 --> 00:26:52,569
whether its GDP or dr. green thumbs jet

631
00:26:49,058 --> 00:26:56,558
fuel oh gee you need to have some

632
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:59,409
standards for growers and for others to

633
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:02,109
you know to follow and that's so it this

634
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:05,110
whole issue of regulation and standards

635
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:07,959
really flows through every aspect of

636
00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:10,089
your business so let's talk about Mary

637
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,190
the difference between branding creating

638
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:15,129
a brand and creating something that can

639
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:17,880
be trademark protecting domestically yes

640
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,880
yes yes sir

641
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:31,960
how big is that industry how many are so

642
00:27:30,069 --> 00:27:33,730
the question is who are the standard

643
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,380
bearers how do you establish who the

644
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,960
standard bearers are how many are there

645
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,490
etc Leslie you probably get best common

646
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,590
sure so there's definitely other

647
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:44,620
organizations out there that have worked

648
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:46,689
on standards for the cannabis industry I

649
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:47,949
to differentiate a little bit there are

650
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,740
certain types of standards called

651
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:52,870
voluntary consensus standards that are

652
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:55,990
suitable for adoption into regulation in

653
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:58,239
fact in 1996 the fair trade and

654
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:00,819
Technology Act specifies that the

655
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,288
federal government has to use voluntary

656
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:04,750
consensus standards when writing

657
00:28:02,288 --> 00:28:06,490
regulations for an industry if they're

658
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,230
available and then it goes so far as to

659
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:10,450
say they can actually make the standards

660
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,548
the regulations so focus is the only

661
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,899
organization that has designed voluntary

662
00:28:12,548 --> 00:28:17,319
consensus standards that meet those

663
00:28:13,898 --> 00:28:18,819
guidelines I'm just going to throw this

664
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:20,710
in because I do pro bono work for

665
00:28:18,819 --> 00:28:23,259
Americans for safe access and they have

666
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:25,720
a patient-focused certified program that

667
00:28:23,259 --> 00:28:28,889
addresses various aspects of industry

668
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:33,579
including cultivation retail and others

669
00:28:28,888 --> 00:28:36,548
and i would say who are they not to

670
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:37,960
slight define california companies but i

671
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:40,210
would look for folks that are operating

672
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,509
in multiple states if you can achieve

673
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:45,669
licensure in more than one state that

674
00:28:43,509 --> 00:28:47,169
suggests something very significant

675
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:48,940
about you it suggests that you can be

676
00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:50,710
capitalized well if you can be

677
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,929
capitalized well you obviously have a

678
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:54,730
good business plan and a good business

679
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:56,830
program it would demonstrate that you

680
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,808
have good corporate governance it would

681
00:28:56,829 --> 00:29:00,730
demonstrate that you understand the

682
00:28:58,808 --> 00:29:02,829
importance of complying with regulations

683
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:05,349
so the standard bearers are those folks

684
00:29:02,829 --> 00:29:07,839
that operate in my opinion in multiple

685
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:10,209
states and I think many folks are on

686
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:12,730
that path but Mary let's talk about

687
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:15,429
branding let's talk about the difference

688
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:18,250
between trademarks and branding and I

689
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:21,669
guess a tandem question is can you trade

690
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:24,369
mark anything related to cannabis yes

691
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:26,640
and yes okay uh so we'll start with the

692
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:28,769
first part next question first

693
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,640
the first part of the question which has

694
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:33,299
to do what's the difference between

695
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:37,200
branding and trademarks so anybody out

696
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:39,059
here have a vaporizer okay when you

697
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,610
chose that vaporizer there were various

698
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:43,049
aspects of the vaporizer that you were

699
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:44,729
looking for did you want it to be

700
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:46,559
something that fit into your pocket or

701
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:48,809
your purse did you want it to be

702
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,879
something that that was battery operated

703
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:53,759
or something that had you didn't have to

704
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:58,500
deal with battery operating did you

705
00:29:53,759 --> 00:30:01,259
wanted to have a indicator on the front

706
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,000
of the vaporizer that had numbers that

707
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:04,950
showed you the temperature as it was

708
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,960
rising or did you want something really

709
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,759
simple simple that the light just went a

710
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,910
certain color when the temperature was

711
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:14,670
reached all of those are aspects of

712
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:16,680
branding it's the product itself it's

713
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:19,200
the way that you communicate about the

714
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:22,380
product to your potential customers or

715
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:26,340
patients it's the price it's the quality

716
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:28,920
it's everything about your product that

717
00:30:26,339 --> 00:30:31,859
interfaces or connects with the consumer

718
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:34,350
and so that's what a brand is what's a

719
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:36,359
trademark a trademark is one portion of

720
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:38,730
the brand and it's the shorthand for the

721
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:40,859
brand because when i say that i use

722
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:42,870
analyzer solo some of you might be

723
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:45,809
nodding as a light right that i liked it

724
00:30:42,869 --> 00:30:47,459
i don't like it la but some of you are

725
00:30:45,809 --> 00:30:50,250
thinking on you know i'll stick with the

726
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:53,309
volcano you know and and the point is is

727
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:56,700
that the brand name becomes the

728
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:59,220
shorthand for all of the factors about

729
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,740
the brand the quality the price the ease

730
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,860
of access the ease of use and so on and

731
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,559
so forth so when you think about your

732
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:11,879
brand which is very important in this in

733
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:13,859
this area of competitive of the this way

734
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,510
this marketplace is changing to be so

735
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:17,459
competitive because there are so many

736
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:20,009
new entrants you've got to think about

737
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:23,370
every aspect and have have a sense about

738
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:25,799
where you're going one aspect of the

739
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:27,809
trade of the branding is the trademark I

740
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:30,210
used to be Mary L Shapiro law until

741
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:33,000
earlier this year because when i left my

742
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:35,400
big firm I felt like what I was selling

743
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,269
was me because I had these relationships

744
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:40,609
with with clients and so forth

745
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:42,649
I just rebranded this year to evoke law

746
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:46,038
because i want a i want to follow the

747
00:31:42,648 --> 00:31:48,918
guidelines that I provide my clients but

748
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:50,569
I also wanted to say something so what I

749
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:52,580
always tell my clients do is choose a

750
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:54,288
brand that is distinctive and exclusive

751
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:56,118
and it's not just because I think that's

752
00:31:54,288 --> 00:31:57,739
a great opinion that's what the law

753
00:31:56,118 --> 00:32:00,079
wants you to have that's the standard

754
00:31:57,739 --> 00:32:02,209
you have to be exclusive and distinctive

755
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:03,888
so when I looked around at other law

756
00:32:02,209 --> 00:32:05,659
firms and I looked at other names I

757
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:08,329
can't you know I ended up settling on a

758
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:10,789
vote because I felt like that was like

759
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:13,098
you need to tell your client you need to

760
00:32:10,788 --> 00:32:15,348
evoke some response from your customer

761
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:18,618
or your patient about what your product

762
00:32:15,348 --> 00:32:20,689
is so that's the that's the difference

763
00:32:18,618 --> 00:32:22,098
between branding and trademarks would

764
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:25,459
you like me to answer the second part

765
00:32:22,098 --> 00:32:28,009
part 2 so I mentioned earlier that there

766
00:32:25,459 --> 00:32:30,499
are two at least two concept trademarks

767
00:32:28,009 --> 00:32:34,399
or state and federal state trademarks

768
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:38,269
provide protection in a given state and

769
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:41,478
it's for intrastate commerce federal

770
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:44,659
trademarks are for interstate commerce

771
00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:46,879
so a lot of folks have a little issue

772
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:48,049
about getting into that federal land but

773
00:32:46,878 --> 00:32:51,108
there are different ways that you can do

774
00:32:48,048 --> 00:32:53,868
it but the question is can you get a

775
00:32:51,108 --> 00:32:56,298
trademark and the answer is yes there

776
00:32:53,868 --> 00:32:58,638
are just different ways of going about

777
00:32:56,298 --> 00:33:00,078
it so if you are only operating

778
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:03,978
intrastate the thing that you need to

779
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:07,249
look at is only a state trademark okay

780
00:33:03,979 --> 00:33:09,819
if you're in California you are screwed

781
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:12,348
for lack forgive my french because

782
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:15,319
California Secretary of State is still

783
00:33:12,348 --> 00:33:18,408
voluntary all entirely following the

784
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:20,838
federal guidelines and so the feds will

785
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:24,169
not issue a trademark registration to

786
00:33:20,838 --> 00:33:28,428
any product that touches the plant so if

787
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:30,349
you are offering education services your

788
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:34,009
you're good you can talk about cannabis

789
00:33:30,348 --> 00:33:36,828
but if you are retailer you cannot get a

790
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:41,808
trademark for your brand for retail

791
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:44,388
services so as I mentioned California is

792
00:33:41,808 --> 00:33:46,638
one of the outliers in this though just

793
00:33:44,388 --> 00:33:49,500
about every other state that I'm aware

794
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:52,709
of where there are cannabis regulations

795
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:55,950
it's permitted do offer state trademark

796
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:57,990
registrations so unfortunately as you're

797
00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:00,450
used to already you've got a patchwork

798
00:33:57,990 --> 00:34:02,849
quilt of local and state and federal

799
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:04,620
laws this unfortunately this area of law

800
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:06,000
is no different and you have to wind

801
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:09,418
your way through and find the right

802
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,659
strategy of how you can obtain the

803
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:14,940
maximum amount of protection so the

804
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:18,389
topic again it's legal now what yes

805
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:20,010
question so the question is you are the

806
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:21,539
comment you had recently been in touch

807
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:22,800
with someone in Washington DC from a

808
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:26,340
trademark office at the federal level

809
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:29,909
and they effectively told you about this

810
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:31,889
problem as Mary described would that

811
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:34,500
it's anything about the illegality so

812
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:36,149
it's really interesting I think I think

813
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:40,230
Matthew said it or maybe Bob are both

814
00:34:36,148 --> 00:34:42,299
said it and I refer to navigating the

815
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:44,789
waters of the cannabis industry in terms

816
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,350
of the law as the Maslow hierarchy of

817
00:34:44,789 --> 00:34:48,960
needs for those of you know what it is

818
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:51,000
if you don't know it's basically like we

819
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,949
need food and shelter like first before

820
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,148
we can like you know and at the very top

821
00:34:52,949 --> 00:35:01,109
we can have exposition existential

822
00:34:56,148 --> 00:35:03,089
happiness so in my mind there's a same

823
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:05,010
triangle and at the bottom you've got

824
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:08,420
criminal lawyers who help people in this

825
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:10,950
industry navigate sorry whoo help help

826
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:13,079
people in this industry navigate through

827
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:14,969
the criminal aspects I think the next

828
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,409
place that most businesses went were for

829
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:20,159
a corporate lawyer and a tax lawyer

830
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:22,619
that's my my my anecdotal presentation

831
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:24,960
someplace above that you start to get to

832
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:27,659
places like employment lawyers and

833
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,579
intellectual property lawyers and at the

834
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:32,940
Pinnacle I see that you have created a

835
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:36,049
business that has revenue and income and

836
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:38,880
equity that you can leave to your a

837
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:40,260
charity or your family and that's where

838
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,869
you need trust lawyers so that's my

839
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:45,810
little thing but to get to your question

840
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:47,909
I think unfortunately because of all the

841
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:50,219
intricacies having a trademark lawyer

842
00:35:47,909 --> 00:35:51,899
can be really beneficial I've seen too

843
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:54,839
many cases where people have applied for

844
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:58,289
goods that are unlawful and they get

845
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,700
refused and at the federal level okay so

846
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,259
you've got the money that you've spent

847
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,579
the time that you've spent and the

848
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,800
frustration

849
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:06,929
and I'm going to admit that it happened

850
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,060
to me in California I applied for five

851
00:36:06,929 --> 00:36:11,369
marks for one client in California and

852
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:13,679
this is what's really crazy California

853
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:15,869
sends you back the application they send

854
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,339
you back your check and they write this

855
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:20,730
really long letter and tell you what's

856
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:22,289
wrong with your application and it's you

857
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:24,090
know it's just it's kind of its kind of

858
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:26,880
the I don't mean to be critical of

859
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:30,720
government or bureaucracy but I do mean

860
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,400
to be and so it also offends me now I'm

861
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:35,099
going to get on my high horse but it

862
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,910
offends me that in California where

863
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:42,089
cannabis has been legal for medical

864
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:44,369
purposes for such a long time in an area

865
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:47,340
of law that is about consumer protection

866
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:49,409
that they have this total disconnect

867
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:52,019
because again if you're a medical

868
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:54,299
patient you want quality and you want to

869
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:56,250
know which retailer is going to give you

870
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,600
that quality which cultivator is going

871
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:59,880
to give you that quality and it's really

872
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,500
important I am a founding board member

873
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,570
of the National cannabis Bar Association

874
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,010
and with the National counters of our

875
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:07,110
association we went to the see the

876
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:09,990
Secretary of State to try and start this

877
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:12,630
dialogue and the sea CIA has also done

878
00:37:09,989 --> 00:37:14,819
that and other people have done that we

879
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:18,840
just haven't seen the change coming as

880
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:21,480
fast as it needs to I would just I would

881
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:24,210
just add that bureaucracy is part of

882
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,800
this industry and I you know if you're

883
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:27,539
thinking about getting into it based on

884
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,590
what the topic of this conversation is

885
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:33,960
today you got to be ready to get no at

886
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:35,430
every corner you have to be ready to

887
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,650
come back with an argument and you have

888
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:39,149
to have the right people around you that

889
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:41,809
understand how to navigate those waters

890
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:44,130
I I feel like colleges like that right

891
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:45,329
colleges like this bag college you go to

892
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,369
you have your learning what you're

893
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:48,900
learning your degree is great but at the

894
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:50,460
end of the day if you can't meet their

895
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:52,260
requirements and you can't figure out

896
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,639
when things need to be turned in you're

897
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,200
really not going to be successful at

898
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:56,879
college even if you understand the

899
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:58,139
content of the course okay now you're

900
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,809
reminding me of the dream that I have

901
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:02,219
all etat all the time that I have an

902
00:38:00,809 --> 00:38:07,289
exam tomorrow and I haven't been to

903
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:08,969
class I'll sesame ok so so I was there

904
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:11,360
was a similar topic i was in laying in

905
00:38:08,969 --> 00:38:13,480
bed in a hotel in chicago may a year ago

906
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:18,220
was david letterman's last

907
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:19,539
on TV and I got to thinking about what

908
00:38:18,219 --> 00:38:22,029
what do you need to know now that the

909
00:38:19,539 --> 00:38:24,219
industry is legal right how can you

910
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:26,560
package that so I decided to come up

911
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:29,649
with my own top 10 list not nearly as

912
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:32,710
clever as his old Dave but let me give

913
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:34,960
you my top 10 if you will things to

914
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:38,139
think about now that it's legal to get

915
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:41,170
into the industry first and foremost the

916
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:43,480
Controlled Substances Act we are talking

917
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:46,869
about a federally illegal substance

918
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:49,300
simple and plain right there a part

919
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:51,670
there are policy memorandum those policy

920
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:55,030
memorandum create rights for this

921
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:56,800
industry to operate those rights are not

922
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:59,019
necessarily enforceable in a court of

923
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,550
law unless you're referring to the

924
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:02,130
federal budget there was a great case

925
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:06,010
from the northern district of california

926
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:08,890
called the mam case the marin alliance

927
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:11,109
for medical marijuana we're at district

928
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:13,299
court federal district court judge said

929
00:39:11,108 --> 00:39:17,039
to the Department of Justice you cannot

930
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:19,390
spend dollar one to enforce against man

931
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:21,309
because the federal budget prohibits it

932
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:23,259
so there are safeguards in place but

933
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:25,449
remember please start with the

934
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,730
understanding of the legality federally

935
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:28,989
but also understand your state legal

936
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:32,050
structure which we touch down a little

937
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:34,299
bit that's number 10 number 9 cash and

938
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:36,310
banking you're going to have a lot of

939
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:39,190
cash you're going to have few banking

940
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:41,230
options so think about that in Colorado

941
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:42,700
we've solved the banking problem states

942
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:45,250
have solved the banking problem in a

943
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:46,960
variety of places through due diligence

944
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:49,389
through software systems through

945
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,429
compliance by third parties it's not

946
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:54,819
solved everywhere so that's going to be

947
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:57,219
a problem number eight state and local

948
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,900
regulations sorry not just marijuana

949
00:39:57,219 --> 00:40:00,730
business regulations environmental

950
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,800
regulations land use regulations

951
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:05,050
something in California called sequin

952
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,180
Pamela Epstein who works with our law

953
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:09,130
firm knows this stuff as well as just

954
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:10,629
about anybody in the state and when you

955
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,539
begin to talk about it people's heads

956
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:13,130
spin

957
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:16,099
understand the environmental issues in

958
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:20,539
the compliance side of things number

959
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:22,759
four number 67 thank you with the law

960
00:40:20,539 --> 00:40:26,440
school for a reason math is not my

961
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:28,790
strong suit publicly traded companies

962
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,800
SEC has shut down trading on publicly

963
00:40:28,789 --> 00:40:33,259
traded companies most states don't allow

964
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,720
publicly traded companies to operate so

965
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:38,450
think about your structure think twice

966
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:40,879
in my humble legal opinion about

967
00:40:38,449 --> 00:40:43,250
creating a publicly traded company to

968
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,890
hold a variety of holdings isolate your

969
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:47,840
liability isolate your licenses get the

970
00:40:45,889 --> 00:40:49,940
notion of publicly traded companies for

971
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,730
the foreseeable future out of your mind

972
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:54,889
unless you're an ancillary business due

973
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:56,960
diligence it's highly specialized in

974
00:40:54,889 --> 00:40:58,339
this industry you need to do due

975
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,010
diligence I was on the phone with a

976
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,960
client this morning who we said we will

977
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:04,700
get you numbers we will get you this and

978
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,740
that for a dispensary that they're going

979
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:08,419
to acquire in Phoenix I don't need to

980
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:09,889
see that stuff the numbers are fine I

981
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:12,710
don't need to see that stuff people

982
00:41:09,889 --> 00:41:14,929
throw stupid money at this industry with

983
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:19,099
don't with no due diligence don't be one

984
00:41:14,929 --> 00:41:23,529
of those people absolutely this is one

985
00:41:19,099 --> 00:41:23,529
of the areas where we're doing a deal or

986
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:27,440
this is one of those areas whether

987
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:29,329
you're doing a deal to acquire something

988
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,429
or merge with somebody or whether you're

989
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:34,340
doing a licensing deal for a brand it is

990
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:35,839
so important you need to know who you're

991
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,880
getting in bed with and I hate to use

992
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,160
you know that metaphor but you really

993
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,690
need to know the people and it's not so

994
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:43,879
it's not just about the numbers you need

995
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,710
to know what their values are what their

996
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,680
ethics are what you do you know what the

997
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:52,010
morality is before you get into business

998
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:53,809
with somebody i also just okay welcome

999
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,970
back to my i'll go ahead well i just was

1000
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:57,650
a sort of natural segue to me one of the

1001
00:41:55,969 --> 00:41:59,599
things i see happening when new

1002
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:01,220
businesses form is they don't think

1003
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,989
about their intellectual property and

1004
00:42:01,219 --> 00:42:04,849
they don't think about what's going to

1005
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:07,219
happen if things go wrong between the

1006
00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:08,779
people and I'm that is just a general

1007
00:42:07,219 --> 00:42:10,369
principle you need to always think about

1008
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:12,019
what's going to go wrong and so I

1009
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:14,359
mentioned that because that's another

1010
00:42:12,019 --> 00:42:15,619
aspect of thinking about you know well

1011
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,180
what's going to go wrong we can't just

1012
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:18,619
assume like we're like we've known each

1013
00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:21,529
other for four months and we're still

1014
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:23,029
like dating and it's all good but you

1015
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:23,380
know when you when you start to do you

1016
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:25,869
know

1017
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,640
run a business together questions come

1018
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:29,858
up decisions get made and you can be

1019
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:31,659
unhappy or happy and so I only wanted to

1020
00:42:29,858 --> 00:42:33,969
mention that I think that's a the due

1021
00:42:31,659 --> 00:42:36,118
diligence is so important about every

1022
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:38,199
aspect of this it's not your

1023
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:39,608
grandfather's due diligence due

1024
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:41,230
diligence is unique in this industry

1025
00:42:39,608 --> 00:42:43,480
because it takes into account your

1026
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:46,240
standard business due diligence but also

1027
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,309
the compliance aspect of it what and how

1028
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:50,588
seriously from a compliance perspective

1029
00:42:48,309 --> 00:42:53,109
do these folks take that seriously yes

1030
00:42:50,588 --> 00:42:54,788
sir look in Washington state washington

1031
00:42:53,108 --> 00:42:56,889
state in effect did away with its

1032
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:59,589
medical marijuana program and it merge

1033
00:42:56,889 --> 00:43:01,778
into an adult use program why i think

1034
00:42:59,588 --> 00:43:03,548
this is important and trust me this is

1035
00:43:01,778 --> 00:43:05,528
not coming from a position of a lack of

1036
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:07,838
regard for patient rights what's

1037
00:43:05,528 --> 00:43:10,599
happening in the united states is you're

1038
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:13,179
going to see federally regulated

1039
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:15,130
cannabis-based medicine based on

1040
00:43:13,179 --> 00:43:16,568
rescheduling whether that's a two or a

1041
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:18,338
three in the future these are

1042
00:43:16,568 --> 00:43:20,528
pharmaceutical products these are

1043
00:43:18,338 --> 00:43:22,838
pharmaceutical grade companies that are

1044
00:43:20,528 --> 00:43:25,150
producing cannabis based medicine

1045
00:43:22,838 --> 00:43:26,650
regulated by the FDA at the federal

1046
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:28,599
level then you're going to have this

1047
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:31,240
divine and on the other side of the

1048
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:33,160
divide is the natural products marijuana

1049
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:35,679
industry this is the industry we all

1050
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:38,259
operate in right now it's the dispensary

1051
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,879
system it's very very different it's it

1052
00:43:38,259 --> 00:43:42,190
is not going to merge into

1053
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,619
pharmaceutical it's going to be its own

1054
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:47,079
thing so to have distinctions like

1055
00:43:44,619 --> 00:43:49,088
medical marijuana and adult use

1056
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:51,068
marijuana when it's all the same thing

1057
00:43:49,088 --> 00:43:53,828
its natural product marijuana and its

1058
00:43:51,068 --> 00:43:55,989
simplest sense is a way to open the door

1059
00:43:53,829 --> 00:43:58,509
and create regulatory structures so

1060
00:43:55,989 --> 00:43:59,949
policy makers see that it works and when

1061
00:43:58,509 --> 00:44:02,650
they see that it works they will

1062
00:43:59,949 --> 00:44:04,689
ultimately merge but the divide is not

1063
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:07,210
between medical and adult use the divide

1064
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:09,009
is between OTC marijuana and federally

1065
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:11,108
regulated cannabis-based medicine

1066
00:44:09,009 --> 00:44:13,630
because think of it this way even though

1067
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:15,730
most hardened zealot anti-marijuana

1068
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:17,048
crusader like chris christie for example

1069
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:19,599
and i could say that from my home state

1070
00:44:17,048 --> 00:44:21,400
of jersey this guy would sit back and

1071
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,579
over a beer he would tell you he would

1072
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:26,588
say Hoban we are not going to send 50

1073
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:28,240
billion dollars of business black back

1074
00:44:26,588 --> 00:44:29,920
to the black market because what is the

1075
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:31,989
marijuana industry and it's in its most

1076
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,900
simple of sense it is the most

1077
00:44:31,989 --> 00:44:37,118
organized well-funded institutionalized

1078
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,769
drug distribution system in human

1079
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,840
history and it's happening in broad

1080
00:44:38,769 --> 00:44:42,550
daylight they're not going to send that

1081
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,920
back to the black market I can assure

1082
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:46,539
you so to figure out and to understand

1083
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,820
that distinction between natural

1084
00:44:46,539 --> 00:44:50,559
products and pharmaceutical base which

1085
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,660
by the way can be based on natural

1086
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,420
products is really going to be an art

1087
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:57,069
but that's why I think that they merge

1088
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:59,920
I'd like to add to that too when you

1089
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:01,300
look at standards people ask me all the

1090
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,389
time are your standards for medical use

1091
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:06,039
or for adult use right and I just looked

1092
00:45:04,389 --> 00:45:08,409
back and I say well we don't want to

1093
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:10,929
turn all the recreational users into

1094
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:13,480
patients because their cannabis isn't

1095
00:45:10,929 --> 00:45:15,789
safe right so at the end of the day it's

1096
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:17,710
about producing safe quality consistent

1097
00:45:15,789 --> 00:45:22,449
products regardless of what marketplace

1098
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:25,889
you're in like to add oh I just want to

1099
00:45:22,449 --> 00:45:29,618
be the cynic of the panel that's my role

1100
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:32,109
the fact of the matter is beyond you

1101
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:34,420
know patient rights and quality and

1102
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:38,410
standards both the federal government

1103
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:42,940
and most state governments spend a lot

1104
00:45:38,409 --> 00:45:44,710
more than they need to be spending and

1105
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:47,590
so we continue to have a spending

1106
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:51,579
problem and we're running out of revenue

1107
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:54,960
tax sources two things to tax and we've

1108
00:45:51,579 --> 00:45:57,039
gone so far down this path of having

1109
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:00,130
insufficient revenue to fund big

1110
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:01,480
government that we're not going to

1111
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:03,099
return to the black market it's only

1112
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:05,199
going to get more and more regulated and

1113
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:09,190
more and more text and eventually like

1114
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:12,489
you said we'll see addy scheduling good

1115
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:14,590
a change in the scheduling and and we'll

1116
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:16,209
have yet another tax at the federal

1117
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:18,010
level at some point maybe it's three

1118
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:19,599
years from now maybe it's 15 years from

1119
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:21,480
now but it'll probably happen it all

1120
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,710
depends on with President Trump allows

1121
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:27,000
I'd like to go back to the notion of

1122
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:29,920
intellectual property though because if

1123
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:33,000
if you if you create something and you

1124
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:35,619
get a patent on it that is some big

1125
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,739
protection and it can help you navigate

1126
00:46:35,619 --> 00:46:41,440
your through the big pharma and natural

1127
00:46:38,739 --> 00:46:42,689
products as well I also want to say as a

1128
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,820
patient

1129
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:48,039
I feel as though it's going to be really

1130
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:50,830
important and even more important to

1131
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:53,199
have qualified people in dispensaries or

1132
00:46:50,829 --> 00:46:56,500
whatever it turns out to be that is

1133
00:46:53,199 --> 00:47:02,829
providing advice and counsel to patients

1134
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:06,130
because when adult uses is I'll say when

1135
00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:08,079
adult uses authorized in California a

1136
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:10,059
lot of the stigma starts to go away and

1137
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,549
so people who never considered using

1138
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:15,789
cannabis to treat arthritis or glaucoma

1139
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:18,670
or whatever the illness is are going to

1140
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:19,989
want that kind of support because now

1141
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,369
they don't have to sign up and get a

1142
00:47:19,989 --> 00:47:22,899
card you feel like they're on some

1143
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:25,659
database and they're all worried about

1144
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:28,030
it they can just go into a dispensary

1145
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:32,440
but it's going to be really important to

1146
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:33,910
my mind to segregate the kind of bud

1147
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,659
teen budtender that's going to give

1148
00:47:33,909 --> 00:47:40,420
advice about medical cannabis versus

1149
00:47:36,659 --> 00:47:41,829
recreational no well said well said all

1150
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:43,320
right so let me buzz through my top five

1151
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:46,500
and then I've got a question for Matt

1152
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:49,720
real estate is another key number five

1153
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,579
zoning land use this at its heart you've

1154
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:53,559
probably seen articles out there the

1155
00:47:51,579 --> 00:47:56,230
cannabis industry at its heart is a real

1156
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:59,469
estate industry in its most simple sense

1157
00:47:56,230 --> 00:48:00,789
at the beginning now that evolves as an

1158
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:02,769
industry matures from a top-down

1159
00:48:00,789 --> 00:48:04,329
regulatory system but understand the

1160
00:48:02,769 --> 00:48:05,949
regulatory structure understand what the

1161
00:48:04,329 --> 00:48:07,809
local governments are thinking before

1162
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:09,609
they think it and some of those folks

1163
00:48:07,809 --> 00:48:12,279
are in the room so get get close with

1164
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:13,570
them make sure you have a liaison for

1165
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:17,380
government local government in

1166
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:19,420
particular number four you can't

1167
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:21,220
generally have a security interest it

1168
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:23,409
makes really hard to lend to the

1169
00:48:21,219 --> 00:48:25,059
cannabis industry because folks that are

1170
00:48:23,409 --> 00:48:28,869
going to be deemed finance ears

1171
00:48:25,059 --> 00:48:31,000
quote-unquote or lenders it's not your

1172
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:33,219
your traditional industry where I can

1173
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,250
have a security interest in the money

1174
00:48:33,219 --> 00:48:37,839
I'll end and in fact if you even can

1175
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:39,340
under the regulations is that

1176
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,050
enforceable in a court of law so that's

1177
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:42,340
something to think about and by the way

1178
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,840
if anybody has a comment on any of these

1179
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:47,320
things please please feel free to jump

1180
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:49,300
in number three capital capitals hard to

1181
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:51,079
come by you can't get institutional

1182
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:54,349
lending of course you have

1183
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:56,599
to go to groups of investors you have to

1184
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:59,329
go to friends and family one thing that

1185
00:48:56,599 --> 00:49:01,609
has opened up we hired a specialist

1186
00:48:59,329 --> 00:49:04,430
about six months ago for reggae plus

1187
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:07,400
sort of crowdfunding raise for this

1188
00:49:04,429 --> 00:49:10,190
industry very popular and it's proven to

1189
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:12,019
be effective and I tell you you can't go

1190
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:13,729
to banks but there are a number of folks

1191
00:49:12,018 --> 00:49:18,228
that'll throw that quote unquote stupid

1192
00:49:13,728 --> 00:49:23,389
money at this industry number number two

1193
00:49:18,228 --> 00:49:26,989
the FDA claims and labeling may 2015 the

1194
00:49:23,389 --> 00:49:29,118
FDA issued a q-and-a on its website

1195
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:31,639
regarding marijuana there were 16

1196
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:33,469
questions 13 of those 16 questions dealt

1197
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:36,920
specifically with marijuana and rather

1198
00:49:33,469 --> 00:49:39,559
the FDA regulates marijuana the other

1199
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,119
three had to do with hemp hemp gets me

1200
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:43,910
really excited so I won't go down this

1201
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,099
road but let me tell you something the

1202
00:49:43,909 --> 00:49:48,259
13 questions about marijuana of course

1203
00:49:46,099 --> 00:49:50,209
say that the FDA does not consider

1204
00:49:48,259 --> 00:49:51,498
marijuana something that they should

1205
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:55,399
have the purview over because it's

1206
00:49:51,498 --> 00:49:58,578
federally illegal with that said be sure

1207
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:00,259
to comply with FDA labeling requirements

1208
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:02,150
it's a step I was going to say and I'm

1209
00:50:00,259 --> 00:50:05,389
actually on the FDA Committee for

1210
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:06,949
cannabis so while they say they don't

1211
00:50:05,389 --> 00:50:09,318
regulate it that goes back to the

1212
00:50:06,949 --> 00:50:12,979
Controlled Substances Act and giving the

1213
00:50:09,318 --> 00:50:15,679
power to Congress not DOJ or FDA to

1214
00:50:12,978 --> 00:50:17,808
change things so the FDA is absolutely

1215
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,969
involved in this they have many many

1216
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:21,499
meetings many phone calls about it don't

1217
00:50:19,969 --> 00:50:23,568
kid yourself to think you do not need to

1218
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:26,328
meet those guidelines so comply with

1219
00:50:23,568 --> 00:50:28,788
your state guidelines for labeling and

1220
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:31,789
packaging at a minimum but look at the

1221
00:50:28,789 --> 00:50:34,459
FDA guidelines as your standard to

1222
00:50:31,789 --> 00:50:37,489
operate because it's critical and don't

1223
00:50:34,458 --> 00:50:40,098
make claims can I good I just want to

1224
00:50:37,489 --> 00:50:41,449
say too just so it's clear the the focus

1225
00:50:40,099 --> 00:50:42,588
standards and I'm not saying that has a

1226
00:50:41,449 --> 00:50:43,999
selling point but I want to make sure

1227
00:50:42,588 --> 00:50:45,619
that you guys understand that all we've

1228
00:50:43,998 --> 00:50:48,228
done is taken Code of Federal

1229
00:50:45,619 --> 00:50:50,989
Regulations Pharma guidelines

1230
00:50:48,228 --> 00:50:52,338
nutraceutical guidelines OSHA hasem

1231
00:50:50,989 --> 00:50:54,048
everything that's like you know

1232
00:50:52,338 --> 00:50:56,478
agricultural guidelines World Health

1233
00:50:54,048 --> 00:50:59,179
Organization guidelines and created put

1234
00:50:56,478 --> 00:51:00,679
those in together into a standard for

1235
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:02,899
each of the areas that have then been

1236
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:04,548
specified specifically to cannabis so

1237
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,410
you don't have to go seeking out

1238
00:51:04,548 --> 00:51:08,358
what do I do for here with Pharma or

1239
00:51:06,409 --> 00:51:11,389
with nutraceuticals or agriculture or

1240
00:51:08,358 --> 00:51:13,130
whatever and that's the benefit to a

1241
00:51:11,389 --> 00:51:14,659
business I think if we're talking about

1242
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:16,219
starting a business right you take the

1243
00:51:14,659 --> 00:51:18,409
guesswork out of it by doing something

1244
00:51:16,219 --> 00:51:20,179
like that and I would say the same thing

1245
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:23,358
is that I want to focus on the claims

1246
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:24,798
and the labeling I am all about consumer

1247
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:26,778
safety and it's not just become a

1248
00:51:24,798 --> 00:51:28,969
trademark lawyer or just you know just a

1249
00:51:26,778 --> 00:51:30,650
human being I'm think about the patient

1250
00:51:28,969 --> 00:51:32,239
first or the consumer first and you're

1251
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:34,009
going to probably end up doing the right

1252
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:37,219
thing as long as you have some guidance

1253
00:51:34,009 --> 00:51:38,838
you know as to the law but claims are

1254
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:41,179
really interesting and I'm not an expert

1255
00:51:38,838 --> 00:51:42,380
in this area but I you know you have to

1256
00:51:41,179 --> 00:51:44,809
be really careful about what you say

1257
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:46,880
your product is going to do because

1258
00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:50,390
you're going to step over some very

1259
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:54,619
important law that's going to put you in

1260
00:51:50,389 --> 00:51:57,228
a real bind and I just just wanted to

1261
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:59,358
throw that in so so even if for example

1262
00:51:57,228 --> 00:52:02,389
your edible product produced in

1263
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:04,278
California from your company even if the

1264
00:52:02,389 --> 00:52:06,409
FDA technically technically doesn't

1265
00:52:04,278 --> 00:52:08,028
count because there's no interstate

1266
00:52:06,409 --> 00:52:10,248
commerce or there shouldn't be over that

1267
00:52:08,028 --> 00:52:11,748
product although any lawyers in the room

1268
00:52:10,248 --> 00:52:13,968
understand that interstate commerce is

1269
00:52:11,748 --> 00:52:16,608
really everything that's neither here

1270
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:18,259
nor there when that chiva choo makes it

1271
00:52:16,608 --> 00:52:20,748
to New York and it's got a label on it

1272
00:52:18,259 --> 00:52:22,159
that says something wrong it says it has

1273
00:52:20,748 --> 00:52:24,618
too little or too much of what it

1274
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:27,379
actually has in it if it says and a

1275
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:29,269
medical regime this product is intended

1276
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:31,400
to treat prostate cancer don't do it

1277
00:52:29,268 --> 00:52:33,828
don't let anybody do it it's a bad move

1278
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,719
from the beginning and back to your

1279
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:37,640
question sir those people will certainly

1280
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:41,659
not be the standard bearers so be aware

1281
00:52:37,639 --> 00:52:45,318
of that number one taxes audits state

1282
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:48,159
tax local tax federal tax Matt segue

1283
00:52:45,318 --> 00:52:50,639
talk about taxes as they apply to the

1284
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:54,819
cannabis industry if you

1285
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:56,920
well cannabis industry not like no other

1286
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:58,660
industry really there's there's not a

1287
00:52:56,920 --> 00:53:05,289
whole lot of difference there I'll talk

1288
00:52:58,659 --> 00:53:08,139
about 280 but fully heavily taxed state

1289
00:53:05,289 --> 00:53:09,960
local and federal level you know

1290
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:14,639
cannabis products in California

1291
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:17,500
generally subject to BOE sales tax all

1292
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:20,949
these mutual benefit corpse that are AB

1293
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:24,639
nonprofit charters are taxable see

1294
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:28,059
corpse generally speaking so they look a

1295
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:29,949
lot like any other industry a lot of

1296
00:53:28,059 --> 00:53:32,949
these businesses management companies

1297
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:35,079
are set up as pass throughs as LLC's or

1298
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:36,699
partnerships and there's nothing

1299
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:38,500
different there there is one code

1300
00:53:36,699 --> 00:53:42,460
section which I'm sure everyone's heard

1301
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:48,340
of or maybe not be familiar with but

1302
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:51,659
have seen it and that's 280e and that's

1303
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:57,090
the differentiator the game changer for

1304
00:53:51,659 --> 00:54:00,429
the legal cannabis industry in terms of

1305
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:02,140
the anything that's a schedule

1306
00:54:00,429 --> 00:54:04,629
controlled substance Congress passed

1307
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:07,029
this law you know 30 some years ago and

1308
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:10,990
their infinite wisdom but you know it

1309
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:13,420
was really targeted towards you know the

1310
00:54:10,989 --> 00:54:17,619
cocaine trade the Pablo Escobar's of the

1311
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:20,139
world not being able to take itemized

1312
00:54:17,619 --> 00:54:23,529
deductions and business expenses for

1313
00:54:20,139 --> 00:54:25,960
what is federally illegal drug

1314
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:27,820
businesses and so we all know that

1315
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,519
marijuana is currently caught in that

1316
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:32,559
web and that still applies to state

1317
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:37,449
legal cannabis businesses which means

1318
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:39,579
that you're really getting a very the

1319
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:41,829
disallowance and deductions is is

1320
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:46,150
significant you're really taking a cost

1321
00:54:41,829 --> 00:54:50,489
of goods type deduction whether you're a

1322
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:53,920
retail dispensary or a or a grower or a

1323
00:54:50,489 --> 00:54:56,618
producer of cannabis

1324
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:00,690
the there's a number of cases in this

1325
00:54:56,619 --> 00:55:06,780
area the champ case is well known case

1326
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:09,970
in those cases under IRS audit

1327
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:14,260
dispensaries were taking deductions that

1328
00:55:09,969 --> 00:55:15,989
were disallowed ultimately they the Tax

1329
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:19,270
Court got them up to somewhere around

1330
00:55:15,989 --> 00:55:22,029
call it seventy percent of what would be

1331
00:55:19,269 --> 00:55:25,389
a hundred percent of a non cannabis

1332
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:27,220
business in terms of deductions but in

1333
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:31,690
and kind of cramming everything in the

1334
00:55:27,219 --> 00:55:33,459
cost of goods but you know there there's

1335
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:37,480
certain guidance that we give our

1336
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:41,289
clients in this area to maybe sort of

1337
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:44,909
doctors you the lesson that the burden

1338
00:55:41,289 --> 00:55:48,308
with respect to i-280 and that might be

1339
00:55:44,909 --> 00:55:50,529
you know for example a retail dispensary

1340
00:55:48,309 --> 00:55:55,349
selling non-kin was probably useful

1341
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:59,290
whether that's glass pipes t-shirts

1342
00:55:55,349 --> 00:56:02,829
paraphernalia and their whole other set

1343
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:05,558
of laws we are familiar but you know the

1344
00:56:02,829 --> 00:56:08,140
extent you can allocate some of their

1345
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:10,298
expensive dental perfect day I've got

1346
00:56:08,139 --> 00:56:12,009
one hour nine sorts of controlled

1347
00:56:10,298 --> 00:56:13,960
substance yeah I'll be they'll really

1348
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:17,880
touch minutes we're going on and it's

1349
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:20,470
only a deadly property or whatever it is

1350
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:24,030
you there are planning opportunities

1351
00:56:20,469 --> 00:56:26,338
from a tax standpoint to to work around

1352
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:30,249
to some extent to it

1353
00:56:26,338 --> 00:56:32,889
so some of those strategies puerto rico

1354
00:56:30,248 --> 00:56:33,998
puerto rico 280e doesn't fly puerto rico

1355
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:36,699
we're working with a number of folks in

1356
00:56:33,998 --> 00:56:39,518
puerto rico in other words you can

1357
00:56:36,699 --> 00:56:41,170
deduct expenses if marijuana were to be

1358
00:56:39,518 --> 00:56:43,538
rescheduled despite what I said before

1359
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:45,219
the impact rescheduling would have on

1360
00:56:43,539 --> 00:56:47,140
the existing dispensary or natural

1361
00:56:45,219 --> 00:56:51,429
product over the counter system is that

1362
00:56:47,139 --> 00:56:54,368
the 280e exception goes away based on

1363
00:56:51,429 --> 00:56:55,598
the scheduling so rescheduling don't

1364
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:57,099
quote me on this because I have a tax

1365
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,838
lawyer I rely on but I believe it would

1366
00:56:57,099 --> 00:57:01,809
have to be a scheduled three for that

1367
00:56:58,838 --> 00:57:05,429
282 to no longer apply Matt your last

1368
00:57:01,809 --> 00:57:05,430
piece of wisdom for the audience today

1369
00:57:05,728 --> 00:57:11,108
consider other states besides California

1370
00:57:08,469 --> 00:57:15,999
over the next few years I'm a big

1371
00:57:11,108 --> 00:57:19,808
proponent of oregon and i would i would

1372
00:57:15,998 --> 00:57:22,958
definitely diversify your risk in your

1373
00:57:19,809 --> 00:57:24,819
exposure and so it's a fun new market

1374
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:27,518
but you know we're years away in

1375
00:57:24,818 --> 00:57:29,469
california from having that regulatory

1376
00:57:27,518 --> 00:57:31,179
certainty we're all looking for the

1377
00:57:29,469 --> 00:57:32,798
business development council for the

1378
00:57:31,179 --> 00:57:35,588
city colorado just ripped Matt's resume

1379
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:38,369

1380
00:57:35,588 --> 00:57:38,369
