00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,519
[Music]

2
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:19,198
I'm Sue sisily I'm a physici from

3
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:22,000
Scottdale Arizona I practice internal

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,679
medicine and I'm the site principal

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,039
investigator on uh randomiz control

6
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:30,239
trial looking at whole plant cannabis

7
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,000
for PTSD and I just wanted to convey our

8
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,238
appreciation to all the good folks here

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,238
who've been following our Saga trying to

10
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:39,759
get this study underway we're finally at

11
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:41,759
a point where we're um screening

12
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,399
veterans and hope to have our first

13
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:45,799
betet enrolled uh in the next few weeks

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,640
so I'll tell you a little bit more about

15
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:52,919
that during my talk thank

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:56,198
you so yeah my name is uh Dr Pon uh I'm

17
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,079
from Emerald Coast research director

18
00:00:56,198 --> 00:01:01,198
we're out of Pac Florida okay cool

19
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:04,400
they're just doing for this

20
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:08,158
conference um we're primarily interested

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,118
in trying to uh study today's Canabis

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,040
products so the products that you're

23
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:14,599
actually picking up at your dispensaries

24
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,080
um and encouraging some of the larger

25
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:20,719
companies to and to research those pro

26
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,118
products in the ways that they can so

27
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,438
primarily survey and observational

28
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:28,438
research uh and the means that are you

29
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:31,078
know at their disposal at this

30
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,758
point uh my my name is David Ostro and

31
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:36,078
like most of you I'm from the Midwest

32
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,719
Chicago uh which is where I founded the

33
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:41,559
first gay community clinic in the world

34
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:43,599
uh back when I was in my mdphd training

35
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,240
at the University of Chicago we went on

36
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:49,718
to prove that Hepatitis B was a sexy

37
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:51,959
transmitted disease and from that we uh

38
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:55,000
were the first Community Clinic to get a

39
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:57,919
contract to study the natural history of

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,039
AIDS and its causes back in

41
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,759
1983 that became the largest AIDS study

42
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:05,239
in the history of the world the

43
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,920
multicenter AIDS cohort study and we're

44
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:12,840
still following thousands of men all

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:16,598
across the US um uh after 33 years and

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,479
we get semiannual physical mental

47
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:23,000
behavioral evaluations plus we put away

48
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:25,598
blood and lymphocytes and purified

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
viruses from those who become infected

50
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,280
so it's been a tremendous source of

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,919
information and it's a model for

52
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:36,439
observational research on in a subject

53
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:38,878
where we start basically at zero that

54
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:42,359
I've been proposing um in the form of

55
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:44,120
the North American uh community-based

56
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,920
clinical cannabis research and

57
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,360
evaluation Network for the last eight

58
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:53,280
years and I think it's a model for how

59
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,760
we can move forward now even pre-post

60
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:00,640
preib to work together at a community

61
00:02:56,759 --> 00:03:02,878
and patient centered basis to really

62
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,518
understand through observational

63
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:08,840
research um what are the specific

64
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,840
strains and preparations that work best

65
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,158
and have the least side effects for uh

66
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,598
specif people suffering from specific

67
00:03:14,158 --> 00:03:20,120
illnesses and I think everybody who you

68
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:23,878
know very properly wants to think about

69
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,360
post prohibition my I have I take a very

70
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:29,759
negative view about that because I think

71
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,760
post prohibition will will only happen

72
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,000
once the

73
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:35,280
pharmaceutical corporations have taken

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,878
over the whole field and driven the

75
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,158
community out of it so I hope we can get

76
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:43,239
going I think the time is now and the

77
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:47,878
opportunity is now to to do as much

78
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:49,480
science um in in the uh to help patients

79
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:52,078
and to help those of us who are

80
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:56,878
activists in this field really get the

81
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,879
best out of this uh wonderful

82
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:02,199
herb great thanks to all of our amazing

83
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,079
panelists I'm Rob Bon I serve in the

84
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:06,318
California State Assembly I was the lead

85
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,640
joint author of the medical cannabis

86
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,039
regulation and safety act from last year

87
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,878
and doing some follow-up work um this

88
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,719
year as well uh with a bill called ab1

89
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,439
1575 and obviously there will be a lot

90
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,079
of ongoing work in research and

91
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:20,959
development is a a critical issue and

92
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,519
we're uh just super excited to have such

93
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,240
a distinguished panel so thank you for

94
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:26,079
the introductions I'm excited to be here

95
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,280
and honored to be here with you so why

96
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:31,159
don't we just jump in outside of the

97
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:33,599
introductions into a little uh maybe

98
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,759
five minutes each on on where on on

99
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,320
where research and development is headed

100
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:43,439
um post prohibition um I I took a few

101
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,279
notes here so I'm going to use my um uh

102
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,478
first I want to say you know we got some

103
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,918
potentially great news from the DEA last

104
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,719
month right they announced that that

105
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:56,478
they're ending the Nida Monopoly and

106
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,560
which could possibly be a major step

107
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,800
forward for cannabis research and I

108
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,519
emphasize possibly because the fact is

109
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,720
that the announcement was not

110
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:10,799
accompanied by any timeline so um yeah

111
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:14,280
so as we all know the DEA are experts in

112
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,560
delay um as our study is proof positive

113
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,519
I mean it's taken us seven years to get

114
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,160
to this point where we're finally

115
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:23,359
allowed to you know where they finally

116
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,120
issued me a DEA schedule one license

117
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,520
that a lot of scientist call that the

118
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,600
golden ticket because it gives you the

119
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,240
privilege of buying cannabis from the

120
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,840
federal government and if any of you

121
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,840
have seen what that looks like I have

122
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:38,519
some pictures on my laptop we just got

123
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:42,239
our shipment in a couple weeks ago and

124
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:43,680
it was incredibly depressing after so

125
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,160
many years of struggle with the

126
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,759
government and everyone was celebrating

127
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,039
this so-called Victory and then the

128
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,600
study drug arrives by FedEx by the way

129
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:57,240
uh yeah it was arrived you think it's

130
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:02,639
like armored truck 4 kilos of cannabis

131
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:06,478
comes in a FedEx delivery man um so the

132
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,960
the good news so theoretically this

133
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:12,800
Federal monopo that has styed cannabis

134
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,598
research for four decades now I mean

135
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,560
they the federal government has enjoyed

136
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:19,839
you know they've assigned the University

137
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,680
of Mississippi this Monopoly for 48

138
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:25,399
years and it's very sad that there's so

139
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,639
many um investigators whose Studies have

140
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:30,159
have not been approved um to move

141
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:32,960
forward because naida simply didn't like

142
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,439
the nature of the study they only really

143
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,638
were greenlighting studies looking

144
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,959
safety studies we call looking at

145
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,280
harmful side effects and addiction

146
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,959
potential so if you dare said that you

147
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:47,079
wanted to study efficacy of marijuana

148
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:50,198
those were the studies that were you

149
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:53,800
know systematically impeded by our

150
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:56,120
government um so so we have a problem in

151
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,680
that the DEA doesn't have any timetable

152
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:02,560
to authorize other Growers um and in the

153
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,639
meantime we are stuck with this cannabis

154
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,439
um we we the the paperwork that came

155
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:10,280
with the Cannabis just you know does not

156
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:14,319
tell you anything about uh other than

157
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:16,318
the THC to CBD ratio so you just heard

158
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,479
all these you know experts on in the

159
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,240
last panel all these sophisticated

160
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,199
Growers talking about how complex this

161
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,439
plant is we don't know anything about

162
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,840
the other canabo in the plant the

163
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,639
tarpine profile flavonoids what

164
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,519
conditions it was grown under was it

165
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,439
grown with pesticides or not they told

166
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:38,560
me it was grown

167
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:42,639
organically so they don't Define that um

168
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:44,478
and it arrived Frozen and uh with a a

169
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,918
thawing procedure they said it had been

170
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:52,598
in their freezer for two years so um so

171
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:54,918
yeah that was uh it's frustrating um I I

172
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:56,759
did want to mention that um you know and

173
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:58,918
obviously we're still not able to get

174
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,038
the varieties of cannabis that we

175
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:04,560
request you know scientists who ask for

176
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:07,598
more than you know 10 to 12% THC that is

177
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,280
their high THC um available if you look

178
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:12,439
at the naida website they list the the

179
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:17,079
phenotypes that are available and 10 to

180
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:19,158
12% is the max so um uh I did want to

181
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:21,918
also give you one more bit of of good

182
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:24,598
news though from um to I don't I want to

183
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:27,439
instill some optimism here um many of

184
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:29,478
you saw that the American Legion which

185
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:32,958
is the largest veteran service

186
00:08:29,478 --> 00:08:36,080
organization in our country 2.5 million

187
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:38,359
veteran members mostly very conservative

188
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,599
um they did announc that you we were

189
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,519
able to infiltrate that group and pass a

190
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,120
resolution there that um not just

191
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:50,240
ordered the ordered the DEA to

192
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,120
reschedule cannabis but also demanded

193
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,120
that the DEA license other Growers for

194
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,399
research and I thought that was very

195
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,320
powerful uh I want to give a shout out

196
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:02,440
to um my buddy Rob Berto Pickering is

197
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,920
with the battlefield foundation and this

198
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,320
gentleman was an integral part of making

199
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:10,319
that happen and we're going to continue

200
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,760
to see um efforts of good people real

201
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,079
expert Growers to finally be able to

202
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:18,039
apply for schedule one license and we're

203
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:20,958
going to pressure um you know pressure

204
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:23,559
them as much as we possibly can to to

205
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:27,559
get this um to get this going actually

206
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:30,359

smiling faces that are part of the

226
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:21,039
movement or want to be part of the

227
00:10:18,278 --> 00:10:23,439
movement or just want to be educated uh

228
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:25,719
it's a wonderful thing there's a lot of

229
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,680
good energy in this room and that's what

230
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,240
we need in this movement is a lot of

231
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,519
positivity and good energy

232
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,639
um I'd also like to thank my esteemed

233
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:36,879
colleagues up here on stage uh it's

234
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,439
actually an honor and a privilege uh to

235
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,879
be speaking with such an accomplished

236
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,160
group of cannabis

237
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:44,879
Scholars uh so that being said I'd like

238
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:47,199
to speak for just a moment about why I

239
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:50,000
enter this industry and some of the more

240
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,360
pressing issues that I believe are out

241
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,839
there today um so most folks realize

242
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:59,560
that the gold standard uh for uh

243
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:03,440
researching investigational new drug

244
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:07,000
applications um are blinded controlled

245
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,120
clinical trials and unfortunately we've

246
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
had far too few of those uh when it

247
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,799
comes to

248
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,639
cannabis and uh that being said I mean

249
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,078
we've got Pioneers like Dr sicy Who

250
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:20,159
spent the better part of a decade uh

251
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:23,359
trying to complete a clinical

252
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:25,799
trial um however the situation with

253
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,480
cannabis is really unique I mean this is

254
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:31,000
a drug that's been out there for

255
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,959
obviously a long time it's been smoked

256
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,839
for

257
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:37,919
Millennia um and

258
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:40,680
frankly uh it hasn't obviously followed

259
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,919
the traditional model of biomedical drug

260
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:45,719
Discovery uh usually we start out with a

261
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:48,559
Target usually uh G protein coupled

262
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,879
receptor a protein kise do a bunch of

263
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:54,799
fancy molecular modeling and high

264
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:57,958
throughput screening and to identify uh

265
00:11:54,799 --> 00:12:00,078
candidate drugs and then eventually the

266
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:03,000
ideal candidate drug drug that will then

267
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,919
go through the clinical trial process

268
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,440
but obviously with cannabis we've taken

269
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:11,879
a completely different route

270
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,160
and what's unique about cannabis is you

271
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:17,958
couldn't ask for a better cannada drug

272
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:20,759
in some ways uh it has one of the best

273
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:23,319
safety profiles that you could ask for I

274
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:25,958
mean the ld50 which is defined as the

275
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,278
lethal dose that would kill 50% of the

276
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:30,879
people taking the drug is literally so

277
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:33,720
high with this drug that you could

278
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:37,600
consume pounds and pounds of it and not

279
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,440
die okay so and that is very unique most

280
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,360
of the drugs that are being investigated

281
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,680
out there today they would die to have

282
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:49,440
an ld50 in that range

283
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:52,399
so that being said um the real issue is

284
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,639
that the Cannabis industry is moving so

285
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,480
quickly right now and research is moving

286
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:58,879
rather

287
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,320
slowly and the products that we see

288
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,039
seeing in the dispensaries today and

289
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,959
especially these new products we just

290
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:08,039
got a wonderful presentation about the

291
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:09,958
evolution of cannabis and so we've got

292
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:12,439
all these new products on the market

293
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:14,239
that really haven't been adequately

294
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,800
studied I think most people would agree

295
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,320
that whole plant cannabis is relatively

296
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,799
safe and an ulous I mean it's it's

297
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,440
really not harming

298
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:26,319
folks um that being said these new

299
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,040
products that are in the dispensaries

300
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,600
which are frankly outselling flowers at

301
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:35,879
this point uh such as concentrates these

302
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,680
vape pens Edibles these new

303
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:40,000
preparations obviously haven't been

304
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,198
studied for any real meaningful length

305
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,679
of time because they've only been in the

306
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:48,319
dispensaries for a short period of time

307
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:52,519
so um I guess

308
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:55,000
where uh I came into this is I started

309
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,440
seeing uh some of the older generation

310
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,799
embracing these new products and and

311
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,839
some of the younger generation as well

312
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:05,278
well but primarily my parents and their

313
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:07,160
friends uh using these vape pens and the

314
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,679
truth is as a

315
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:11,679
scientist uh you know I started to look

316
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,758
on Pub Med the world's largest medical

317
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,278
database for Research into these pens

318
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,919
and they just really isn't any it's not

319
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:22,720
there uh the tobacco industry who

320
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:25,240
initially created these pens uh they

321
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,959
have the research but they sure haven't

322
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:32,039
published it so um I do believe that the

323
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:34,399
vast majority of the products that are

324
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:37,439
out there in these dispensaries are

325
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,360
probably safe you know I am not an

326
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,320
alarmist and I'm not here to scare

327
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,079
anyone uh in fact I am a supporter of

328
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,879
this industry and an

329
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:49,799
advocate uh that being said I also

330
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:53,240
believe that it is incumbent upon this

331
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:57,679
industry and upon the producers of these

332
00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:00,560
new products to begin to do at

333
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:03,198
least you know at least what they can

334
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:05,078
research-wise and if that's just survey

335
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,120
research if it's just observational

336
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:09,278
research for now they could at least be

337
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,240
capturing all those data points so

338
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,240
that's what I've been doing is

339
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,278
encouraging these larger companies that

340
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,159
can actually afford to have research and

341
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:17,278
development program to go ahead and

342
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,559
begin that

343
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,879
research so I'll say that you know

344
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:26,039
nonetheless I do see a lot of signs and

345
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:29,120
a lot of improvement uh in both private

346
00:15:26,039 --> 00:15:30,439
and academic cannabis uh research you

347
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,198
know the larger companies that I was

348
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,480
calling on privately a couple of years

349
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:36,719
ago and asking for a chief scientific

350
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,039
officer I mean they just laughed at me

351
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,240
they didn't have a chief scientific

352
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,639
officer head of research and development

353
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,159
no NOP not that either so we were just

354
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,000
talking with businessmen a few years ago

355
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:48,559
now those larger companies they have

356
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,559
those people in place so you're starting

357
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:55,559
to see scientists at these larger

358
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:57,518
companies and starting to see um more of

359
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:59,078
an emphasis on research and development

360
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,360
all those I would say personally that

361
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:03,599
it's really skewed toward

362
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,680
development um and although slowly

363
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,240
academic research as Dr Sicily talked

364
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:11,519
about is beginning to at least head in

365
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,000
the right direction uh because as long

366
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,839
as we can't do translational research

367
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,440
and as long as of the Cannabis that Dr

368
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:23,519
sic is being provided by naida uh is of

369
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:26,199
that poor quality um it's hard to

370
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,278
really uh call that translational

371
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:29,719
research when the vets that are going to

372
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,838
be taking that

373
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,519
product uh that's not the product that

374
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,959
they're going and buying in dispensaries

375
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,639
my my friends I mean and they're

376
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,919
probably like you said they're probably

377
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:42,720
going to laugh when they see what you're

378
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:45,679
going to ask them to inhale so uh we

379
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,399
really need uh these new Partnerships

380
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,958
and you know I like the model in

381
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:50,799
Pennsylvania that they've formed you

382
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,119
know Colorado wanted to be the

383
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,679
recreational Cannabis King uh in

384
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:59,399
Pennsylvania they want to be the medical

385
00:16:54,679 --> 00:17:01,958
cannabis King and frankly um I believe

386
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:03,958
that these Partnerships between

387
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:06,038
universities and all these probably

388
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,279
private cannabis institutes in the same

389
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:10,318
way you saw stem cells have to go

390
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:12,240
private and stem cell institutes you're

391
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:14,199
going to see a lot of that in the future

392
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,759
so just to try and wrap up here quickly

393
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:20,798
all I know is this canos needs to be

394
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:22,798
studied thoroughly at all levels uh as

395
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:25,798
much as possible I believe there needs

396
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,918
to be frankly tons more academic

397
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:30,918
research uh do I believe that we need

398
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,038
more private research certainly uh do I

399
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:34,080
believe that there's a role for big

400
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:35,599
Pharma in this yes there's a lot of

401
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,839
talent in big Pharma and they're not

402
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,480
going to be cut out of the equation

403
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:42,038
anyway so we might as well move forward

404
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,679
with the incremental steps that we can

405
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:47,200
take right now and frankly as many

406
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:52,080
players as we can get involved in the

407
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:57,000
research is a good thing because we

408
00:17:52,079 --> 00:18:00,678
need uh a broad spectrum of research not

409
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,359
just big Pharma not just Academia we

410
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:06,840
need everyone to be doing this research

411
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:09,839
and just to finish uh as a last Point

412
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:13,798
I've really actually never seen much

413
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:16,678
harm done by doing too much

414
00:18:13,798 --> 00:18:19,200
research uh frankly the harm is done

415
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:21,559
when we do too little research so I'm

416
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,440
just here to advocate for more research

417
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:28,720
from all entities and thank you very

418
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,600
much thank you Dr Pon let's go to drra

419
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,440
yeah I wanted to follow that talk

420
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:35,240
because you gave me so many great

421
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,880
lead-ins and and one of that you know my

422
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,599
main talk is about yes we can talk about

423
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,760
the future in terms of what's going to

424
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:46,119
happen once prohibition uh is ended or

425
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:48,679
so forth but we all know that that is a

426
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:50,399
train a train that's hurtling down a

427
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:53,759
track that's almost worse than when we

428
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,200
invaded Iraq I mean that is a track

429
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:59,440
that's been laid by Farmer and the DEA

430
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,440
and FDA for decades and it's just been a

431
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,360
postponing act against the community so

432
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,320
they can you know have to total control

433
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,119
over this I mean one of the greatest

434
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:15,798
lies that you saw in the DEA statement

435
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:18,439
was that um we allow uh you know lower

436
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:20,639
scheduling for synthetic cannabinoids

437
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,759
that been made by the drug industry well

438
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,000
I want to tell you something none of

439
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:30,759
those compounds are synthetic mostly the

440
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,720
the the th is is extracted from that

441
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:35,798
same from the leftover crap from what

442
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,480
you've received from the University of

443
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:41,000
Mississippi which has been breaking

444
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,599
their contract with naida for decades

445
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,480
and then they have this other thing

446
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:48,719
called the midest touch and that is they

447
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:52,798
put it in a capsule they add sesame oil

448
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:55,120
and voila it's legal it's schedule three

449
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:57,038
so these rules only apply to the

450
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:59,038
community and they will apply to the

451
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:02,720
community and the ACT activist and so

452
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:05,558
forth as long as it takes for a farmer

453
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,159
to get complete control of this industry

454
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:10,279
so what do we have to do in the

455
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:13,640
meanwhile we have to do

456
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:17,319
observational scientifically developed

457
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:20,360
research on every single person we can

458
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:23,720
capture who's going on medical cannabis

459
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:27,000
in an area or a state or the system

460
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:29,558
where the with the concentration and the

461
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
composition of the cannabis is being

462
00:20:29,558 --> 00:20:34,960
very carefully monitored and the amount

463
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,519
that they're using is being controlled

464
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,480
so I'm working with the groups that are

465
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:42,038
trying to set up the standards for that

466
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,200
and I'm working with the doctors through

467
00:20:42,038 --> 00:20:48,200
the American Academy of canabo Medicine

468
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,679
and the society for cannabis clinicians

469
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,400
and all over the United States and

470
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:56,200
Canada who will agree to give us

471
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,679
objective feedback on their patients

472
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,480
every six month just like we

473
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:04,000
uh ran the Mac study and then to

474
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:07,558
interview those patients who agree to be

475
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,960
in it at least oneon-one on the phone

476
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:12,678
and then maybe thereafter through

477
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:15,159
surveys because as a long-term survey

478
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,798
researcher I know we can never assume

479
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:20,200
that we know what the questions are that

480
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:23,839
the patients want us to answer so we

481
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,679
must do mixed um method research

482
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:28,798
starting with qualitative and

483
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,400
ethnographic and so forth and I you know

484
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,158
kind of come to this place because I've

485
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,000
been doing this for 34 years in the area

486
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:38,840
of AIDS and HIV and have seen how

487
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,359
powerful Whoever thought we would have

488
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:43,678
not only the

489
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:46,000
treatment uh in Hand by now but be

490
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,038
reaching for the elimination of this

491
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,558
disease I certainly never thought of

492
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:51,919
this would happen and we would get to

493
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:54,038
this point so there's a lot we can do no

494
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,919
matter how much the drug company say oh

495
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:59,079
no observational research will never go

496
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:01,360
past the FDA it's not the state of the

497
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:03,399
art and all this kind of stuff well sure

498
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,000
they say that because they want the

499
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,278
system to stay the way it is we have to

500
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,440
do the same thing that a activists did

501
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:13,599
in the

502
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,798
1970s what and we have to stand up to

503
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:19,918
this we have to get the people uh out of

504
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,720
office have to vote vote vote at the

505
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,400
local and every other level but we have

506
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,079
to come together as a as a community

507
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,240
that wants to work together with

508
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:32,000
standardized Med methods and good

509
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,839
analysis and so forth and build that

510
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,240
database from which we can learn so so

511
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:44,240
much and we could do it right now thank

512
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:47,679
[Applause]

513
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,880
you um I you know cannabis is a a

514
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,400
controlled substance and yet its use has

515
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,240
proliferated uncontrolled for many Decor

516
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,759
decades so I'm not as freaked out about

517
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,200
big Pharma as my colleague Dr Astro is I

518
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:02,640
don't think you big farmer or any other

519
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,080
single entity can ever totally control

520
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,400
this plant it just won't

521
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:10,000
happen um but big Pharma is a serious

522
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,278
player and can have a serious influence

523
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,558
I wanted to start out my brief

524
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:16,119
introductory comments by giving a shout

525
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:19,240
out to of all people President Ronald

526
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:21,959
Reagan and we should all thank him

527
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,079
ironically because uh he did a lot

528
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,960
inadvertently to advance us to the place

529
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,079
where we are you know when Reagan took

530
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,880
over he relaunched the drug war with the

531
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:33,199
Vengeance he militarized it uh his

532
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,440
administration put a lot of money into

533
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,278
research because they were sure this

534
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:42,159
evil weed uh if the research was done uh

535
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:44,759
it could be shown how it damages the

536
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,679
brain this is in the 1980s they put a

537
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:49,119
lot of money into this but instead of

538
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:51,400
showing how harmful cannabis was they

539
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:53,000
ended up funding the research that

540
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,600
culminated in the discovery of the

541
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,599
endocannabinoid system uh which shows

542
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:00,278
why cannabis has a neuroprotective

543
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:02,480
effect not a neurotoxic effect so

544
00:24:00,278 --> 00:24:04,720
there's a great irony there uh and when

545
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,599
we talk and and you know that's a hugely

546
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,640
important Discovery and and it's the

547
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:11,798
edifice for so much of of research that

548
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,200
has been done and will continue to do uh

549
00:24:11,798 --> 00:24:18,639
be done as we transition into a post

550
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:20,679
prohibition era um you know when we when

551
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,480
I say it has a huge impact has really

552
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:23,759
opened up whole new vistas of

553
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,000
understanding human biology and

554
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,919
Physiology and it has an impact for many

555
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,440
different areas of Medical Science I was

556
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:33,120
say a significant impact for all areas

557
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,960
of Medical Science and it sheds a lot of

558
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:37,239
light on why cannabis is such a

559
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,640
versatile medicine and why it's the most

560
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,640
popular recreational substance on the

561
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,159
planet and yes it is medical and

562
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:46,240
recreational and yes low dose is very

563
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,880
significant value valuable and so is

564
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,159
high do we have to embrace it all when

565
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,200
we talk about research in the landscape

566
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:55,640
you know thus far I think one of the

567
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,880
misconceptions that have been promoted

568
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,880
uh by uh largely the media but policy

569
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,120
makers as well is that we're just

570
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,720
lacking the science to know really

571
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,319
what's up with cannabis we that's what

572
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,360
the DEA said that they didn't have the

573
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:12,319
science to to reschedule or deschedule

574
00:25:10,359 --> 00:25:14,199
um there's a voluminous amount of

575
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:18,678
scientific data that have been

576
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:20,798
accumulated um uh most of it is not been

577
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:22,200
clinical oriented in fact very little

578
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:23,759
has been clinical oriented there's also

579
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,399
been observational research

580
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,440
observational studies uh so we have a

581
00:25:26,398 --> 00:25:31,319
lot of data that explain how and why

582
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:33,558
cannabis works and we say we have a lot

583
00:25:31,319 --> 00:25:35,480
of data people anecdotally or through

584
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:37,278
observational studies saying it works

585
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:39,558
for this that the other thing what we

586
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:42,119
what we are lacking by and large is the

587
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:43,839
clinical research to prove quote unquote

588
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:46,479
that it works to the extent that we need

589
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:48,798
it so what's the implications of this uh

590
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,079
as we are heading now into a new era

591
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:53,158
well you know for a long time the the

592
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:55,158
the rule of thumb has been cannabis is

593
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:57,960
so dangerous that they couldn't do human

594
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:59,600
studies right well so we have an animal

595
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,240
studies and we have a lot of research

596
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,798
and a lot of data for animal studies and

597
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,038
some of is very significant and

598
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:07,599
important but the problem is you can't

599
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:10,919
extrapolate from animal data to humans

600
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:13,398
necessarily always it provides leads uh

601
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:16,440
uh it it it show it can show the way for

602
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:19,000
or to develop uh drugs and so forth but

603
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,759
it can't always be easily uh uh

604
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,519
extrapolated in particularly when it

605
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:26,079
comes to dosage this is a problem that

606
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:27,720
we see uh at project CBD you know people

607
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:29,678
who want to make products are sometimes

608
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,880
times they are are are healing but

609
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,600
they're not necessarily medical

610
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,640
professionals they go read these science

611
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:37,678
papers and they look at how much CBD or

612
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,640
THC it's always single molecules

613
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,919
generally are given to a rat or a mouse

614
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,840
or a dog and and they and they take that

615
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,600
and then say okay well if the dog or the

616
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:51,798
mouse is getting 20 milligrams of

617
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:54,839
something per kilogram and they and they

618
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:56,480
weigh 10 lb well for a 200 lb person

619
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:59,439
they should be getting 20 times the

620
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,240
amount that is is ridiculous it it first

621
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,159
of all and and really this is how things

622
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,919
are calculated I've talked to people so

623
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:07,320
as a result this is sort of a Prejudice

624
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:09,159
for very high and when I say high dosing

625
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:10,639
I mean almost obscene dosing I'm not

626
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:12,440
talking about what Swami was talking

627
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,840
about and we're on the same page about

628
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:18,798
that you know um and and it's uh it you

629
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:23,519
start off on the wrong foot and you can

630
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:25,440
get very distorted results um uh so what

631
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,879
I think when we talk about research and

632
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,080
where we're going I think I would like

633
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,760
and it's going to happen on many

634
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:32,359
different levels and big farmer will be

635
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:34,038
involved and there will be observational

636
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:37,000
studies there'll be all sorts of things

637
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:38,879
going on uh what I think it's important

638
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,679
uh is that at least some of the research

639
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:44,960
be oriented very pragmatically uh to

640
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:47,000
enhance our ability to optimize this

641
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:50,360
plant for whether it's therapeutic use

642
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,798
or recreational use we have had since

643
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:54,599
before the written word humankind has

644
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,759
had a relationship with this plant a

645
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:59,519
very significant one that relationship

646
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:02,398
was broken uh last century because of

647
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:05,519
prohibition we have to relearn about how

648
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:08,479
to use this plant it's now that we have

649
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,558
uh uh oils and the concentrates where

650
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,319
you can measure very specifically and

651
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,240
know specifically what is in these

652
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:17,839
products if they're label properly uh it

653
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,519
gives us an opportunity uh to kind of

654
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:21,519
take it all onto a different level it's

655
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,000
not just smoking a joint anymore and I

656
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:26,038
have nothing against that I do it

657
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,480
practically every day uh but it now you

658
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:30,720
can uh know exactly what you're taking

659
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,720
you can repeat the dosage or you can

660
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,440
adjust the dosage um and you can get a

661
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,880
very clear indication of what you need

662
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,240
if you find something right so you can

663
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:43,080
repeat it uh so I think research and we

664
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,278
we talked before we heard about uh uh

665
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:47,240
this Quagmire around dosing on the panel

666
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:48,880
before this is an area that's really

667
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,200
significant you know dosing is all over

668
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,000
the map at project CBD we're hearing for

669
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,000
as little as 2 milligrams of CBD and

670
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,798
when I say CBD I always mean CBD rich

671
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
with other things never a CBD isolate is

672
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:04,079
what I'm talking about as little as that

673
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,919
can be very effective therapeutically

674
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,678
and as much as a grad day uh so where

675
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:11,360
are we all add in this we have to figure

676
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:15,120
this out luckily it's a very safe

677
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:16,959
substance uh but uh you know I think I

678
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,278
fear as we go forward last point I'll

679
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,558
make real quickly is that the

680
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:23,640
researchers and scientists they aren't

681
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:24,879
immune from the the cultural Prejudice

682
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,919
in which they're working you know there

683
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,880
was just as an example a study done was

684
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,600
published the results only last month

685
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,399
from the University of British Columbia

686
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:35,839
maybe you heard about this the press

687
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:38,518
release released from the University uh

688
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:41,519
described it as the first scientific

689
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:43,880
proof that cannabis makes uh marijuana

690
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:45,519
smoking causes one to be a slacker you

691
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,360
know what they did with this they

692
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,759
injected massive doses of THC into a

693
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:52,558
rat's brain and they found the rat

694
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:54,319
wasn't very interested in eating or

695
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:56,879
going for the sugar when they usually

696
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:58,759
are they Overlook the fact that you have

697
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,200
a by phasic effects so when you have

698
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:03,558
very high doses of THC it actually

699
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,640
dampens the appetite and dampens the

700
00:30:03,558 --> 00:30:08,440
interest in Sugar so here they they

701
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,000
extrapolated from a single molecule of a

702
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,720
mouse and and projected onto that their

703
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:16,679
own prejudices and concluded this is

704
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,679
some uh that they had some serious data

705
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:22,399
they could say about uh slacker hood or

706
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,720
a motivation uh and we have to avoid

707
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,918
this you know in the future but but I

708
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,759
think that as we transition into this

709
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,399
new these prejudices aren't going to

710
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:35,440
just be let go uh and my final Point

711
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:38,000
here is I think uh I'm worried but I'm

712
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,159
also hopeful that as we move forward

713
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,440
that we don't sacrifice Medical on the

714
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,480
altar of recreational they're both

715
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,798
important uh and the medical shouldn't

716
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,519
be S shoved aside and and uh big farmers

717
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:51,440
shouldn't be allowed to dominate the

718
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:54,319
industry at least the above ground part

719
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,000
of it um you know there is a place for

720
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:58,759
big Pharma and there's a place for

721
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,960
isolates but to me it's a small place in

722
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:03,000
the overall research Universe in the

723
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,079
potential of cannabis it's a legitimate

724
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,599
place but the problem is it becomes

725
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:08,558
imperious and wants to take over

726
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:11,038
everything and shove everything else out

727
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:11,038
those are my

728
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,960
comments wonderful thank you to all of

729
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:21,278
our panelists again for your for your

730
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:23,440
opening remarks um I think we have some

731
00:31:21,278 --> 00:31:26,638
questions that could uh if you have any

732
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,200
um you can uh we'll identify you and

733
00:31:26,638 --> 00:31:29,839
we'll have a mic ph up here but let let

734
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,080
me just start with one there was some

735
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:35,199
reference to the the federal climate um

736
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:38,038
can any of the panelists share their

737
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,919
thoughts on specifically what is

738
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:42,519
necessary to change the federal climate

739
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:45,200
to be more supportive of research who

740
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:47,319
needs to do what and how can Advocates

741
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,278
and activists be involved in making that

742
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:52,798
happen sooner than later well it's um a

743
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:54,960
very interesting thing because you can

744
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:57,558
change the law you can change the

745
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,519
scheduling but until you change the

746
00:31:57,558 --> 00:32:02,720
education of health professionals in the

747
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:05,120
United States and the and and the

748
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,759
stigmatization that's been driven into

749
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:10,079
everybody I mean I've gone before

750
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,879
Medical scho classes and talked about

751
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,879
the myths and the lies and everything

752
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:16,000
and I've had students stand up and say

753
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,799
how dare you say that our government

754
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,798
lies to

755
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,840
us and I look at them and I say wow I

756
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,240
mean don't they teach you anything about

757
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:29,199
medical ethics and and you know the uh

758
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,880
the the the projects that have been done

759
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,038
to uh infect people with with all kinds

760
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,799
of diseases and not even tell them you

761
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:38,798
know it's just you know our history of

762
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:41,558
our government and cover ups I mean from

763
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:43,798
the AIDS epidemic I could write a whole

764
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:45,759
book of having been the fly on the wall

765
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:49,038
when government people covered up and

766
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:50,319
lied and and and uh even they though

767
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:52,599
they knew that the government was

768
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:54,798
responsible for the spread of HIV among

769
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:58,278
Haitians when they released them from

770
00:32:54,798 --> 00:33:00,000
the camps uh by by judge order they

771
00:32:58,278 --> 00:33:02,519
didn't even warn the communities they

772
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,200
were going to and then they said okay

773
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:09,558
being Haitian is a risk factor okay all

774
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,960
right so you can change everything but

775
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:13,960
you have to change beliefs and you

776
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,919
change beliefs is the hardest thing to

777
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:20,360
do and then you change attitudes that

778
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:22,320
way and I even proposed that Nido once

779
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:24,240
that they should sponsor a program to

780
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:27,720
change the beliefs and attitudes of

781
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,759
their own staff around around

782
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,600
cannabis uh you could imagine that

783
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,919
didn't get a very you know warm

784
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,678
reception right now they say they've

785
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,759
changed they say they've heard the

786
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:43,200
message and everything but they still

787
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:46,798
are tool of the same FDA DEA big farmer

788
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:49,278
naida uh alcohol industry you name it

789
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:52,398
and who's fighting us the hardest now

790
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:56,398
now it's the opioid manufactors because

791
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:59,918
they see a tremendous threat if um uh

792
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:03,359
strong strains of of analgesic uh uh

793
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,639
types of cannabis get out there because

794
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,158
they're not going to be able to argue

795
00:34:04,638 --> 00:34:10,679
anymore that they're incredibly

796
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:13,000
addicting and and accounting for more

797
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,079
and more deaths among Youth and so forth

798
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,719
the United States that their drugs

799
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:22,200
really are better than than cannabis if

800
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:24,519
we show them uh this is the fact and and

801
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:27,719
you know in defense of the University of

802
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:29,599
British uh Canadia there's another group

803
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:32,598
there that published a wonderful paper a

804
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,960
few months ago showing that a huge

805
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:38,280
proportion of the people in their survey

806
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,599
of 1500 people going on medical cannabis

807
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:45,399
a quarter at least did it to reduce or

808
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:47,760
stop the use of addictive opian for for

809
00:34:45,398 --> 00:34:50,519
their treatment and I think that has to

810
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,359
be a cry you just like we used to say

811
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:56,079
you know uh ignorance kills and so forth

812
00:34:54,358 --> 00:35:00,159
everything we have to go out there and

813
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:02,289
say that medical cannabis saves lives

814
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:06,679
okay and is harm

815
00:35:02,289 --> 00:35:09,079
[Applause]

816
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:11,078
reduction I I wanted to mention that you

817
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:13,280
know the challenge with finding new

818
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:16,079
sources of study drug for any of these

819
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,960
controlled trials um is even more

820
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,920
problematic because of course the DEA

821
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,440
announcement said that if you're

822
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,280
breaking federal law now you're if

823
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,079
you're a state licensed grower you're

824
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,160
not eligible to apply and so this has

825
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:31,680
the potential to become you know an

826
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:34,598
academic oligopoly where only

827
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:36,480
universities can apply um to grow

828
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:39,599
Canabis for research and we really have

829
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,960
to fight that I saw an article in Vice

830
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,720
recently I'm not sure how many other

831
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,760
folks saw that the DEA director was

832
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:48,439
interviewed by this Vice reporter and

833
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,960
said you know was this just a publicity

834
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:52,679
stunt or is the DEA serious about

835
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,679
licensing other Growers and he said

836
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:58,239
absolutely not a publicity stun we are

837
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:01,838
you know this is a this is serious we

838
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:05,199
are going to um find other Growers but

839
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:07,000
we haven't received any applications yet

840
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:08,759
he said that there were no applications

841
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,079
in the pipeline because of course

842
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:13,280
everybody knew that there was a a

843
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:15,720
government enforced Monopoly and nobody

844
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,200
bothered to try so we are trying to work

845
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:21,519
with groups all over the country whoever

846
00:36:18,199 --> 00:36:23,879
is willing to put their toe in and fill

847
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:26,400
out this application I want to emphasize

848
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:28,760
to you it's not as daunting as people

849
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,920
think because everybody assumes a DEA

850
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,240
application is going to be 200 pages and

851
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,240
ridiculously bureaucratic it is

852
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:39,598
literally a three-page application it

853
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:42,078
took us five minutes to fill out with

854
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,960
our group at the battlefield Foundation

855
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,440
that and I was really proud of people

856
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:49,240
like Steve D'Angelo you heard yesterday

857
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,240
who's offered to partner with us on also

858
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:53,279
on trying to apply for a federal growth

859
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:56,199
so I think I want to encourage you all

860
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:58,720
the more people who can get applications

861
00:36:56,199 --> 00:37:01,559
into the Pipeline and pressure the DEA

862
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:06,078
to to license other real expert

863
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:06,078
cultivators it is going to be valuable

864
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:14,880
believe

865
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:18,559
the hello um my name is Dr Rosen and I

866
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:22,480
was the one who practiced Western

867
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:26,920
medicine treating benign and cancer pain

868
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:29,679
for 40 years and I retired 12 years ago

869
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:32,079
happy watching television and traveling

870
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:34,838
and all of a sudden medical marijuana

871
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,640
came to view and for the last 6 months

872
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:39,920
I've been obsessed with trying to

873
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:42,679
understand what it's all about and so I

874
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:46,358
resurrected my license and I'm going to

875
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:49,838
start a brand new clinic and a mobile

876
00:37:46,358 --> 00:37:54,239
clinic to be able to get to those people

877
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:56,719
who need it uh I came from the last this

878
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:59,118
last month of this month this is my

879
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:01,959
fourth meeting on medical

880
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:05,599
cannabinoid and the last one before this

881
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:09,039
was in Israel which is the epicenter of

882
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,920
medical cannabinoid and my my husband

883
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:14,358
calls me the Godmother of pain

884
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,639
management because I did it before and

885
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:20,078
uh I met the Godfather of medical

886
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:24,799
cannabinoid my question is this how

887
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:29,000
could I treat my patients if there is

888
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,599
no um St standardized medication of

889
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,960
medical cannabinoid that I could use for

890
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:37,318
my patients and how could I study and I

891
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,480
plan to study all my patients because I

892
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:44,440
have a both an academic and private

893
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,440
practice um uh experience are they

894
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,280
standardized tests to C to know how

895
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,358
they're doing and I'm talking about when

896
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,119
you're in the clinic you have to give a

897
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:57,400
test that's practical that's paper and

898
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:59,400
pencil and can be put in a data the base

899
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:01,920
because I'd like to be able to say after

900
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,160
one year I treated 100 dementia patients

901
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,880
and 80% had better

902
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:09,039
cognition uh but I want to know what

903
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,760
kind am I going to use and where am I

904
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:14,519
going to get it thank you briefly there

905
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,599
are products out there a lot of products

906
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:18,519
uh it's a question of how they're

907
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:20,318
labeled if they're labeled well and

908
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:22,480
properly but there's there are products

909
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:24,759
out there you can mention a few that we

910
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,719
think highly of and and and there are

911
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:30,079
also product lines that have different

912
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:31,480
ratios of CBD and THC and you can think

913
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:33,000
of it really in terms of what we can

914
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:35,599
play with right now there's really two

915
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,760
axes the cannabinoid axis which is

916
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,079
really CBD and THC in terms of what's

917
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,000
practically out there what we can use um

918
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,079
and there's also the turpine access one

919
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,239
is ratio specific the other strain

920
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:49,119
specific um and at project CBD when we

921
00:39:47,239 --> 00:39:50,559
we hear from a lot of doctors a lot of

922
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,440
patients and scientists we have

923
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:56,519
relations with the entire Community um

924
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:00,000
the best we can say at this point is the

925
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:01,480
goal is for a person to self-medicate

926
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,719
under the uh hopefully under the

927
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,280
guidance of a he health professional uh

928
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:10,318
starting out low

929
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:13,800
dose uh usually starting out higher THC

930
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:15,960
lower uh higher CBD lower THC and

931
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:17,800
increasing that ratio to the point where

932
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:20,039
it becomes balanced moving it in a

933
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,079
direction of balance so that a person uh

934
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:25,079
can use as much a can a cannabis remedy

935
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:26,640
with as much THC as they're comfortable

936
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:28,119
with and they shouldn't go beyond on

937
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,759
that and it doesn't have to be high

938
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:32,720
doses so it's not about figuring out the

939
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,640
perfect ratio for every condition but

940
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:36,559
what's right and comfortable for a

941
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:38,920
person and you don't necessarily know

942
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,599
what the right ratio is in terms of what

943
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,720
you're comfortable with in terms of the

944
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:44,838
psychoactivity or the Stony effect

945
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:46,399
unless you go beyond that and when

946
00:40:44,838 --> 00:40:48,279
people go beyond that sometimes they

947
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,039
find in fact they actually like that for

948
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,599
for new new people in the scene they

949
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:54,199
they like getting a little high they

950
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,680
prefer that and that's also

951
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:59,000
therapeutic you touch on a lot of really

952
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:01,519
important questions uh it's one of the

953
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,639
reasons why we started up uh forming the

954
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:06,960
North American communitybased and

955
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:09,679
patient centered clinical cannabis

956
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,720
research and evaluation Network some

957
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:14,879
seven eight years ago and we've been

958
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:16,759
meeting regularly uh with all the

959
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,519
shareholders from every

960
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,680
level of the like you know putting the

961
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:24,559
the seeds in the ground the geneticist

962
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:26,879
all the way up to the scientists and and

963
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:29,759
people like myself who are

964
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,680
basically uh into Innovative research

965
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,839
methodology that gets around these

966
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:37,000
issues and we've come up with a whole

967
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:38,759
bunch of Baseline surveys um that have

968
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,519
been attributed from different groups

969
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,520
and things that have you know really

970
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:46,599
validated these surveys and then once

971
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:48,559
you get into particular um illness or

972
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:51,680
what I like to say set of cardinal

973
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:54,358
symptoms because it's very hard to do

974
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,559
illness change but if you can if you can

975
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:58,960
break that down to the Cardinal system

976
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:01,960
symptoms that the patient is suffering

977
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,838
and and and most stress them uh there's

978
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:08,318
always very simple uh measures of five

979
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:10,519
or six items at most that you can use

980
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:13,239
for that Sue knows that this there a

981
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:15,920
great um uh

982
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:18,479
PTSD index but you can also break it

983
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:22,760
down to looking at the actual symptoms

984
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:26,639
because some symptoms may very likely

985
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:28,520
respond to different canabo and that's

986
00:42:26,639 --> 00:42:31,480
the ultimate question that we have to

987
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:33,079
ask you one other really quick comment

988
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:34,920
because symptoms I want to also always

989
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:38,400
play The Devil's atet and it's always

990
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:40,480
both are true uh uh Michael back has

991
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,480
referred to Cogen and medicinal genomics

992
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,599
earlier in the previous panel they're

993
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:46,119
doing Gene sequencing of uh cannabis

994
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:48,200
strains they were also involved in the

995
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:50,079
human genome product the problem with

996
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:51,799
just focusing on symptoms when you're

997
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,240
dealing with something like seizures for

998
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:57,160
example little kids with terrible

999
00:42:54,239 --> 00:43:00,039
epilepsy um there are so many different

1000
00:42:57,159 --> 00:43:01,920
uh factors that can play into seizure

1001
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:03,719
disorder there could be hundreds of

1002
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:06,838
different mechanisms in the brain that

1003
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:08,719
are wrong you know hundreds possible to

1004
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:10,480
choose from and what medicinal genomics

1005
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:13,078
done what I feel Is So Exciting in terms

1006
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:17,599
of the future of cannabis research is

1007
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:20,000
that they are matching uh uh a condition

1008
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,838
where where they will Gene sequence the

1009
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,760
uh tissue from from the patient and they

1010
00:43:22,838 --> 00:43:28,279
will locate uh the broken molecular

1011
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,680
Channel let's say for the the EP

1012
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:33,519
epilepsy D syndrome they're finding a

1013
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:35,440
common theme Here is a problem with the

1014
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:38,559
Sodium Channel they call it a broken

1015
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:41,519
sodium Channel um and that happens to be

1016
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:43,519
something that responds very well to CBD

1017
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:46,759
but there are other severe cases of

1018
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:48,800
epilepsy that that symptom that are a

1019
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,400
result of a broken sodium channel that

1020
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,559
don't respond well to CBD that respond

1021
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,960
hardly at all or sometimes CBD can make

1022
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:58,800
it worse even violently worse so so uh

1023
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,639
it's very exciting that you have this

1024
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:04,880
kind of Technology emerging that you can

1025
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:06,838
match uh uh Gene sequencing data from a

1026
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,318
plant to a person and I think that

1027
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:10,679
there's a lot there and it's a uh for

1028
00:44:09,318 --> 00:44:13,119
the future and I think it's something

1029
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:15,000
that the FDA can hardly keep up with

1030
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,079
this is something beyond what the FDA is

1031
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,599
really capable of regulating and and I

1032
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:22,000
think it's a whole new universe opening

1033
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:24,920
up my question is for Martin uh it was

1034
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,000
about something that you said actually

1035
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,760
two things that I wasn't quite sure how

1036
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,960
to reconcile and I was wondering if you

1037
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:34,960
could flesh it out you made a statement

1038
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:37,358
that there is a role for isolates but uh

1039
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,039
before that you said something about CBD

1040
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:41,838
and when you referring to CBD you were

1041
00:44:40,039 --> 00:44:44,440
making it sound like you did not

1042
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:46,558
encourage the use of that as an isolate

1043
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,280
so could you flush that out a little bit

1044
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,920
please real real quickly you know

1045
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,519
there's been some limited research and

1046
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,440
one thing about research you know has to

1047
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:55,000
be done a lot over and over again until

1048
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,559
you really have a consensus you know

1049
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,480
just one or two studies doesn't really

1050
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:01,599
prove anything but in terms of there's

1051
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:05,079
been comparisons of CBD as an isolate to

1052
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,599
a whole plant a CBD Rich oil extract and

1053
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:09,720
what they found basically this is done

1054
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:12,200
in Israel that you can get a therapeutic

1055
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:14,919
effect from CBD as an isolate if very

1056
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:17,239
high doses are used and very precise

1057
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,760
doses they can get the readings they're

1058
00:45:17,239 --> 00:45:21,318
looking for for certain markers of

1059
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,280
inflammation and so forth uh and if you

1060
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:26,318
don't get the exact or very the problem

1061
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,680
is it's a very narrow therapeutic window

1062
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:29,400
if you're a little too low or a little

1063
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,759
too high it doesn't do anything where

1064
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:33,240
with the CBD Rich oil extract you give a

1065
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,240
little it has a little effect you give

1066
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:37,078
more it has more of effect so it's not

1067
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:38,479
like the isolate can't do anything in

1068
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:42,000
fact we're seeing from the studies now

1069
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:44,880
with GW Pharmaceuticals with epids for

1070
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,838
the D syndrome for the it's almost pure

1071
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,680
CBD and they they are having positive

1072
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:52,599
results uh but that's all well and good

1073
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:55,679
we should recognize there's a reality

1074
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:57,519
there but you know big farmer didn't

1075
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:00,399
come to the aid of little Charlotte you

1076
00:45:57,519 --> 00:46:02,519
know it that came from marijuana growers

1077
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,240
and and we have a lot of research and a

1078
00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:06,960
lot of information we're developing on

1079
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:09,199
the ground uh that's also very important

1080
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,639
the the point is not to reject what GW

1081
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:14,719
is doing with epids it has its place I

1082
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:16,838
think it's a very small place and and we

1083
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:18,558
have much more potential using the

1084
00:46:16,838 --> 00:46:21,799
complex

1085
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:25,880
plan I always want to add to that that

1086
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:29,039
um a eons of research have shown that a

1087
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:32,400
you cannot grow a cannabis plant that

1088
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:34,279
does not have THC many people like to

1089
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:38,880
talk about oh we're going have this

1090
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:41,519
great law that only allows C pure CBD

1091
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:45,599
you know that that's a fallacy first of

1092
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:48,599
all you need a little bit of th there to

1093
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:52,079
get the best effect uh um and who knows

1094
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:55,318
what other compounds there and CBD is

1095
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,318
despite the the uh you know the general

1096
00:46:55,318 --> 00:46:59,440
wisdom

1097
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:04,039
is probably not the

1098
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:07,039
specific real life um uh type two

1099
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:10,000
receptor Agonist it's probably one of

1100
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:13,599
its uh metabolites or a mixture of

1101
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,838
compounds including what THC does at the

1102
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:19,200
CB1 receptors so we have to think about

1103
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:22,880
this you know the way Neuroscience has

1104
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:27,519
been moving the brain is not a sponge

1105
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:29,519
living in a in in a in aition dish tub

1106
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:31,358
and then just absorbing these chemicals

1107
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:34,400
and everything to think of what's going

1108
00:47:31,358 --> 00:47:38,480
on at the synapses and at the system

1109
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:41,240
level and you see that it is complex and

1110
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:44,119
involves a bunch of molecules doing

1111
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:46,279
different things at different places um

1112
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:48,760
in the brain and we shouldn't forget

1113
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:51,079
that there's so much basic science

1114
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:54,599
throughout neurochemistry and including

1115
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:57,079
in canabo medicine uh to tell us not to

1116
00:47:54,599 --> 00:48:00,000
think this way

1117
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:01,440
hi so um one of our patients called us

1118
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,440
and said that one of our products

1119
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,358
completely made him be able to stop

1120
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,800
taking insulin for his diabetes and uh

1121
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:11,679
Stanford University Hospital in Paulo

1122
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,160
Alto wants to do a study on it and I was

1123
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:15,440
just wondering what do you do with that

1124
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:17,558
type of data once uh the study has been

1125
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,240
completed I know you can do like get it

1126
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:20,920
published in a scientific journal but

1127
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:23,479
and then what do you do after that like

1128
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:26,159
where can we take that to yeah the best

1129
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,760
place uh for any scientific data

1130
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:30,639
uh that's meaningful is in a

1131
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,559
peer-reviewed scientific journal I mean

1132
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:35,960
PubMed is the world's largest medical

1133
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,480
database and frankly uh the attitudes

1134
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:39,199
out here on the West Coast are a lot

1135
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,960
more Progressive than the attitudes out

1136
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:44,519
on the east coast in the I95 research

1137
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,480
Corridor and until those Physicians out

1138
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:49,880
there and the doctors out there that are

1139
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:54,639
making a lot of the policy decisions uh

1140
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:56,160
see uh a systematic and probably rather

1141
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:58,920
lengthy

1142
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:00,440
uh string of good peer-reviewed science

1143
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,119
we're probably going to be sitting here

1144
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,119
right at the same scheduling point we're

1145
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:07,720
at right now would be my guess so peer

1146
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:10,280
reviewed research is going to be the key

1147
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:12,759
to moving this uh this industry forward

1148
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,760
in a lot of

1149
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:18,039
ways but it's not to the end all because

1150
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:20,159
if that just gets into the journals it

1151
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:22,798
doesn't do anything to change clinical

1152
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:25,039
practice we have to change the attitude

1153
00:49:22,798 --> 00:49:26,880
of the scientists and particularly the

1154
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:29,798
doctors and other primary healthc care

1155
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,920
givers that this is not a

1156
00:49:29,798 --> 00:49:34,519
dangerous uh drug and that if they if

1157
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:37,119
they prescribe it they're not going to

1158
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:39,759
get their their license taken away a lot

1159
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:42,280
of what we do at aacm is put out

1160
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,720
practice standards so that people have a

1161
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:47,519
way to defend themselves when they've

1162
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:50,399
written that 50th recommendation and the

1163
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,358
DEA comes down on them and seizes all

1164
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,798
their records and and stops their

1165
00:49:52,358 --> 00:49:56,519
practice okay next question from the

1166
00:49:54,798 --> 00:49:59,440
audience yes good afternoon um I just

1167
00:49:56,519 --> 00:50:02,239
wanted to segue also from the uh limited

1168
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:04,679
CBD question that was just asked to ago

1169
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:06,798
um specifically in terms of industrial

1170
00:50:04,679 --> 00:50:09,598
hemp and cannabis I hope it's not sacr

1171
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:10,679
sang to include that in the conversation

1172
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,160
considering there hasn't been a whole

1173
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:14,399
lot of research done across the board

1174
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:16,519
but we see so much of this Industrial

1175
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,798
Hemp coming from I I think southern

1176
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:21,960
France is the largest European China and

1177
00:50:19,798 --> 00:50:25,880
it's you know it's invading our

1178
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:28,199
Marketplace looking like uh Medical but

1179
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,559
is I I would like to know your opinion

1180
00:50:28,199 --> 00:50:32,838
what you think about it okay Industrial

1181
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:35,760
Hemp uh hemp is fantastic you know we

1182
00:50:32,838 --> 00:50:37,239
know 20,000 products and and one of I

1183
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,720
think one very important aspect

1184
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:43,159
incidentally we're not even touching on

1185
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:44,879
uh in terms of the new research era is

1186
00:50:43,159 --> 00:50:46,358
Research into the plant forget about all

1187
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,200
this clinical stuff there we're going to

1188
00:50:46,358 --> 00:50:50,318
have more opportunities to actually

1189
00:50:48,199 --> 00:50:52,318
research this plant and as you would any

1190
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:54,639
other plant so I think this is a whole

1191
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:56,159
vast area that we're we're moving into

1192
00:50:54,639 --> 00:50:58,199
that we're not touching touching upon it

1193
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:00,279
would be nice for previous panel to

1194
00:50:58,199 --> 00:51:01,679
address that more but and and there will

1195
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,480
be a lot of research in terms of

1196
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:06,480
industrial hemp and I know there's a lot

1197
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:09,480
going on now with respect to CBD to

1198
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:12,039
create a plant that's very rich in CBD

1199
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:15,240
let's say 20% like what we have here in

1200
00:51:12,039 --> 00:51:19,039
California with the ACDC in the non hemp

1201
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:21,519
varieties because it's above 3% THC but

1202
00:51:19,039 --> 00:51:24,400
to create a plant that you know falls

1203
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:28,000
under that marker for THC um but still

1204
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:30,519
is very robust and rich in CBD uh that's

1205
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,798
where a lot of and I think they're far

1206
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:35,199
ahead in that effort in Europe but

1207
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:38,000
that's an example of how a politicized a

1208
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:40,239
needlessly politicized agenda kind of

1209
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,960
truncates and misshapes research I mean

1210
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:45,719
who cares if the plant has 3% THC or 7%

1211
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,039
or

1212
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:49,399
1% um in terms of what it actually is

1213
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:51,239
going to do for a person if you're

1214
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,760
talking about a drug or a therapy it

1215
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:56,519
really makes no difference 3% or 0.5%

1216
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:58,760
because we got the political situation

1217
00:51:56,519 --> 00:52:01,000
it gets all skewed you know it's a real

1218
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:03,960
long answer that's required in terms of

1219
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,880
industrial hemp uh because it's a matter

1220
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:07,559
a lot of it it's a matter of definition

1221
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:11,200
as we see it again we don't look at the

1222
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:15,280
legal definition of 3% THC industrial

1223
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:17,558
Hamp is low resin cannabis marijuana is

1224
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,839
high resin cannabis if you're going to

1225
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:22,160
extract from a plant to make a drug you

1226
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:24,279
need the high resin cannabis not the low

1227
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:26,239
resin cannabis in terms of low resin

1228
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,839
cannabis to keep the answer as short as

1229
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:30,039
possible there's really two kinds

1230
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:33,159
there's the fiber hemp that's useless

1231
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:35,199
for CBD and then there's the seed oil

1232
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:37,639
that you can make nutritional products

1233
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:40,279
varnish paint from a very useful

1234
00:52:37,639 --> 00:52:43,318
industrial product um those plants you

1235
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:45,519
can get about 3% THC from the foliage as

1236
00:52:43,318 --> 00:52:48,159
compared to like our ACDC or some of the

1237
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:51,679
other strains we have in California 20%

1238
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:54,798
you can get a decent servical product

1239
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:57,519
from that type of seed oil Foliage for

1240
00:52:54,798 --> 00:52:59,358
CB D but it means you grow have to grow

1241
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:01,639
you know tons of it to get a little

1242
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:03,558
amount of oil uh compared to what we

1243
00:53:01,639 --> 00:53:05,440
have here but from an economic

1244
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:08,798
perspective if you're in Europe there's

1245
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,358
no plant limits here 100 plants right

1246
00:53:08,798 --> 00:53:13,318
realistically you can't grow more than

1247
00:53:10,358 --> 00:53:15,759
99 so it's not econ you can't compete

1248
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:18,558
economically with that source of CBD but

1249
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,359
it's not as good quality but some you

1250
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:23,760
can make products that help people and

1251
00:53:20,358 --> 00:53:25,440
if that's the case great I'm a physician

1252
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,920
I've been working almost 2 years at a

1253
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,880
medical marijuana clinic here in

1254
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:32,720
Southern California and uh I want to

1255
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:36,240
Echo your comment about uh physician

1256
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:38,719
education in general uh being needed uh

1257
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:41,000
I've seen hundreds of patients uh over

1258
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:43,919
my almost two years working there and I

1259
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,599
would say that at least 50% of the

1260
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,200
patients I see the primary indication

1261
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:51,000
they're coming in for medical marijuana

1262
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:53,919
is for chronic pain uh and the vast

1263
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,639
majority of those also give me the

1264
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:59,358
comment I want to get off the opiates or

1265
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:02,159
I don't want to get on the opiates and

1266
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:06,159
here we have a government campaign

1267
00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:08,399
saying opiates are bad we have to stop I

1268
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:11,279
get emails every day as a

1269
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,599
physician with programs about helping

1270
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:17,440
Physicians to get patients off of

1271
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:19,920
opiates uh the DEA will not

1272
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,960
deschedule right now they say they're

1273
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,280
not worried about EIC uh safety they're

1274
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:25,639
worried about efficacy it's I'm sure

1275
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:27,440
it's not the first time the government's

1276
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:30,159
been speaking out of both sides of their

1277
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:33,039
mouth but it seems to me there must be a

1278
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:36,358
way that we can leverage the

1279
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:41,239
government's wish to get people off of

1280
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:45,119
opiates with the knowledge that at least

1281
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:48,318
anecdotally that uh medical marijuana

1282
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:52,318
will go a long way to help this uh this

1283
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:55,838
uh occur we have to do the studies to

1284
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:58,199
prove that this is better

1285
00:54:55,838 --> 00:55:00,279
and less addictive and is an answer to

1286
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:02,759
this every time there's an article that

1287
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:05,680
appears that that talks about how to

1288
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:08,359
keep your pain patients from getting

1289
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:10,358
addicted to opiates I always write in a

1290
00:55:08,358 --> 00:55:13,838
letter to the editor why didn't you

1291
00:55:10,358 --> 00:55:16,798
mention uh canono why because the

1292
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:21,000
article was written and paid for by a

1293
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:23,719
drug company that produces high does uh

1294
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,639
ones and they're leveraging their money

1295
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:29,279
by funding all the anti you know

1296
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:31,838
legalization campaigns because they see

1297
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:35,680
this is a threat to their business so

1298
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:38,719
vote at the voting booth find people who

1299
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:41,960
are not bought and known hand inand and

1300
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:45,000
work with your own medical groups and

1301
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:48,199
societies and so forth to get them to

1302
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:52,119
adopt these uh uh you know resolutions

1303
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:54,118
in this in favor of using a medical can

1304
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:57,200
cannabis it's it's a hard thing because

1305
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:59,240
so many doctors get so much money from

1306
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:01,598
the pharmaceutical companies but there

1307
00:55:59,239 --> 00:56:04,318
are others who who don't or you can

1308
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:06,559
prove their conflict of interest very

1309
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:08,358
easily follow the money is one of the

1310
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:11,760
best things I always

1311
00:56:08,358 --> 00:56:14,199
say I would just say uh Physicians are

1312
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:17,599
required to take continuing medical

1313
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:20,318
education correct uh wouldn't it be nice

1314
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:23,920
if cannabis was included in that that

1315
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:25,639
would be wonderful I mean addtive yeah

1316
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,400
exactly educ

1317
00:56:25,639 --> 00:56:30,838
not propaganda this is an area in term

1318
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,760
this a tremendous organizing opportunity

1319
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:34,318
uh to to this is a way to put pressure

1320
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:36,559
on local government city government

1321
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:39,759
state government I know in Maine um

1322
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:42,480
there was a ADV an advac effort as a

1323
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,720
result of Dr DUS slot's work there who's

1324
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,719
been one of the leading physicians in

1325
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:49,959
this whole field about um getting the

1326
00:56:47,719 --> 00:56:51,719
state of Maine to recognize as part of

1327
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:54,000
its medical marijuana program that

1328
00:56:51,719 --> 00:56:56,598
cannabis is a therapy for opioid

1329
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,760
addiction and didn't didn't get passed

1330
00:56:56,599 --> 00:57:00,280
because they got a weird government

1331
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:03,079
there kind of a tea party government but

1332
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:05,519
uh this is really a ripe area for

1333
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:08,880
organizing and for political pressure

1334
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:11,960
there's uh in every state now they have

1335
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:14,480
a heroin task force you know opioid

1336
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:17,039
epidemic task force um you know the

1337
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:19,880
medical community needs to infiltrate

1338
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:22,440
all of these um you know government

1339
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:24,079
bodies and try to encourage them because

1340
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:27,440
if you look at all these task force

1341
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:30,359
reports none of them talk about opioid

1342
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:32,358
as a potential substitution therapy I'm

1343
00:57:30,358 --> 00:57:35,519
Excuse cannabis as substitution therapy

1344
00:57:32,358 --> 00:57:37,679
for opioids none of them even in legal

1345
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:40,880
medical cannabis States they fail to

1346
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:42,759
address cannabis as a solution so we

1347
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:46,000
have a duty as people who are

1348
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:48,520
knowledgeable to get on these committees

1349
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,559
and demand that that get attention on

1350
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:52,280
these task force reports I mean I think

1351
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:54,160
we all probably realize that task force

1352
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:56,680
reports are generally worthless and they

1353
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:59,558
sit on somebody's desk and never get

1354
00:57:56,679 --> 00:58:01,960
read but it is valuable to have that

1355
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:03,640
documented in these various States and I

1356
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:06,599
did want to bring up I know yesterday

1357
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:08,440
somebody was talking about the the insys

1358
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:10,760
um you know the pharmaceutical company

1359
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,920
that dropped a half million dollars in

1360
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:16,240
Arizona to to fight against the the

1361
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,760
legalization effort I just want to point

1362
00:58:16,239 --> 00:58:21,558
out there's a quote from their SEC

1363
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:24,920
filing so insus is the pharmaceutical

1364
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:26,920
company that manufactures fentanyl um

1365
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:29,720
and they also manufacture ironically

1366
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:32,240
dronabinol which is the synthetic THC

1367
00:58:29,719 --> 00:58:35,318
product but um this was a quote from

1368
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:37,358
their SC filing legalization of cannabis

1369
00:58:35,318 --> 00:58:39,920
or non-synthetic cannabinoids in the US

1370
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:42,279
could significantly limit the Comm

1371
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:45,200
commercial success of our dronabinol

1372
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:47,359
product if marijuana or non-synthetic

1373
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:49,919
canabo were legalized in the US the

1374
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:52,239
market for ganabol product sales would

1375
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:55,000
likely be significantly reduced and our

1376
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:58,598
ability to generate revenue and our our

1377
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:01,159
business prospects would be materially

1378
00:58:58,599 --> 00:59:03,920
adversely affected so this is what we're

1379
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:06,440
up against in all of these uh yeah and

1380
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,798
all of these states um these guys are

1381
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:11,679
the ones getting on these heroin task

1382
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:13,639
forces talking about you know defending

1383
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:15,199
their position in the market so we have

1384
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:17,118
to do the same thing we have to meet

1385
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:21,159
them where they're at and fight this at

1386
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:23,838
every turn every single specialty and

1387
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:25,519
general medicine has a local and

1388
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:28,558
Statewide

1389
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:30,480
Association and they hold Grand rounds

1390
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:33,920
and I have found that that's the best

1391
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:36,519
place to confront these ridiculous

1392
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:39,318
beliefs and attitudes uh about it I

1393
00:59:36,519 --> 00:59:41,480
spoke to gynecologists and they said

1394
00:59:39,318 --> 00:59:43,719
well you can't use uh cannabis and

1395
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,880
pregnant women and I said where did you

1396
00:59:43,719 --> 00:59:48,078
get that oh it's all over the place it's

1397
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:51,160
it's even in our Board Test well it

1398
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:53,720
turns out that's total lie every single

1399
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:56,960
study that is shown uh like Millie

1400
00:59:53,719 --> 00:59:59,159
Dryer's study of rosarians and those

1401
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:02,240
women who did smoke constantly and those

1402
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:05,078
didn't the kids were the same and

1403
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:07,679
develop the same and I said and you know

1404
01:00:05,079 --> 01:00:10,318
we have a great opportunity is in

1405
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:11,960
childbirth cuz a lot of women don't want

1406
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:15,239
to take the opius they want to be a

1407
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:19,480
participant in the process well give

1408
01:00:15,239 --> 01:00:23,479
them a canabo or a very canono along

1409
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:25,480
with very low dose um opioid and they

1410
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:27,960
can participate and not feel like they

1411
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:32,318
were drugged out during that very

1412
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:34,519
important uh event my question is does

1413
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:36,880
is everyone familiar with talk to the

1414
01:00:34,519 --> 01:00:41,280
hand campaign referring to government

1415
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:44,559
patent 6630507 it seems that if everyone

1416
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:47,798
knew about 6630507 that the government

1417
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:50,920
said that it is medicinal and non-toxic

1418
01:00:47,798 --> 01:00:52,119
that it could be a basis for um

1419
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:54,599
different

1420
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:57,318
conversation if everyone was educated

1421
01:00:54,599 --> 01:00:57,318
ated about that

1422
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,639
patent one thing about that patent it's

1423
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:06,400
it's been misconstrued by the industry I

1424
01:01:03,639 --> 01:01:09,318
think purposely as this legalizing CBD

1425
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:11,358
or or patent for CBD not legalizing and

1426
01:01:09,318 --> 01:01:14,960
that's incorrect it was a based on

1427
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:17,598
Research uh into CBD THC and other

1428
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:19,838
cannaboids it's not just about CBD it

1429
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:21,960
was saying a patent for cannabinoids

1430
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:24,000
they're neuroprotective and antioxidant

1431
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:26,079
properties which could have potentially

1432
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,559
great benefit fits for neurological Ines

1433
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:30,359
stroke Alzheimer's and so forth and yes

1434
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,920
it it it underscores the glaring

1435
01:01:30,358 --> 01:01:33,639
contradiction but the way they get

1436
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:35,358
around that contradiction is through

1437
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:36,400
sophistry or they're not talking about

1438
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,639
cannabis they're talking about

1439
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:41,119
individual components of the plant

1440
01:01:38,639 --> 01:01:43,400
marijuana no medical value but THC it's

1441
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,160
already recognized as a medicine CBD is

1442
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:47,599
going to be recognized as single

1443
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:49,719
molecule very soon so it's a game that's

1444
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:51,640
played verbally that's what's going on

1445
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:55,399
do

1446
01:01:51,639 --> 01:01:56,960
effect uh how are they going to cover

1447
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,960
well it's not so much a cover up but

1448
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,760
they just uh we'll see it's on its way

1449
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,278
to approval we hope it should be a

1450
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,799
medicine in there but you can already

1451
01:02:02,278 --> 01:02:08,358
get something exactly like cannabis uh

1452
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:10,960
satx which is a one:1 CBD to THC

1453
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:12,880
sublingual spray in most dispenseries in

1454
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,760
this town you can probably get something

1455
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,798
almost exactly the same except a little

1456
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,480
better because it's not alcohol based it

1457
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:22,119
will be coconut oil based but it's

1458
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:26,039
produced from yes so is

1459
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:27,440
Saturday so

1460
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:30,760
thank you to all of our panelists I just

1461
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:32,960
want to make a a few closing uh remarks

1462
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:35,839
little bit of a perspective from the the

1463
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,519
state legislature and a lot of comments

1464
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:39,119
about the the important role that

1465
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:41,159
government can play hasn't been playing

1466
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:43,519
but could play if it if it were more

1467
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:46,118
supportive of of uh medical cannabis and

1468
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:49,639
research I think right now we're in a a

1469
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:52,760
time of massive uh transformation and

1470
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:54,519
change it's Dynamic um you know we had

1471
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:58,359
the medical cannabis regulation and

1472
01:02:54,519 --> 01:03:00,880
safety act passed a year ago prop 64 is

1473
01:02:58,358 --> 01:03:02,639
Almost sure to pass in my view um the

1474
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:06,599
California medical association did

1475
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:09,078
endorse and support the prop 64 and I've

1476
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:10,798
seen the attitudes and beliefs that have

1477
01:03:09,079 --> 01:03:12,720
been discussed up here changing in the

1478
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:15,440
legislature in the short time that I've

1479
01:03:12,719 --> 01:03:17,679
been there there were folks who you know

1480
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:20,200
fully adopted the the stigmatized view

1481
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:22,278
of of medical cannabis but changed

1482
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:24,879
during the the process uh when we were

1483
01:03:22,278 --> 01:03:26,358
carrying the legislation so I think that

1484
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,559
California can continue to have a

1485
01:03:26,358 --> 01:03:31,598
leadership role in in changing those

1486
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:33,000
beliefs those ideas uh those attitudes

1487
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,119
and I think there's going to be more

1488
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,039
embracing of it we had a bill this year

1489
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:38,760
that would have provided for research

1490
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:41,559
and development opportunities in the

1491
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:43,960
state of California it got stuck because

1492
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:46,400
the governor's office wasn't prepared uh

1493
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:48,559
to to support that given that they

1494
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,480
thought prop 64 was likely going to

1495
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:52,720
going to pass and they wanted to make

1496
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:55,400
sure that things were all all harmonized

1497
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:58,199
but you know when in my view when prop

1498
01:03:55,400 --> 01:04:01,119
64 passes there will be an opportunity

1499
01:03:58,199 --> 01:04:04,399
to revisit that and um there'll be a lot

1500
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:07,278
of other work to do too to to harmonize

1501
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:09,599
uh and synchronize uh the mcrsa with

1502
01:04:07,278 --> 01:04:11,079
prop 64 but um there's folks who are

1503
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:14,278
very interested in this we see the

1504
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:16,920
medical benefits we see that medical

1505
01:04:14,278 --> 01:04:19,480
cannabis can be an alternative to

1506
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:21,680
addictive opioids um and and all the

1507
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,000
other positive benefits of it so I think

1508
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:24,759
those attitudes are changing I think

1509
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,719
you'll see more from the state legis so

1510
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:28,319
just a a little bit of a of a window

1511
01:04:26,719 --> 01:04:29,480
into the mind of the collective

1512
01:04:28,318 --> 01:04:30,969
legislature but let's have one more

1513
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:35,250
round of applause for our amazing

1514
01:04:30,969 --> 01:04:40,000
[Applause]

1515
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:43,000
