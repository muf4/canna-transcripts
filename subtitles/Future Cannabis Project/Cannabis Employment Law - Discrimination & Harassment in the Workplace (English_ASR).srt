2
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:28,278
best practice is having personnel files

3
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:30,169
disciplinary files handbooks policies

4
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:33,530
procedures those sort of things in place

5
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:35,359
so that when an environment which right

6
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,590
now is very collegial and everybody sort

7
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,170
of knows each other and is growing

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,670
together goes through some sort of a

9
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,620
cyclical nature and people need to be

10
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,480
let go or someone has a performance

11
00:00:42,619 --> 00:00:47,628
issue and they claim discrimination and

12
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,279
or or something along those lines the

13
00:00:47,628 --> 00:00:50,808
company has something to go back to to

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,730
say well these were our policies and

15
00:00:50,808 --> 00:00:54,948
procedures for example here's the

16
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:57,709
discipline we gave you these are the

17
00:00:54,948 --> 00:01:00,108
warnings we gave you here's our open

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,789
door policy for example if you really

19
00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:05,030
had all these concerns which are now

20
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:08,060
voicing and you didn't voice way back

21
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,239
when why not those sort of things so

22
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,980
that's that's been a big issue

23
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:15,469
compliance front on the discrimination

24
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:19,070
and harassment front I think a lot of

25
00:01:15,469 --> 00:01:23,090
what we've seen is a nascent industry

26
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:25,639
sort of growing up very quickly and in

27
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:28,159
the early days of the industry you would

28
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,079
have everybody sort of being friends

29
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,969
they everybody sort of knows each other

30
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,039
or they're referred in from somebody

31
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:36,849
they know it's a very comfortable

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,010
situation because not a lot of

33
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:41,689
boundaries or rules or policies or

34
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,689
procedures in place to sort of lay some

35
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:48,109
of the expectations out there and things

36
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:49,789
were pretty loose that's a bad

37
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:52,700
environment to be in from an employer

38
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,210
standpoint because people will right or

39
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,040
wrong

40
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:56,539
get the understand that they can get

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,490
away with certain things that certain

42
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,130
behavior might be okay and this industry

43
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:02,959
whereas if you went to work for a law

44
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:03,798
firm and you wore a suit and tie just by

45
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:05,538
operation

46
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,859
you're addressed in the environment

47
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:09,110
really you might think oh well this

48
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:11,030
doesn't really fly the cannabis industry

49
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,640
is no different than any other other

50
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:16,969
industry you you are employers these are

51
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:18,529
your employees you have to take steps to

52
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:20,449
create a professional environment so

53
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,669
that individuals understand we don't

54
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:25,219
want you doing certain things and if

55
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:26,839
you're an employee that is subjected to

56
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:28,280
some behavior that they don't like we

57
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,739
want you to tell us about it so that we

58
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,060
can take steps and we have policies and

59
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:33,530
procedures out there that tell anybody

60
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,469
in the universe if you tell us about

61
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,419
stuff we will do something about that's

62
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:41,689
the sort of environment that you want to

63
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:43,129
create in a business to put yourself at

64
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:45,289
least in a good starting spot if

65
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:47,359
something that happens people are going

66
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:49,879
to do stupid things it's just human

67
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,680
nature but from a company standpoint if

68
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,289
you can show that you have a policy you

69
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,590
have a procedure you have an open door

70
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:59,479
and over time you've got a track record

71
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,150
for doing stuff when people complain

72
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:04,449
that pushing that that seemed possible

73
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,459
if somebody does something stupid and

74
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:11,238
another employee harasses another

75
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:13,579
employee my analogy or my example of

76
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:17,299
what like would be appropriate somewhere

77
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:19,909
is like in the NBA on the basketball

78
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:21,170
team they Pat each others butts yeah

79
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:23,209
what would happen if you were walking

80
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:25,068
back to the hall and one of your

81
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,599
colleagues like pat you on the button

82
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:29,089
man like you rocked it in court

83
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,539
yesterday yeah you'd be like that was

84
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,209
weird

85
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:34,009
yeah they're theirs without going too

86
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:36,049
deep into the definition of sexual

87
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:38,269
harassment there is a context to some of

88
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,519
these things and and there's some famous

89
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:42,129
cases out there one involving a bunch of

90
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,870
writers for the show friends whether

91
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:46,789
developing topics for the show and the

92
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,549
nature of the business is talking about

93
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:51,530
relationships and sex and who's sleeping

94
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:53,389
with who or which relationship in that

95
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:56,239
context there's going to be a discussion

96
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:57,889
about sex but if you're a you know line

97
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,419
worker at McDonald's and you're making

98
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:02,109
hamburgers there's no reason for you to

99
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:04,510
be discussing sex with your coworkers

100
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:06,919
similarly in this in the cannabis space

101
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:08,870
there's a conversation probably that

102
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,340
would take place about legalization of

103
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:11,739
drugs

104
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,469
or legalization of cannabis or that's

105
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:16,750
what the stuff but outside of that

106
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:20,290
there's really no you know why would you

107
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:22,300
be discussing sex for example or race or

108
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,069
maybe the the topic would be social

109
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,960
equity and there's a discussion about

110
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:28,719
social equity what that means in that

111
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:30,279
context okay but to discuss somebody

112
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,560
else's race and oh I heard you're a

113
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:36,189
particular race and does that mean that

114
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,689
you are blind there we're outside the

115
00:04:36,189 --> 00:04:39,399
bounds of what the context of that

116
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:42,040
discussion should be given the industry

117
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:44,199
so yeah it just needs to become more

118
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,879
professional I think is the overarching

119
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:47,680
theme that we're trying to tell people

120
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:51,639
and what we're sort of encountering is

121
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,459
the very loose very relaxed environment

122
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,840
some of which business owners are

123
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:58,750
telling us well this is what I want and

124
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,399
we're telling them look no good deed

125
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:02,560
goes unpunished if you have this very

126
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,079
lacks environment that's okay people are

127
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,339
jeans and t-shirts to work but you also

128
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:08,379
need to have a conversation with your

129
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:10,149
employees about what sort of behavior is

130
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:12,639
appropriate and what's expected of them

131
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:14,379
so that they don't mistake the fact that

132
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,689
you can wear shorts and a t-shirt to

133
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:18,009
work to mean you can wear certain

134
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:20,439
outfits to work that are going to be

135
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:21,939
inappropriate or because a female

136
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,529
employees wearing a particular outfit

137
00:05:21,939 --> 00:05:26,889
and mail-away can start commenting on

138
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:29,829
her body it's just they don't so some of

139
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:32,949
the things that if you were to grow up

140
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:37,000
as a business you what like employee

141
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:39,339
handbooks and training programs and can

142
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,470
you just give me some examples of like

143
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:44,888
some easy low-hanging fruit that a

144
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:48,400
business that has no procedures or

145
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:51,610
protocols or best practices could yep

146
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,409
started on in terms of blocking and

147
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,150
tackling some of the basics of nmv

148
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,710
there's there's sort of things that you

149
00:05:55,149 --> 00:06:00,069
have to have by law in terms of your

150
00:05:56,709 --> 00:06:01,569
payroll records if you have a commission

151
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:04,569
agreement with an employee has to be in

152
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:06,099
writing you have to keep certain you

153
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:08,168
have to provide certain notices to

154
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,090
individuals when they're hired these

155
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:11,288
sort of things just have to be there and

156
00:06:10,089 --> 00:06:12,609
you should be documenting that you're

157
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:14,469
giving these sort of things and keeping

158
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,810
those in a personnel file

159
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,130
beyond some of those mandatory things

160
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,290
the employee handbook would be the first

161
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:22,329
thing that I would probably mention and

162
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:24,100
there are different levels of

163
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:25,719
sophistication there's sort of a magic

164
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,330
number around twenty five and fifty

165
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,919
employees where different laws start to

166
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:31,479
kick in and so I would tell them if an

167
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,789
individual if you've got less than 50

168
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,770
employees you can have a pretty simple

169
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,560
handbook that sort of covers the basics

170
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:40,029
and lets you communicate your employees

171
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,970
what's expected of them provides

172
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:45,129
required notices and and get you going

173
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,139
once you get past 50 employees some

174
00:06:45,129 --> 00:06:48,939
additional statutes kitchen kick in

175
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:51,340
order you have to add some things to it

176
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:52,870
but again it's not some mountainous task

177
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:54,579
a lot of the stuff that sort of in the

178
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,750
can and a good lawyer or a good HR

179
00:06:54,579 --> 00:07:01,469
consultant couldn't give it to you

180
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:01,470
pretty quickly the other thing that is

181
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,430
somewhat required somewhat recommended

182
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:09,159
would be training so if you're in

183
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,569
California you've got employees you

184
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,520
should be training your managers on

185
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:15,339
sexual harassment there's a requirement

186
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:18,310
under the law beyond that in terms of

187
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:19,689
educating managers it's not required by

188
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,449
the law but like a handbook I would

189
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:24,038
encourage employees or employer or its

190
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:27,759
excuse me cannabis businesses to be

191
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:29,680
doing it teach them what disability and

192
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,810
lead management looks like a lot of

193
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,939
times people don't understand what an

194
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,470
individual's rights are in terms of if

195
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:36,639
they're sick or they're disabled or

196
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:39,430
they're injured on the job what they

197
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,409
should be doing that's a giant area of

198
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,629
liability right now for employers across

199
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:46,320
all industries and cannabis will be no

200
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:49,089
exception teach managers about that

201
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:51,189
hours and wage and hour issues teacher

202
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:52,779
managers about that if you have an

203
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:55,300
expectation that people are working a

204
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:57,369
particular schedule help them understand

205
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,990
that help them understand what the

206
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,360
requirements for meal periods and rest

207
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,759
breaks are educate them on the fact that

208
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,129
they can't be changing employees work

209
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,509
hours or or adjusting clocks without

210
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:10,810
legitimate reasons and some

211
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:13,839
documentation on those try to stave off

212
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:16,540
some of the stuff that will get you soon

213
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,009
if something happens again from an

214
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,139
employer standpoint you want to be able

215
00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:21,699
to say this is outside the no one this

216
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:25,540
is not what we expected whether it's

217
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:27,220
discrimination or a manager manipulating

218
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,449
somebody's timecard you want to be able

219
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,370
to show from the company standpoint

220
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:33,580
that's not the expectation that's not

221
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,110
what you want and you had some effort

222
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,240
out there to try to prevent it from

223
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:40,000
happening again people will do silly

224
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,440
things and they will make mistakes but

225
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,149
the more you can do from a company

226
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,890
standpoint to show but that's not what

227
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:47,439
was expected this is not a company-wide

228
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:49,750
practice or procedure the better you

229
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,180
will do it stay tuned off you know big

230
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:55,049
damage claims punitive damages certain

231
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:55,049
penalty provisions

232
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:07,928
