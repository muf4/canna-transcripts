63
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,680
let's let that hang out for a bit I

64
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,438
should put more water in it really but

65
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,239
go grab a couple yeah go grab a water

66
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:20,099
oh yeah all that Peter try this sure

67
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,250
now that the blowtorch isn't on in there

68
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,199
and the wand order isn't ready so this

69
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:29,490
bag is gonna save all that organic

70
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:33,210
material yeah how you're already pulling

71
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,978
it up that we're gonna take a TV timeout

72
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:39,839
- oh yeah we'll do TV timeout yeah I

73
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:46,139
like TV templates it's a go we can keep

74
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:48,599
talking it's almost like producing a

75
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,519
cooking show we're like yeah you gotta

76
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,379
think about okay this meal takes an hour

77
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:56,668
so like we can't talk early oh yeah and

78
00:04:55,379 --> 00:05:00,598
then they were like the breakthrough is

79
00:04:56,668 --> 00:05:02,579
like let's make it before we even start

80
00:05:00,598 --> 00:05:05,370
the show and have a fully cooked one in

81
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:10,829
the oven so as we put one in we're just

82
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:14,180
pulling out so we need like the the

83
00:05:10,829 --> 00:05:18,418
other bag that he did before we got here

84
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:22,680
you're like fast-forward 20 minutes so

85
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:34,978
that camera gonna take pictures of each

86
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:38,060
of these oh my god I keep forgetting I'm

87
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:38,060
normally that Mac one is

88
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:45,269
hi hi honey

89
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,530
yeah I love the different consistencies

90
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:16,779
or just how different they all are like

91
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:23,170
you have different colored labels yeah

92
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:31,869
he makes it easier to sort them out it

93
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:35,620
all started with the red but yes we just

94
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:37,600
mix like this very frosty this is our

95
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:42,629
new new thing we're offering the new

96
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:45,520
mixing stations so you make the

97
00:06:42,629 --> 00:06:48,490
stainless now and we have big huge ones

98
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:51,699
we sell two we're setting up a lot of

99
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,769
hash labs now all over and they want to

100
00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:59,349
go as big as possible it's all about

101
00:06:53,769 --> 00:07:02,709
size scale this whole like setup would

102
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:05,620
go for retail within three bags and I

103
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:08,109
had just maybe like I don't know exactly

104
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,410
to tell you the truth we haven't yeah I

105
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,540
don't

106
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,960
we haven't pricey yet but you go on our

107
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:17,020
website bull banks calm and check it out

108
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:19,539
nom Instagram but yeah so people want to

109
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:22,180
most labs want to do at least like 10 10

110
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:25,270
thousand grams a month get production up

111
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,730
and people are scaling right now it's

112
00:07:25,269 --> 00:07:32,229
crazy but what if what see this being

113
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:33,759
used really well for test runs you know

114
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,650
of a certain strain yes you're gonna be

115
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,699
always happy you can just grab you know

116
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:38,109
a quick couple plans

117
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:40,029
yeah they're like equipment uncle man

118
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,939
just put it in there mix it up and go

119
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:44,709
okay it's worth it I put this in this is

120
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:47,110
what came out let's cut that whole

121
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:48,609
freaking crop down that's exactly what

122
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,680
the big companies do yeah that would be

123
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,250
very they buy our little five sets and

124
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,199
they do

125
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:55,300
test run or they'll run even like one

126
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:58,269
gallons before they run the big 200

127
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,889
gallon systems just as like the little

128
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,829
Barbie batch just to make sure they

129
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:04,599
dialed it in and also it's a good way of

130
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:06,370
saving your product too before you go

131
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,439
into a freeze dry cuz you have to have a

132
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:09,970
full freeze dryer full because it cost

133
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:11,920
money to run that freeze dryer and you

134
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,630
don't want to run it half full so these

135
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,720
are great to save your product in

136
00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:18,699
between runs it's another way bags

137
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,320
holding bags would you actually leave it

138
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:27,370
in the bag and just set it aside oh yeah

139
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:28,779
in the bucket - yeah totally and then

140
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,670
you just put it on your trays when

141
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:32,439
you're ready to rock and then come in

142
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:38,649
here and check this out this is really

143
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:44,229
awesome it's like almost orange it's

144
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:49,659
gonna be beautiful it's gonna be yummy

145
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:50,740
really yummy you smell it yeah it's

146
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:54,789
pretty tangerine ewwww

147
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:56,860
yeah give it a squeeze let it melt then

148
00:08:54,789 --> 00:08:59,289
sometimes you just hang it above just

149
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:04,659
give it a hang but I'm just gonna put

150
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:07,529
this aside for now I could let it drain

151
00:09:04,659 --> 00:09:11,289
and melt for maximum yield

152
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:13,088
but for TV purposes or just put it

153
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:16,959
balanced a lot of yeah we're gonna waste

154
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:19,350
a lot of great hash yeah this is going

155
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,350
to be great

156
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,379
so being obviously being in a really

157
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:29,799
cold environment is the best and best

158
00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:32,769
situation so most of the labs are we set

159
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:35,620
up or all like walk-in fruit freezers

160
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:39,850
basically you need full-on cold gear in

161
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:44,259
there I run it like 46 degrees roughly

162
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:46,120
with a cool box so so the people so the

163
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:48,519
people doing stuff at scale I mean

164
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,070
they're they're having massive walk-in

165
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:53,470
freezers right massive walk-in freezers

166
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:58,240
just yeah and what temperature do they

167
00:09:53,470 --> 00:10:00,850
usually keep it at I'm like 40 46 you

168
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,230
see yeah I read it 46 I mean you can you

169
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,550
can have it colder but it's it's not

170
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,960
really necessary and if you really

171
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:07,029
actually it's in a freezer you can't it

172
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,629
literally freeze while you're while

173
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:14,439
you're doing this you wanted about 46 to

174
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:16,149
50 I've noticed that even at 55 your ice

175
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,250
isn't gonna melt as long as it's moving

176
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:19,629
but anything above that and it's

177
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,740
definitely gonna start melting off

178
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:22,389
really good you're gonna get a lot more

179
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,490
condensation on the side of whatever

180
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:26,740
you're using even if they're jacketed

181
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,480
they'll start to really condensate I

182
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,340
like the colder the better the colder

183
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,830
the better is the best but then but then

184
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,960
it's exactly comfortable and working

185
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:36,790
with it I was in the other day and you

186
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,160
have to have your full-on beard cover

187
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:42,939
you know your beard net your tat net

188
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:45,579
your walking suit and it's just like too

189
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,690
cold too cold you need like next time

190
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,129
you gotta bundle up

191
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:51,280
you'd be surprised though how quick you

192
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:52,990
get warm once you start really paddling

193
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,879
down the river so we got a little waste

194
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,250
material here no big deal no big deal

195
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,929
just a little you know we're just we did

196
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:03,340
like double sifting basic there's a

197
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:06,219
really good handful so anyways we're

198
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:09,580
going to put that aside and then we're

199
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:13,129
gonna pull out of our 45 here this is

200
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:15,839
the gauge this is the goodies right here

201
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:18,088
it's just kind of like you wanted if you

202
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,269
can see over there yeah you kind of want

203
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:23,759
the ball to kind of congeal together

204
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:25,709
kind of get together and obviously a

205
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,149
little water action would be nice but

206
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:28,859
see the beautiful little healthy little

207
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:31,948
ball there that is gorgeous

208
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:34,889
that's nice yeah that's gonna be um yum

209
00:11:31,948 --> 00:11:37,049
yum and this is what I would consider

210
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:39,329
full-spectrum because he basically did

211
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:41,219
42 159 yeah

212
00:11:39,328 --> 00:11:43,500
just with a couple of little strokes of

213
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,449
the paddle mm-hmm you barely even beat

214
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,860
that was maybe like three minutes of

215
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:49,620
washing it at the most

216
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,060
check this out that's gorgeous that's a

217
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,828
lot more than I was expecting from that

218
00:11:51,059 --> 00:11:58,219
from that train man that looks really

219
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:58,219
good it looks good in the light

220
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:09,300
yeah not bad man yeah that's how we do

221
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:11,480
it that's gonna be nice little freeze

222
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:13,740
dryer put that with a lot more and

223
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,379
freeze dry it and it's gonna be

224
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,688
delicious I used to like it you did this

225
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:21,028
table like 20 years ago you would lay it

226
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:22,409
out on the table or something this

227
00:12:21,028 --> 00:12:26,039
tables been in our family a long time

228
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:31,740
actually seen a lot of hillbilly hash

229
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:32,990
bashes right I love it yeah so let's

230
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,490
hash everybody

231
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:38,009
that's a 45 that's a good bubble hash

232
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:42,600
right yeah that's gonna be really fun do

233
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:44,699
you smoke later and then also check out

234
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,399
the hue of this water in here yeah I

235
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:49,948
mean this is delicious product here too

236
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,948
and what you can do with this all of my

237
00:12:49,948 --> 00:12:55,639
water all of my hash to water my plants

238
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:58,139
is you could actually boil this down and

239
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:00,480
distill all the water out all the water

240
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,610
out and you can get more solid material

241
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,680
I don't use so what's great about this

242
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:06,810
new mixing bucket is that you can

243
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:08,969
actually really maximize your product

244
00:13:06,809 --> 00:13:11,369
and then turn this into something useful

245
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,959
instead of throwing it out so this is

246
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,448
stuff that only made it through all

247
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,578
three bags right yes this is the final

248
00:13:15,448 --> 00:13:20,789
smoke product you can go down to a 25

249
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:23,250
micron to but but my point is that super

250
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:27,059
filtered with jism yeah this this is

251
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,649
after you boil this down and you get

252
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:31,229
solid material this will be really

253
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:32,188
smokeable or edible too it'll be really

254
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:34,970
great for edibles

255
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:38,519
yeah fantastic because it'll also be

256
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:42,720
it'll be activated with heat which will

257
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:45,629
make it really psychoactive when you eat

258
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,778
it that's a lot of work I just like I

259
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:51,509
said I use all of my hash water with my

260
00:13:48,778 --> 00:13:53,278
mixes and my teas it's thanks a little

261
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:55,409
bit and you said you feed it to your

262
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,259
plants all night they're like fuck yeah

263
00:13:55,409 --> 00:14:00,480
dude I'll be honest thanks man regular

264
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:02,339
mix as soon as it gets those they're so

265
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,879
happy they they immediately just go

266
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:08,160
crazy so yeah I love the color of this

267
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:10,709
look I would say it's like almost orange

268
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,689
it's fun it's fun like to play with

269
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:14,879
different kinds of trims like indoor

270
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,010
Sonics and things because you get some

271
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,379
amazing results sometimes you get purple

272
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:21,569
water and you've got purple water thank

273
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:24,450
you crazy sometimes water yeah you get

274
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:27,629
blue water fed like all kinds of colors

275
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:30,750
pink at times also it's always different

276
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:33,629
there's so many amazing strains and that

277
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,159
have been you know not even testing even

278
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:36,990
as you wash as you go through your

279
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:38,579
washes the color of the water will

280
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,799
change like it'll start purple and then

281
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:46,110
move to this like like you know greenish

282
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:50,549
tannish orange colors or wow this is so

283
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:55,289
cool yeah that smells delicious good job

284
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:57,779
man that'll be far out and so when you

285
00:14:55,289 --> 00:15:00,029
left it out drying I guess its climate

286
00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:01,589
dependent but like how long because

287
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:04,529
you're in Humble right I'm sorry good so

288
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:07,410
how long would that take to just sundry

289
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:09,389
it like a week maybe it depends on the

290
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:11,639
you know if it's the summer or you know

291
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:14,879
when yeah so this is wild so we made

292
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:18,090
some hash you guys with some this 45

293
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:27,509
mesh full mesh bags and it's going to be

294
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:32,430
delicious and what's amazing is this on

295
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:34,679
a large scale yeah alright so so in kind

296
00:15:32,429 --> 00:15:36,719
of the biggest size that's on the market

297
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:39,750
now that are being used by these larger

298
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,279
facilities what's kind of the yield per

299
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:46,259
walk like what are you seeing yield wise

300
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:50,699
it depends on the strains like how many

301
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:54,620
grams is this would you guess I would

302
00:15:50,700 --> 00:16:01,680
say like two after that after driving

303
00:15:54,620 --> 00:16:03,210
maybe maybe two am lucky yeah we weren't

304
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,309
doing it as fast as what we were doing

305
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:07,530
it you know I've gotten more absolutely

306
00:16:05,309 --> 00:16:10,079
I'm just throwing a couple handfuls

307
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:10,679
anything and also it's really a hot day

308
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,240
today too

309
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:16,679
yeah I think that I need agree so you

310
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,730
don't want to do hash on a hot day

311
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:20,039
because your yield

312
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,829
really shitty what's nice is if you

313
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:25,019
crank up the AC in the house or do it on

314
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:28,049
a cold night all night or if you're in

315
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:30,509
the snow go out and get some snow that's

316
00:16:28,049 --> 00:16:32,819
what you do and make it a nighttime

317
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:34,500
manner right now it's um I mean

318
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,500
everybody's wearing their full-on like

319
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:40,440
you know like cold work it's so cold in

320
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:43,019
there I'm wearing like I have snowboard

321
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,850
jackets a guy might be yeah and it's

322
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:48,149
cold we have to come out with new like

323
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:54,839
cold gear now because we're in the cold

324
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:56,610
all the time not only that but you it's

325
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:58,860
weird cuz you get both them you're

326
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,440
working in that cold so you're gonna get

327
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,089
warm - so you kind of have to like be

328
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,429
able to take your jacket off sometimes

329
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:07,939
and like I mean it's 50 degrees in there

330
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:10,048
but I'm not cold sometimes and then I

331
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:13,048
usually I'm in shorts but I'll usually

332
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:16,048
wear a jacket but my feet usually get

333
00:17:13,048 --> 00:17:18,078
freezing and my air conditioner is

334
00:17:16,048 --> 00:17:21,269
pumping and it's freezing in there and

335
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:25,409
I'm always adding ice - I'm really anal

336
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:27,509
i-i-i I'm very picky I guess you could

337
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:31,860
say but I guess it comes out in the end

338
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:34,589
product - just once I will keep it gold

339
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:36,839
I once had to work as a butcher and I

340
00:17:34,589 --> 00:17:39,539
sold that stays in the freezer room and

341
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:43,859
it reminds me of that but making hash is

342
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:50,399
so much fun there's nothing better than

343
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:51,899
stupid no thanks no thank you I'm not

344
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,298
into that at all

345
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,740
and then you I've noticed that people

346
00:17:54,298 --> 00:18:00,440
are doing different temperatures at

347
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:03,150
their presses and I've noticed also what

348
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,798
they're not they're not pressing in a

349
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:06,298
warm room but they're also not pressing

350
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:10,160
in a freezing cold room they're doing it

351
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:12,480
about like 65 at 60 to 65 degrees and

352
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,769
I've noticed a lot of people are up in

353
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,130
their temperature where it used to be

354
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:21,298
like Oh 190 200 max and now people are

355
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:23,280
pressing up to 30 to 40 and the to 30 to

356
00:18:21,298 --> 00:18:25,589
40 just allows a direct press so you can

357
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,710
kind of squirt directly into a jar I

358
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:30,389
don't know if that's all for

359
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:34,470
visual purposes or whatever the case may

360
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:39,810
be and the a lot of other big-name

361
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:40,230
companies like monopolies extracts dang

362
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:43,379
Zara

363
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,910
ice wax that guy they're just they just

364
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:47,130
pump directly onto parchment and then

365
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:49,890
they just ball it up throw it in a jar

366
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:51,210
and let it cure then there's also a lot

367
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,210
of different curing techniques where

368
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:57,329
people say Oh put it in a in a jar with

369
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:58,860
the lid closed for 200 degrees for 45

370
00:18:57,329 --> 00:19:00,359
minutes and let it do its thing in the

371
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:02,129
jar and then other people are like that

372
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:04,529
ruins all the Turks you're gonna you're

373
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:06,830
gonna ruin everything and then other

374
00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:11,849
people say oh just leave it in the jar

375
00:19:06,829 --> 00:19:13,139
75 degrees wow I've noticed that I kind

376
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:14,849
of play with the best of both worlds

377
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,670
where I go a little bit warmer I have a

378
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:19,919
mmm have a closet in my house luckily

379
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:23,430
that hasn't water heater in it so it

380
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:25,620
stays about 85 degrees all the time and

381
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,480
I let my hash sitting there in a dark

382
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:29,909
room at about 85 for about five days

383
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,970
that's where my separation occurs and

384
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:34,380
does everything does this and this and

385
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,759
in all honesty you can have it any way I

386
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,780
can fresh press it and freeze it and

387
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,789
it'll look bomb and it looked like

388
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:39,269
shatter but then you have to keep it

389
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:42,450
cold

390
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:45,329
you have to seven ten labs just started

391
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,950
to talk about how they're finally

392
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:48,210
starting to explain hey this is what our

393
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,259
hash looks like at the beginning this is

394
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,990
what our hash looks like after it's been

395
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:56,539
to store your hash in the frigerator in

396
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:58,980
a nice little Tupperware jar with a anti

397
00:19:56,539 --> 00:20:01,139
moisture yeah back inside keep the

398
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,930
moisture out that's what I that's what I

399
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,420
prefer and recommend you not freeze it

400
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:09,029
freezing it's bad yeah freezing is very

401
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,560
bad I don't like to freeze my hash the

402
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:13,079
only thing those threes is my is my

403
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,119
flour I freeze my flour when it's fresh

404
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:17,220
frozen and cut down because it doesn't

405
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,909
seem to expand much because it's already

406
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:23,069
full of water and doing its thing and

407
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:25,680
even then I've seen fresh frozen last

408
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:27,779
like if it's sealed good and a good

409
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:29,279
freezer like six months to a year no

410
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:32,670
problem and still produce exactly the

411
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,379
same as it did the day was cut down but

412
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,120
after it's pressed and made like you

413
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,640
said it should stay cold and it should

414
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:39,229
stay at least humid as possible you have

415
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,720
to have those

416
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,880
whatever those that's a great hat it has

417
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,319
a great shelf life does it does it'll

418
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,549
last a long time I remember the big

419
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:52,069
bricks back a long time with the stamp

420
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:53,869
on it yes and you just they lasted you

421
00:20:52,069 --> 00:20:56,000
just put it in your closet or in your

422
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:59,689
drive wherever and they you know issues

423
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,419
but Trailer Park Boys status hash blocks

424
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,970
I love that cam rock walks around with

425
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:09,649
his igloo cooler is little mini cooler

426
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:13,460
he takes his seriously he is very very

427
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:16,219
serious yeah but he also has full milk

428
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:17,659
he separates them so you have to keep

429
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,639
your full milk cold or else it'll turn

430
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:21,320
black or not black but it oxidize and

431
00:21:19,638 --> 00:21:23,778
turn brown which is still good it still

432
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:25,730
tastes amazing but over how long a

433
00:21:23,778 --> 00:21:28,819
period like the next day or next day

434
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,620
okay yeah yeah from from from literally

435
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:33,769
like white is this you know why does

436
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:35,239
this lid it'll it'll turn so it's

437
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:39,440
basically like carrying a heart

438
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:43,339
transplant from like LA to keep it cold

439
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,950
well you you how I figured it out and

440
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:50,148
learned was before I even started doing

441
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:52,190
this you approve of his wash you like

442
00:21:50,148 --> 00:21:57,908
his work is that what attracted you to

443
00:21:52,190 --> 00:22:02,558
him good answer

444
00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:02,559
she's she makes better hash than me

445
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:13,819
really at a spa like a spa day yeah I

446
00:22:06,288 --> 00:22:15,470
was oh you were both already at the spa

447
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:17,089
I thought she was like you need to meet

448
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:18,380
my daughter and you're gonna go on a

449
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:19,849
date to a smart

450
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,260

your mom that's one thing I always

452
00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:32,298
learned my mom agrees with that advice

453
00:22:24,648 --> 00:22:35,989
totally yeah yeah well so who are you

454

455
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:40,399
see people post stuff on Instagram or

that you're you'd like that you'd like

458
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,909

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:50,058
recently smoked personally smoking

460
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:51,830
others hash I really like let's see what

course like I said supe

463
00:22:53,538 --> 00:23:00,048
Michigan made melts makes amazing hash

464
00:22:57,608 --> 00:23:02,628
7-10 Labs is always good it's always

465
00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:04,219
consistent and that that's really the

466
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:07,608
the hard thing to find is somebody that

467
00:23:04,219 --> 00:23:09,798
makes a consistent product there's a

468
00:23:07,608 --> 00:23:11,418

474
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,570
consistency and finding people that have

475
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:25,368
good strains Cameron

00:23:45,858 --> 00:23:50,358
it like I don't want to have a bunch of

488
00:23:47,298 --> 00:23:52,489
like you know like avid and people

489
00:23:50,358 --> 00:23:54,798
spraying their plants and you know I

490
00:23:52,489 --> 00:23:56,629
just I don't want that so I don't I

491
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,460
don't I make sure to stay away from that

492
00:23:56,628 --> 00:24:00,408
and I'm always like in the room right

493
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,749
before I'm the one cutting the weed down

494
00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:04,190
so I'm in there a couple days before

495
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:07,399
their harvest cutting their weed down

496
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:09,679
doing a test batch for other people's

497
00:24:07,398 --> 00:24:11,418
harvest yes okay I have my own harvest

498
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,759
but there's no way to sustain that like

499
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:16,278
as a one person you'd have to have all

500
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,169
sorts of rooms to have the consistency

501
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:19,638
to have a point is that they're letting

502
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:21,830
you come in and cut yeah these are my

503
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:23,838

about you know like the High Times cups

655
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,680

656
00:30:52,829 --> 00:30:59,159
intimate was exchanged small intimate or

657
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:01,289

662
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,009
was was growing and they were figuring

663
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,360
all of these things out you met all

664
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:17,819
those people all those strains that were

665
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:19,859
getting built the chocolate the LA

666
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:22,679
Confidential all those strains were new

667
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:24,000
and never even around and they were said

668
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,560
it were you and Amsterdam for a while

669
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,329
yeah well I wasn't there but I was going

670
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,619
every year and I was like this is what I

671
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:30,359
want to do with my life I want to figure

672
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:32,849
this out I want to know what the pulse

673
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:34,229
is around the world and it was funny how

674
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,669
many Americans you found going to

675
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,349
Amsterdam trying to also figure out what

676
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:39,600
I was like you know we were just like

677
00:31:37,349 --> 00:31:41,279
the Canadians to Canadians to know all

678
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,599
the claims are we wearing their red and

679
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,639
white shirts and rolling around

680
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:46,079
everybody was having so much fun

681
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,910
the cannabis community it was like so

682
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:51,389
refreshing where you don't have to like

683
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:52,410
you all like outcasts and black sheep

684
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:53,910
and you're running around everybody's

685
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,380
like oh man here go to this Hedgehog

00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:05,459
it first got real hash like real a hash

691
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:07,380
man stirred a myself holy crap

692
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,819
like there's nothing like this like

693
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:11,070
nobody's and if anybody's making

694
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:14,939
anything like this then giving it to me

695
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:17,519
yeah only like 18 19 20 maybe you know I

696
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:19,440
certainly wasn't under yeah I got some

697
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,930
good chronic it's a weed is tight you

698
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,600
know chronic and man that you know yeah

699
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:26,340
but when you found it and it was all

700
00:32:24,599 --> 00:32:29,699
like you says come from Nepal was coming

701
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:32,789
from Morocco and it would be blonde or

702
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,620
even even the dark stuff was so good and

703
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:36,930
you would barely get any and it would

704
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,729
last you so long it was so delicious and

705
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,230
then you know just trying to figure out

706
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,490
fun seeing the bubble man and then

707
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:43,440
seeing people with the washing machines

708
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:45,450
and seeing people with the straighteners

709
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,460
and then seeing people smash everything

710
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:49,980
and then people coming up with all sorts

711
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:52,049
of cool ideas on ways to smoke it's

712
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,099
changed you know people using the Ember

713
00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:55,799
that was the first time I saw someone

714
00:32:53,099 --> 00:32:59,309
with like a hot rod you know a hot stick

715
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:01,019
connected to a you know a plug and

716
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:04,079
you're smoking weed without a flame it's

717
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:05,369
like okay oh and the volcano came out so

718
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:06,659
it was like oh this is like there were

719
00:33:05,369 --> 00:33:09,449
so many different things changing around

720
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:11,430
that time right around 2000 2002 it's

721
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:13,080
really cool it was really awesome and

722
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:15,080
I'm just glad that it's still

723
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:17,939
progressing and we're not being stagnant

724
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:20,639
these new oils these all the new oils

725
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:24,090
stimulate new smoking products and it's

726
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:27,660
just a full circle I was just talking to

727
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:30,119
Ben from rising tech because I was

728
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:32,700
asking I was like is there any reason

729
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:33,959
why you make THC a besides just kind of

730
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,880
a show either I want to get really

731
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,460
fucked up or just to show people that

732
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,650
you can do something that I don't I I

733
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,090
know that the process is insane I've

734
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,519
never even attempted have you seen a

735
00:33:42,089 --> 00:33:46,289
little white rocks a little basically

736
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,619
you're gonna miss again yeah and you're

737
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:50,079
gonna repress this

738
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:52,418
at a higher temperature and yeah you

739
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:54,759
actually to cut the bag open scoop shit

740
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:58,299
out it's like I think it's time for that

741
00:33:54,759 --> 00:34:03,308
this delicious is that something I'm not

742
00:33:58,298 --> 00:34:04,778
going to take my red wine yeah yeah I'm

743
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:06,490
really I'm really happy with my product

744
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:08,260
I don't need to go that far down the

745
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:10,059
rabbit hole I don't think I've seen it

746
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:11,950
done and I've looked into the the

747
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:13,269
research on it and I've seen some other

748
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:14,769
people do it but I've also seen it I

749
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:16,719
feel like people do it just to get super

750
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:18,250
fucked up not because it's like how much

751
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,809
more fucked up can you get just smoke to

752
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:22,418
dabs of that well that's my point that's

753
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:23,889
why I'm wondering why people do it is it

754
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:27,338
just to show other people that they can

755
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:29,649
do it I think so okay I think so I don't

756
00:34:27,338 --> 00:34:32,079
I don't see any benefit to it right I

757
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:34,059
don't see any nice technology it's a fun

758
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:37,199
topper for your that that's my foot yeah

759
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:40,989
product people like it it's nice pure

760
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:43,989

762
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:46,658
yeah

763
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:52,720
now you mentioned that yard I was like

764
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:55,809
sweet I want a yurt I've seen them

765
00:34:52,719 --> 00:35:00,069
yeah I've seen really interesting new

766
00:34:55,809 --> 00:35:05,019
derivatives of hash now from the widest

767
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:10,500
white powder oh yeah yeah from the black

768
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:13,599
to white and I've also every grade when

769
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,719
when I'm making this before I I've

770
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,519
turned it into like this color or this

771
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:20,949
consistency like I can I could probably

772
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:23,019
cut the top part off you know all of the

773
00:35:20,949 --> 00:35:24,039
Terps and save all the white underneath

774
00:35:23,019 --> 00:35:26,619
and it would be a completely different

775
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:28,179
smoke but again I like it all together

776
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:29,980
do you know what I'm saying trying to

777
00:35:28,179 --> 00:35:33,399
say that I like that mixture of

778
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:35,289
everything feel like even with THC

779
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,030
diamonds or two nodded Charlie's in

780
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:38,949
there diamonds like I said you're gonna

781
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:42,700
reap put it back in another bag into

782
00:35:38,949 --> 00:35:45,509
about a 15 micron bag I'd give it a go

783
00:35:42,699 --> 00:35:45,509
you should be good

784
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:51,489
so 15 micron bag and then you're gonna

785
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:53,980
repress it hotter and I've heard that

786
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:55,569
actually you started a super low temp

787
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,909
first or something like that Lincoln a

788
00:35:55,570 --> 00:36:05,430
hundred degrees and then you press and

789
00:35:57,909 --> 00:36:05,429
then you can gradually increase it I do

790
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,010

my life I thought I'd be making hash

810
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:29,610
bags it's not since you were a small boy

811
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:31,949
you had this dream but it's a wonderful

812
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:33,900
like you know people depend on me for

813
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:35,730
them a lot of people get pissed like I'd

814
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,369
say I'd stop making them because I don't

815
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:41,670
make a lot of money doing them so I tell

816
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:46,769
people and they get mad you know he just

817
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:49,970
try to keep your like it's a great you

818
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:54,840
know thing that people need it's still

819
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:57,059
and I enjoy it and I enjoy being in the

820
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:58,769
cannabis world I do too I really like

821
00:37:57,059 --> 00:38:02,579
the community I've literally been in the

822
00:37:58,769 --> 00:38:04,409
cannabis world for over 20 years there's

823
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:07,139
a big part of the community I do not

824
00:38:04,409 --> 00:38:10,619
like there are those people and there's

825
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:13,319
a community I do like I mean luckily

826
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:16,349
I've got you know and I know the best

827
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:20,970
people and really good many good people

828
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:26,009
in this business but after 20 years you

829
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:29,730
know you learn a few things sometimes

830
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:31,560
not the easy way yeah sometimes they

831
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:33,929
cost you a friendship or a couple bucks

832
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:36,989
but you know you just try to remain

833
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:39,089
positive is is the main thing and I

834
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:40,719
found people get greedy in this business

835
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:42,400
that's sort of one thing that's

836
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:45,699
it kills it you know people get a little

837
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,889
too greedy sometimes I mean they should

838
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:50,289
just sort of like just sit back and try

839
00:38:47,889 --> 00:38:51,460
to be part of the big picture mm-hmm you

840
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:54,670
know when you're building something like

841
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,900
Pepsi Cola you know it's like gonna be

842
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:59,019
part of it you know like when you're

843
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,820
building something big cannabis

844
00:38:59,019 --> 00:39:04,389
businesses so that's full of a lot of

845
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:05,800
different stories like that I hear a lot

846
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:10,150
of stories especially with legalization

847
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:12,310
now do ya know I've had people burn me

848
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:15,460
like it's still a gangster business

849
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:16,960
basically kind of I can't believe the

850
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,579
robberies go on like they do like people

851
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,460
just like breaking and smashing and

852
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:22,420
grabbing I'm like what he is doing like

853
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,470
it's the cannabis community we're so

854
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,659
tight-knit usually you're gonna get

855
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:27,339
caught anyway like yeah there's a lot of

856
00:39:25,659 --> 00:39:33,118
desperate people out there still it's

857
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:36,220
sad it sucks but there was a cot

858
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,530
all right so what would you you'd

859
00:39:36,219 --> 00:39:41,559
basically dry that now that be dried or

860
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:43,269
you just let it sit in the Sun or just

861
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:45,250
kind of get the water Christ okay this

862
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:47,199
gets by I can't remember if I asked the

863
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:50,320
question but if you let this sit out in

864
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:53,799
the Sun here in LA how long would you

865
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:58,410
like it one day a week yeah give it a

866
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:00,910
week right I'd say right now right now

867
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:02,289
degrees out maybe not even you could

868
00:40:00,909 --> 00:40:04,480
smoke it tomorrow I mean I think you're

869
00:40:02,289 --> 00:40:06,070
joking right now if I put it like you

870
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,630
could definitely yeah yeah probably

871
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,400
smoke it tomorrow no problem

872
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:12,670
it should make a nice ball we have ever

873
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:15,190
straight press that no because it's

874
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:17,170
gonna be water right so when you squish

875
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:19,000
that and there's water left in its team

876
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:21,430
concept yeah well it'll literally squirt

877
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,070
out the water yeah you just kind of do

878
00:40:21,429 --> 00:40:28,809
it's great to drink the water yeah so

879
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:31,030
you can't do a super hyper fast drying

880
00:40:28,809 --> 00:40:32,739
it freeze dryer the freeze dryer is the

881
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:34,830
way to go always that's why you can't

882
00:40:32,739 --> 00:40:37,299
that's why you can't press fresh flour

883
00:40:34,829 --> 00:40:39,730
you have to wait for flour to dry before

884
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:43,410
you can actually do flour rosin so you

885
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:43,409
have to have to dry it out

886
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:49,059
the other humming looks delicious I'll

887
00:40:46,699 --> 00:40:49,059
be good tomorrow

888
00:40:51,039 --> 00:41:00,079
smells good yeah oh yeah I love making

889
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:02,839
ash yeah I definitely love disgust

890
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:04,490
getting a big bag made a custom one and

891
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:08,269
maybe even yeah we can do that for you I

892
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:10,879
would really appreciate that we we just

893
00:41:08,269 --> 00:41:16,639
did these hundred and eighty gallon bags

894
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:19,608
that's huge huge like size 180 gallons

895
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,868
we just did 180 I'm like trying to think

896
00:41:19,608 --> 00:41:23,210
of what that would even look like like

897
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:25,338
it's just a big tank you know the size

898
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:27,139
of that couch cushion right there while

899
00:41:25,338 --> 00:41:30,049
it's like just like you know it's a big

900
00:41:27,139 --> 00:41:31,879
tank it's not too big you know they did

901
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:34,339
have an agitator in the middle yeah an

902
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:37,599
agitator goes up on top I did this for a

903
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:44,210
good friend up in the hills of humble

904
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:48,950
company and so still massive yeah yeah

905
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:51,260
we love doing that but but so did I ask

906
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:55,159
the question where it's like we yielded

907
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:58,339
like oh the Precision's

908
00:41:55,159 --> 00:42:01,210
we made going fervour on volume depends

909
00:41:58,338 --> 00:42:03,318
on the strains of course some strains

910
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:05,000
nothing

911
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:07,818
yeah I thought the strains that pumped

912
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,338
flour and pens just like for exhaustion

913
00:42:07,818 --> 00:42:12,079
it's like 2% nothing just like why does

914
00:42:10,338 --> 00:42:15,289
the strawberry banana just squirt out

915
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:19,190
some john and rosin so because your

916
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:21,259
mom's amo 80% 7% you're like what every

917
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:23,329
time and it's really hard to find oh

918
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:26,000
geez that produce at all thankfully my

919
00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:28,730
wife I does like a 5% which is it's

920
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,619
still really good for an OG usually

921
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,969
you're happy with four but you're not

922
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:34,099
gonna be making much fun here's my

923
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:37,299
question are there machine returns the

924
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:39,619
larger you go he says I believe so no

925
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,780
traditionally making hash like you you

926
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:43,700
got a pound of hash I mean a pound of

927
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,950
weed or trim you're gonna get about

928
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:49,039
thirty percent yield sometimes twenty to

929
00:42:45,949 --> 00:42:51,199
thirty percent yeah yeah dry if it's dry

930
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:52,309
you know yeah you're gonna get that much

931
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:54,859
hash you

932
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:58,369
that exact return but then this more

933
00:42:54,860 --> 00:43:01,460
refined product it's all depends on you

934
00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:04,130
you have to weigh out potency versus

935
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:06,889
flavor and and just work your way

936
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:10,430
through mm-hmm and work your way into

937
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:13,099
the best quality but like 20 percent

938
00:43:10,429 --> 00:43:15,679
average I'd say yeah yeah and 20 percent

939
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:18,500
average that's on dry flour and then if

940
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:20,899
you cut down and it's wet we do five

941
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:23,929
times the ratio so like a pound of flour

942
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:25,849
is 40 for 450 grams roughly will 450 for

943
00:43:23,929 --> 00:43:28,639
exactly and then when I do a pound of

944
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:32,029
fresh frozen it's 2250 so it's five

945
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:34,190
times that amount so that's why we

946
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:37,100
that's how we roll that and then you get

947
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:40,190
a four percent but if you do 4 times 5

948
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:43,309
that's 20% and you're hoping for those

949
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:45,619
20 percents anything more is a lot of

950
00:43:43,309 --> 00:43:47,389
icing on the cake and for some reason

951
00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:49,789
like you said those strawberry bananas

952
00:43:47,389 --> 00:43:51,349
those those GMOs there's some strains

953
00:43:49,789 --> 00:43:54,590
the cookies and cream they're pumping

954
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:57,170
six to eight percent repetitively

955
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:58,940
over and over and over again so that's

956
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:01,190
what people are making the most hash out

957
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:04,309
of obviously my problem is just keeping

958
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:06,889
a consistent supply finding traffic is a

959
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:10,730
problem it is definitely consistency

960
00:44:06,889 --> 00:44:16,460
problem huh just kind of that's one of

961
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:20,360
the ways I wash and I I wanna wash in a

962
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:23,389
44 I've been doing in a 32 but my bag is

963
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:29,480
a 50 because I can't actually find a bag

964
00:44:23,389 --> 00:44:29,929
that will fit a 30 44 that's not six

965
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,809
feet long

966
00:44:29,929 --> 00:44:34,460
like I said go on a website make them

967
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:38,029
the right thing please I'd love to find

968
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:40,070
out bullpens comm I there i lo I'll send

969
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:43,160
you some later but so I wash I wash

970
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:45,740
roughly and I wash in a big bag with no

971
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:47,960
light like my big bag is my work back so

972
00:44:45,739 --> 00:44:50,809
I'm just washing directly in that I tie

973
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:52,159
it off I put a slip knot on it and I

974
00:44:50,809 --> 00:44:54,230
have a hoist and I pull it straight out

975
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:55,969
of the trash can and let it hang like

976
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:58,250
you did you know what I'm saying yeah

977
00:44:55,969 --> 00:44:59,629
the hoist is a great way just to wrap it

978
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:01,789
in the middle I do I just twist it

979
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:04,550
straight up pull my bucket of water out

980
00:45:01,789 --> 00:45:07,099
and then I dump into ten

981
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:10,280
I do 10 gallons and I use ice extracts

982
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:13,099
packs right now but I use the same exact

983
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:18,170
what you're doing I use 40 and then I go

984
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:20,360
from 40 to 179 my I have I wash into 220

985
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:23,480
then I dump into another to 22 to clean

986
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:25,370
that and then my 180 to 219 I throw that

987
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:27,740
like just to the side - that's just like

988
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:28,429
you know hash for bond loads or

989
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:33,319
something like that

990
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:35,000
I my my full spec that I press is 42 179

991
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:38,960
and that's what I feel like the best

992
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,699
heads are so that's my yeah it's all

993
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,409
about the precious heads if the precious

994
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:45,019
heads are there you're gonna get them if

995
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:46,940
it's not I mean I look at trim every day

996
00:45:45,019 --> 00:45:49,519
and it's amazing under the microscope

997
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:51,860
it's either there or it's not out there

998
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:55,309
it's just fucking fact

999
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:59,349
yep and I'm in the fact also as our eyes

1000
00:45:55,309 --> 00:45:59,349
are getting any better as we get older

1001
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:03,530
yeah

1002
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:04,640
I've seen even the the other technique

1003
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:06,830
where people are just putting a couple

1004
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:08,629
nugs in a mason jar with ice and water

1005
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:10,340
shaking it up and just holding it you

1006
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,809
know to the sunlight see him okay is

1007
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:14,650
there enough sand down in the bottom is

1008
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:18,019
it worth running this contests good

1009
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:21,530
people are also you know be innovative

1010
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:22,639
you know be be it's also a little frugal

1011
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:25,940
you know so you're not you're not

1012
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:29,779
wasting a bunch of product but so what

1013
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:32,119
end consistency do you guys speculate

1014
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:34,970
that's gonna look like it's gonna look

1015
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:38,029
like one of these two cuz it's a trim

1016
00:46:34,969 --> 00:46:39,559
these are all full fresh nugs and this

1017
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:41,150
is only even dark because it's been in

1018
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:42,170
here for two months you know be in this

1019
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:46,130
color range

1020
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:47,900
yeah after it's pressed and in all

1021
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:49,910
honesty it's funny how it might look

1022
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,849
darker here but once you dry it and you

1023
00:46:49,909 --> 00:46:55,309
put in a freeze dryer comes way lighter

1024
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:57,049
that's a fact and then when you press it

1025
00:46:55,309 --> 00:46:57,949
then it turns yellow and you're like oh

1026
00:46:57,050 --> 00:46:59,180
crap cool

1027
00:46:57,949 --> 00:47:01,730
yeah everything's dark the one that's

1028
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:03,829
wet and I'll be honest when I press

1029
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:07,579
these they came out super dark they were

1030
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:10,250
almost like like black and then after a

1031
00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:11,690
week of curing and whipping they start

1032
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:14,719
to look very nice and they start to look

1033
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:17,519
like this consistency and they're

1034
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:22,019
extremely delicious to smoke

1035
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:26,338
they are I think there's unanimous

1036
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:28,530
