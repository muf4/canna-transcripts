2
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:22,760
my name's AJ I'm a second-generation

3
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:28,108
farmer my parents got into it and I

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:30,840
naturally took to doing stuff I think 12

5
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:32,880
13 we get paid a little money to dig

6
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:36,058
holes and stuff like that and her kids

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,370
and grew my first crop but at 13 got a

8
00:00:36,058 --> 00:00:42,628
few plants so me and my buddy got a

9
00:00:38,369 --> 00:00:45,349
little spot on a on a ridge and that's

10
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:49,259
when it started with me so I've been

11
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,820
growing ever since things used to be a

12
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:53,579
lot different we used to grow up in the

13
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,558
tops of trees I was kind of a technique

14
00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:01,770
that I I pioneered at least in my area

15
00:00:55,558 --> 00:01:05,728
and was somewhat legendary for and we've

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,790
been building the farm been in the same

17
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:13,728
spot for the last 30 actually 32 years

18
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:16,890
and we've been slowly but surely

19
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:20,849
evolving our farm into what it is now

20
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:24,868
now we have a couple acres of permitted

21
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:28,640
cannabis in the center of 280 acre piece

22
00:01:24,868 --> 00:01:31,049
of property in Humboldt County right

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,960
pretty much close to the center of the

24
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,820
Emerald triangle so southern southern

25
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,169
Humboldt right we were started with a

26
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:38,699
smaller property and we were able to

27
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,189
acquire property next to it to make it

28
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,259
larger so was it we didn't start off on

29
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:45,839
a 280 acre parcel we started off on a

30
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,909
40-acre parcel got to buy the property

31
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,909
next next to us and

32
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:54,890
and then some more lands came up for

33
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:58,189
sale and so we got to expand a bit like

34
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:04,790
that but it's been the 288 for about 20

35
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:09,349
years that's been well we're like 1200

36
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:11,810
feet elevation so we get we get some

37
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:14,900
cool River fog that comes in not

38
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:17,449
consistently all year but certain times

39
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:21,800
the cool river fog comes in afternoon

40
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:24,019
winds come up so it's definitely I mean

41
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,750
there's so many microclimates up here

42
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:30,200
that we're kind of on a southern gentle

43
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,860
slope so the air is kind of sliding down

44
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:33,469
the hill

45
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,940
when it gets cool and it's pushing up up

46
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:38,150
the hill through the plants when it's

47
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:40,689
warm getting hotter in the day we've

48
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:46,310
been working mostly with the SF vog and

49
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:49,579
it loves it too dense of a of a strain

50
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:52,159
has trouble with its chicken through

51
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:56,300
situs as a challenge with rot at certain

52
00:02:52,159 --> 00:03:01,819
times because of the cooler nights but

53
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:04,580
the oh geez Sour Diesel really really do

54
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:10,009
well we primarily grow in soil we have a

55
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:13,070
few pots around but but we mostly grow

56
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:17,229
in beds and we've used the per most of

57
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:19,539
our soil is about we brought in soil

58
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:23,030
mixed it in with the native soil that's

59
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:27,949
seven years ago now so we amend it test

60
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:29,739
it see what it needs and yeah it's

61
00:03:27,949 --> 00:03:33,229
pretty awesome we earth worms and

62
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:34,939
beetles and and lots of you know the

63
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:37,518
good beneficial stuff growing in there

64
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:40,099
one part of the gardens we've got some

65
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,439
four hundred gallon smart pots the rest

66
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:45,340
are holes we have for our long-term we

67
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:51,189
have holes they're about the same size

68
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:53,830
they're about a three feet deep by five

69
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:56,949
six by six

70
00:03:53,830 --> 00:04:00,680
and that's in the ground and we have

71
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:04,609
primarily beds that are tilled into the

72
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,740
ground with with potting soil mixed in

73
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,950
and then in an annual amendments to

74
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:13,100
amend that and those are eight-foot-wide

75
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:15,079
beds and if you look at pictures of our

76
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:20,048
pharmacy the terrorists they're kind of

77
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:23,629
terrorists on a gentle slope so so those

78
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:26,689
yeah that's that's how we primarily grow

79
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:35,750
I'd say 80% is in the beds we do 8 foot

80
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:39,170
by by 98 by 90 its amended in native mix

81
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:41,060
so so we didn't put a barrier underneath

82
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:43,490
it or anything we did we got I mean the

83
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,280
the soil you know the spring when it's

84
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:55,370
like a dark rich brown you know it's

85
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:57,500
it's a pretty nice nice soil we till

86
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,819
them back in because we get started

87
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:03,350
pretty early as soon as the weather is

88
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:05,089
permitting for depth so so they get yeah

89
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,610
they get tilled in a few of the later

90
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:11,269
ones kind of got a chance to completely

91
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,949
finish out and we just knocked them down

92
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:16,668
with the weed weed eater and tell them

93
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:18,500
in and they're they're you know lush and

94
00:05:16,668 --> 00:05:20,750
a little less mature you can just take

95
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:23,379
the tiller right right to and chop them

96
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:27,079
up because they're all crisp and green

97
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:29,360
and yeah when we still do but you have

98
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:31,899
to amend a lot less and so so you do

99
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,759
that and then we get it tested and and

100
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:37,909
our nitrogen in that case it's usually

101
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:39,409
pretty good we do light depths mostly

102
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,470
light depths what we do do some

103
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:45,080
long-term the farm that the the bottom

104
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:49,530
two-thirds are our light depth and then

105
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:53,519
the top third is we have some long-term

106
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:56,779
on well we don't have it right now but

107
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:59,959
we grew a golden strawberry that was

108
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:01,949
that was pretty awesome and and

109
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:06,709
definitely like to get a hold of that

110
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:06,709
again yeah that's one of my favorites

111
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:19,139
yeah Sour Diesel is great on a on a a

112
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:20,909
good year on the really the traditional

113
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:22,560
Indian summers that we get it seemed

114
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,020
like it was a nine out of ten loosely

115
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,459
get get eight out of ten you know you

116
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:28,289
can count on a pretty good Indian summer

117
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:31,739
but if you don't they're gonna be

118
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:34,970
regretting it which was last year last

119
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,970
year wasn't fun for the Sour Diesel

120
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:46,530
during the offseason I'm a big fan of of

121
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:50,220
fava beans but I can't always find

122
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:51,149
enough fava beans to do so so last time

123
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,630
I found it

124
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:58,049
nakai at the demand o AG store they had

125
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:59,969
an organic organic veg cover crop that

126
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,770
we did last year and that works pretty

127
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:04,949
good I was pretty nice it had it had

128
00:07:01,769 --> 00:07:09,740
follow beans bush beans I think some

129
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:12,810
barley handful of different different

130
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,780
grasses nitrogen producing we plan also

131
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:17,780
around not in the beds but all around

132
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:21,719
the beds on the outside

133
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:24,478
clover nitrogen-fixing clover so that's

134
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,669
that's really it takes a while but if

135
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,349
you have you know freshly grated places

136
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:32,759
and and things like that it really

137
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:34,580
rebuilds the soil and takes nitrogen out

138
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:38,668
of the atmosphere out of the air and

139
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:41,550
puts it into the soil and it keeps

140
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:44,250
growing year after year nurse it along

141
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,449
and keep it expanding so that's and it's

142
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,029
nice it's kind of like working walking

143
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:51,660
on a carpet in the spring so it's pretty

144
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:53,939
cool a big fan of white clover in the

145
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,159
rows in between everything and in the

146
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:58,439
walkways in any of the open area within

147
00:07:56,158 --> 00:07:59,939
the the fence

148
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:07,740
I get bags with it throw that seed

149
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:12,418
everywhere it keeps you know honeybees

150
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:15,449
love it it keeps the dust down it's it

151
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:19,339
doesn't shoot up and you know like a

152
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:23,069
tall grass and then unleash a barrage of

153
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:24,810
thorns or this you know foxtails or you

154
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,939
know things that become a real pain in

155
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:29,459
the ass and sticking your socks and

156
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:32,038
stuff but below the soil

157
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:33,990
yeah it's pulling it's pulling nitrogen

158
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:36,479
and releasing it into the soil so it

159
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,399
will take ground like the ground freshly

160
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,930
grated ground like ground behind me and

161
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,959
it takes you know it takes some years to

162
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:48,849
do it but it'll rebuild that soil

163
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:51,509
and and bring it back up to a good soil

164
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:54,460
that has you know a top soil so it's

165
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:56,639
yeah it's a pretty awesome plant for

166
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,639
that

167
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:03,009
I've done some teas but I was doing it

168
00:09:00,938 --> 00:09:05,548
wrong so I kind of gave up on the tea

169
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:08,318
and now this year we're just starting

170
00:09:05,548 --> 00:09:10,328
use them use the instruments to measure

171
00:09:08,318 --> 00:09:12,009
to know what I'm actually working with

172
00:09:10,328 --> 00:09:14,708
know if I'm doing it right if I've

173
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:17,528
actually got a live proper amount of

174
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:19,778
microbes ready to ready to go or if I'm

175
00:09:17,528 --> 00:09:24,188
just dumping a dead liquid out on my

176
00:09:19,778 --> 00:09:26,678
Vice stuff that's you know not knowing

177
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:29,409
that that makes it pretty tough and you

178
00:09:26,678 --> 00:09:32,588
can't really afford to have to be

179
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:35,558
pouring out a dud you know material and

180
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:37,360
then and then some pasture or microbe is

181
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:39,838
taking over while you're while you're

182
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,839
sleeping at the wheel

183
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:57,269
