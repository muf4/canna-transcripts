1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:12,029
[Music]

2
00:00:12,048 --> 00:00:22,070
so what is losing losing men started

3
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:26,269
as a plant that translates so if I'm a

4
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:28,730
slow death it just leads to death what

5
00:00:26,269 --> 00:00:33,969
kind of joy can there be so how about we

6
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:38,539
don't lead to that how do we start I

7
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:41,659
would say there's one more step we got

8
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:44,009
to teach people the difference between a

9
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:46,019
dirt which is dead

10
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:50,808
you can play and die on my plan there

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:54,320
too yeah it's great to get dirty but

12
00:00:50,808 --> 00:00:56,698
it's not growing yeah let's go get dirty

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:06,180
but then come back and go sir

14
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:09,420
and to do that what do you I'm gonna

15
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,820
make it even more simple what crap

16
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:22,469
well 95% of them all pretty much like

17
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:27,030
the same thing yep so now up to a

18
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:28,739
one-to-one meeting and that's that's

19
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,799
called counting and most people don't

20
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:35,629
realize that scientific speech is like 2

21
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:41,728
to 1 it's just like your THC CBD ratios

22
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:43,829
1 to 2 ratio that's it well how do we

23
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:47,789
find that out and there's an expectation

24
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:56,700
that we have to go buy something to do

25
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:59,009
that yourself for free if you have time

26
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:03,299
if you have the price of a microscope

27
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:05,579
you know about $300 for that microscope

28
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,590
you learn how to use it and you can do

29
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,879
all of your own testing at that point

30
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,649
well why would I want to do all my own

31
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,669
testings why would I want to pay someone

32
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:17,310
a lot of money to take my soil sample to

33
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:21,809
tell me if it's healthy or not because

34
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:23,750
you learn a lot faster exactly what you

35
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,830
need to do is that keep things done

36
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,770
faster you don't wellfest

37
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,300
and it takes you 20 minutes what it

38
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,580
takes you 20 minutes to look through a

39
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:35,099
microscope mm-hmm why are you doing so

40
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:38,700
slowly I can literally look hey there's

41
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:41,189
some fungi right well you still know

42
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:43,739
that a representative number

43
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:49,740
but the cannabis community the normal

44
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:51,120
person who's not a true soil nurse they

45
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:54,810
literally just want to know if there's

46
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,719
this right stuff in it how can we help

47
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:01,409
the plant be more of what it wants to be

48
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:03,770
do we do anything or do we just work

49
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:06,030
with the microbes that do all the work

50
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:09,510
it's our job to put those microorganisms

51
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,909
back into that soil because it's us that

52
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:13,560
have destroyed that soil and turned it

53
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:15,210
into dirt and we got to reverse the

54
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,210
process we've got to turn that dirt back

55
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:21,650
in the soil and so if we want to do it

56
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:24,330
at human speed and you know we're very

57
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:27,390
impatient we've got to have everything's

58
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:29,760
got to get fixed yesterday and if we

59
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:32,399
want to do it that speed we're gonna

60
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:35,280
have to take it into responsibilities

61
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,439
right right we've got to be the ones who

62
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,680
come back and heal it within the time

63
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,599
span that we require mother nature will

64
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,969
get it back don't worry don't fuss but

65
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,549
she could take ten thousand years to get

66
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:49,199
it down no I don't either I would like

67
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:56,400
to stay alive I'd like my children to

68
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:59,030
stay alive I would like to just still be

69
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,930
around next year and sometimes I worry

70
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:05,819
so we've gotta put that yeah we've got

71
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,099
to put that biology back into the soil

72
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:10,079
and the sooner the better because then

73
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,759
we can start taking that elevated carbon

74
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,040
in the atmosphere and putting it back

75
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,139
into the soil from whence it came so

76
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:19,310
let's just start what can I do tomorrow

77
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:23,610
to make the changes that we have to make

78
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:26,519
me start making some mom posts for you

79
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:29,340
guys he yeah well I'd like to start with

80
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:32,609
the compost so just allowing organic

81
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:35,159
materials to break down in a beneficial

82
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,870
way yeah we we want to make certain that

83
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,760
it's selecting for the right

84
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,040
microorganisms in there they have to be

85
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,750
aerobic those are the good guys we don't

86
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,419
want to be growing diseases or problem

87
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,879
organisms we don't want to be putting

88
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:50,120
anything toxic so it's gotta stay

89
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,439
aerobic but quick question about that

90
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,158
because most people have a perspective

91
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,819
of

92
00:04:53,158 --> 00:05:01,709
who wins right who the fight that battle

93
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:05,908
between good versus bad bugs and why

94
00:05:01,709 --> 00:05:10,288
does an aerobic environment when out

95
00:05:05,908 --> 00:05:12,748
over the negative microbes for our

96
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:16,678
benefit and our plants benefit mm-hmm

97
00:05:12,749 --> 00:05:18,719
well plants are obligate aerobes they

98
00:05:16,678 --> 00:05:21,329
have to maintain aerobic conditions

99
00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:23,550
around that root system around any part

100
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:26,598
of the plant in order for that plant to

101
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:31,139
be able to perform its function of

102
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:32,699
reproducing making fruit yeah cuz what

103
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,879
do we actually eat mmm

104
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:38,429
all of that good reproductive tissue the

105
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:40,559
plants are making so we've got to make

106
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:42,838
certain that it stays aerobic and that

107
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:44,819
means having organisms that will build

108
00:05:42,838 --> 00:05:47,338
structure in your soil and that's a

109
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:49,559
major component of what microorganisms

110
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:52,110
do aerobic microorganisms do for you

111
00:05:49,559 --> 00:05:53,699
anaerobic microorganisms don't build

112
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,619
structure because they don't want to

113
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:58,528
build airways and passageways to allow

114
00:05:55,619 --> 00:06:03,779
oxygen to move into their habitat

115
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:07,499
because they thrive well back from our

116
00:06:03,778 --> 00:06:12,509
point of view yeah bad from the point of

117
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:14,579
view of producing food so we've got to

118
00:06:12,509 --> 00:06:16,829
make certain that we maintain that

119
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:18,088
habitat around the root systems of the

120
00:06:16,829 --> 00:06:21,179
plant and they both got part of the

121
00:06:18,088 --> 00:06:24,059
plant so that that plant will thrive

122
00:06:21,178 --> 00:06:28,168
we've got to convert the nutrients which

123
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:32,879
are in our soils already there 55 pounds

124
00:06:28,168 --> 00:06:35,490
worth of gypsum or lime or inorganic

125
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,429
nitrogen fertilizers or phosphate

126
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:40,889
fertilizers or sulfur fertilizers we

127
00:06:38,428 --> 00:06:43,588
don't know if I haven't put the bag of

128
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:48,209
that product on the soil how did it get

129
00:06:43,588 --> 00:06:51,059
there how did it get there all these new

130
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:53,639
trees the 42 necessary like supporting

131
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:55,740
yep or more than that actually now that

132
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,439
we newly start getting into it now

133
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,329
always always good to be more I always

134
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:03,028
love it when you go back in time and you

135
00:07:00,329 --> 00:07:06,538
look at back in the 1950s there were

136
00:07:03,028 --> 00:07:07,230
only three major nutrients that if you

137
00:07:06,538 --> 00:07:09,180
put in

138
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,530
Aion you were gonna be just fine that's

139
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,199
all you had to worry about and then it

140
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:14,819
got to be a couple more and then a next

141
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,069
thing you knew I was eight essential

142
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:20,339
nutrients and then it was 12 and it was

143
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:22,649
18 and then it was 24 and then it was

144
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:24,569
30-something and you know now if you

145
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:27,719
talk to certain plant people they're

146
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:29,969
gonna be saying it's 42 I like that I

147
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:40,800
like a number 42 because it's the answer

148
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:43,470
to the universe what's your what do you

149
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,040
think the best kind of clay to grow

150
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:49,860
cannabis to use to feed the microbes

151
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,810
best microbial food for cannabis and can

152
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,410
you talk about montmorillonite clay or

153
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:57,569
like the best kind of clay for I don't

154
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:59,790
think there's really a best kind you

155
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:01,529
just have to recognize what kind of clay

156
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,770
you've got what's your sand with your

157
00:08:01,529 --> 00:08:07,979
silt what's your clay remember clay is a

158
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:10,979
mineral differentiation just like sand

159
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:26,490
and silt okay so clay does not grow

160
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:28,590
anything so yeah not really you just

161
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,810
have to understand why is that clay red

162
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:34,799
and it's telling you about past history

163
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:37,950
the reason why clay is red as it went

164
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:41,098
anaerobic at one time and under

165
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:43,830
anaerobic conditions your iron is going

166
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:47,009
to be converted into a highly reduced

167
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:50,280
form when oxygen comes back into that

168
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:54,600
system then as that highly reduced iron

169
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:59,100
is oxidized it turns into a completely

170
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,360
not a plant usable form of iron so of

171
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,330
course and we think that this is

172
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,470
horrible clay this is really bad get

173
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:10,050
some iron like I'm referring to

174
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,509
montmorillonite clay specifically that

175
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:16,259
has if you look at the MSDS breakdown it

176
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:18,990
has every trace mineral on it like gold

177
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:19,450
cadmium lead arsenic and everything that

178
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,539
can think

179
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:26,080
and you know but we don't even know

180
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:29,319
everything basically but I mean it's

181
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,620
it's I see the difference in my plants

182
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,879
when I use it and it's it's I think it's

183
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:35,889
really good stuff because you can eat a

184
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:38,529
tooth livestock feed and I don't know

185
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:43,210
I'm really curious about using my

186
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:47,589
mineral clay and really when you look at

187
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:49,840
any soil which you know the mineral

188
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:54,580
component in any soil is gonna be the

189
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:57,129
sand to seal the Clay's only three it's

190
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,629
all size fractions and that's all we're

191
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:01,090
really talking about when we're dealing

192
00:09:58,629 --> 00:10:05,070
with the difference between clay and

193
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:05,070
silt what's helping your plants grow

194
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:13,690
really do man they how do the microbes

195
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:15,879
break down clay I love this answer

196
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,380
they have enzymes that they make and

197
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:20,860
they pull out of the crystalline

198
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:22,360
structure of that clay the nutrients and

199
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:30,250
it's my six-year-old in a way that would

200
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:32,710
make him so the bacteria and fungi at

201
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,779
the direction of the plant are gonna do

202
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:37,840
exactly yeah they're told what to do and

203
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:40,000
golly they go do it because the plant is

204
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,340
giving them cakes and cookies in order

205
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,190
to do the work that the plant requires

206
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,019
because the plant can't move yeah and

207
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,090
it's kind of just like your mom you know

208
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:51,189
luring you to clean your bedroom she

209
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,410
offers you cakes and cookies and then

210
00:10:51,190 --> 00:11:00,130
you go ahead and do that work because it

211
00:10:53,409 --> 00:11:01,959
makes the name the clone originator I'm

212
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:05,189
trying not to give the name away for all

213
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:08,350
these indoor grows we call them mothers

214
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:10,710
so literally the mothers are

215
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:14,050
communicating into the soil ecosystem

216
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:17,050
what they need yep and when they don't

217
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:20,740
need it yep they don't eat it so you

218
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:22,899
don't have to add whatever mineral the

219
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,779
store says you have to add yeah because

220
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:28,750
you don't need to you know mom is

221
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:31,480
already taking care of herself so you

222
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:33,340
know let her right now we gotta stop

223
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,100
interfering and pretending like we

224
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,750
no better right yeah so we we go in

225
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,370
there and we interfere with all this

226
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,320
stuff and all it does is destroy the

227
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,620
biology that would have done the work

228
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:49,750
for us if we had just let things go the

229
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:51,519
way they're supposed to not amazing it's

230
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,029
because we don't understand what we're

231
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,389
doing

232
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:58,839
why did the Green Revolution happen it

233
00:11:55,389 --> 00:12:00,189
wasn't really because we needed to be

234
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,769
put in those nutrients into the soil

235
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:06,400
it's because we had piles and piles of

236
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:08,529
leftover munitions from war from World

237
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:12,009
War one and then World War two even

238
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:16,990
worse because we bombed Hiroshima knows

239
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:19,870
a lot about the byproducts of war mm-hmm

240
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,810
and we're still picking up the pieces -

241
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,529
yeah but instead of picking up the

242
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:28,599
pieces and ending up with a bunch of

243
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:29,980
poisons and nitrates you you said

244
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,509
ammonium nitrate and nobody even

245
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:33,730
flinched but that's the same stuff

246
00:12:31,509 --> 00:12:35,500
that'll blow up a building right well

247
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,110
you have to have the proper combination

248
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:52,750
of nitrate and ammonium but I can have a

249
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:53,919
truck full of soil I love it mass

250
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:57,370
prosperity

251
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:59,949
I love selfish farmer questions because

252
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:03,250
farmers share can you can you talk about

253
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:05,770
the the dance between the the two most

254
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:08,710
common polymers in nature the cellulose

255
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:10,649
and the chitin how can we intentionally

256
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:13,930
produce large amounts of chitin ace to

257
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:16,840
use as a pest deterrent and activate the

258
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:19,989
pest deterrent abilities of plants the

259
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:23,290
best way you know do I need to add all

260
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:26,680
that to my soil it's growing there all

261
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:30,809
by itself so why would I get anything to

262
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:35,079
it except for the required organics and

263
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:37,269
microbes that access everything and when

264
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,009
you think about the plant is going to be

265
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:41,590
putting out cakes and cookies to get

266
00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:45,100
those bacteria or fungi to do the

267
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:47,850
decomposition of the exoskeletons of the

268
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,850
dead insect

269
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:55,370
structural materials cellulose in the

270
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:57,800
plant material that's why most people

271
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:02,328
think they need to add it because we're

272
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:06,559
talking about full-blown full beautiful

273
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:06,919
organic true holistic growing mm-hmm

274
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,778
okay

275
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:13,789
a lot of people need to add things

276
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:17,809
because they're growing in a pot in a

277
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:19,939
basement at which point of course

278
00:14:17,809 --> 00:14:22,458
there's nothing for the one worm or

279
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:25,009
whatever to eat because it's not a

280
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:27,500
complete ecosystem you're lacking a

281
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:30,230
whole bunch of the microorganisms to

282
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,539
help that earthworm stay alive and like

283
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:35,778
you explained earlier when you send your

284
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:37,969
soil in to be tested gosh this is the

285
00:14:35,778 --> 00:14:43,629
misnomer right yeah and they come back

286
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:43,629
and say look at all this horrible stuff

287
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:49,838
or they say you don't have an adequate

288
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:52,850
amount of the soluble inorganic

289
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:55,639
nutrients hmm so you're gonna have to

290
00:14:52,850 --> 00:15:02,629
put more in there translates into plant

291
00:14:55,639 --> 00:15:02,959
accessible mm-hmm plants have access to

292
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:05,600
it

293
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,578
it's microorganisms are gonna do the

294
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,850
conversion of that material from plant

295
00:15:07,578 --> 00:15:13,879
not available into plant available on

296
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:18,139
whose terms on the plants terms the

297
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:22,338
plant is getting what it wants already

298
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:27,198
there we go your plant tells the soil

299
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:29,480
food web what it needs and statement all

300
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:32,000
we as human beings have to do is make

301
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:34,938
certain the full diversity of all the

302
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,589
organisms are present in there the

303
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:40,849
bacteria the fungi the protozoa the

304
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:44,839
nematodes microbiomes earthworms spiders

305
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:46,909
voters voles choose insects don't have

306
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:49,759
dead insects you don't have chitin so

307
00:15:46,909 --> 00:15:52,578
the insects everything now this is the

308
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,560
fear well then how the hell are my

309
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:56,958
plants gonna grow if all these other

310
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:59,489
things are in my garden and I'd like you

311
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:06,359
to explain cuz I'm a California

312
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:06,360
grower mm-hmm and I grow plants mm-hmm I

313
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:13,240
didn't with all my background I didn't

314
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:16,179
know the simple truth of the reason

315
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,879
ground squirrels and Gophers will not

316
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:21,969
eat your plants right how many of us

317
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,620
wrap our root balls in wire because

318
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,149
we're trying to protect them we're doing

319
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,078
our best to protect them we don't

320
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:31,389
understand but all that those Gophers

321
00:16:29,078 --> 00:16:34,208
the voles the shoes the things that eat

322
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:36,060
your root systems they're there because

323
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:40,388
mother nature told them to go there and

324
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:43,359
make certain that they build structure

325
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:45,459
in the soil pathways for the bacteria in

326
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,709
the fungi protozoa nematodes to get into

327
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:50,258
that soil so they're breaking up those

328
00:16:47,708 --> 00:16:56,919
the Gophers are breaking up the

329
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:59,050
compaction well until you fix your soil

330
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:01,360
and still until you get rid of that

331
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:05,740
compaction layer and that's what these

332
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:09,909
guys are situation you and so action

333
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:12,789
layer is the kicker yeah it's a ground

334
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:16,480
squirrels hole or the mole hole or

335
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:19,019
gopher vote depends cannot support

336
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,390
itself open mm-hmm it collapses right

337
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:25,389
that tells the animal which is part of

338
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:29,320
the soil food web you don't want to live

339
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:31,540
here you've got a job move along so they

340
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:33,668
will literally turn around and not go

341
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:37,808
into your garden because it's a truly

342
00:17:33,669 --> 00:17:41,650
healthy ecosystem yep I'm not kidding

343
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:44,619
dude did I tell you look at it knows

344
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:46,630
what she's doing and it's just as human

345
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:48,369
beings that keeps screwing up because we

346
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,080
paid no attention to the information

347
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:53,408
that Mother Nature is bright and

348
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,058
sticking right in front of my face we

349
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:55,750
don't pay attention to it and we think

350
00:17:55,058 --> 00:17:57,730
we know better

351
00:17:55,750 --> 00:18:00,579
poor little mother nature she needs our

352
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:03,849
help and so we're gonna as we sing in a

353
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:06,279
redwood grove yeah that no one planted

354
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:09,219
these trees have been growing here just

355
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:12,470
fine all by themselves no inorganic

356
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:15,720
fertilizers no no

357
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:18,480
nothing where's the 55 pound bag of

358
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,000
gypsum yep and these guys are putting on

359
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,480
putting more carbon into their bodies

360
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,579
every year then any crop that you want

361
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,970
to be growing wait a very night after

362
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:32,398
talking about global warming climate

363
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:37,890
change these are called carbon sinks

364
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:39,898
yeah yeah these trees put on more carbon

365
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,788
every year that global warming have

366
00:18:39,898 --> 00:18:43,678
cleaner air blah blah blah all the

367
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:46,798
things people whined about we should

368
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,788
just let things grow mm-hmm stop tearing

369
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:52,950
them down stop no harvesting them and

370
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:55,679
turning them into especially mature

371
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:59,460
ecosystem yeah because they may take

372
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:01,470
10,000 years to truly develop yep it

373
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,470
takes a special place yeah because if

374
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:06,480
you tear down these trees and you till

375
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:09,329
the soil and you wipe out all the

376
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,120
biology it's gonna be a thousand years

377
00:19:09,329 --> 00:19:14,069
ten thousand years for you even to get

378
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:17,819
to the point where these trees could

379
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:20,339
possibly grow again so they've got to

380
00:19:17,819 --> 00:19:23,369
have all of this development of the soil

381
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:27,418
to even be able to germinate and get

382
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:30,269
established here so so when do you start

383
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:35,220
growing when do I start growing my

384
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:38,609
answer is when do I stop yeah why would

385
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:41,308
I have my garden growing mmm-hmm there's

386
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:43,709
currently no cannabis planted in it but

387
00:19:41,308 --> 00:19:45,329
there's everything else I'm building

388
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:48,329
soil every second that we're sitting

389
00:19:45,329 --> 00:19:50,939
here I usually so this is a fun one

390
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:54,349
how much compost tea I make a

391
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:59,159
five-gallon bucket of fungal rich and

392
00:19:54,349 --> 00:20:02,788
bacterial dense every week even in the

393
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:05,490
off season and I brew it outside so that

394
00:20:02,788 --> 00:20:07,288
the microbes that are grown are the

395
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,630
microbes that are thriving at that

396
00:20:07,288 --> 00:20:12,148
temperature range because that's what

397
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,130
I'm gonna put on my plants because

398
00:20:12,148 --> 00:20:15,808
they're at that temperature range it's

399
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:18,570
not that hard right it's not that

400
00:20:15,808 --> 00:20:20,038
difficult it's that's outside that's ten

401
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:26,249
gallons

402
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:30,658
of love a week you should have a pretty

403
00:20:26,249 --> 00:20:33,058
good food webbing oh it's so beautiful I

404
00:20:30,659 --> 00:20:38,159
have I have dicots

405
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:40,470
that haven't even popped split with 9 in

406
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:44,759
route 9 its roots alright very good

407
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:46,319
because the food web is feeding because

408
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,019
it hasn't really started even

409
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:52,499
photosynthesize yet so who's feeding

410
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:54,298
that plant because it's too young to

411
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:56,519
even make cakes and cookies really I

412
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:59,220
mean it is a little bit but yeah the

413
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:00,778
food web is literally saying oh we know

414
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,308
what to do with you come here you're

415
00:21:00,778 --> 00:21:04,710
gonna need some of this right and

416
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:06,868
because that little plants should be

417
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:09,419
already tuned into the below ground

418
00:21:06,868 --> 00:21:13,019
Network those Michael Raizel fungi are

419
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:14,999
already colonizing those roots and so

420
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:16,019
we're talking about three to six months

421
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:18,389
yep

422
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:21,058
so it when you have a good functioning

423
00:21:18,388 --> 00:21:23,628
food web in that soil the root systems

424
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:26,940
of that baby plants are going to be

425
00:21:23,628 --> 00:21:29,418
colonizing immediately with an hour so

426
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,889
not three to six months literally

427
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:34,979
instantaneous but we just don't see the

428
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:35,488
effects from maybe hours yep so sounds

429
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:39,929
good to me

430
00:21:35,489 --> 00:21:41,639
we want a really healthy plant right

431
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:44,249
from the very beginning so you never

432
00:21:41,638 --> 00:21:47,908
realized that it would have otherwise

433
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:50,940
been stunted and limited and unhappy and

434
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:53,669
no fertility and sick and diseased

435
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:56,700
because it's been started out right yeah

436
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:59,669
from the very beginning and you know how

437
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:04,348
much I spend on my compost tea couple

438
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:06,450
dollars I bought a twelve dollar

439
00:22:04,348 --> 00:22:08,729
I got a twelve dollar bubbler and I've

440
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,710
been using that for a long time yep and

441
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:13,710
it runs two hoses that's where one for

442
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:15,538
each bucket yep so it's you know the

443
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:17,819
electricity things so a little bit

444
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:19,700
electricity a little bit for the to

445
00:22:17,819 --> 00:22:23,939
start the materials that you put in

446
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:26,609
collecting yeah and it's your time yeah

447
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,870
and that's all it is so how much is my

448
00:22:26,608 --> 00:22:32,460
time worth

449
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't know $25 an hour here's a

450
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:39,319
question all right how much how much

451
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:42,028
does someone go and spend at the store

452
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:46,740
or you can just hang out with your

453
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:48,298
plants for an hour max and it's doing

454
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,380
good things for you to hang out with

455
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:53,759
your plants so I'd rather be outside

456
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,620
putzing around in my garden then do and

457
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,720
then go into the store and buying toxic

458
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:59,609
chemicals and then having to figure out

459
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,929
how I'm gonna spread them and do you

460
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:02,908
ever walk through a hardware store

461
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:05,130
anywhere like that and just walking near

462
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:06,299
that aisle makes your skin like you feel

463
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,730
the toxins in the air

464
00:23:06,298 --> 00:23:10,889
yep right yeah like you're like that's

465
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:13,349
not healthy yeah come here children

466
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:16,950
you're like what are they being exposed

467
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:19,428
to in my garden nothing yeah except

468
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:22,200
goodness yeah good breathable air

469
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:22,940
where's that come from let's start out

470
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,860
from that

471
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:28,580
where's good breathable healthy air come

472
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:31,288
from diagnosed well from anything that

473
00:23:28,579 --> 00:23:33,389
photosynthesizes because they're taking

474
00:23:31,288 --> 00:23:35,819
that carbon dioxide and pulling the

475
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,409
carbon off and blowing off that oxygen

476
00:23:35,819 --> 00:23:39,389
there's where a good breathable air

477
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:41,820
comes from so instead of standing in

478
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:44,159
front of like a air purifier in my

479
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:45,808
office I should maybe just have a plan

480
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,809
on my toes yeah you should have a couple

481
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:51,058
plants yeah so you know if you just have

482
00:23:48,808 --> 00:23:52,139
a couple of plants in your office that

483
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:53,730
you're taking care of and they're

484
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,770
healthy and they're happy they're gonna

485
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:58,500
provide you all the oxygen you need for

486
00:23:55,769 --> 00:24:00,000
the whole entire year and are you

487
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,609
talking about just breathable air or

488
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,669
maybe a little soul air too

489
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:08,308
well because those plants are pretty

490
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:11,820
good comfort you know they brighten your

491
00:24:08,308 --> 00:24:14,589
day they will eventually flower and well

492
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:15,289
