1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:03,240
we're really excited about the s like a

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,830
fertigation system called rhythm that

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,440
we're just having installed and so that

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,699
can really just dial in some of our

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,400
systems further it's like we can

6
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,899
actually see like how dry the plant is

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,699
and what that time like okay here's when

8
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,010
I watered first this is my dry vac time

9
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:19,019
and the system will know exactly based

10
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,550
on the parameters we set in it when to

11
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,169
water it again and some other day that

12
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,429
we collect okay what's that runoff look

13
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,529
like what's the tissue analysis the

14
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:28,589
plant look like what's the soil holding

15
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:31,018
what's still inside there so we can kind

16
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:32,609
of go back in program and dial in these

17
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:34,558
strains even further so like we've

18
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:35,939
developed a regimented system where you

19
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:38,459
know we know the genetics of the strains

20
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:40,320
you know like my Saturn og is an Afghani

21
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,109
cross and so you know I want to borrow

22
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,820
that right and we can actually optimize

23
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:46,530
the system faster because we have that

24
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,480
good data set of collection we know it's

25
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,429
like okay this Afghani likes this kind

26
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:52,890
of this kind of fertilizer blend or this

27
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:54,030
little bit of soil difference and if we

28
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,469
find another strain that might have

29
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,539
another Afghani cross it's like okay

30
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,460
well we've already got a baseline for

31
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,109
that genetic so we can optimize it

32
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,780
faster by doing that but I'm really

33
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,338
excited about that you know the

34
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,930
environmental control systems like link

35
00:01:05,338 --> 00:01:08,310
4 we're working with them pretty closely

36
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,689
so I'm really excited with kind of the

37
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,189
data collection and now we've we've

38
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:13,919
hooked up a lot of those servers and

39
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:15,569
sensors to a sequel server database and

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,070
we can actually pull all the data out of

41
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:18,599
that and mash it up with like these data

42
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:23,819
visualization software you know I think

43
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:26,188
the the thrust of it is data is that

44
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:28,438
collecting more and more data about how

45
00:01:26,188 --> 00:01:30,149
much what are they using and so forth

46
00:01:28,438 --> 00:01:33,328
and really getting it down to a very

47
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:35,790
fine art you know it's really when you

48
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:38,069
get the most production right the

49
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,939
cleanest production also and it's it's

50
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:40,938
repeatability to
