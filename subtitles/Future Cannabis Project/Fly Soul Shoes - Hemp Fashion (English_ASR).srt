Newport I knew Peter cannabis yeah do

20
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:33,590
you know when I moved out to California

21
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:40,879
to pursue and get back in this industry

22
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:43,640
I moved into a tent real life is word

23
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:53,379
Freudian room in that house before I can

24
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:56,599
afford and you know humility is

25
00:01:53,379 --> 00:02:05,530
undervalued the option who's it to be

26
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:05,530
able to I am grateful to God I

27
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:11,618
appreciate

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:23,610
I'm sorry so we're sitting at a table of

29
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:27,060
these shoes yeah so let's talk about

30
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:29,310
these four sections my sole shoes well

31
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:34,620
you know let's talk about the Industrial

32
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:35,250
Revolution yes yes great shoes are just

33
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,739
a start

34
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,329
I chose shoe because most people are

35
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,170
going to feel it or not you know I'll

36
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:42,170
make you a special shoe

37
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,328
so these are the first hand-woven hemp

38
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:52,318
shoe in North America so the ones you

39
00:02:51,329 --> 00:02:54,480
have in front of you are

40
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,888
I made have like a canvas but the one

41
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,818
that I'm wearing this is actually very

42
00:02:55,889 --> 00:03:01,590
first prototype you can see is a

43
00:02:58,818 --> 00:03:03,810
hand-stitched and the unique thing about

44
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:07,109
the shoe is that every single pair is

45
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:12,209
one of them so the pattern will not line

46
00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:15,829
up on a shoe and so I designed them like

47
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:20,539
that you've been rocking these sensor

48
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:24,180
well you know I mean you don't change

49
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:25,858
yeah it's kind of cool when you rate

50
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,909
your own shoes why would you wear

51
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:30,930
something else and there you know it's

52
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,250
not just about the shoes

53
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,650
it's about this industrial have

54
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,469
revolution that you are very much on the

55
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:40,379
forefront of like that's well you know

56
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:44,669
is this this got a start way back in the

57
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:47,969
day and can right we had a huge

58
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:50,459
marijuana legalization movement and

59
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:52,560
heavily as a human that had its abstract

60
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,810
nuts and it failed for several different

61
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,219
reasons the reason that I believe the

62
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,979
film is because the culture didn't

63
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:02,639
accept it as really a better replacement

64
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:05,448
many many textile rings basically

65
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:08,219
everything says a leather on your body

66
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:12,109
better more durable antimicrobial

67
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:15,329
antifungal hypoallergenic out a hip and

68
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:16,918
waterproof so and you think it's the

69
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:19,079
culture that didn't accept it or do you

70
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,839
think it's the powers-that-be that stood

71
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,040
to lose

72
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,168
so much they didn't allow the

73
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,840
infrastructure to really let me let me

74
00:04:23,168 --> 00:04:28,448
answer that directly yeah culture

75
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,060
dictates everything we will if what we

76
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:32,889
will not accept we have to stand up

77
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,800
together and they could change it has

78
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:37,689
one right the problem and I see in the

79
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,829
country right now especially is that we

80
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:43,750
are so bifurcated we are so divisive

81
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:46,240
from our political stance let's come

82
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,040
together on a plan that you know hemp

83
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,220
industrial has hemp right is the gift

84
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,010
from God and it remediates the soil it

85
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:56,250
removes more co2 than a tree it produces

86
00:04:54,009 --> 00:04:59,409
better fiber better paper our

87
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,810
Constitution is written on it so if you

88
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:11,740
can't get behind that heck that's

89
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:14,530
anti-american not free to grow hemp

90
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,600
though interesting not in our state you

91
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:19,168
know and we come from Texas we hail from

92
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,210
the great state of Texas as you know and

93
00:05:19,168 --> 00:05:25,060
we are still not able to grow our own

94
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:27,930
hemp and what we're really nervous about

95
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:34,030
is that industrial hemp will push out

96
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:37,209
the medical and the CVD well I

97
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:39,519
this past 18 months or past year 2019 I

98
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:42,959
traveled to 68 cities and 19 countries

99
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:46,478
building a manifest of each individual

100
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:48,189
industrial or hemp CBD THC minor

101
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,899
cannabinoid markets and where the

102
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:52,329
culture and regulations and everything

103
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:53,560
was gonna be this is gonna shock you and

104
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:55,659
probably a lot of people that are

105
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,379
watching a podcast but the future of

106
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:02,590
cultivation of of hemp for a refined

107
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:04,750
cannabinoid production will in my

108
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:07,439
opinion cease to exist in the United

109
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:10,959
States in the next four years the

110
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,490
economic advantages of Labor rates that

111
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,549
are achievable in countries like

112
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:18,970
Colombia or Mexico for two examples in

113
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,800
the Western Hemisphere simply will

114
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,360
follow the commoditization that's taking

115
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,410
place in many agricultural products such

116
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,240
as fresh-cut flowers or sugarcane we

117
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,409
don't go into this country because the

118
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,430
difference between the longest and

119
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:34,500
shortest day in Colombia is 41 minutes

120
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,910
so the northern hemisphere simply can't

121
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,889
compete with that

122
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:41,130
many psycho ability is that for the

123
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:44,509
moral crops of hemp a year out door of

124
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:48,180
three maybe four to five

125
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:51,538
Negroes relentlessly and if you find it

126
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,000
relentless plan God thank God and if

127
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:55,800
with a climate control it and the

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,990
institutional type of capital that's

129
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,300
been invested in these countries because

130
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,379
they already recognize that it's only

131
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,400
going to go one way

132
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:07,168
you got a forecast for CBD isolates and

133
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,579
isolated molecule to be trading at a

134
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:11,069
hundred dollars a kilo in the future

135
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:14,609
just like sugar I mean you guys you got

136
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:16,709
to think about that three years ago we

137
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,300
were selling at eighteen five twelve

138
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:20,069
five that next year sixty five hundred

139
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,639
last year I'm selling it for fifteen

140
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:27,180
hundred bucks right now so just see BCD

141
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:29,728
Iceland and so industrials on the future

142
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:33,500
of the industry in the United States

143
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:36,300
is short-lived you and you turn on

144
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,269
institutions like Mexico which already

145
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,460
have you know agricultural producers

146
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:44,159
with 20 straight kilometers of

147
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,659
established greenhouse they can just

148
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,510
take okay well we'll call her out this

149
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:51,330
mile

150
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:54,180
amazing I mean I hear that and I totally

151
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:55,680
I see that but what what say you about

152
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:59,030
the smokeable hemp

153
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:03,019
that's really a that is a concern that

154
00:07:59,029 --> 00:08:05,609
the smokeable hemp flour will be banned

155
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:08,129
hence you know kind of paving the way to

156
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:11,158
ban any smokeable flour of any sort in

157
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:12,930
Texas it's very strange and this is kind

158
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:17,038
of a land that we're living in so you

159
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:19,590
know the the the reason that the United

160
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,538
States has really lost this battle is

161
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:23,219
because we are so bifurcated our state

162
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:24,629
laws that say you know I'm going to do

163
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,949
this and I'm gonna do that in Texas

164
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:30,180
unfortunately is suffering from that

165
00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:33,060
exact consequence when we launched the

166
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,740
state system in Washington they were bro

167
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:39,500
I mean we literally set up the track and

168
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,500
trace office in the welc be and so

169
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,470
unless Texas they shouldn't ban that

170
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:46,210
because there's

171
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:50,410
medicinal purposes and actually

172
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:52,960
smokeable hemp is probably the only sub

173
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:55,240
facet of the industry that will survive

174
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:58,300
in the United States because the

175
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,620
importation of hemp flour for smoking

176
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:01,209
purpose that will be refined to that

177
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,980
nature will not come from those

178
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:04,720
importing they'll get a refine into an

179
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:07,659
isolated or distillate or you know

180
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,610
easily ship container so right there's

181
00:09:07,659 --> 00:09:13,839
something to be said for you know local

182
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:16,120
flower artisan flower yes you know their

183
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,649
marijuana flower that we love so much

184
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,299
you know because you put yourself into

185
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:26,439
growing the plant yeah it really is a

186
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:28,779
reflection of how much you can't no I

187
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,370
wouldn't spray flower coming out of

188
00:09:28,779 --> 00:09:32,919
Mexican right right right like you know

189
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:35,080
right no no but you know the isolate you

190
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:37,149
know who fucking knows you cares this is

191
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,820
this is all sort of future thinking

192
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:42,279
right like this is what will what what

193
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,810
is stopping that from becoming that

194
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:46,750
reality like are there still any staff

195
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:50,409
gaps now that are like hurting him fully

196
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:52,509
coming online industrially so industrial

197
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:54,399
hemp let's classify the two here the

198
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,870
dust real hemp production cultivation of

199
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,179
hemp for industrial purposes versus

200
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:01,720
refined canister whether it be minors or

201
00:09:58,179 --> 00:10:04,719
CBD industrial hemp will survive the

202
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:08,500
United States but the United States is

203
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,570
very far behind in building the key

204
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,330
linchpin which is the production or

205
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:15,280
never extraction I'm sorry the

206
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:17,710
processing facilities to make it into

207
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,069
fibers to make it into you know usable

208
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:24,790
textiles that we can develop and and and

209
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:27,520
replace cotton or replace infrastructure

210
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:30,480
it's a new yeah and and so there's a

211
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:34,240
couple different really forward-thinking

212
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,250
states that are taking like industrial

213
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,409
waste sites and they're planting

214
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:42,879
hairline and that's perfect for you know

215
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:45,209
put on your body instilling toxic waste

216
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:45,210
yeah

217
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,759
planet at Fukushima it takes radiation

218
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:53,979
of the ground Wow this is the best this

219
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,709
is here to save our world I'm telling

220
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:58,329
you this is it's here to free the people

221
00:10:55,708 --> 00:11:00,399
it's here to reverse this negative

222
00:10:58,328 --> 00:11:02,498
paradigm that we've been demonizing

223
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,958
plant-based medicines right it's here to

224
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:08,189
elevate our consciousness you know free

225
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:10,628
us from PTSD remove information our body

226
00:11:08,188 --> 00:11:19,719
help us with our neurological diseases

227
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:24,879
the depriving of the endocannabinoid

228
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:27,430
States government's have done yeah it's

229
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:30,909
like ripped from think about it in the

230
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:33,458
United States the corporate agenda to

231
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:35,139
feed us food that makes us sick treat us

232
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:38,349
with a few of those ailments not cure

233
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:40,180
them feed us more medicines to treat the

234
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,300
symptoms of those medicines and

235
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:45,789
eventually we rot away and die you know

236
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:47,109
unless you're conscious of that make

237
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:48,610
your own choices

238
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,629
and that's what I want to inspire with

239
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:54,938
these shoes we are here to inspire the

240
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:57,250
embrace people to embrace industrialized

241
00:11:54,938 --> 00:11:59,438
Hamady and revolutions coming your style

242
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,549
through comfort yes through a lifestyle

243
00:11:59,438 --> 00:12:03,429
brand that's going to move into some

244
00:12:00,549 --> 00:12:08,078
other categories of niche that that are

245
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:09,729
like you know accent pieces yes make

246
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:11,859
sense it does it makes perfect sense

247
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,308
there are accent pieces and they're more

248
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,808
than that I mean they're they're true

249
00:12:14,308 --> 00:12:19,299
true pieces of self-expression

250
00:12:16,808 --> 00:12:22,448
it's not just oh I'm loud I'm flashy

251
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:26,318
Here I am it's also you know that that I

252
00:12:22,448 --> 00:12:29,049
care I've made a commitment to you know

253
00:12:26,318 --> 00:12:31,360
this planet to making one plant based

254
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:33,099
decision right because even if you buy

255
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,889
them because you think they're fly as I

256
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,860
love them you're making that decision to

257
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:41,350
give the consumers a choice of four

258
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,438
charities from the Amazon to the ocean

259
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:46,689
to the United States of choices they can

260
00:12:44,438 --> 00:12:48,879
donate a portion of each sale to Wow

261
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:50,620
they've mail is back the postcard tell

262
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,240
us what you want so real quick oh we

263
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,789
skipped over it but what is the

264
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,330
Instagram handle fly soul shoes

265
00:12:54,789 --> 00:13:00,449
soul like your soul you gotta gotta have

266
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:07,930
a little fly soul decayed off you know

267
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:11,460
so not sol ESO shoes so back to the the

268
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:13,989
endocannabinoid system and the

269
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,690
deficiencies I'm seeing some studies

270
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:19,750
that are just coming out on migraines

271
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:23,220
ADHD things of this letters Alzheimer's

272
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:25,779
there now there now pointing to

273
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:46,950
endocannabinoid deficiencies as the

274
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:50,139
premise of these issues fun fun fact is

275
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:51,700
CBD or the cannabinoids themselves your

276
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:55,210
endocannabinoid system but the CBD

277
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,650
specifically is I believe the only thing

278
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,690
we found that can actually go in and

279
00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:01,360
remove the plaque from the brain that

280
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:04,720
leads to Alzheimer's so getting back to

281
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,500
what a miracle it actually is this plant

282
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,509
is fucking amazing

283
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,210
yeah I mean it does so much for so many

284
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:13,179
people there's over a five percent

285
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:15,700
variance in its DNA content from plant

286
00:14:13,179 --> 00:14:17,289
that is a broad range there's like a not

287
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,759
there's like a point three percent or

288
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:21,009
less darienne's between you and a

289
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,590
chimpanzee think about that for a minute

290
00:14:21,009 --> 00:14:27,009
think about how long it's been around

291
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:33,790
genetically you know modified itself

292
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:35,950
yeah hmm that's why you know plant the

293
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:37,299
same genetic at sea level versus

294
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,340
eighteen hundred meters you could have a

295
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:42,309
completely different every microclimate

296
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:43,930
come out differently you know you can't

297
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:45,849
take genetics from Canada and plant in

298
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:47,679
Jamaica they think you can though a lot

299
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,490
of people fucking yeah well I've ruined

300
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:51,459
Jamaica

301
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,529
you just have to making gold let's talk

302
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,600
about that we were all in Jamaica yeah

303
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:57,068
we're you and Jamaica yeah

304
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,810
there's a sneaky little guy though you

305
00:14:57,068 --> 00:14:59,379
gotta yeah I don't know where to find

306
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:02,948
them

307
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:04,509
yeah I know where to find them we're not

308
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:06,879
gonna let you go so let's talk about

309
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:09,310
Jamaica and what's happening there and

310
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:11,078
all of the new strains cropping up and

311
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:14,258
Canadian money flowing in and what the

312
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:17,500
fuck's going on well in 2015 bio track

313
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:19,120
where I was the CIO CFO of designed and

314
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,919
implemented the track and trace for the

315
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,889
University of West Indies and university

316
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:25,769
technology in Kingston and we passed and

317
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:28,209
wrote the law and Minister Paul well to

318
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:31,299
legalize the possession of cannabis on

319
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:34,599
the island up to two ounces we thought

320
00:15:31,299 --> 00:15:37,439
they were on the fast track to becoming

321
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:43,569
a very successful country at that point

322
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:45,639
but Jamaica has a cultural hurdle to get

323
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:48,879
over by which there's a lot of greed in

324
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,860
there everybody wants it and the pride

325
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:55,328
of Jamaica has cost them the Opera is

326
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:57,190
you tender and really be because the

327
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:58,689
branding of Jamaica was you know come to

328
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:08,319
Jamaica get on our beaches it was

329
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:25,920
branded notion we went when we were

330
00:16:08,318 --> 00:16:25,919
there once we welcome

331
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:35,470
I saw something slide down the slide

332
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,350
that I

333
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:41,230
oh yeah you know put your making hats on

334
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:43,509
still regulated their program to a

335
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,159
medical so in other words severe

336
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:46,990
tourists you have to go into a place and

337
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:50,469
fly to a doctor's say right you know

338
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:52,720
just forget I did my medical care ok

339
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:55,449
with it yeah of course Leo has her

340
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,410
medical card in Jamaica but um you know

341
00:16:55,448 --> 00:17:02,219
the industry on over the past decade a

342
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:06,049
great friend of mine dr. Darryl Hudson

343
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:10,470
there's a world-renowned

344
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:13,230
PhD in this industry in Canada outside

345
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:15,959
of Toronto has been studying the

346
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:19,019
cannabinoid contents and THC levels of

347
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:22,680
Jamaican candidates for over a decade in

348
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:25,500
Jamaica they have a wellness retreat

349
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:41,220
in Jamaica as well psychedelic research

350
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:41,880
ayahuasca available and so over the past

351
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,339
decade

352
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,200
Jemaine Gould had a certain THC and

353
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:49,649
you'd find you you know in various areas

354
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,960
of that people have been introducing CBD

355
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,910
and hemp into the island and not

356
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,829
understanding and this is part of a

357
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:59,759
classic example of Jamaican arrogance

358
00:17:55,829 --> 00:18:02,639
that is costing them everything is that

359
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:05,400
they've been smuggling it in planting it

360
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,940
and not pulling the mails and it's been

361
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,610
pollinating the entire island and so

362
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,890
there used to be no CBD on Jamaica no

363
00:18:11,609 --> 00:18:17,939
CBD in there strands now it's a one run

364
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:22,259
off everywhere and as our lambs breath

365
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:24,570
went I mean is that what basically yeah

366
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:26,309
I think I mean it just diluted diluted

367
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:29,789
alluded to the you're on an island right

368
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:30,929
got it you know unless you're going

369
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:33,329
through your field and pulling your

370
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:35,400
nails right your that's not everybody

371
00:18:33,329 --> 00:18:37,349
right that's not their way of I mean

372
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,000
their will but that was it so when we

373
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:45,299
were in Canada in Jamaica I don't know

374
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:51,440
if one geneticist panel of dr. Darryl

375
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:51,440
Hudson was on the panel said you know

376
00:18:51,859 --> 00:19:00,839
and it was almost like very few yeah you

377
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:06,000
know after all these conferences that

378
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:09,209
was best because he came up he said

379
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:14,099
Jamaica is about combining all the we've

380
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:15,590
mastered and that's shipping out and he

381
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:18,490
doesn't understand

382
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:20,839
that's not what the industry is about

383
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:24,048
it's not about smashing your weed

384
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:26,628
together it's about refining our art of

385
00:19:24,048 --> 00:19:29,058
what we can create to help people it's

386
00:19:26,628 --> 00:19:31,878
not really about getting high

387
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:34,128
the secret is if you know everybody

388
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:36,109
likes this phone get high I love it but

389
00:19:34,128 --> 00:19:38,689
it's really about what we can do to

390
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:44,808
change the planet and and help humanity

391
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:48,798
become this is a gateway drug to health

392
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:51,109
and happiness 100% because you can't not

393
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:53,058
think about the other decisions that you

394
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:55,699
make on a daily basis when you're stress

395
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:57,618
all those levels down and you're in

396
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,869
communion with a plant you start

397
00:19:57,618 --> 00:20:02,509
thinking about things that are real well

398
00:19:59,868 --> 00:20:04,999
literally aids with homeostasis right it

399
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:07,069
levels out every system in your body and

400
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:09,169
that I mean is a huge but even at a

401
00:20:07,069 --> 00:20:10,178
societal level you see what we're doing

402
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:12,528
right now

403
00:20:10,179 --> 00:20:15,559
have you ever super like you know

404
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:23,480
anybody like don't go fight Yeah right

405
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:27,288
right more you know you share kindness

406
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:30,819
you know you express ideas you know in

407
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:35,058
vulnerabilities you know in a space that

408
00:20:30,819 --> 00:20:36,349
we you know oh my god this is life this

409
00:20:35,058 --> 00:20:39,158
is being recorded

410
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:41,689
you know it's hardcore recorded and

411
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:42,919
we're doing something big with this

412
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:46,548
conversation right now

413
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:49,070
but yet I don't feel encumbered by you

414
00:20:46,548 --> 00:20:51,888
know like fears of like looking like an

415
00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:54,439
idiot with you guys you know because

416
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:56,599
we've shared this button together you

417
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,369
know so I encourage people to smoke on

418
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:00,168
the street you guys it yeah because I

419
00:20:58,368 --> 00:21:02,470
want people to smell it I want people to

420
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:05,869
be familiar with their kids so

421
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:07,759
California now I'm you might already be

422
00:21:05,868 --> 00:21:09,558
aware of this but very recently there's

423
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:11,269
only five if you have a doctor's

424
00:21:09,558 --> 00:21:13,730
recommendation there's only five places

425
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:17,359
you can't smoke in the state of

426
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:18,740
California in public and it's I mean you

427
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,019
got to look at the pot brothers a lot

428
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:30,609
yeah

429
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:33,009
within like the best the but yeah

430
00:21:30,609 --> 00:21:34,599
operating a boat is one of the places in

431
00:21:33,009 --> 00:21:38,379
public that you can't smoke within

432
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:41,619
operating a boat yeah in a vehicle that

433
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:52,390
is operating and within so many feet of

434
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:55,299
a school and there's two others I would

435
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:56,980
use it but that's why I really have made

436
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:59,139
more of a transition away from the

437
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:02,529
regulated THC market here in California

438
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:05,380
and letting the dust settle I mean you

439
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:07,869
know I'm gonna give you some truth right

440
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,160
now the regulated market is surviving

441
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:11,799
because they're participating in both

442
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,259
sides and you know 80 percent of the

443
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:18,250
legal market in California is black

444
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:20,259
market probably yeah and no no in the

445
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,359
legal dispensary market yeah that is a

446
00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:23,799
chain of custody which only legal

447
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:27,129
product tested product makes I did too

448
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:30,359
they're talking about are more robust

449
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:32,710
even existing in LA black market

450
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:35,349
dispensary right that they are selling

451
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:37,600
their access products they're producing

452
00:22:35,349 --> 00:22:39,609
of their own facilities labeled in and

453
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:42,429
who just put it in the market and you

454
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:44,859
know listen can't really blame us to be

455
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:47,140
honest with you because not the taxation

456
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:51,659
system the state of California you know

457
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:55,870
I remember I was at in 2015 the first

458
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:58,150
Department of Taxation hearing on how to

459
00:22:55,869 --> 00:23:00,609
design the track and trade system at

460
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:03,100
that point you know we try to give the

461
00:23:00,609 --> 00:23:05,559
state an idea of listen you can't fort

462
00:23:03,099 --> 00:23:07,419
the industry you have to give taxation

463
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:10,450
at various levels we had reconstructed

464
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,650
the taxation code for Washington because

465
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,799
they had learned this lesson alright and

466
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:16,570
you felt they were on board but as well

467
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:18,789
you know this was early this is 2015 so

468
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:22,359
right by the time it really got handed

469
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:25,599
down so many more influencers had come

470
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,859
in to try different techniques to really

471
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:28,000
get the state what they did is really

472
00:23:26,859 --> 00:23:30,609
screwed themselves because

473
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,160
they were to actually provide the

474
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:36,669
industry especially in the beginning a

475
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:39,880
little less of a taxation or actually a

476
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:41,430
significantly less taxation and tax in a

477
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,320
different model associated with

478
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:48,360
production at various lifecycle changes

479
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:51,460
of the change of custody they would have

480
00:23:48,359 --> 00:23:54,029
made a lot more money instead they have

481
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:57,880
made it literally or nearly impossible

482
00:23:54,029 --> 00:24:00,759
and especially in LA is a tragic example

483
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,500
to make money in an illegal market it's

484
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:05,670
just you know why would I buy an eighth

485
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:12,569
of cannabis at $75 when I can go next

486
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:12,570
maps and for 25 1992 pricing yes 2020

487
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:19,930
okay so walk us through the track and

488
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:24,340
trace a little bit so for those that

489
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:26,560
don't understand what's been rolled out

490
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:30,189
or what what is you know up your sleeve

491
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:33,159
when it comes to that well in order to

492
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:35,440
provide a closed-loop economic system

493
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,400
for an agriculturally tract product you

494
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,080
need to make sure that there's no

495
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,759
illegal or listen inventory coming in

496
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,199
and out of right you need to make sure

497
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:42,460
that you're not having money laundering

498
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,890
taking place you need to make sure that

499
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,799
you're not delivering this regulated

500
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:50,350
commodity to people that shouldn't get

501
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:51,519
it like children and so really know what

502
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:53,769
that means is that you need to have

503
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:56,109
unlike any other agricultural product a

504
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:59,829
track and trace down to the gram for

505
00:24:56,109 --> 00:25:02,879
cannabis so when Washington went live 37

506
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:05,379
country companies bid on the RFP for

507
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,990
track and trade software program for the

508
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:11,040
governmental regulatory system bio track

509
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:15,220
THC which is based in Fort Lauderdale

510
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:17,740
won that bid and during the

511
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,110
implementation of that we you know

512
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,720
learned a lot about you know what

513
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:25,089
taxation models were you know

514
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,610
you know how to not allow monopolization

515
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:32,289
or you know big corporate interest just

516
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:34,089
to own the whole market you know it was

517
00:25:32,289 --> 00:25:36,819
the beginning of the industry so track

518
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:39,509
and trace is literally quintessentially

519
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:43,299
important for the opening of

520
00:25:39,509 --> 00:25:45,430
international trade right so one day we

521
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:48,940
will have a federal legal system one day

522
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:50,799
we will be able to export California

523
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,779
branded cannabis because California

524
00:25:50,799 --> 00:26:04,089
branded cannabis is the best in the

525
00:25:52,779 --> 00:26:05,980
world but I'm saying this and it has a

526
00:26:04,089 --> 00:26:08,829
premium all around the world give me

527
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:12,690
give me a little insight on how it's

528
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:14,619
even traceable down to the ground so

529
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:16,090
there's a couple different techniques to

530
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:20,619
do it that are implemented right now in

531
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:22,839
the United States rfid tagging radio

532
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:25,689
frequency identification is implemented

533
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:27,129
by bio tracks largest competitor and the

534
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,049
winner of the city California contract

535
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,900
called metric and that is a company

536
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:33,460
called Fran wall decor which really

537
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,700
developed the system to track cabbage

538
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:39,220
it's really inaccurate I wrote a paper

539
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:43,470
in 2016 of 16 different ways you can

540
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,470
sneak pounds out the back door right

541
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:50,920
they bungee when so when Colorado and

542
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:54,759
Washington went live bio track when

543
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:57,460
Washington metric won Colorado and you

544
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:59,529
know it's been a learning process for

545
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:03,120
both companies since and a battle of

546
00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:03,119
who's gonna get the next state contract

547
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,840
California was a beast like no other

548
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:10,509
because it's the fifth largest economy

549
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:12,509
in the world you know sixty percent of

550
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:15,778
the cannabis in the world is grown here

551
00:27:12,509 --> 00:27:18,778
it is might be an under estimate of and

552
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:22,878
so and it's huge

553
00:27:18,778 --> 00:27:26,608
so trying to regulate an existing market

554
00:27:22,878 --> 00:27:28,408
versus something that was coming on is

555
00:27:26,608 --> 00:27:30,958
proving to be more comes from than

556
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:33,359
attract and trade system and anyone that

557
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:38,219
exists in my opinion really can handle

558
00:27:33,358 --> 00:27:40,259
but metric has an rfid tagging system

559
00:27:38,219 --> 00:27:43,469
the answer your question and you just

560
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:45,179
scan your RFID reader but in Colorado we

561
00:27:43,469 --> 00:27:47,429
saw an example of an example of just

562
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:49,019
being in a box and scan the box and

563
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:50,729
you're growing eight rooms you're not

564
00:27:49,019 --> 00:27:54,298
reporting and that's gonna happen with

565
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:57,440
the system so why why is cannabis why is

566
00:27:54,298 --> 00:28:00,209
it a necessity to track to that level

567
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:04,619
because it's a gradual one regulated

568
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:09,749
drug right so it's like I mean if we

569
00:28:04,618 --> 00:28:11,308
ditch that let's let's first off it

570
00:28:09,749 --> 00:28:17,879
enables a government that tagged

571
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:20,158
something like let's get so we if we if

572
00:28:17,878 --> 00:28:23,458
we drops down to schedule five as hemp

573
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:26,639
has what what game-changer is that do we

574
00:28:23,459 --> 00:28:29,548
now get to consume lemon extract the

575
00:28:26,638 --> 00:28:32,068
same as cannabis extract because it's no

576
00:28:29,548 --> 00:28:34,558
longer Schedule one like is that there

577
00:28:32,068 --> 00:28:38,158
is that there hook in the fish is that

578
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:40,648
Schedule one classification that's a

579
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,230
part of the book the other side of the

580
00:28:40,648 --> 00:28:44,969
book is

581
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:44,970
[Music]

582
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:01,720
so that's the reason it's not a safety

583
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:03,100
issue it's not it there's no other play

584
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,110
that's what they're good

585
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:06,579
you know safety plays a part in it you

586
00:29:05,109 --> 00:29:08,229
know if we're gonna give medicine to

587
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:09,909
people let's make sure it doesn't make

588
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:15,210
them sick I mean that makes sense right

589
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:15,210
I would like to smoke regularly tested

590
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,990
preferably outdoor but for hundreds of

591
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:25,149
years millions of people have smoked

592
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:27,880
cannabis grown in the hills by hippies

593
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:41,019
that don't wash their hands yeah without

594
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:42,870
my fact the industry when what we're

595
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:46,029
talking about earlier two thousand

596
00:29:42,869 --> 00:29:48,159
twelve two thousand when the first money

597
00:29:46,029 --> 00:29:50,200
really came in and we're starting we

598
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:54,640
started looking at this new horizon of

599
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:56,470
cannabis well you know you know pioneers

600
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,230
in the industry in Colorado like Norton

601
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:01,690
ablaze and lost audience of green

602
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,789
horizon and affordably of Mehta and

603
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:09,580
Massachusetts and they founded River

604
00:30:03,789 --> 00:30:11,379
Rock in Colorado 2009 you know these

605
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:13,449
guys were I really like the heroes of

606
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:16,210
the industry Norton was recently in the

607
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:18,640
National Geographic about a struggle

608
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:20,529
about how you know for a legal

609
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,770
standpoint they attackin to attorneys

610
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:27,548
that you know believe so heavily in

611
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:29,740
plant medicine that you know they took a

612
00:30:27,548 --> 00:30:32,470
you know everything they had to you know

613
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:35,500
really provide a legal evidence and

614
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:37,919
efficacy for undeniable fact this

615
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,720
medicine this makes you better

616
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,730
this is in Colorado Colorado in the US

617
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:45,509
and so did you know that's really what I

618
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:48,799
think that you know Colorado was really

619
00:30:45,509 --> 00:30:51,779
the really

620
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:54,869
besides in California I mean they made a

621
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:57,569
medical in 98 but Colorado bites

622
00:30:54,869 --> 00:31:00,989
beginning to track it and ready to do

623
00:30:57,569 --> 00:31:03,179
that came to a level where now we can

624
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:05,279
tax it and now we can pay the IRS income

625
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,930
tax yeah now you have a federally

626
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,119
regulated system and eventually we'll be

627
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:12,060
able to export our cannabis right and

628
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:14,129
the United States will have a THC

629
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:15,960
Revolution right now but that has to be

630
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:18,900
trackable at each point of the process

631
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,420
right raw material extract the material

632
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,070
finished product because if there's a

633
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,910
recall you need to be able to find out

634
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:25,529
where it came from

635
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:29,310
yeah I guess that's the root of it right

636
00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:31,529
yeah there's no there's a most advanced

637
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:33,210
system that I've come across after all

638
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:36,829
of the track and trade systems that I've

639
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:39,299
looked at from Switzerland sick-sick / -

640
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:41,549
you know what exists in the mind places

641
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:43,409
now is this some gold backbone

642
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:46,769
there's same guys that build QuickBooks

643
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:49,140
and and that's weak sort of - or -

644
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:51,420
they've come in with a real ERP that

645
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:55,460
gives you just a lifecycle dashboard

646
00:31:51,420 --> 00:32:02,880
where it stands through the entire life

647
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:04,829
I love your passion is it's so like it's

648
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,170
hard not to just like get fired up being

649
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:10,799
around it and like like I think you you

650
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:13,350
um you've got such a an amazing depth

651
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,480
and knowledge for this and you're fired

652
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:18,899
up about it I would love to know what is

653
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,450
sort of your future like your ideal

654
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,820
future like what does it look like for

655
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:26,309
America and this and this hemp game in

656
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:33,899
this and really the kid the cannabis you

657
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:35,369
know revolution baby well I was working

658
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,310
for that law firm until my birthday in

659
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:40,379
August and I resigned to launch the shoe

660
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:44,509

sole shoes

662
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,990
since we don't take it white man should

663
00:32:53,529 --> 00:32:58,178
be quite honest I don't serve that

664
00:32:55,990 --> 00:33:00,429
company best as the CEO or even a

665
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:01,750
c-level executive I'm best as you know

666
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:05,460

we're a team of passionate people for it

673
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:23,109
and we're gonna make that happen but I

674
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,730
accepted the role as the global

675
00:33:23,109 --> 00:33:27,669

687
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:03,670
geography in this window can can I get

688
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:22,329
some of those edibles or do I gotta

689
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:24,909
import that the woman is really the

690
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:26,378
decision-maker what women are much

691
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:29,200
better leaders than we are we just had

692
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:31,989
this guy last week you know so it's like

693
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,849
it's so obvious you know and so the

694
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:36,009
sooner we can get out of male-dominated

695
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:40,319
society the better will be my opinion

696
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:40,320
so Hillary no Bernie

697
00:34:52,920 --> 00:35:07,720
never loves that guy cannabis on

698
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:09,099

00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:46,480

I mean you know when you're in line with

752
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:45,230
though it's good for the whole and not

753
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:47,930

you know life is not about you it's

755
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:53,389
about altruism it's about loving the

756
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:53,750
common man and not expecting anything in

757
00:38:53,389 --> 00:38:57,259

when we started practicing ayahuasca and

819

practice and when you move out of the

824
00:42:22,449 --> 00:42:27,368
suitcase for 18 months and travel 25

825
00:42:25,088 --> 00:42:29,949
days a month I mean awesome people you

826
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:32,710
realize that the things that people

827
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:34,748
value like cars and like you know

828
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:36,730
possessions and even real estate

829
00:42:34,748 --> 00:42:39,098
probably don't matter it's a fallacy

830
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:40,599
even money is a fallacy my opinion it's

831
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:43,539
something that's been created by society

832
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:45,940
that really doesn't have truth what is

833
00:42:43,539 --> 00:42:47,769
now you agree that there's value is the

834
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:49,298
only reason there is value yes you know

835
00:42:47,768 --> 00:42:52,508
what the most powerful and valuable

836
00:42:49,298 --> 00:42:56,559
currency there is it's your effect on

837
00:42:52,509 --> 00:43:01,329
others with that you can change the

838
00:42:56,559 --> 00:43:04,690
world and so money is the placation of

839
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:07,200
our weakness they do have the importance

840
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:07,200
of it in life

841
00:43:08,309 --> 00:43:15,179
yeah is the vacation of our weakness

842
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:19,829
it's another shirt that's certain 13

843
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:21,599
today because you know we're talking

844
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:23,639
about veganism and we're talking about

845
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:28,559
you know how to live a more plant-based

846
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:30,960
life recently and you know we're weak

847
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:49,349
and we have to placate that by oh it's

848
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:53,280
my mom she's in a little more mom oh

849

your son he's he's an angel he's an

860
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:34,500
angel from heaven that's my assessment

861
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,420
as a Texan we're talking about the

862
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,190
cannabis industry moving to Texas and

863
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,550
hoping that it happens sooner rather

864
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,550
than later

880
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:57,500
have no practical knowledge of it so is

881
00:45:54,980 --> 00:46:00,769
it like is it is it is it as badass as

882
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:02,900
people saying well it's if it really is

883
00:46:00,769 --> 00:46:05,449
man it's waterproof so it repels things

884
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:07,700
its antifungal so it's not gonna get

885
00:46:05,449 --> 00:46:09,019
stinky its antimicrobial so it's not

886
00:46:07,699 --> 00:46:12,469
gonna have stopped growing off your feet

887
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:16,639
I found a company hand heel that is

888
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:22,750
making the soles at a hemp seed and so

889
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:22,750
I'm gonna try and make one the sole

890
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:43,369
planet hemp plant will come out

891
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:46,400
biodegradable but the future when you

892
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:52,369
wear it out you plant your shoes and a

893
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:54,260
hemp plant okay now how does how does he

894
00:46:52,369 --> 00:46:57,380
how does this how does one make rubber

895
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:59,300
from said plant so they they make a they

896
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:05,960
take the hemp seed and they take

897
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:08,000
recycled PVC tubing and they melt it

898
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:11,090
down and tada

899
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:16,159
now what the the addition of the hemp

900
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:18,530
seed is my idea how long we'll get into

901
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,000
details I got a couple I got a couple of

902
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:22,080
