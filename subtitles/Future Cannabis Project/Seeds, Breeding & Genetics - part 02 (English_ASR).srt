00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,138
[Music]

2
00:00:11,119 --> 00:00:17,759
yes back when High Times was really cool

3
00:00:16,138 --> 00:00:21,390
that's when it was actually fun in

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,330
Holland a long time ago so I think the

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,949
first year we met was 2012 we had booths

6
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:28,768
across for each other at high times

7
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,630
swerve had the biggest biggest amazing

8
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:32,879
crazy booth with like 30 people working

9
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:34,738
it and loud seeds was this little booth

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,559
right across from with I think four of

11
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:39,449
us and they had a microphone and half on

12
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:48,019
on the microphone back in the day and I

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:53,250
was that wasn't the milk bag it was the

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,850
city of little ways powers huh yeah that

15
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,539
was a cool thing

16
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,250
Wow so we've sat on panels before we

17
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,039
hung out in Amsterdam one time we even

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,140
hung out in Amsterdam and I was talking

19
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,460
to swerve and he was like so I heard

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,890
someone was seeing you talk shit about

21
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:10,139
me and I literally got a text at the

22
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,180
same exact time it was like I heard I

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,590
heard swerves pissed at you and fucking

24
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,570
he was talking shit about Hewitt and

25
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,060
it's like that kind of stuff went on

26
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:19,169
back in the day a lot the drama from

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,009
that was like the early days of

28
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:25,320
Instagram right high school drama it was

29
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,659
even more crazy than high Sparrow auto

30
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:31,379
industry the marijuana industry and a

31
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,180
lot of guys acting like kids and how

32
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:34,798
more people took offense to stuff like

33
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,299
that then actually worried about the

34
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,979
simple fact of we're doing something

35
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,509
extremely illegal we have to worry about

36
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:41,789
the cops but we're more worried about

37
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:45,118
the other person it was like hey your

38
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:47,490
cuts are really bad like really you're

39
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:48,599
worried about the cuts or the seeds but

40
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:49,798
you're not worried about the fact that

41
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:51,569
everything we do is a hundred percent

42
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:54,118
illegal and we're actually like breaking

43
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:57,239
the law to do this yeah

44
00:01:54,118 --> 00:01:58,890
that's not that's a weird weird thought

45
00:01:57,239 --> 00:02:01,438
now that I think about it how lucky the

46
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,239
modern-day grower is right the

47
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,679
modern-day generation they don't even

48
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:08,008
have to experience this stuff we had to

49
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,950
to get to this point it was like bizarro

50
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:11,679
world in some way

51
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:13,030
- I know it's kind of wild to see like

52
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,650
you guys were talking how you have like

53
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:16,209
you know some of you more like some of

54
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:17,560
the like I saying some of there's people

55
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:19,330
that are placing the orders you're like

56
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,890
oh yeah we did a hundred thousand seeds

57
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,989
or we need a million seed since like

58
00:02:20,889 --> 00:02:26,169
wait a second a million are you gonna

59
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:27,459
grow all those yeah we've got a land

60
00:02:26,169 --> 00:02:28,689
we're gonna grow all that and you're

61
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:30,340
like wait a second here

62
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:33,430
yeah I mean some of these companies are

63
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:36,039
stockpiling seeds I heard a specific

64
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:38,110
company bought five million auto flower

65
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:39,669
seeds this year and then I was like they

66
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,709
must have a lot of Linn that's gonna be

67
00:02:39,669 --> 00:02:43,809
crazy we got to get in on it sell some

68
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:45,729
seeds yeah and it turns out that they're

69
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,069
stockpiling those seeds it's not like

70
00:02:45,729 --> 00:02:50,828
they're they're burning through that

71
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:52,479
every year so I think big companies are

72
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:54,010
getting ready to go online and they want

73
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,828
to have stockpile and they have tons of

74
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:59,709
money that was never a thing back in the

75
00:02:56,829 --> 00:03:01,599
day million that reads like maybe 50,000

76
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:06,069
seeds if you're lucky yeah a kilo of

77
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:09,009
seeds was like oh baby yeah yeah see

78
00:03:06,068 --> 00:03:11,589
it's 40,000 seeds hell yeah yeah it's

79
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:13,539
pretty wild well in seeds change you

80
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,009
know depending on the cultivar you can

81
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:17,048
have small seeds you can have biggest

82
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:21,810
seeds they can weigh anywhere as small

83
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:25,900
as like point zero one two of a gram two

84
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:28,959
point point zero yeah it's a point two

85
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,329
point five I've seen some monsters I

86
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,060
think like ray from homegrown natural

87
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:35,590
wonders OD that used to work for sub he

88
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,840
has these seeds that don't even look

89
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,329
like cannabis seeds they're so big so

90
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,889
and he grows outdoors and it's all

91
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:44,260
indicative to the calyx that it was

92
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:46,600
growing and you know yeah and I did so I

93
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:48,310
did side by side like when I first

94
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:51,068
started making seeds again after my

95
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,569
little hiatus I started and I had some

96
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:53,979
outdoors and some indoors and the

97
00:03:52,568 --> 00:03:56,798
outdoor ones were the same as the

98
00:03:53,979 --> 00:03:59,858
indoors the females and the seeds that I

99
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,329
harvested off them were completely

100
00:03:59,859 --> 00:04:03,370
different looking in the sense the

101
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:06,159
outdoor ones were much bigger and and I

102
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,689
think it's because of the the like I

103
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,668
would there was using kavita's like

104
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:11,919
1,100 watts on yeah and so because

105
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:13,450
they're so strong it changes the bud

106
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,069
density and so that puts pressure on the

107
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:15,449
seat so the seed doesn't get his Bank at

108
00:04:15,068 --> 00:04:17,069
anyone

109
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:19,819
big doesn't have the chance to spread

110
00:04:17,069 --> 00:04:24,509
out and get some some roundness or room

111
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:26,668
so you started working in Amsterdam guy

112
00:04:24,509 --> 00:04:31,769
over ten years ago around ten years yeah

113
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:34,859
about ten years ago yeah I think my

114
00:04:31,769 --> 00:04:39,359
first my first cannabis cup was my first

115
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,970
cannabis cup as a competitor was 2009 or

116
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,270
2010 I forget when our first award is I

117
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:47,430
think our first awards from 2011 is that

118
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:48,839
the power zone yeah we're just talking

119
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,269
about how is the power zone the good old

120
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:53,339
days are the power zone before we had

121
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:56,310
that awesome rate at that a beautiful

122
00:04:53,339 --> 00:05:00,719
tennis courts that was the last one but

123
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:03,509
I was oh yeah but it was my last one for

124
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,270
a while I was an adventure it's nothing

125
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:08,009
like being rated by Dutch police in the

126
00:05:06,269 --> 00:05:13,228
end then they arrested Milla out of all

127
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:14,639
people out of jail for that one thing

128
00:05:13,228 --> 00:05:18,629
she was doing demonstration right right

129
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:21,538
yeah classic that was a good time that

130
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:23,370
was an adventure that the changing of

131
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:25,800
the guard so to speak from when they

132
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,478
went from like sort of chill and relaxed

133
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,360
over in Holland to super conservative

134
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:32,430
like 2012 was cool that was like the

135
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,189
last year of like Steve Haggar the

136
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:36,569
temple dragons being part of it and yeah

137
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:38,699
that was a sort of bitters bit I would

138
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:40,639
say bittersweet moment there you know

139
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,930
was a good event

140
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,310
the thing about the cups back then which

141
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:46,350
is really cool in my opinion was that it

142
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,959
was every year and so you had a whole

143
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,120
year to kind of gear up for everyone and

144
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,370
when it happened it was really cool but

145
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,329
it was also still kind of hokey but that

146
00:05:53,370 --> 00:06:00,090
hoe keenest came through is sort of like

147
00:05:56,329 --> 00:06:02,519
authentic you know and then how they're

148
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:05,759
maybe they're more efficient as far as I

149
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:07,680
can more people etc but but if you have

150
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,089
so many of them and you saturate your

151
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,699
market it's like how many cups can you

152
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:13,379
really go to and as a as a company it's

153
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:15,300
really hard to pick and choose I mean

154
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:16,978
you have a nightmare to think about

155
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,689
every Sochaux is it gonna be a winner or

156
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:20,519
loser is it a winner is it a loser and

157
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:24,558
there's more losers than winners these

158
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:27,930
days that these shows because we've sat

159
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:29,969
every other week cash cards yeah they do

160
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,189
it's like one day Vince I'm in Detroit

161
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:35,939
one day event I'm coming in Portland one

162
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:37,620
day of it for xx more than one the

163
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:38,939
Portland one is just an award show it's

164
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,278
not even an event that's technically

165
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:43,319
just an award show they just announced

166
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:44,430
they weren't money give us your $1,100

167
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,610
give us your money

168
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,499
there's no shows $500 entries we get a

169
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:52,050
jersey the full price well you know and

170
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:53,699
that was the problem is that like also

171
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,668
because when most people came to Europe

172
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:58,830
it was a double adventure you know not

173
00:06:56,668 --> 00:07:00,240
only were you judging a cannabis cup but

174
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:02,338
you're actually in another country and

175
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,509
so everybody was pumped up and stuff but

176
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:06,360
when you drive like you know the

177
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:07,889
Riverside it's not like it's not got the

178
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,960
same sort of flair to it

179
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,999
we're like okay this is gonna be fucked

180
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:12,989
you know there's no parking oh we

181
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:16,889
haven't thought about these signal digs

182
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:18,990
is crazy like lack of basic things in

183
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:21,389
Oklahoma was a disaster and they didn't

184
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:24,079
have water oh yeah it was like a hundred

185
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:27,598
and seven degrees three-hour wait

186
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,370
parking was two miles from the festival

187
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,149
and people were in wheelchairs

188
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,209
wheelchairs

189
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:35,759
yeah this is just a few months ago it

190
00:07:33,209 --> 00:07:37,949
was just like Mike I got stressed out

191
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,360
calls from my friends who are like can

192
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:41,579
you get me in touch with anybody at high

193
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,899
times because we have no water and I get

194
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:44,848
here people like yelling in the

195
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:50,218
background I was like oh do this fire

196
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:54,269
fast going on it was a proper it was a

197
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:56,069
proper disaster but I think that the

198
00:07:54,269 --> 00:07:59,549
future of that is gonna be back to those

199
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:01,199
300 to 500 people events that are like

200
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,939
you kind of get to talk to all of them

201
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,158
and every hangout instead of like a

202
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:07,199
couple thousand people or ten thousand

203
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:09,598
people or 20,000 because it just loses

204
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,270
at a certain point it's impossible to

205
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,038
really judge it properly like Denver

206
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:15,508
those two years or three years where

207
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:17,370
there was a hundred thousand people with

208
00:08:15,509 --> 00:08:19,439
you know you know workouts and it was it

209
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,809
it was there was a mean because I moved

210
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:24,088
to Colorado in 2009 and I was really

211
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:26,459
surprised for the first time in my life

212
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:28,199
I'd actually like bid on the fucking

213
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:30,180
right horse right cuz I was like oh this

214
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,788
place it could get legal here you know

215
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,408
and then all of a sudden hey fucking

216
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:36,059
wreck weed all the sudden were like wow

217
00:08:34,408 --> 00:08:39,090
I'm in this spot after

218
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:42,269
Amsterdam for so long and and but to see

219
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:45,720
how they lost that whole gig due to bad

220
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:47,100
organization or of organ and like you

221
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,110
can't it's really hard to put a hundred

222
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,670
thousand people anywhere and make them

223
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,560
all happy yeah they had no structure to

224
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:55,319
it but then when you add dabbing to it

225
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:58,169
it just kill like that was like not

226
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,940
enough tables right not enough plugs not

227
00:08:58,169 --> 00:09:01,979
enough tables too many people passing

228
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,180
out ambulances end up water going not

229
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,730
enough water you know just like I'm

230
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:09,539
walk-in recipe for disaster

231
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:11,039
High Times yeah there you go where they

232
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:12,329
gun corporate to and they're and they're

233
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,338
getting their ass handed to him when it

234
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:16,410
comes to like trying to get IPO going it

235
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:18,450
and trying to like think that it's

236
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:24,028
really like the culture is moving ahead

237
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:27,240
faster oh for sure but they still have

238
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:30,450
the opportunity to change the roller

239
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,580
they have the core they're lucky they're

240
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:35,940
lucky to be able to fall bit but it's

241
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:39,930
just the the written the magazines are

242
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,920
dead we know that that's like a lot of

243
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:43,289
print media is dead

244
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:45,799
it's yeah it's and and then when you go

245
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:49,079
but when you go online with it it's

246
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:50,099
you've got to be working non-stop you

247
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,320
know you have to be working on those

248
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,899
events and they don't have a great track

249
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,190
record when it comes to taking out

250
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:57,449
permits and doing all these things

251
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:59,910
that's one of the things when it comes

252
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,920
to doing cannabis related events it's

253
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:03,719
hard that's one of the I've tried to do

254
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,849
it for years and in Amsterdam where you

255
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,639
think it would be easy it was even more

256
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:12,120
hard because they actually had rules you

257
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:14,250
know so I had one year where I lent a

258
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:18,740
Dutch guy due to the marketing for me

259
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:20,759
and he just put out like on Reuters like

260
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,950
we're gonna roll the world's biggest

261
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:25,708
joint it's gonna be 500 grams right and

262
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:28,440
then within an hour we had the cops

263
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:30,029
contact alisios like you know yeah you

264
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,380
know we're gonna be there right and I'm

265
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,610
like yeah but everybody's gonna put

266
00:10:31,379 --> 00:10:34,860
their own weight in it's like there's

267
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,839
not gonna be one guy with 500 grams and

268
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,789
they were like no but the minute it all

269
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,440
goes into that one joint it's illegal

270
00:10:38,789 --> 00:10:41,730
and we're gonna raise you you know

271
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,589
sounds like shit

272
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,620
why could you tell what we don't so the

273
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:48,690
main you gotta like just do it in these

274
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,570
situations and then talk about it after

275
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,790
it's it's my reward of advice yeah I

276
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,709
mean that whole system over there like

277
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:57,719
as far as their coffee shops and how

278
00:10:55,708 --> 00:11:00,208
they get weed it's crazy

279
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:02,670
they're only allowed like what 500 grams

280
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:04,768
at any one given time in your coffee

281
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:06,328
shop yeah most of them happen most of

282
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:09,328
the coffee shops have networks of guys

283
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:10,769
on scooters that will deliver and run

284
00:11:09,328 --> 00:11:13,138
from the cops cuz they can't get pulled

285
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:14,850
over they'll get arrested it's not legal

286
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,560
until it gets through the door it's like

287
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:20,790
a total of cat-and-mouse game and it's

288
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:23,009
also the weirder one which was they now

289
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:25,169
cuz when I was there it was not legal to

290
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:27,149
sell space cake ever but people still

291
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:28,620
did but now they actually have rules but

292
00:11:27,149 --> 00:11:31,169
the rules are you have to be able to see

293
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:32,669
the weed so it's like basically you just

294
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:34,019
have to make the worst edible as

295
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:36,509
possible like here you go make the worst

296
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,250
edibles and then you can sell it as long

297
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:40,578
as people can see little flakes of weed

298
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:43,769
in all of your products you're like Oh

299
00:11:40,578 --> 00:11:48,000
counterproductive and those things yeah

300
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:49,049
and and so the the funny thing about how

301
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,958
long though is it's like they're looking

302
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:53,639
at us like with a mouse a Gabe like they

303
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:56,609
just can't believe what's going on and

304
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:58,289
it's like you guys had 25 years to do

305
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,209
this and like this work whatever you

306
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:02,939
just never wanted to acknowledge the

307
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:05,009
grower and the grower is the most

308
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,600
important part of the whole thing back

309
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:08,129
in the day it was pretty much you go to

310
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,379
the guy he grew the way he grew weed you

311
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:12,689
got it from him there you go very small

312
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:15,899
window now it's you get it from a guy

313
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,639
who has 20 guys growing for him and 15

314
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:21,539
guys trimming for him and it goes

315
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:23,579
through this UV control after and gets

316
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:26,278
handled seven times before hands goods

317
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:27,719
to you and then you wonder why it's not

318
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,389
quite as good as it was when you got it

319
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,160
from your friend you know so the Dutch

320
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:34,230
have been dealing with that for 20-plus

321
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,689
years that's why the weed was always

322
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,730
like men kind of mediocre at best

323
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,290
and occasionally you get a good batch

324
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:42,629
but that was because it was a grown

325
00:12:40,289 --> 00:12:44,969
small by somebody you know few pounds

326
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:46,198
here and there but the minute you got

327
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:48,810
any kind of consistency but the whole

328
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:50,549
point was they don't recognize growers

329
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:51,849
it's not legal so you have to play this

330
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:54,699
small grower

331
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:57,159
that was kind of vibe thing or just have

332
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:59,170
be totally criminal and not give a shit

333
00:12:57,159 --> 00:13:01,959
and rent huge warehouses and pay you

334
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:03,339
know do the play that game but those

335
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:07,509
people don't care that that's your

336
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:09,460
classic mmm no care weed at all you know

337
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:11,559
as you could tell people bring us stuff

338
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,620
up from Morocco and the stuff that came

339
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:16,750
up from Spain oh now Spain is I mean if

340
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,460
you go to Europe and you don't go down

341
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,750
your cannabis lover then you're out of

342
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,460
your mind because that's right yeah

343
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,470
Barcelona is the New Amsterdam for sure

344
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,450
oh yeah it's the heart and soul of

345
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,279
cannabis in Europe is there now it was

346
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,509
it was an Amsterdam for a long time but

347
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,549
it wasn't again it wasn't the Dutch

348
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:34,990
people it was all the same guys in

349
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:38,949
Barcelona yeah and now it's nice yeah

350
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:40,600
food it's actually good it is amazingly

351
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:41,950
not bad at all and if you go to the

352
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,340
right spots but for the most gets

353
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:48,100
everything Holland's not that good to

354
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,780
food yeah it's bland people are sort of

355
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:53,170
nice they're nicer right now they're

356
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:54,939
rioting like oh yeah we're in Spain yeah

357
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:56,259
as far as that people dying in stuff

358
00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:00,370
yeah well and that's the thing about

359
00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:02,049
they're very passionate I can see very

360
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,750
passionate but in general I mean

361
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:06,789
definitely when it comes to cannabis

362
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:08,169
it's it's it has a much more California

363
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:10,089
vibe to it though to when you're there

364
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:11,679
you can actually you can finish outdoor

365
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:15,490
weed there in November you know you

366
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:17,649
can't Colorado is now arts art Amsterdam

367
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,299
is not conducive to how tour growing you

368
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:21,309
know almost any way shape or form

369
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:23,229
there's a few pockets of places but that

370
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:25,059
even in greenhouses out there and is

371
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,279
really gone off of natural light it's

372
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:30,729
all still supplemental over in Holland

373
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,319
that's where I mean literally indoor

374
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,120
growing came from Holland because of the

375
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,379
lack of light you know so they but they

376
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,440
got all the water in the world

377
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:40,750
yeah that's never been a problem in the

378
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,110
world but the you know they again like

379
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,669
now you see how because we're growing on

380
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,639
scale it's start to look very similar

381
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:49,689
like between the way people grow in

382
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,129
greenhouses and like when I was there I

383
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,230
was always butting heads with these guys

384
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:55,029
because I was ignorant and I was

385
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,039
thinking like that the American way of

386
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:57,899
growing was the right way and at that

387
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,980
time period

388
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:01,500
and everybody was growing with

389
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:03,300
air-cooled lights and so you were like

390
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,159
putting the lights right down on the

391
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:07,439
plants and growing completely different

392
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:09,539
and everybody over there had 15 feet in

393
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,830
the air and I was like you guys are

394
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:12,409
crazy you don't know what you do you

395
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:16,050
know and so it was like this whole like

396
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:19,019
change of Technology and now America has

397
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:21,240
adopted the Dutch system and are doing

398
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,559
it I would say better because Dutch are

399
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,259
very efficient they can do it with less

400
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,549
people and always make they can always

401
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,990
cut every corner because they don't be

402
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:30,750
like shit you know these are computo

403
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:33,389
he's a automatic thing whereas I think

404
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:35,490
we're still kind of for the most part

405
00:15:33,389 --> 00:15:36,990
trying to like create jobs we're not

406
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,019
trying to automate everything too much

407
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:43,379
it's getting there but for the most part

408
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,730
it's like the scale is I think you still

409
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:47,460
do better when you have more hands-on

410
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,839
anyway it's automation is great but you

411
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,490
still need people to take care of things

412
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,080
that's just the reality but you need to

413
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:55,080
have the human touch the human hand that

414
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:56,850
the human interaction no matter what and

415
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,528
in my honest opinion I like that

416
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,670
Automation is awesome because it makes

417
00:15:58,528 --> 00:16:02,250
things obviously that much more

418
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:03,838
efficient mm-hmm but the human touch the

419
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,039
human hands yeah well I think there's

420
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,930
things that should be automated there's

421
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,689
things that shouldn't be out of man like

422
00:16:06,929 --> 00:16:13,949
watering I totally love automated

423
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:16,260
watering but my friends up in Seattle a

424
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:18,750
house a cultivar those guys hand water

425
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:20,819
and it's because for their model hand

426
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:23,870
watering works they have 88 different

427
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:27,480
cultivars at any one given time in a 34

428
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,830
thousand square foot facility and yeah

429
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,420
that's a lot of hand watering but I

430
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:31,889
think those type of things should

431
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:34,169
definitely be automated I feel like you

432
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:35,610
can control it better and the more you

433
00:16:34,169 --> 00:16:38,789
can control your variables when you're

434
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:41,399
growing like large quantities you know

435
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,870
and also repeating the same results like

436
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:45,449
those things are important well plants

437
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:49,110
appreciate the timing you know what I

438
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:51,720
mean like you realize when you try to do

439
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:54,480
like if you've ever tried to save money

440
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,339
by not at like I don't need a timer I'll

441
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,200
just turn it on and off every day at the

442
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:59,850
right time you'll never do it it's like

443
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,589
it's always gonna be a minute here

444
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,600
they're two minutes here five minutes

445
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:05,038
here like for you to literally get it

446
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,730
all the time every day it's not

447
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:10,500
happening right so so that's to fail and

448
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,470
when it comes to watering even though

449
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,328
you could be consistent depending on how

450
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:18,419
you're growing like it's better to feed

451
00:17:15,328 --> 00:17:21,178
them less off less amounts but on a very

452
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:23,038
consistent schedule and kind of let them

453
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,600
go where they need to go and let them

454
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:27,298
like instead of trying to baby every

455
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:28,829
single plant because like my mom's the

456
00:17:27,298 --> 00:17:30,418
worst she's like picks up every single

457
00:17:28,829 --> 00:17:32,788
plant range when she's doing it like

458
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:34,380
she'll go in and takes her two hours to

459
00:17:32,788 --> 00:17:36,690
do it takes me like a half hour because

460
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:38,760
I'm just kind of like well I'll go do it

461
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,990
come back and if I see a mr. spot or

462
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:41,640
whatever I'll do it but she'll like go

463
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:44,308
and pick up every single plant

464
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,110
double-check triple-check and water just

465
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:48,779
the right perfect you know it's not

466
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:50,250
effective timewise it's great they all

467
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:52,769
look great but that's what you do with

468
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,659
your mom's and your things that you're

469
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:56,490
not but when you're doing production in

470
00:17:54,659 --> 00:18:00,299
a way it's a lot nicer when you can just

471
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,650
plug a dripper or you know bottom

472
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:04,408
depending on your system while you're

473
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:07,830
gonna feed it or bottom feed it or you

474
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:10,320
know have it on a dosatron or whatever

475
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:13,408
system you're gonna be using but you

476
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:15,269
notice it wow they sure do produce way

477
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:17,669
better when when someone else is doing

478
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:20,129
the time cuz yeah I'm a big fan of like

479
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:21,659
for making seeds I prefer making seeds

480
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,250
in a sterile environment I use cocoa

481
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:25,620
which is more sterile than soil

482
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,538
obviously but as far as for smoking I

483
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:30,658
prefer like living soil if you can't you

484
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:34,730
can't beat the taste salts are good in

485
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:36,870
in they're great for mass production and

486
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,630
there's nothing wrong with it and for

487
00:18:36,869 --> 00:18:43,739
seeds salts using salts as opposed to

488
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:47,250
organics so like gh is pretty much salt

489
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:49,429
based HGV my friends in Arizona are

490
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:56,730
using HDV and they're crushing it

491
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:58,470
anything with a G or H in it but I mean

492
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,659
it is the most effective and it is easy

493
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,610
especially in a dosatron situation like

494
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:05,460
things like when your automated you kind

495
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:07,419
of have to fall into line you can't it's

496
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:11,798
very hard to do organic

497
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:13,960
and have it automated beyond you know I

498
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:15,339
think even with that like when you're

499
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,150
doing living soils and stuff there's

500
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:21,099
really no point of automating it because

501
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:24,490
well really your work schedules are a

502
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:27,159
lot lower Wrigley in Nevada has 40,000

503
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,720
square foot forty thousand square foot

504
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,400
facility of living soil so they've

505
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,890
scaled it and that's great for them I

506
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:37,480
haven't I haven't yeah and so I mean

507
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,890
that's it's an interesting concept I

508
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,110
just and maybe maybe it's more

509
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:43,030
beneficial for the plants even making

510
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:44,889
seeds maybe it's better but in my

511
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:47,798
results I feel like I've gotten better

512
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:51,490
results from using cocoa with seeds and

513
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:53,500
using you know net FM drippers and I

514
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:55,390
water several times a day and I keep it

515
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,589
real simple yeah seven times three

516
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:58,600
minutes maybe yeah

517
00:19:56,589 --> 00:20:00,519
four minutes max depending on how big of

518
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:08,409
putts I've grown in as small as one

519
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:11,798
gallon and twelve plants per 600 and

520
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:15,250
you're in and they dry out so you ever

521
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:17,379
use a the charc or bio pots yeah so it's

522
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,849
cocoa and they come in these blocks and

523
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,090
they have bags and then you hydrate them

524
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:24,339
and they spring up and you can

525
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:26,048
transplant one bag right to the next so

526
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:27,609
you can use the that's convenient yeah

527
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:30,759
the one liter will go in like a two

528
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:34,149
gallon super easy and for making seeds

529
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:38,349
it's super simple because you can and I

530
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:40,780
like from Nick dros pyramid see you seen

531
00:20:38,349 --> 00:20:42,699
those right yeah the pyramid oh yeah

532
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:43,960
totally those are badass those are

533
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,558
really good that's the thing is when

534
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:49,090
you're growing on a scale it's all about

535
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:51,399
consistency it's about trying to do

536
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:53,889
things it's you kind of have to get real

537
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,080
boring if you want because you can't

538
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,900
start making like adjustments you have

539
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:01,259
to make everything very linear you want

540
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,940
your lighting schedule to be like

541
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:05,410
there's no point of like turning bulbs

542
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,808
in different directions to try to fill

543
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:10,179
in gaps I mean you get a all those old

544
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:12,250
ways of thinking like we run a couple

545
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:13,929
over this way and a couple over here and

546
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,339
it's like no no once you have once you

547
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:17,040
start growing anything that that's

548
00:21:15,339 --> 00:21:20,609
specially custom-built and

549
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,019
you know when you're talking forty fifty

550
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:26,549
sixty thousand square foot facilities

551
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:27,750
it's you know kind of kind of boring

552
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:30,210
because it's gonna they all start to

553
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:35,160
become very homogenous I can't exactly

554
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:41,850
it's all rolling tables yeah SOPs all

555
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:43,080
this and you know you start to see it

556
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:44,929
when you tour all these facilities you

557
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:47,759
start to go like yeah it's like

558
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:49,380
unfortunate like my thing that I loved

559
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:50,730
back in the day especially when when

560
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,880
people were a little bit more creative

561
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:56,190
was that you would find like a nugget at

562
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,710
every grow like there'd be like one guy

563
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:01,920
who just you know filled reservoirs

564
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:04,319
every day for like seven years and he

565
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,750
came up with the smartest way to like

566
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,159
never fuck up and like it's just but oh

567
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:11,339
yeah I went to Home Depot and I got this

568
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,960
thing and I put oh my god genius it's

569
00:22:11,339 --> 00:22:15,449
because those people did it every day

570
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,980
you know and now the problem it takes a

571
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:19,769
lot of that creativity away because if

572
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,509
they're thirty gating with dosatron you

573
00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:23,609
pretty much die have them under contract

574
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:26,009
or you have Argos or you have another

575
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:28,709
one of these big companies and then

576
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:29,940
you're a slave to that it's like it's

577
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,680
like driving a Tesla it's like you're

578
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,740
not gonna go home and fix that thing I'm

579
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:36,480
sorry your if your car breaks up call

580
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,620
Tesla and they don't company caller love

581
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,759
it you know and that's kind of where a

582
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:41,309
lot of the grows are getting

583
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:43,259
see you guys thanks man that's where a

584
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:44,639
lot of the grows are kind of going

585
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:45,960
towards where they're it's just

586
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,130
literally everything is under contract

587
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,390
plus people are as you noticed the next

588
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,010
few years of this industry are gonna be

589
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,140
a lot of litigation because a lot of

590
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:57,390
people are putting a lot of energy and

591
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:00,540
money into something and then figuring

592
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:04,500
out that it's totally wrong that's just

593
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:07,680
not right oh you mean we have to tear it

594
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,000
out and heads are gonna roll you know

595
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,450
that's all you see now in this industry

596
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,029
so I think the big winners are gonna be

597
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,350
lawyers in the next few years

598
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:16,849
I mean you guys were talking about her

599
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:19,159
earlier with all the ham stuff it's like

600
00:23:16,849 --> 00:23:22,099
couple friends of mine even I think they

601
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,890
had think it was about 15 acres made

602
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:26,899
thousands of pounds dead this came out

603
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:29,270
state of Kentucky had to completely

604
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:32,180
another just bulldoze came in hot

605
00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:33,859
yeah cholera seed straight up doesn't

606
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,539
matter hundred thousand seats 200,000

607
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:36,859
see is a bucket seat and place our ham

608
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:40,960
seeds were talking about people complain

609
00:23:36,859 --> 00:23:40,959
about is selling th seeds yeah you know

610
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:47,900
th see seeds you know you know and

611
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,340
that's the situation or its kind of

612
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,320
flower gassing a c-word

613
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:53,209
yeah they put six seven hundred thousand

614
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:55,009
dollars in from a company who said oh no

615
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,450
this is actually this here's a CoA and

616
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:58,869
they never see oh it was full of shit

617
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:04,759
well this there was a point in time

618
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:08,029
where yeah there was a point in time at

619
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:10,730
last year when if you put in like a CoA

620
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:13,639
into like Google search there was like

621
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:15,559
BAM maybe like 50 of them right and then

622
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,390
you'd recognize like you'd be like oh I

623
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:18,769
just saw that one yesterday like

624
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,870
literally it's like someone be in the

625
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:22,490
parking lot you know to go make a see

626
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:24,739
you a real quick and then so the same

627
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:27,380
cos we're going around for nine

628
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,329
different types of seed that were

629
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:32,630
nothing to do with those cos at all it's

630
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:34,699
same thing with SOPs like every letters

631
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:37,610
don't trust three letter things are bad

632
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:40,519
it was like boil it down to three

633
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:46,819
letters it's usually a bad situation as

634
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:48,109
you know come on James jump in Jim yes

635
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:50,179
so peace we're talking years language

636
00:24:48,109 --> 00:24:52,429
now we're talking actually erase all our

637
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:55,700
SOPs now he was a little tray Niall

638
00:24:52,430 --> 00:25:02,769
it's a lot better you know you you're in

639
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:04,759
the the crazy world of SEO and internet

640
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:06,769
positioning and all that I mean it's one

641
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:09,859
of those things I I don't really feel

642
00:25:06,769 --> 00:25:12,259
very so I do feel sorry but I don't ever

643
00:25:09,859 --> 00:25:13,699
like envious position because I know how

644
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:15,710
hard that is is like

645
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,720
it's the bane of my existence websites

646
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:22,130
it's trying to keep them off track even

647
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:25,130
going working security wise making sure

648
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:28,220
we're secure which we get randomly

649
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:30,800
hundred thousand times a day so I mean

650
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:33,049
you got closed your account got shut

651
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,539
down more times like probably like

652
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:37,460
seventeen time Instagram shut down yeah

653
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:40,700
wait now we have the most boring

654
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:42,230
Instagram account ever just be so as we

655
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,460
put something up at we take it down 24

656
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,620
hours because that's young away we can

657
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,059
keep it up every time we get to 10,000

658
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:49,549
20,000 boomers shut us down

659
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:53,419
17 times I grew of running out of names

660
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:56,480
like what your whales do you call

661
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:58,550
yourself people just they would just

662
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,410
report us that's that's like the

663
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:02,299
genocide cast at canvas if you will they

664
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:04,340
keep they keep cutting down on everybody

665
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:07,099
due to the YouTube accounts and all

666
00:26:04,339 --> 00:26:08,809
these all these Instagram accounts you

667
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:11,569
people will forget about what people

668
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:13,460
went through and you guys have all your

669
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:15,349
pictures printed out and have hard

670
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,610
copies of them but when Jordan loved

671
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:22,519
their Instagram they believed your

672
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:24,229
account that's your history yeah I see

673
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:25,970
Matt got to leave their bridge bro tips

674
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,730
that they did all that history all went

675
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:30,620
away so we've got a forum opened up to

676
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,690
on see on seats you now so all my

677
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:34,639
breeders have the ability to go in there

678
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:36,799
they'll form shell on its own separate

679
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:43,850
server that's hosted in Amsterdam that's

680
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:45,589
pretty secure see the fact you could ask

681
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:46,969
him better strange you asked to talk to

682
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:49,069
the breeder one-on-one and get the

683
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,720
information from them or so is it hosted

684
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:54,799
by excess for all by any chance

685
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,720
yes it is is it it was like the original

686
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,849
guys in Holland who did everything like

687
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,610
anything shady back in the day it was

688
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:03,529
always access for all as like well it

689
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:05,449
was in the same building of them but

690
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:06,740
actually that kind of swings it around

691
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:08,150
too

692
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,220
when I heard that sword was gonna join

693
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:12,440
us I was like okay well interesting

694
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:14,269
enough I remember the show that you came

695
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,890
and I remember that it was funny cuz

696
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:17,029
like we didn't actually talk during that

697
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:18,650
show because we were both busy doing our

698
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:19,970
own things and then later there was just

699
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:21,050
kind of like yeah I don't know I think

700
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,829
Adam doesn't like me or something like

701
00:27:21,049 --> 00:27:23,659
that that's just kind of how the

702
00:27:21,829 --> 00:27:25,069
industry rolled but it wasn't even that

703
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:27,380
I think it was a situation of that I

704
00:27:25,069 --> 00:27:29,720
recognized at that time because I had

705
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:34,060
heard your name and I think you were one

706
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:36,350
of the first guys in my opinion because

707
00:27:34,059 --> 00:27:38,269
it wasn't that mean there was people

708
00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:41,209
selling online but there wasn't a lot of

709
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:44,450
people putting their name out there yet

710
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:46,490
that kind of like put their face behind

711
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:49,610
and I think and so I I think I kind of

712
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,599
was curious at the time because I felt

713
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:54,829
like you were part of that next

714
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:56,359
generation of breeders coming up and it

715
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:58,639
not as an insult but it was like I was

716
00:27:56,359 --> 00:28:00,649
like ah see he's got a little system

717
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:05,840
because he's like online high-fiving

718
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:07,400
himself every five minutes but we were

719
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:10,279
actually creating ways that I was seeing

720
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:12,050
in Amsterdam just by the name you know

721
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:13,549
what I mean so I give you definitely

722
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:16,339
kudos for that because I was also like

723
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:18,549
as you see the hustle has gotten fierce

724
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:22,039
but it's also crazy kind of like

725
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:23,659
ridiculous too because like the quality

726
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:26,599
of the camera that we have in our phones

727
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,880
is so much better than nothing like back

728
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:31,939
in the day to get a photo of your

729
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,890
cannabis grow your cannabis back in the

730
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:36,920
day yeah like I was trying all the time

731
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:38,720
to like like imagining magic and you

732
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,490
know literally like the other day I got

733
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,200
one of those little tiny scope things

734
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,700
and I was like you see where we're at

735
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,529
now it's like he just click click it on

736
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,539
your phone you know I got a 400 you know

737
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:49,460
time zoom he could take photos videos

738
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:51,440
and I'm like thinking to myself like man

739
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:53,329
we were like struggling I was like

740
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,970
trying every angle to make things work

741
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:58,039
but also the internet was sort of like I

742
00:28:55,970 --> 00:29:00,559
grew up in a generation that was kind of

743
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:02,059
like we didn't take we didn't like with

744
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,740
Generation X so we didn't really like

745
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:05,419
jump to it as much as the next

746
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,480
generation which definitely jumped to it

747
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:10,340
and I think now it's it is it like if

748
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,529
it's like like he was saying if your

749
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:14,769
Instagram account gets deleted

750
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:20,079
you have no ya know existence and

751
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:24,039
like I feel like that's kind of it shows

752
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:25,899
you a little bit of where the sales it's

753
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:27,399
a lot of smoke and mirrors you know and

754
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,660
you can't smell the weed right you can't

755
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,060
smoke the weed you can see the we

756
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:33,850
there's some awesome photos and like I

757
00:29:31,059 --> 00:29:36,819
saying cameras are as good as a SLR

758
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:38,289
camera was way better than it is for

759
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:39,849
sure yeah and some people just have a

760
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:42,519
really good eye right they could like

761
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:48,369
BAM all that avidin you go twenty

762
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:49,629
doesn't come up on right but wait so

763
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:52,750
what's your situation now like you

764
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:54,370
you're kind of bringing you're kind of

765
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,720
bringing things back online

766
00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:58,000
yeah keeping it going you know we've

767
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:00,700
been just kind of been low-key

768
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,299
unfortunately you know like most in this

769
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:08,049
industry we hit a minor Rogoff called

770
00:30:04,299 --> 00:30:09,940
the police department and then they one

771
00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:11,619
first foot second but thankfully we have

772
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,140
solid lawyers and they took care of

773
00:30:11,619 --> 00:30:17,079
everything for us and we've managed to

774
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:19,000
mitigate our losses and we've been just

775
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:22,299
direct sales as well as our our

776
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,009
wholesale over in Europe and whatnot we

777
00:30:22,299 --> 00:30:26,139
faded away from your for a minute but

778
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:28,809
we've been hitting high the states

779
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,850
pretty hard we're hopefully about to

780
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:34,839
announce once everything's locked down

781
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:37,269
and signed you know tri-state deal

782
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:39,579
bringing us to Nevada Arizona and

783
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:41,589
California legally which would be kind

784
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:43,509
of cool to be able to embark on that one

785
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:47,349
because we've been fighting for Nevada

786
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:51,009
for since my now defunct partnership

787
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:52,809
with MJ mmm J America in Colorado

788
00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:55,779
otherwise I'm a just keeping it going

789
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:57,240
like you know how do you say that now

790
00:30:55,779 --> 00:31:03,420
that you say that I'm like oh yeah

791
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:06,309
Salazar I remember being in his office

792
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:08,950
probably a month or two after you were

793
00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:11,019
there and I think and I was wondering

794
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:14,590
how that and that's a classic example of

795
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:17,410
of how the the industry kind of gobbles

796
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:20,289
up talent tacit eats it up takes what

797
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:22,150
they want from you yeah well he was you

798
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:27,460
were dealing with a guy like literally

799
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:29,170
a loan shark that's what he would eat

800
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:31,799
for living so I was like okay well I

801
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:35,500
guess I know where we're at here yeah

802
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:39,879
yeah so that's interesting so you're so

803
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:43,650
that actually the whole vault thing just

804
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:47,320
sort of yeah the whole vault thing they

805
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:49,860
when it came down to finances I got a

806
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:52,599
beautiful letter from their lawyer and

807
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:54,219
said we appreciate all the genetic that

808
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:55,839
she did for us all the breeding that she

809
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:59,350
did for us everything mazing that you

810
00:31:55,839 --> 00:32:01,480
did for us but uh have a great day

811
00:31:59,349 --> 00:32:04,209
because you can't be a part of it

812
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,250
anymore and as that because of the out

813
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,299
of state yeah situation is it out of

814
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,559
state thing and they didn't want it they

815
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:11,019
didn't want to do things the opposite

816
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,399
side which was the licensing way which

817
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:16,539
would have been able to allow us to

818
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:18,640
retain the control of the IP which is

819
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:21,220
one thing that after I realized and

820
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,590
learn off of that one was and has been

821
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,660
my main focus and pitches intellectual

822
00:32:23,589 --> 00:32:27,909
property people forget about the IP part

823
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:29,680
and about the fact of like we're all

824
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:31,660
talking when you work with these major

825
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,820
corporations now that's what I refer to

826
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:37,330
them as you know these huge farms that

827
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:39,939
can buy you ten times over and you do

828
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:42,250
all of their genetics for them well

829
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,350
that's their IP now and you forget that

830
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:47,769
and don't realize it you just lost your

831
00:32:44,349 --> 00:32:50,409
legs ya know it's 100 I mean the best

832
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:52,900
deal you can do as a grower is become

833
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:54,790
like a decent percentage owner that

834
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,259
makes it so that what you're doing is

835
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:57,700
for the for the bigger for the greater

836
00:32:56,259 --> 00:32:59,259
day yeah because if you're trying to

837
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,120
come in and and exactly what you're

838
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:03,190
saying like the minute you bring because

839
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,500
by law when you bring genetics into

840
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:07,509
their facility it's their thing there's

841
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:10,119
no way that you can argue that unless

842
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:11,379
you write it into your code even if you

843
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:13,179
do you're the one that broke the law

844
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:16,510
you're writing yourself out oh yeah I

845
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:18,430
ship plants across the country oh that's

846
00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:20,640
against the law so we gotta iso right

847
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,640
there

848
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,610
you can't see that you know when you're

849
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:25,210
trying to battle them in this in the

850
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:27,029
court of law

851
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:32,289
yeah yeah they're gonna win every time

852
00:33:27,029 --> 00:33:33,910
it's it's been definitely you know

853
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:35,019
proven over and over again I mean that's

854
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:38,259
one of the things that's the hardest

855
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:39,639
part as a as a grower or breeder in the

856
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:41,710
industry when I first came back to

857
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:43,840
America I was like convinced that you

858
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:45,519
know I was like this is gonna be you

859
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:47,589
know no problem and I just like hit a

860
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,779
roadblock after roadblock and it always

861
00:33:47,589 --> 00:33:51,699
came down to partnerships based on the

862
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:54,930
you know if unless you were working with

863
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:57,190
somebody that was 100% the owner

864
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:59,740
financier and all of the above

865
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:02,380
there's always that like oh by the way

866
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:03,910
so-and-so doesn't like this that or the

867
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:06,120
other and all of a sudden you know the

868
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:09,460
altie all deals are off and it really

869
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:12,909
it's sad but you know when you bring

870
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:14,440
genetics a living thing like that the

871
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:16,089
minute that they can replicate it

872
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,559
there's gonna do it and you know that's

873
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:19,360
gonna happen so you have to always

874
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:22,509
anticipate that and then when it comes

875
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:25,570
to like I said you know if you get

876
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:28,210
locked out and it's really hard to do

877
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:29,769
this recourse is hard so so what are you

878
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:32,440
guys thoughts on material transfer

879
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:33,880
agreements basically signing that you're

880
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,650
if you sell people see that they're not

881
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,230
gonna be breeding with it it's

882
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:39,369
impossible to do anything with you can't

883
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:41,349
it's like that it's like the Crawford

884
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:43,059
brothers is right now it's yeah there's

885
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:45,579
a good example where they got really Oh

886
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:47,920
everybody anybody who surprised it it

887
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:49,449
doesn't work the same thing with even

888
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,210
with Milo from being all the big hemp

889
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:54,009
comes Big Buddha Big Buddha tried to he

890
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:57,940
sent two letters of you know to anybody

891
00:34:54,010 --> 00:35:00,100
using any cheese of any type right

892
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:01,480
and I even just like I told him I was

893
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:04,420
like dude I'm doing fromage that's a

894
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:07,090
cheese sage cross what are you gonna do

895
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,010
about it right it's like nothing just

896
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:10,240
you know it's just him trying and like

897
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:11,350
it's one of those situations where I was

898
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,359
like well I didn't really I think I've

899
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:15,639
hurt your image in the industry more

900
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,460
than helped it because we're kind of all

901
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:20,589
in it to like we know Milo and Big

902
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:23,170
Buddha even though they didn't create it

903
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:25,690
they just it's like it wasn't even a

904
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:27,789
creation of theirs but I'll give it but

905
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:29,250
they promoted it they got it out there

906
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:31,800
it's just little me but

907
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:35,099
but when you start to say like anything

908
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,990
she's related which now you're stepping

909
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:39,179
into a whole other industry - so it's

910
00:35:36,989 --> 00:35:41,729
like what so now none of us can say you

911
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:44,219
know anything is like cheese cheddar

912
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:46,710
come on now you know we're saying we

913
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:48,089
were using people were it's amazing that

914
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,869
it didn't get used as a name for

915
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,340
cannabis lon

916
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:52,589
earlier I just made my own videos one of

917
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:55,230
those like oh Jesus why don't we live in

918
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:57,600
Holland - why were we not thinking of

919
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:59,519
this you know we we're the king of tons

920
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,089
it was the easiest it was Buddha bit the

921
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:04,769
easiest dream but in general I think you

922
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:06,809
know we're like we were saying earlier

923
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:08,340
it's really you can do all you should

924
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:09,539
trademark your stuff if you really

925
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,340
aren't confident that you're the first

926
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:12,900
person to do it and you have something

927
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,030
super original and it seems to be

928
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,039
valuable it's a good idea it's not very

929
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:18,840
enforceable and you may risk is

930
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:20,820
enforceable I think I think you could

931
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,410
probably as a big camel company making

932
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,360
seeds you could probably enforce it to a

933
00:36:22,409 --> 00:36:26,129
degree hemp is more enforceable because

934
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:29,120
it's recognized but yeah but either way

935
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:31,619
they're all still enforceable yeah my

936
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:33,900
patent and trademark attorney like he's

937
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:36,719
very much so explained to us how you can

938
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,970
enforce it but it comes down to the fact

939
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,489
are you're gonna spend $15,000 to

940
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:42,750
enforce you from using something yeah

941
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:44,219
you're not gonna spend that kind of

942
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:47,219
money and I gotta waste that money

943
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:49,139
it's the factor it's the trailer but if

944
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:50,669
so the thing is here you're always

945
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:52,319
losing when you know that I feel like

946
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:53,510
whenever you're on the attack like say

947
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,370
you're the guy was out there attacking

948
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:58,350
you're you're you're looking like an

949
00:36:56,369 --> 00:37:01,739
asshole damage our brand and you're also

950
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:03,509
not gonna win really you might get the

951
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:05,549
guy to like you know change the name if

952
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:07,770
he's smart which you know it's not a big

953
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:09,510
deal for the most part but your genetics

954
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:10,710
are already compromised at that point

955
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:12,480
and that's the way the people's a lot of

956
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:15,090
times don't get it they're like you know

957
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,159
to me is the names okay that's one thing

958
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:19,050
and names are actually easier to to

959
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:22,230
protect yeah cuz it's a name sure

960
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:23,760
genetics know there's DNA snippets and

961
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,619
you have actual markers on them you're

962
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,020
not gonna you have to have a genetically

963
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,989
modified planet to be able to protect it

964
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:32,800
as a patent of

965
00:37:28,989 --> 00:37:34,239
situate you can protect a cultivar with

966
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,410
the material transfer agreement that

967
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:37,509
just states that you're not going to

968
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:39,848
breed with their genetics and I guess I

969
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:41,050
think it's so unenforceable so you think

970
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:44,740
that they're not gonna breed with your

971
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:46,150
genetics what happens if they what is

972
00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:47,618
the question okay what was the question

973
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:48,789
to that what happens if they have a

974
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:50,619
hermie and all sudden they're whole

975
00:37:48,789 --> 00:37:51,880
rooms pollinated now they have shit

976
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:52,809
tense the seeds what are they supposed

977
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:59,349
to do throw them away

978
00:37:52,809 --> 00:38:01,329
oh sure it's the same ploy as it's a

979
00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:03,550
tough one because if so trademarked

980
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:06,279
markers within there yeah that's not my

981
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:07,869
major hundred thousand dollars worth of

982
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,980
research and I'm selling these seeds for

983
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:10,750
a dollar seed and I sell them to

984
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,880
somebody they buy fifty thousand dollars

985
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,469
for the seed then they replicate it and

986
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,349
they're selling the same exact seed

987
00:38:14,469 --> 00:38:20,739
there s wanting it or whatever yeah well

988
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:22,390
yeah as far as ethics I think your only

989
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:24,639
way you could protect yourself is if you

990
00:38:22,389 --> 00:38:26,199
did put those markers in uppercase' this

991
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:28,509
cost a bunch of money so you have to do

992
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:37,239
that and you have to that's the only way

993
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:39,670
otherwise you'd be like no no way I

994
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:41,979
could tell you like I could tell you I

995
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:45,720
guess I could give you a very strong

996
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:48,608
company organ not to go with because

997
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:52,750
he'll they'll give you nothing but th

998
00:38:48,608 --> 00:38:56,079
seeds Jade seeds the real thing but th

999
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:56,829
see nothing but it nothing but THC

1000
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:08,500
that's it

1001
00:38:56,829 --> 00:39:09,909
and it's hemp there's a lot of good yeah

1002
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,858
I mean I see you soon I've seen I've

1003
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:13,509
seen a lot of it depends on your depends

1004
00:39:11,858 --> 00:39:15,069
where you're located to like some things

1005
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,320
like the T one this year worked really

1006
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:19,800
well in Colorado and last year not so

1007
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,800
great so

1008
00:39:22,849 --> 00:39:25,980
[Music]

1009
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:35,779
yeah yeah well you know the thing too I

1010
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:38,269
think those people flout that are

1011
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:40,640
flowering him too long or a week too

1012
00:39:38,269 --> 00:39:42,800
long go above a point three level so

1013
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:45,409
it's not the hemp level on that part so

1014
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,760
we cute little tramp that doesn't get

1015
00:39:45,409 --> 00:39:51,500
hot though yeah and that's what we're

1016
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:53,570
like if we compared to the not hot I'm

1017
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:57,079
trying to get the inside lace what's not

1018
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:59,300
hot but if you look at cherry wine

1019
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:00,949
cherry wine for example so many

1020
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,570
different phenotypes of cherry wine but

1021
00:40:00,949 --> 00:40:04,609
there are phenotypes that do not go

1022
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:06,620
above 0.3 but I mean I feel like that's

1023
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,300
the same about the elektra hem that

1024
00:40:06,619 --> 00:40:10,190
you're talking about that's the most

1025
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:13,220
common hemp out on the string right now

1026
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:14,869
on the product for a CBD joint so it

1027
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:16,879
makes no sense of people who are

1028
00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:18,529
flowering that same hemp at home and

1029
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,269
it's a week or two too long

1030
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:22,190
I mean it's above that point three

1031
00:40:20,269 --> 00:40:23,630
especially if they're going through it

1032
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:25,309
we just haven't fully figured out the

1033
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:28,160
tomato industry has figured out Tomatoes

1034
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:30,349
over the last 50 years using them as an

1035
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,719
example just RT we're just scratching

1036
00:40:30,349 --> 00:40:35,809
the surface of this stuff I mean we're

1037
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:38,329
gonna have zero that's brand new

1038
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:40,969
industry I mean look at you know it has

1039
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:43,460
a zero THC that comes out zero the whole

1040
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:45,949
time so it's gen can f from Kentucky

1041
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:48,619
oh I mean there's other you can also

1042
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:52,460
spray your plants with snow we have this

1043
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:54,650
very sugar water and it's it's like the

1044
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:57,230
CVG decided offensive people that are

1045
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:59,450
specialized in CBD and you have to find

1046
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:04,010
that one cultivar really replicate the

1047
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:08,089
absolute shit out of that and also where

1048
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:13,430
do we look to for the future of the CBD

1049
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:14,570
hemp give it about two years and well

1050
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:19,519
just don't put all your eggs in one

1051
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:21,380
basket with anything no se just just

1052
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,570
like yeah you know take into account

1053
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:25,039
that way if you run hot and you have one

1054
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:26,870
strain in the field and you're gonna

1055
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:28,389
take down that whole thing so think

1056
00:41:26,869 --> 00:41:30,859
along the line of carbon carbon

1057
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:31,730
compartment analyzing your situation and

1058
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,079
having the

1059
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:34,849
different fields doing different things

1060
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:36,289
and taking you know because the problem

1061
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:37,789
is it's also if you're trying to grow a

1062
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:38,809
smokeable hip or you're trying to go

1063
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:40,160
biomass if you're trying to grow a

1064
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:42,859
biomass or if you're trying to grow

1065
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,509
other cannabinoids besides CBD there's

1066
00:41:42,858 --> 00:41:46,548
other flower you can take stuff way

1067
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:48,349
earlier to guarantee that you're not

1068
00:41:46,548 --> 00:41:49,639
gonna have it and don't try to like ride

1069
00:41:48,349 --> 00:41:51,920
that line because there's a lot of times

1070
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:53,420
you know we're not trying to get the

1071
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,470
same end result unless you are trying to

1072
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,510
get smokeable flow and if you're trying

1073
00:41:54,469 --> 00:41:58,459
to get smokeable flower I would just do

1074
00:41:56,510 --> 00:42:00,380
cult I would do clone only in

1075
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:04,760
greenhouses that way I know exactly

1076
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:06,680
what's going on yes I love seeds even

1077
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,510
though I love suits you just be safer

1078
00:42:06,679 --> 00:42:10,669
right now the clones to us that come

1079
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:12,380
from I see is the wild you get it right

1080
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:17,869
to the market you like I know your

1081
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:21,019
breathe into a source as my source is

1082
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:24,710
right here yeah yeah

1083
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:26,239
but gee you know the villagey yeah and I

1084
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,940
think you know right now like CBG is a

1085
00:42:26,239 --> 00:42:31,098
big cannabinoid that you know it

1086
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:34,309
followed the same trend as CBD as far as

1087
00:42:31,099 --> 00:42:36,349
a kilo of CBD two years ago is worth

1088
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:37,760
about twenty thousand right and now it's

1089
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:40,548
worth about twenty two hundred or two

1090
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:44,480
thousand say yeah that's ten times drop

1091
00:42:40,548 --> 00:42:46,429
in two years CVG was sixty thousand last

1092
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,710
year and it's already twenty thousand

1093
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:49,909
it'll be ten it's gonna drop yeah just

1094
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:53,720
like everything else and so everybody

1095
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:56,719
keeps like oh yeah these guys in Oregon

1096
00:42:53,719 --> 00:42:58,009
now have a CBD cultivar that is you know

1097
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:03,739
test between nine and fifteen percent

1098
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:07,839
which is what string elektra Oh 30

1099
00:43:03,739 --> 00:43:11,298
percent no 37 I mean like our bollocks

1100
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:11,869
our bollocks MC it's 18 percent 16

1101
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:14,028
percent

1102
00:43:11,869 --> 00:43:15,500
yeah like 17 18 seems to be like the

1103
00:43:14,028 --> 00:43:22,760
kind of coasting line for a lot of this

1104
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:26,510
stuff there's some little pops here but

1105
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:28,609
then yours yeah you're probably at that

1106
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:33,980
point I would imagine you are yeah but a

1107
00:43:28,608 --> 00:43:37,619
viagra for CVD my dicks are so there's a

1108
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:41,990
lot of convert from CBD now is a joke

1109
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:41,989
that was Joe he repeat the joke

1110
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:47,970
so CBD basically is a precursor and you

1111
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:52,920
can convert that into other cannabinoids

1112
00:43:47,969 --> 00:43:56,339
and CBD can now be converted to THC

1113
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,349
using enzymes so technically ship world

1114
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:03,120
shipping for cannabis is no longer an

1115
00:43:58,349 --> 00:44:04,409
issue you ship as hemp and CBD that's

1116
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,719
gonna say it's kind of funny cuz you as

1117
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:09,539
you're saying that there's enzymes you

1118
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:11,879
can put on the plant in the field and

1119
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:13,860
completely knock out THC also there's

1120
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,050
guys we were working on there's a group

1121
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,760
in Hawaii right now and they claim

1122
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:21,150
they're out of Oregon but now they're in

1123
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,250
Hawaii because the thing is the all

1124
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:25,470
around the like anywhere that's got

1125
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:28,170
really good growing conditions it's very

1126
00:44:25,469 --> 00:44:29,519
hard to keep your shit below like 1% you

1127
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:31,500
know I mean it just wants to spike

1128
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:34,710
because of the conditions being so

1129
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:36,210
perfect so whoo I had a few people that

1130
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:38,220
actually had lines this is most of them

1131
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:40,650
ran hot last year too just like a lot of

1132
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:42,839
places so the yeah they're sort of

1133
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:44,220
testing that there and that's a

1134
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:47,490
game-changer in itself because you could

1135
00:44:44,219 --> 00:44:50,189
take straight-up THC strain and then in

1136
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:53,519
the field hit it hard and have all those

1137
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:54,900
Terps but not have any THC on the final

1138
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:56,699
product so there's I think we're gonna

1139
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,740
come up just like anything we're gonna

1140
00:44:56,699 --> 00:45:02,339
kind of slip our way around as much as

1141
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:03,929
we can and just the ability to grow on a

1142
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:07,110
scale that we're finally able to grow on

1143
00:45:03,929 --> 00:45:09,210
just creates more bigger ideas and

1144
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:12,240
bigger you know bigger moves that we can

1145
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:13,530
hopefully do and stay one step ahead

1146
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:14,759
would you we're just scratching the

1147
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:17,310
surface of all this stuff it's like

1148
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:19,830
we're just learning how to cultivate

1149
00:45:17,309 --> 00:45:22,259
properly and how to breed properly and

1150
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:26,039
use marker assistant breathing I'm you

1151
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:27,780
know I believe GMO has its place

1152
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:28,440
potentially I compared to like brain

1153
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:30,810
surgery

1154
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,519
how if you're they were scared of brain

1155
00:45:30,809 --> 00:45:34,199
surgery when people started doing it and

1156
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:36,090
GMO might not be the solution we

1157
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:37,319
probably who knows if we even have to do

1158
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:39,840
in our lifetime I mean we can use

1159
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:42,090
analytical driven breeding and marker

1160
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:45,240
driven breathing without actually

1161
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:46,829
editing the genes but I mean we're just

1162
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:49,549
scratching the surface of other stuff

1163
00:45:46,829 --> 00:45:50,630
now we're like dedi Miri out of Israel

1164
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:53,030
he's doing a lot of clinical research

1165
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:54,950
he's the number one cancer clinical

1166
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:57,320
research scientist in the world

1167
00:45:54,949 --> 00:46:00,469
and he's comparing it all with different

1168
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:02,480
cannabinoid profiles and chemo typing

1169
00:46:00,469 --> 00:46:03,919
which is basically going in looking at

1170
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,690
the chemical expression of the plant and

1171
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,000
how it works with people's bodies and

1172
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:10,460
we're just you know he discovered all

1173
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,840
these receptors before we only had to

1174
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:15,019
they thought we had cb1 and cb2

1175
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:16,579
receptors now from cb1 and cb2 receptors

1176
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:18,940
they have 28 other like nuclear

1177
00:46:16,579 --> 00:46:23,119
receptors in our body that actually

1178
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:24,650
interact with cannabinoids and so and

1179
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,549
that's just the if you have flavonoids

1180
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:27,829
there's a whole other thing that we

1181
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:30,140
really don't talk about but that is what

1182
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:32,809
they believe will help cure pancreatic

1183
00:46:30,139 --> 00:46:34,789
cancer and so even from a medical side

1184
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:36,529
we're just really scratching the surface

1185
00:46:34,789 --> 00:46:38,119
of what's possible ten years from now

1186
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:39,560
we'll have a lot more of that figured

1187
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:41,329
out but I still don't believe we'll have

1188
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:42,769
it all figured out there's no way cuz

1189
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:44,929
they would just like you're saying ten

1190
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:47,030
years ago it was as illegal as it can

1191
00:46:44,929 --> 00:46:48,889
get you know there wasn't clinical

1192
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:51,350
trials there was an actual labs that

1193
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:53,869
were testing I mean there were but they

1194
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:55,489
were just starting out you know

1195
00:46:53,869 --> 00:46:56,480
well universities I mean that's where I

1196
00:46:55,489 --> 00:46:58,250
guess that's where it's really

1197
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,460
interesting because you know they're

1198
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:03,230
getting grants to study something that

1199
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,789
should have been studied a lot the last

1200
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:07,159
time with for the last 75 years have

1201
00:47:04,789 --> 00:47:09,739
been sort of only studying it on a

1202
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:12,409
negative you know looking for negative

1203
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:14,899
results not even like warning positive

1204
00:47:12,409 --> 00:47:16,519
results and now it's pretty interesting

1205
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,829
for if you think about like a young kid

1206
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:21,139
going into college and he has an option

1207
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:23,389
to really take cannabis on the next

1208
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:25,369
level serious from a from a biological

1209
00:47:23,389 --> 00:47:28,400
point of view and and I think they're

1210
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:30,199
gonna have you know think about the the

1211
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,990
50 thousand ways that they already knew

1212
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:36,199
what to use him for and then add into

1213
00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:38,059
that also these high cannabinoid plants

1214
00:47:36,199 --> 00:47:39,109
which nobody was really the minute they

1215
00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:42,049
were out there but nobody was really

1216
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:46,730
focusing on them so now we have a whole

1217
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:47,580
arsenal of potential compounds coming

1218
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,929
out of that

1219
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:52,679
there's just leave the Cure's well

1220
00:47:49,929 --> 00:47:54,489
they're gonna be like epically you know

1221
00:47:52,679 --> 00:47:56,259
beyond anything that we're even

1222
00:47:54,489 --> 00:47:59,979
comprehending when it comes to like when

1223
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:02,260
you see how simple some of those things

1224
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:04,090
like with him for instance because also

1225
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:06,070
that's again like with him cannabis be

1226
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:08,230
it's the same thing and imagine when we

1227
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:11,440
grow like the ultimate plan which is a

1228
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:13,809
high THC high CBD high fiber content

1229
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,639
high you know

1230
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:17,049
cellulose con everything of all the

1231
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:20,409
above like oh and it has all the other

1232
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:21,940
cannabinoids in it oh and it's feet tall

1233
00:48:20,409 --> 00:48:23,409
and it does you know there's always

1234
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,510
things we have an evap because we're

1235
00:48:23,409 --> 00:48:28,149
still trying to separate the differences

1236
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:30,369
but they're all in there and so there's

1237
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:31,690
a pretty exciting like the next 10 years

1238
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:33,579
are gonna be awesome it's gonna be

1239
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:35,590
finally when people get over the whole

1240
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:38,319
CBD craze they're gonna get more into

1241
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:40,750
bio plastics and you know because that's

1242
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:43,420
something that I think is the next big

1243
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:44,679
problem in you know in the world is

1244
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:46,420
everyone's gonna be on the same tip

1245
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:47,559
where it's like yeah this plastic

1246
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:49,720
situation is getting a little out of

1247
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:52,480
control what else can we use and you

1248
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:54,489
know Legos has already said that they're

1249
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,969
gonna replace all of their Legos with

1250
00:48:54,489 --> 00:48:58,299
leha

1251
00:48:54,969 --> 00:49:00,608
have bioplastic by 2030 and that's like

1252
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:02,190
you know that's huge right there when

1253
00:49:00,608 --> 00:49:05,190
you think about a company like that so

1254
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:07,179
that's kind of where I'm excited even

1255
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:09,880
you know as much as I'm excited about

1256
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:13,449
cannabis in general that whole next

1257
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:14,980
generation of like house is built out of

1258
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:16,329
it and the car is driving on it and all

1259
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:26,440
of you know that's that's where we're

1260
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:29,829
gonna be going commercial people should

1261
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:32,710
be hitting you guys up no I mean right I

1262
00:49:29,829 --> 00:49:34,750
mean commercial growers and commercial

1263
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:38,289
farms are contacting I would assume you

1264
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:43,269
James for bulk seed and proceed right

1265
00:49:38,289 --> 00:49:45,099
yeah it's happy but I don't I've stayed

1266
00:49:43,269 --> 00:49:46,449
away from bulk hemp seeds just for that

1267
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:48,010
reason because

1268
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:49,568
a wine was hot and I don't want to be

1269
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:52,420
responsible for somebody's losing their

1270
00:49:49,568 --> 00:49:54,400
crop of my yeah so I wasn't I wasn't I

1271
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,409
haven't I didn't step into that field

1272
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,059
there was my expertise and I throw those

1273
00:49:56,409 --> 00:49:59,828
things they sell something I can back up

1274
00:49:58,059 --> 00:50:01,599
and I can see results I see paperwork

1275
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:03,789
and I do my Danvers to get the bottom of

1276
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:08,410
things and that organ company you speak

1277
00:50:03,789 --> 00:50:10,778
of I've talked with them yeah and I just

1278
00:50:08,409 --> 00:50:12,159
I never wanted that on my conscience and

1279
00:50:10,778 --> 00:50:14,318
I asked some way they feel to get tossed

1280
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:16,629
so as I've never sold them for that

1281
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:18,460
reason so we we stayed out of that we do

1282
00:50:16,630 --> 00:50:20,380
some bulk film stock and book the other

1283
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:22,630
to see it's but we haven't gotten into

1284
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:23,890
him it's just because okay I've got one

1285
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:25,240
company I work with and they've got

1286
00:50:23,889 --> 00:50:27,308
three years with the COAS

1287
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:29,768
so he's been doing it for a long time in

1288
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:33,700
Maine that doesn't that's the best Coast

1289
00:50:29,768 --> 00:50:35,979
guy best coach genetics he uses not a

1290
00:50:33,699 --> 00:50:49,899
box trained beacons get you're speaking

1291
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:51,730
up so when all of us have emceed lines

1292
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:54,099
is just yeah the proofs in the pudding I

1293
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:55,630
mean I mean permanently we got like

1294
00:50:54,099 --> 00:50:57,609
seven hempseed lines you know we have a

1295
00:50:55,630 --> 00:50:59,440
literally seven different varietals that

1296
00:50:57,608 --> 00:51:03,690
week we put out and have wave see aways

1297
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:08,559
for all of it but no bow acts

1298
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:10,150
Electra autos all these just coming out

1299
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,710
you know Auto hamster yeah they have a

1300
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,660
long ways to go but just like how

1301
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:18,759
there's two autos there's Oh Tootie Oh

1302
00:51:13,659 --> 00:51:21,368
would ya no boss no as far as flower

1303
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:23,528
auto flowers I said gotcha

1304
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:24,789
it has a lot of potential like we

1305
00:51:23,528 --> 00:51:26,139
haven't figured it out if you really

1306
00:51:24,789 --> 00:51:28,960
want like a little hollow flower hem

1307
00:51:26,139 --> 00:51:35,139
plan yep and then you what you do is you

1308
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:38,559
put in harvesting you're like July 19

1309
00:51:35,139 --> 00:51:40,778
you can plant 10,000 per acre and so you

1310
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,339
plant more but the thing is is we're

1311
00:51:40,778 --> 00:51:43,900
working on getting these CBD level

1312
00:51:42,338 --> 00:51:45,759
higher that's the big thing is getting

1313
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:48,430
because right now Otto flowers are

1314
00:51:45,759 --> 00:51:52,449
somewhere between 5 and 10% for CBD and

1315
00:51:48,429 --> 00:51:54,608
I think that's gonna evolve into 18 to

1316
00:51:52,449 --> 00:51:55,849
20% CBD in the future but it's gonna

1317
00:51:54,608 --> 00:51:59,480
require a lot of breeding

1318
00:51:55,849 --> 00:52:01,789
a a lot of selection a lot of selection

1319
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:04,940
has a lot of work a lot of money testing

1320
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:08,179
I totally believe it's possible because

1321
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:11,349
I saw Otto flowers in 2012 I went saw

1322
00:52:08,179 --> 00:52:14,449
all the airs Otto flowers in Spain and

1323
00:52:11,349 --> 00:52:17,360
they sucked they were really they were

1324
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:19,369
they were this tall lowering and yeah

1325
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:21,320
they were he was so the further away you

1326
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:22,719
get from Morales the better it gets and

1327
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,890
the stuff that's auto-fire now is

1328
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:33,319
unbelievable and you're getting stuff to

1329
00:52:24,889 --> 00:52:35,089
test high 20s the Buddha's doing some

1330
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:37,280
good stuff for sure Mephisto is killing

1331
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:40,280
a fist oh it's know for sure but even

1332
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:43,010
though stuff I'm doing with with my

1333
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:45,650
buddy Nick good open source we're doing

1334
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:47,750
stuff together so we're cursing some

1335
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:49,039
Otto flowers and we're testing really

1336
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:51,170
high you know we're just testing stuff

1337
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:53,119
in the 20s with our Otto flowers and the

1338
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:55,059
deal is is it's not right for everybody

1339
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,139
it's not right for every situation but

1340
00:52:55,059 --> 00:52:58,940
for people that want to get multiple

1341
00:52:57,139 --> 00:53:01,519
harvests in a year that are willing to

1342
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:03,860
invest in fifteen to twenty thousand

1343
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:05,869
seeds per acre that might be the ideal

1344
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:08,059
solution you know it's it's not a

1345
00:53:05,869 --> 00:53:11,389
one-size-fits-all solution there is no

1346
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:13,429
one-size-fits-all solution yeah it's an

1347
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:16,069
option it's an option I am Alaska who

1348
00:53:13,429 --> 00:53:17,329
needs it and it's a lot of situations

1349
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:19,519
that actually need it though to where

1350
00:53:17,329 --> 00:53:21,860
it's just like they're there you can't

1351
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:23,210
rely on then like especially bringing in

1352
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:25,780
a cultivar that's never grown in a

1353
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:29,059
region like Colorado's got some pretty

1354
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:32,210
pretty intense weather there's lethal

1355
00:53:29,059 --> 00:53:35,299
came in and grew I went to one farm that

1356
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:37,130
had 16 pivots each pivot was 240 acres

1357
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:40,519
so we're talking about 1800 acres of

1358
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:43,570
hemp all within a few it's a 15 and a

1359
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:46,309
half square mile area just packed and

1360
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:47,390
but next door to them was another 2,000

1361
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:49,279
acres of guys who were growing

1362
00:53:47,389 --> 00:53:51,980
industrial him and they were just

1363
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:54,290
letting stuff just blow across the thing

1364
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:55,820
so it was like wow you guys are not

1365
00:53:54,289 --> 00:53:57,679
arrowing any smokeable hemp here I'm

1366
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:59,809
sorry everything is seated they couldn't

1367
00:53:57,679 --> 00:54:01,649
had a hard time taking that one but in

1368
00:53:59,809 --> 00:54:03,389
general it's just you know

1369
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:14,910
yeah the scale that people are growing

1370
00:54:03,389 --> 00:54:19,049
now there's tsunamis of pollings I gotta

1371
00:54:14,909 --> 00:54:21,000
fly the Caribbean for work boy this is a

1372
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:22,200
because the collapse this is our collab

1373
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,820
that we're doing together so these are

1374
00:54:22,199 --> 00:54:28,169
some of the samples that were grown and

1375
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:30,450
for Adam to try out you know we

1376
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:31,829
basically hard time ABC it's a year ago

1377
00:54:30,449 --> 00:54:34,879
yeah it's a tough job right

1378
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:37,049
somebody's gonna smoke them all and I

1379
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,820
basically make stuff and I make sure

1380
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:41,070
it's tested before it's ever released so

1381
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:43,289
I want it grown out by multiple people

1382
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:45,809
we do cos we did everything in compare

1383
00:54:43,289 --> 00:54:47,130
so yeah so ours it's a sage and sour I

1384
00:54:45,809 --> 00:54:53,070
was talking about earlier how I used

1385
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:55,650
three males instead of one no its agents

1386
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:57,180
our sage and sour so sage and sour the

1387
00:54:55,650 --> 00:54:59,820
first time I saw it was a Harborside of

1388
00:54:57,179 --> 00:55:02,909
maybe 2008 I really fell in love with

1389
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:04,740
the I like sours my allowed seeds that

1390
00:55:02,909 --> 00:55:08,250
me and my friends started it was based

1391
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:11,159
on Sour Diesel like love sour and so

1392
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:12,840
sage and sour was this kind of like sour

1393
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:15,539
it has this the the won't the pheno they

1394
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:17,700
had was it was a little more wispy but

1395
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:19,529
it was like super greasy and a group big

1396
00:55:17,699 --> 00:55:21,179
it didn't yield as good as sour or

1397
00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:24,780
anything like that but the taste was

1398
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:26,219
like lemon funk with the it I fell in

1399
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,660
love with it and let you it's like that

1400
00:55:26,219 --> 00:55:30,779
lemon funk with a little bit of that

1401
00:55:27,659 --> 00:55:32,489
sage in there and so Adam and I kind of

1402
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:34,170
I decided I was gonna make seeds and I

1403
00:55:32,489 --> 00:55:36,119
talked to Adam about doing a collab and

1404
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:37,980
so I wanted to do some interesting

1405
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:40,980
crosses with it and I wanted to give

1406
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:43,829
people the most availability for the f

1407
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:46,380
ones for selections of their own and so

1408
00:55:43,829 --> 00:55:49,079
like this one right here this is a la

1409
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:53,910
antidote from FC genetics from our buddy

1410
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:56,130
at FC I got his twenty to one it's your

1411
00:55:53,909 --> 00:55:59,279
buddy did I met that I got some clothes

1412
00:55:56,130 --> 00:56:01,500
off and he he's he has some good stuff

1413
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:03,090
but yeah so this was his LA antidote the

1414
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,769
he made and I put it on this agent sour

1415
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:09,480
and it has some amazing check that up

1416
00:56:06,769 --> 00:56:12,329
there's two fie nose of it here so will

1417
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,309
grow and will do selections like I went

1418
00:56:12,329 --> 00:56:14,569
to Arizona work

1419
00:56:13,309 --> 00:56:16,610
with the company out there we did

1420
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:18,830
selections on starting with a thousand

1421
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:20,990
seeds narrowed it down to 120 from the

1422
00:56:18,829 --> 00:56:22,309
120 after we pulled out the males and

1423
00:56:20,989 --> 00:56:26,329
the herbs and everything else we

1424
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:28,460
selected about 35 and they still they're

1425
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:31,309
keeping the 120 but like we do analytics

1426
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:32,780
we do smoking you got it the analytics

1427
00:56:31,309 --> 00:56:37,400
don't tell the whole story no matter how

1428
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:40,130
much so yeah so the skosh from Duke

1429
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,750
diamond cry we put that on there and

1430
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,170
that has like that old school skunk

1431
00:56:41,750 --> 00:56:43,909
stuff

1432
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:45,920
and if you smell it it smells just like

1433
00:56:43,909 --> 00:56:52,819
cantaloupe you get fresh cantaloupe on

1434
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:58,039
this you're living vicariously through

1435
00:56:52,820 --> 00:57:03,440
our nose yeah no you know most agents

1436
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:09,380
our eyes gym shoes cuz this stuff stinks

1437
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:11,510
it has like that Bo from the Kennedy I

1438
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:15,289
got some fie nose of that and someone

1439
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:18,020
came out lemony some came out Kimmy we

1440
00:57:15,289 --> 00:57:20,989
got a little diversity with them yeah I

1441
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:22,699
like the fact that you didn't pick a

1442
00:57:20,989 --> 00:57:25,189
super dominant male either so it's like

1443
00:57:22,699 --> 00:57:27,379
this is all all flavors

1444
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:29,450
representativeness yeah sometimes when

1445
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:31,670
you use a male that has a jack in it or

1446
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:33,529
