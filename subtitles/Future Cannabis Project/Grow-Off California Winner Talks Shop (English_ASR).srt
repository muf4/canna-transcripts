2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:08,820
you won the SoCal grow off last year and

3
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:10,980
where did the genetics come from those

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,679
from dark heart nursery I think was the

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,539
grapefruit in the romulan then that was

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,448
but but you didn't know it at the time

7
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:22,768
no no I mean everybody had their ideas

8
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:25,199
but we were way off we get - it was

9
00:00:22,768 --> 00:00:27,118
funny because when we got there we

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,650
didn't have at the money order so to

11
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,719
find the money order we went on a

12
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:33,509
mission walking four blocks to find a

13
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:38,219
place so by the time we got there it was

14
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:41,699
it was funny because I'd saw heavy tea

15
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:44,719
or Tyler at the time and this is just

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,399
before we started doing the podcast and

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,340
it was always fun for me I think that

18
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,870
whole contest was really for me to see

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,739
what I could do against him in my mind

20
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:57,780
so it was a fun little aspect to that I

21
00:00:54,738 --> 00:01:01,259
just see them pop up randomly you get

22
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:04,349
two clones and you bring them back and

23
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:07,500
not knowing what it is how does that

24
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:09,359
affect you in terms of a growth it's

25
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,090
just like being a chef I would consider

26
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:14,549
it it's like I like to cook and I think

27
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,618
that a lot of good chefs out there you

28
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:18,900
can give them a different stovetop you

29
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:22,170
can give them a different pan and they

30
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,080
know enough to where like looking at how

31
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:26,340
it's searing looking at how it's cooking

32
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,009
they already know when it's close to

33
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,560
done just by feeling it and you know to

34
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,079
me you know part of being a good growers

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,990
experience so over the years it's

36
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,908
knowing little things like that is

37
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:41,009
knowing the plant structure as it grows

38
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,479
I knew immediately it wasn't a very

39
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:48,090
stretchy plant will call it it was

40
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,609
definitely a long veg but in that long

41
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,649
veg I think with you know different

42
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:54,688
varieties of strains they would grow a

43
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,579
lot more lankier in that time period

44
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,609
which was a nice thing that it states so

45
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:01,500
squat because for me at the beginning I

46
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:04,739
thought the whole contest was based on

47
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:07,170
who can grow the biggest plant you know

48
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:10,799
and for me it was just I think

49
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:14,459
everybody's mindset and in I don't know

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,709
since like 2010 yield you know everybody

51
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,539
it was big thing to hit two pounds

52
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:20,219
alight and then people were hitting

53
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,378
three pounds of light you know and it

54
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:25,919
was a big thing for people so for me it

55
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:27,750
was like okay I started out growing big

56
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,719
plants originally because when I would

57
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,818
have a personal grow you know to be

58
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:36,239
perfectly legal it was six plants in

59
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:38,669
California so I was like okay well six

60
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,099
plants one plant per light I got six

61
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:43,500
lights here we go you know most people

62
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:47,549
are thinking oh I'll put six plants

63
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:51,269
under one light it then it became okay

64
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:53,969
so we're able to grow and and for me

65
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:55,379
everybody learns from somebody I'm not

66
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:58,139
gonna say the guy's name cuz he was a

67
00:02:55,378 --> 00:02:59,489
rule I call him old man chicory but he

68
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,639
was a family dude you would have never

69
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:04,769
thought this guy Groupon it and I

70
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,539
remember walking into his garden for the

71
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:08,550
first time and it felt like a scene out

72
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:11,370
of Jurassic Park like I've been growing

73
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:13,620
for a long point to that time and to see

74
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,890
somebody growing these monster plants

75
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,900
that were just kind of trellis tout and

76
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:23,458
just these huge colas I was just it blew

77
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,950
my mind and you know I think when I saw

78
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,890
that I was like oh this makes sense and

79
00:03:25,949 --> 00:03:31,229
we started to grow any genetic one plant

80
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:32,939
for light and just knowing the veg x of

81
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:35,908
them and how to manipulate the plant

82
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:38,759
that we just need to fill that 4x4

83
00:03:35,908 --> 00:03:40,408
square under that thousand watt and and

84
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,509
we knew that we're gonna get at least a

85
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:45,899
pound and a half to two plus pounds off

86
00:03:42,509 --> 00:03:48,329
this one plant and you know between two

87
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:52,590
people we could have 12 plants you know

88
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:56,840
and it was kind of a loophole for us in

89
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:58,979
a sense you know most people like for me

90
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,009
sometimes like people smoke

91
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:04,048
I think chain smoke cigarettes it's not

92
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:06,959
that I change smoke but I love to smoke

93
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:09,989
just the act of it so if I'm medicating

94
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,989
I think that you know unless I grew

95
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:15,090
enough it wouldn't have been worth it to

96
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:17,579
me to just grow one light and six plants

97
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,280
after seeing this it just blew my mind

98
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,379
when I saw the contest I was like okay

99
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,098
I've been doing this forever this is

100
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:27,960
gonna be easy

101
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:32,250
so you know I think that everybody was

102
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:35,878
so focused on the quality and in the the

103
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:39,300
potency and these other aspects as Minh

104
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,800
to the results because we yield it's so

105
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,689
much more than even the second-place

106
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,210
competitor I think maybe they got a half

107
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:47,430
a pound and we got almost four pounds

108
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:49,529
off this one plant which it was cool to

109
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,439
see the Colorado contest kind of step it

110
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:53,668
up I saw even before this contest a lot

111
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:55,978
of people were really focusing on

112
00:04:53,668 --> 00:05:01,139
getting these huge yields off one plant

113
00:04:55,978 --> 00:05:04,050
and I think that's really cool that you

114
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,579
know for me most people have always said

115
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:07,288
oh don't grow a big plant because it

116
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:09,060
wouldn't be as potent as a plant that's

117
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:11,158
smaller and there's philosophies where

118
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,189
people would say well growing a smaller

119
00:05:11,158 --> 00:05:17,129
more compact plant takes that plants

120
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:18,839
energy and and puts all of this into one

121
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:23,580
smaller bud meaning it may be more

122
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:25,288
potent here say and I know that we

123
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:28,468
stretched it right to the deadline when

124
00:05:25,288 --> 00:05:31,589
we when we we turn it in I think even

125
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:34,860
the product we turned in was it was

126
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:36,119
unflushed because it was I I think it's

127
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,098
still needed at least about another

128
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,288
seven to ten days before we pulled the

129
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:43,139
plant but because of the deadline with

130
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:44,968
se labs and the the laws everybody's

131
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,750
hands were tied we had to do it by the

132
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:51,689
31st so you know still being able to get

133
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,598
third place and potency in fourth place

134
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:55,889
and the terpenes it was huge to me

135
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:59,250
because I know we didn't finish the

136
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:02,250
plant how we wanted to but the the yield

137
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:05,009
was just what over three pounds over

138
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:07,620
even second place I was like that to me

139
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:11,098
spoke a lot because you got situations

140
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:15,000
like you know I talked with people that

141
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:17,399
are in Michigan and having a large full

142
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,228
mature plant count stipulation where you

143
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:21,718
don't see that the same in other states

144
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:23,878
while being able to grow larger plants

145
00:06:21,718 --> 00:06:26,069
is a huge advantage for people like that

146
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,360
because then you're actually increasing

147
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:30,879
the amount they're able to produce as

148
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,439
well so you know

149
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,060
it was a cool way that I guess she'll

150
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:38,379
showcase something that I've been doing

151
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,819
for a long time and you know I've been

152
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:41,290
the guy that worked behind the counter

153
00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:44,469
in the Hydra store and you're always

154
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:46,450
giving people advice and I was always

155
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,760
that crazy guy that would grow one plant

156
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:50,529
for light and you know they'll be like

157
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:51,670
no show him a picture of it drums show

158
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:53,379
him a picture and I would show people

159
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:56,350
pictures and then just blow their mind

160
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:58,750
that you can do this so you know I think

161
00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:00,340
a lot of you know what people don't

162
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,370
believe is possible is because they've

163
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:05,769
never seen it and I think the more this

164
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,569
competition actually grows they're gonna

165
00:07:05,769 --> 00:07:10,240
be able to actually bring people in

166
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:12,040
there with cameras and and really go

167
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,379
into detail about their growing

168
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,580
practices and let's be honest some

169
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:19,689
people aren't gonna give away all their

170
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:21,879
secrets you know for me growing at least

171
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,920
cannabis has always been about for what

172
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:27,459
I could do for my sister who passed away

173
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:30,069
from cancer you know at the time we had

174
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:32,169
dispensaries but it wasn't tested and it

175
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:33,730
wasn't as strict and you knew that there

176
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:35,140
was harsh chemicals and there was things

177
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,520
that we didn't even know to this day

178
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:38,199
that were happening that we could have

179
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:40,719
prevented for people to get the cleanest

180
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:43,860
medicine and for me to do that was to

181
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,540
grow it for her and she wasn't a smoker

182
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,819
basically so you know exactly what's in

183
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:50,950
it yeah absolutely you know that it's

184
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:53,259
the peace of mind and not many people

185
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:56,019
get that experience you get something

186
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:58,180
we'll call it stepped on you never have

187
00:07:56,019 --> 00:08:01,240
the opportunity to get quality medicine

188
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:03,670
right from the grower themselves right

189
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,530
to you it's very rare for people to have

190
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:07,960
that experience because even in today's

191
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:09,759
date you have a product that's being

192
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:12,370
produced at a legal you know clean

193
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,500
facility then that products then being

194
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,379
sent for testing and by the time it's

195
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:20,500
packaged it's been touched and and moved

196
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:22,870
so many times that you lose kind of to

197
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,300
me that visual aspect of quality that

198
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,740
you get when you you actually get it

199
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,569
right from the source it's just like

200
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,370
anything that's fresh there's there's a

201
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:32,429
slight and subtle difference that only

202
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,080
the people that would know will know and

203
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:38,379
that's the thing that people need to be

204
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:41,229
educated about and for me to grow clean

205
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:43,509
cannabis you know I've always wanted to

206
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,550
do as clean as possible and it always

207
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:46,919
didn't make sense

208
00:08:44,549 --> 00:08:49,169
well we have an indoor grow but we're

209
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,599
gonna take outdoor elements like cocoa

210
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:54,059
or soil and bring them indoors to me

211
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,580
that wasn't necessarily a the most

212
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:58,579
sterile thing that I could do as far as

213
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:00,899
a common sense factor to me is I

214
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:05,160
wouldn't take something that necessarily

215
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:07,950
is for instance cocoa core they they let

216
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:09,958
it sit out doors it gets heated they

217
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:12,300
turn it you know it doesn't matter it

218
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:14,969
shipped around these are things that are

219
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:16,859
not necessarily isolated to know that

220
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,480
that was probably in a processing

221
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,419
facility where they have rats running

222
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,129
around the floor and to me rockwool

223
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:25,319
because it's fun it's such a high heat

224
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:28,289
level I think they say it's at 700 some

225
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,420
long degrees you have a very sterile

226
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:32,669
substrate to me that comes from an

227
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:35,399
organic source being it's it's spun rock

228
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:38,219
come down into like a cotton candy kind

229
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,559
of substrate so is that your preferred

230
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,589
grow media I think so just because of

231
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:46,859
the sterility of it it's it do we factor

232
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:50,130
in ecological and environmental factors

233
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,769
I think you know with that there's a lot

234
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:55,250
of water consumption savings in benefit

235
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:57,569
to that because you're able to

236
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,740
necessarily not use the abundance of

237
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,320
water you would have in deep water

238
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,389
culture under current systems where they

239
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,640
use an ample amount of water and at the

240
00:10:03,389 --> 00:10:07,828
end of the cycle or for that reservoir

241
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:10,049
change you have excess water that you're

242
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:13,019
dumping down the drain so when people

243
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:15,479
here drained away systems or feeding

244
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:17,370
systems that wastewater because there's

245
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,320
actual runoff coming out of the bottom

246
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:20,970
of the pond you have to really think

247
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,829
about how much water it took to saturate

248
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,950
those plants how much water you're

249
00:10:22,828 --> 00:10:27,870
actually wasting in versus you know

250
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,810
people use what 40 to 50 gallon

251
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,250
reservoirs per 4 by 8 table in old

252
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:34,679
school days doing these flood and drain

253
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,909
systems when to me that's it doesn't

254
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:36,958
seem logical because they're topping

255
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:38,189
that off through the week and then

256
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,689
they're just dumping it down the drain

257
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,449
and that's a lot of wasted water and

258
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:45,720
nutrients and you know depending on how

259
00:10:42,448 --> 00:10:47,309
that setup different states have laws

260
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,750
and stipulations about the chemicals

261
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:52,109
that can go down the drain some of them

262
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:54,480
have different type of systems that

263
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,480
collect this runoff ways so it's not

264
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,889
contaminated

265
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,539
where we're dumping it for instance I

266
00:10:56,889 --> 00:11:01,659
believed and I could be wrong i believe

267
00:10:58,539 --> 00:11:04,389
california doesn't have a law on this so

268
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:07,059
we kind of just dump it down

269
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:14,379
I believe the ocean is where a lot of

270
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:15,669
this goes you know we're Altima all

271
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:18,730
trying to do the right thing

272
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:21,639
you know at least you could always just

273
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:24,850
hope that people are at the end of the

274
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:26,799
day you know we want to have this plant

275
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:28,389
broken down and isolate it into ways

276
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,909
that we can actually save people's lives

277
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:33,639
and and use it for a benefit you know

278
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:35,769
and I and I think that realistically I

279
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:37,509
would love to see cannabis get to the

280
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:39,820
point where you pay for your health

281
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:42,309
insurance you pay a five to ten dollar

282
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,528
copay for expensive medicine if people

283
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:46,388
didn't have to spend let's say two three

284
00:11:44,528 --> 00:11:47,828
four or five hundred plus dollars a week

285
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:51,159
on their medication going to a

286
00:11:47,828 --> 00:11:52,750
dispensary and paying these taxes you

287
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,879
know and it was worked out that way I

288
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,850
think everybody would benefit from that

289
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,860
you know for me I've always been the

290
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,129
person that knows how to do it in my my

291
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:06,250
head at least the right way and you know

292
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:08,110
it's kind of cool to be able to answer

293
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,360
people's questions so I've always worked

294
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,818
you know whether it's doing the podcasts

295
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,419
and things and in speaking at different

296
00:12:12,818 --> 00:12:17,708
events it's like I almost wish I never

297
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:19,479
had to work for anybody in particular

298
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:21,789
it's almost fun to just consult with

299
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,139
different people because as much as

300
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:24,879
they're learning for me I'm learning

301
00:12:23,139 --> 00:12:27,818
from different situations can you kind

302
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,708
of talk about your own evolution and

303
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:33,099
things you've experimented with you're

304
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:35,500
doing kind of so cal indoor right is

305
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,600
that kind of your main I mean I don't

306
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,600
know if it's SoCal indoor you know I

307
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,690
base everything on me it's it's all

308
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,149
about common sense for me and for me to

309
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,589
optimize anything as far as plant growth

310
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:49,809
you don't have to be a scientist to

311
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:52,000
realize the faster you can get a plant

312
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:54,159
to go through the water and nutrients

313
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,230
that are in the media itself more

314
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:59,078
rapidly the plant is going to grow just

315
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,449
as fast so the thing is is it's always

316
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:05,500
been in being able to grasp whatever

317
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:08,379
system it is the biggest thing well -

318
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,269
like obviously deep water culture in

319
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:12,490
in true hydroponic style systems where

320
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:14,409
the roots are suspended in water where

321
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,930
you have to play the saturation game

322
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:19,360
whether it's in soil or cocoa or rock

323
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:21,909
well you're always looking at the drying

324
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,830
time period in the wilting points of

325
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:26,169
this plant and not letting those roots

326
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,480
dry out too much to create a lockout so

327
00:13:26,169 --> 00:13:30,579
there's good and bad stresses that you

328
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,430
can give to the plant and for me

329
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:36,910
common-sense is obviously get them to

330
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:40,629
drink as fast as possible have the most

331
00:13:36,909 --> 00:13:42,009
root mass as possible meaning for me you

332
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:43,929
know you look at the different types of

333
00:13:42,009 --> 00:13:46,439
potting containers whether it's a smart

334
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:50,049
pod or an air pot the whole philosophy

335
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:53,080
for that is a root pruning pot so the

336
00:13:50,049 --> 00:13:56,049
science is is when the root tip makes

337
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:59,050
contact with the air it causes that to

338
00:13:56,049 --> 00:14:02,069
some necessarily die off at that point

339
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:04,779
and stop growing but it also creates

340
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:07,210
supplementals that branch out causing a

341
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:09,519
much denser root system where you don't

342
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:12,700
have the spiraling of the roots choking

343
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,860
the plant out at a certain point and you

344
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,300
know you can extend the longevity of the

345
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:20,259
plant's life in a smaller container

346
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:22,149
which with irrigation you know you can

347
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:24,159
obviously cut down on the amount of

348
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:25,779
transplanting I think that's a huge part

349
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:28,120
of you know people using rock wall

350
00:14:25,779 --> 00:14:29,679
blocks once you transplant them from the

351
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,659
clone stage they're in the same

352
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,179
container till the time they die

353
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:37,929
essentially and so there's not that

354
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:39,519
stress of going into a different you

355
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:41,859
know and there's a lot of benefits to

356
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,689
that you know as far as the cleanliness

357
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:46,560
to me and being able to clean a room

358
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:49,000
after and the the different types of

359
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,859
cleaning methods that go into a soil or

360
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,620
Coco room you have a lot of different

361
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,269
problems with drains clogging up biofilm

362
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,600
and sludge accumulating with a lot of

363
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:00,639
different organics and I'm not saying

364
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,409
I'm against organics but you know

365
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,840
there's benefits to it in a true sense

366
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:06,850
of nature if you're collecting data and

367
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,800
you're able to take a plant and take

368
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:10,960
that plant and actually plant it let's

369
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,599
say every square inch of the entire

370
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:15,670
earth and collect the data don't return

371
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,200
let it do its own thing we're gonna see

372
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:18,569
where this plant thrived the most

373
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,400
collect the data there

374
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:23,400
and try to recreate that in an indoor

375
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,840
environment so with that plants will be

376
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:27,419
able to create their own food whether

377
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:29,160
it's environmental or it's the plants

378
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:32,099
themselves being able to break down the

379
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,809
the foliage or whatever type of forms of

380
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,730
compost that are there naturally and

381
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:37,889
what's occurring there in the soil is

382
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:41,129
meaning those beneficial microorganisms

383
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:43,199
that we create teas and additives to try

384
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:45,240
and simulate but some of them are

385
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:47,610
actually beneficial and you take those

386
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,799
that are in nature and you try and

387
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:53,039
create a tea to brew those specific

388
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:54,599
species of fungi and bacteria well all

389
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,250
these things are just basically

390
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,379
chelating nutrients to the plan I

391
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,840
believe in any type of environment

392
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:03,840
whether it's hydroponic or not a plant

393
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:05,610
having its own sugar production you know

394
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,190
from its roots we have cellulose that

395
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,870
needs to be broken down by cellulose so

396
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:12,060
or I'm sorry cellulose that's broken

397
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,799
down by cellulase and that's the plant

398
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:16,469
creating its own sugars to feed those

399
00:16:13,799 --> 00:16:17,370
beneficial organisms with its own form

400
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,590
of carbohydrates

401
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:21,629
we have different types of additives we

402
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:24,629
can add to feed these which help them

403
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:26,279
colonize at a much faster rate assuming

404
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:28,460
that the higher collimation rates of

405
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:31,379
these microorganisms were able to

406
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,900
benefit the plant by feeding it faster

407
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:36,899
it's it's my way of saying imagine

408
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:39,059
having a milkshake that's really hard to

409
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,500
suck up the nutrients with a straw and

410
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:43,229
then giving your plant a bigger straw

411
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,820
and in with that in turn you're

412
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,250
optimizing all the other elements

413
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,080
whether it's temperature humidity

414
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:51,360
lighting and all these things go into

415
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:55,620
the the benefit of the rapid growth that

416
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:58,320
you see and you know that's why when

417
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:00,570
people are so stuck in one way it's it's

418
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,110
a terrible thing to see because I think

419
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:05,850
I can get better every day and the thing

420
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:07,500
is is if you aren't that person

421
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:10,708
searching out these different aspects

422
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:13,019
like for me seven eight years ago

423
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:14,430
telling people about LED technology and

424
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:16,889
they're just kind of like rolling their

425
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:18,990
eyes I've been using that technology for

426
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:22,320
years especially in like a vegetative

427
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:24,420
state it was always a difficult finding

428
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,529
the right way to do it in Flour and I

429
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,900
never had the success that we have

430
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:30,279
but as people are switching over to LED

431
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:33,960
we see the benefits with that with

432
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:37,690
electrical consumption we see

433
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:40,450
substantial benefits for different for

434
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:43,000
instance like we have DWP here in LA in

435
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,990
Southern California Edison and different

436
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,849
states have their different power

437
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:48,759
sources but they're creating different

438
00:17:45,849 --> 00:17:50,799
rebate programs that if we're consuming

439
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:52,960
so much energy with a thousand watt amp

440
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:55,720
you know or a thousand watt ballasts and

441
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,059
we designed that for HIDs and switching

442
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,819
to LEDs they're giving these people huge

443
00:17:58,059 --> 00:18:02,559
benefits as far as rebates to pay for

444
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:04,480
these lights so it's helping the owners

445
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,950
and you know we get into people that

446
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,039
have been doing this for years that

447
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,539
we're brands that that you know have

448
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,000
been struggling to stay afloat with all

449
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:15,460
the loopholes like you know for instance

450
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,769
different cities have stipulations I see

451
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,410
all the time where they're asking these

452
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:21,819
20 light rooms all of a sudden to shut

453
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:24,040
down because they don't have a co2

454
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:27,089
monitor that can only be installed by

455
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:29,470
the contractors from the city and it's

456
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:31,119
$28,000 per room how do you tell

457
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,529
somebody that's already struggling at

458
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,469
that point to come up with this money

459
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:38,829
and it's a sad thing to see but at the

460
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:41,500
same time it's gonna evolve to a point

461
00:18:38,829 --> 00:18:43,659
where I'd like to see all these

462
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,630
companies survive but at the end of the

463
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,790
day unless that company is putting the

464
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,460
money into the technology to research

465
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:53,349
exactly what we need in the plant we

466
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,950
need to figure that out because now

467
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:59,379
we're just now integrating lighting

468
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:02,019
systems with infrared and ultraviolet

469
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:03,730
light which to me was a no-brainer back

470
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:05,319
in the day if we get to the last couple

471
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:09,039
weeks of a cycle we were putting in

472
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:12,009
10,000 K UV bulbs and getting this spike

473
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,960
in to me it's like plants naturally have

474
00:19:12,009 --> 00:19:15,910
defense mechanisms and people know as

475
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,220
resin to be one of them and different

476
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:19,330
resins for instance like especially a

477
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:21,430
lot of people that grow there's certain

478
00:19:19,329 --> 00:19:22,960
strains I just have a negative reaction

479
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:26,080
to around like I get itchy

480
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,029
my skin gets red or irritated and you

481
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,159
can only accommodate that to what's in

482
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:33,069
the plant naturally and as they have

483
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,650
these resin glands we have to think not

484
00:19:33,069 --> 00:19:37,899
only do they get us high or Medicaid us

485
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,370
but they deters things that they would

486
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:43,480
sustain in nature

487
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:45,879
were they originated from so to me we

488
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,140
get burned our skin from ultraviolet

489
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,460
light a plant creates more resin content

490
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:53,200
towards the end of its cycle especially

491
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,720
when it's developing the resin when

492
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,819
finishing by creating its own sunscreen

493
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,850
protecting itself from ultraviolet light

494
00:19:57,819 --> 00:20:03,899
so it's a no-brainer to me and you know

495
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:06,730
I think the further we actually bring in

496
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,740
real gardening practices a lot of people

497
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:10,750
always called them strawberries or

498
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,769
tomatoes walking into Anna hydroponics

499
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,170
who are trying to get advice from

500
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:18,160
somebody that was growing in their

501
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:20,080
closet or whatever it may be and you

502
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:23,220
know whether it's a dosatron system

503
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:25,210
which is what from car wash industry and

504
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,500
agricultural industry and we're just

505
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:29,279
like oh this is the next greatest thing

506
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:32,200
this is things that have been around and

507
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,490
you know it's the big gold rush for a

508
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,080
lot of companies to create the next

509
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:36,910
gimmick but all these things have

510
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:38,649
already been implemented into large

511
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:42,700
systems already whether from greenhouse

512
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:45,220
or large-scale farming so you know we're

513
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,110
gonna we're gonna see I wouldn't at

514
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:50,380
least hope all the hype kind of stop at

515
00:20:47,109 --> 00:20:53,229
some point then was so you mentioned

516
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,820
LEDs so you're growing with LEDs and

517
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:57,430
you've grown with them for a long time

518
00:20:54,819 --> 00:21:00,279
and you said you're flowering with them

519
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:01,950
too or right now we're converting a lot

520
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:04,240
of them to the flower

521
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:06,640
we've been doing a lot of experiments

522
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,559
with a company called Pro grow tech and

523
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,950
they've been doing custom lighting for

524
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:14,259
us that we're gonna basically take to a

525
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:17,140
cannabis project I'll speak a little bit

526
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:18,670
but we'll be developing the second

527
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,670
research facility at the University of

528
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:27,690
Gainesville Florida to research cannabis

529
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:30,610
and we're gonna leave fun our licensed

530
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:32,860
facility yes and where's the FIR the

531
00:21:30,609 --> 00:21:37,719
first ones in Mississippi yep okay so

532
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:39,579
this will be literally right yeah it's

533
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,650
it's gonna be a lot different right you

534
00:21:39,579 --> 00:21:44,409
know we put a lot of thought in this and

535
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:46,830
you know for me to to meet some of the

536
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:49,330
the scientist that are involved with it

537
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:50,189
actually there's just past MJ buzz

538
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:52,408
Connor

539
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,538
was introduced to some of the people

540
00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:59,778
involved with a company called medicinal

541
00:21:54,538 --> 00:22:02,548
genomics and yeah I sat down in a

542
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:04,888
meeting with Brian mckernon and and a

543
00:22:02,548 --> 00:22:08,908
few other guys there from the the

544
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:11,908
company and it was almost a match made

545
00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:13,799
in heaven I guess I didn't know till

546
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:17,100
about 12 hours later when I called back

547
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:19,378
for another meeting and it's it's really

548
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:21,808
cool to be a part of something like that

549
00:22:19,378 --> 00:22:24,298
I think it's uh it's really a dream of

550
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:25,888
mine because for me I've always wanted

551
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:27,990
to be the best or whatever I do that's

552
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:30,119
why I love golf it's you know I always

553
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,740
tell my nieces it's like look if you

554
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:33,388
don't like sports but you want to get

555
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,919
involved in some of golf's a great thing

556
00:22:33,388 --> 00:22:36,479
because if you're good at it and get

557
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:39,299
paid to take a vacation and get paid

558
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,700
every week and it's you against the

559
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:43,408
field it's you and everything that you

560
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:46,429
do you can't take away from you that you

561
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:50,759
accomplished and you know being able to

562
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:51,870
grow a superior product or you know

563
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:53,970
something that makes somebody feel

564
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:56,268
better even if you don't hear it that's

565
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:58,980
a great feeling you know it really is

566
00:22:56,269 --> 00:23:01,620
let's say for the grow-op specifically

567
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:05,450
kind of what was your setup so it seems

568
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:09,508
like LED lights like what like are using

569
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:12,590
BIOS are you using well we used an LED

570
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:15,870
so let me explain the process for me I

571
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:17,548
started out the first half a flower

572
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:19,798
meaning the first four weeks for me I

573
00:23:17,548 --> 00:23:22,710
just called it a nine week cycle just in

574
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:24,538
case I think we really should have ran

575
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:27,210
that plan about ten ten and a half weeks

576
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:29,220
but for instance the first four weeks

577
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,889
especially having a higher orange-red

578
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:34,620
level of light with an HID HPS like a

579
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:36,119
Gabi delight for me I took advantage of

580
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:39,628
getting this plant to stretch out and

581
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:41,489
cover a massive area so you know getting

582
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:44,128
those Reds in there was huge and that's

583
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:46,169
why you know at the time I used a black

584
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:48,719
dog LED for the second half of flowers

585
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:50,519
specifically because it being a full

586
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,798
spectrum light incorporating the

587
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:54,509
ultraviolet in there as well was great

588
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,308
to finish the plan especially to bring

589
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:58,259
up resin production after I already got

590
00:23:56,308 --> 00:24:02,548
the plant to stretch and that was the

591
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:03,389
plan I think that you know that's why

592
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:05,308
with the

593
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:07,398
Rotech one of the things that drew me to

594
00:24:05,308 --> 00:24:09,538
the company immediately is the full

595
00:24:07,398 --> 00:24:11,848
capability of tuning the spectrum

596
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:14,219
meaning I can go ahead and take the the

597
00:24:11,848 --> 00:24:16,259
red levels and tune it down by you know

598
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:19,469
a five ten percent ratio of the white

599
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:21,628
blue levels and then being able to

600
00:24:19,469 --> 00:24:23,669
custom integrate infrared and

601
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:26,158
ultraviolet light into this as well I

602
00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:27,629
think that what people are gonna see

603
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,119
what I've always noticed with LEDs

604
00:24:27,628 --> 00:24:32,278
especially for veg it was nice because

605
00:24:30,118 --> 00:24:33,988
we were able to double stack by

606
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:35,548
controlling the height level of the

607
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:38,269
plants and I think that really came down

608
00:24:35,548 --> 00:24:40,950
to the frequency of the lighting itself

609
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:43,888
Jay era was one of the guys that brought

610
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:45,598
the the Gavita to life to market years

611
00:24:43,888 --> 00:24:48,118
ago and when nobody was using

612
00:24:45,598 --> 00:24:50,489
double-ended liens and one of the first

613
00:24:48,118 --> 00:24:52,199
times I had met him he was showing me

614
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:55,919
the light I was like what is this thing

615
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:59,548
and after he explained it to me what I

616
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:01,200
took from that was we needed to increase

617
00:24:59,548 --> 00:25:02,729
the frequency of the light for people

618
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,979
that have been growing a long time we

619
00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:07,348
started with magnetic ballasts there are

620
00:25:04,979 --> 00:25:10,048
these huge white boxes that would hum

621
00:25:07,348 --> 00:25:11,308
and get hot not many people today that

622
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:13,979
are growing probably even know what this

623
00:25:11,308 --> 00:25:15,808
is but they operated at such a low

624
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:17,578
frequency that if you took a picture of

625
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:19,888
your grow back in the day you'd see

626
00:25:17,578 --> 00:25:21,808
these little wavy lines and you can

627
00:25:19,888 --> 00:25:23,338
never get a great shot I don't care who

628
00:25:21,808 --> 00:25:25,499
you are you never had a great shot of

629
00:25:23,338 --> 00:25:30,138
your garden without getting these little

630
00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:32,940
wavy lines even if you took a video and

631
00:25:30,138 --> 00:25:35,638
what we noticed I compared this to like

632
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:38,940
for instance we all had flat screen TVs

633
00:25:35,638 --> 00:25:41,638
10 years ago what's changed besides the

634
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,528
the 1080i you know picture it's always

635
00:25:41,638 --> 00:25:45,269
been the same it was the the Hertz level

636
00:25:43,528 --> 00:25:45,959
or the frequency of the lights blinking

637
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:49,499
himselves

638
00:25:45,959 --> 00:25:52,828
for instance the first TVs operating at

639
00:25:49,499 --> 00:25:55,169
like 60 Hertz so what I took from that

640
00:25:52,828 --> 00:25:57,628
is if you watched high-definition

641
00:25:55,169 --> 00:25:59,579
fast-paced motion action like sports

642
00:25:57,628 --> 00:26:01,858
it would pixelate and you'd see this

643
00:25:59,578 --> 00:26:04,618
ghosting effect and as that increased to

644
00:26:01,858 --> 00:26:07,168
120 240 and beyond you took that away

645
00:26:04,618 --> 00:26:09,208
and what this does as far as the

646
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:11,639
frequency of light for a plant is that

647
00:26:09,209 --> 00:26:13,709
is measuring the times that that light

648
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:15,628
blinks for every one second and

649
00:26:13,709 --> 00:26:16,740
operating at such a low frequency let's

650
00:26:15,628 --> 00:26:18,629
say even if it's too

651
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,339
forty Hertz we're looking at something

652
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:22,320
going to a hundred thousand-plus Hertz

653
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:24,178
when we're going into like the type of

654
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,189
technology that Gavita brought in and

655
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:27,840
now that we're looking with LEDs you're

656
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,789
operating at such a high frequency that

657
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,439
you're optimizing the amount of light

658
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:33,509
that the plants actually getting every

659
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,670
one second and people don't realize

660
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:37,920
those little things like that

661
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:40,110
made a huge difference and when you

662
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:42,210
bring up the frequency and you can

663
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:44,069
actually manipulate the actual spectrums

664
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:45,539
of light you can manipulate the type of

665
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:48,450
growth you get from the plant meaning

666
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:51,869
whether it's tighter internodal spacing

667
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:53,580
a more compact plant or even being able

668
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:55,529
to take a plant that wouldn't be so

669
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:57,119
compact and with stretch typically and

670
00:26:55,529 --> 00:26:58,710
being able to slow down the vertical

671
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:01,428
height of that by manipulating the

672
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,960
spectrums so with some of those

673
00:27:01,429 --> 00:27:06,059
scenarios can you talk about how you're

674
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,400
dialing to make to achieve specific

675
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:10,410
effects well everybody's got to work

676
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,660
within their limitations your space is

677
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:15,870
your space so whether you have a four by

678
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:18,570
four tent a four by eight table or a row

679
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:20,939
you're you're always at the limit of

680
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:24,450
your space and knowing the amount of

681
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:27,360
edge time needed into accommodating for

682
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:29,039
me what I like about see when I say

683
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:30,689
Rockwell I use a loose rock wall and

684
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,808
it's hard to really explain to people

685
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:35,400
sometimes because grodan themselves has

686
00:27:33,808 --> 00:27:36,720
made very different types of rock wall

687
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:38,400
over the years there was something that

688
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:42,750
they used to make that was granular or

689
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:45,809
absorbent granular repellent now also

690
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:48,720
known as grow wool they make like a cube

691
00:27:45,808 --> 00:27:51,178
style and then a chunk which is probably

692
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,990
about 60% bigger than the actual cubes

693
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:57,390
which will compare to like a crouton

694
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:59,519
being able to know how to stuff these in

695
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:02,460
the pot the density at which they're put

696
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:04,319
in there and knowing the plants drinking

697
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:06,840
habits are huge and that comes into

698
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:07,950
experience when when you know certain

699
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:10,230
plants have a slower

700
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:12,569
vej time meaning they may just take a

701
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,250
longer time to grow to the size you need

702
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:16,859
them to fill a canopy with a certain

703
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:18,660
amount of plants or the amount of times

704
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:20,759
it drinks you could really put together

705
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:24,630
a room with multiple different genetics

706
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:26,839
and customize the media so that this way

707
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:28,380
it dries out whether it's just

708
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:30,389
evaporation of

709
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:32,190
natural moisture into the the atmosphere

710
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:34,410
itself or the plant absorbing that

711
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:36,059
moisture through the root system we want

712
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:38,850
them all ultimately to dry out at the

713
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:40,139
same time and being able to optimize the

714
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:42,240
amount of times you get them to drink

715
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:45,150
you can take a plant that doesn't

716
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,980
necessarily drink is fast and manipulate

717
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:50,070
the way that that potting media is put

718
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:52,289
together maybe it's a lighter mix where

719
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:54,119
repels more water from being held on

720
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:56,099
just naturally for a longer period of

721
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:59,250
time and it will dry out at the same

722
00:28:56,099 --> 00:29:02,699
time as a pot mixed with maybe a more

723
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:05,759
absorbent style concoction we'll call it

724
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:08,460
the the loose media so you have your

725
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,619
little rock wall cube what's the rest of

726
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,240
the grow media that is surrounding it

727
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:14,759
for you and what size pots do you like

728
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,430
I've really liked the air pot

729
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:18,839
specifically for me we'll go back to

730
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:21,420
common sense there's a lot of root

731
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:23,369
pruning pots but to me it's the only pot

732
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,350
out there that actually raises the

733
00:29:23,369 --> 00:29:27,089
surface level of the plan itself of

734
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:29,339
approximately 2 to 3 inches off the

735
00:29:27,089 --> 00:29:30,899
ground which is benefit for a lot of

736
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:32,639
people some people are still in old

737
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,470
school saucer systems we'll call it

738
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,690
where you have runoff that the plant

739
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:39,000
will sit in and when you have a pot

740
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:41,250
old-school plastic container the roots

741
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,049
are exposed sitting into this stagnant

742
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:44,640
water we'll call it you're in a root

743
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:46,559
pruning pot like an air pot or a sack

744
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,840
pot it's still wicking this moisture

745
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:52,230
back into the pot but it's sitting in

746
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:54,299
stagnant water it was a great thing for

747
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:55,740
me I was like well there's multiple

748
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:57,269
benefits obviously if you're in that

749
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,049
type of a system it's not sitting in

750
00:29:57,269 --> 00:30:00,420
stagnant water

751
00:29:58,049 --> 00:30:02,430
you see rockwool systems even with cubes

752
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:06,269
now there's a lot of promotion of these

753
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:07,769
little screen inserts that you put into

754
00:30:06,269 --> 00:30:09,660
the tables to me is just another

755
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:11,519
headache to clean later where it's

756
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,110
giving the roots more area because it's

757
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:16,829
raising them off the surface of the tray

758
00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:20,309
which this pot does so there's benefits

759
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:22,439
like that just the amount of potting

760
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:25,259
media that you use in comparison to a

761
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:28,259
normal setup where you're using cocoa or

762
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:30,329
soil it's it's just a lot easier for me

763
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:31,650
it's a lot cleaner you don't have so

764
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,389
much sediment building up into the

765
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:35,430
tables causing different types of

766
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:38,610
pathogens to a career later on down the

767
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:41,400
line but but is your potting media 100

768
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:43,979
percent rock wall that's 100 percent

769
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,590
it's just a very custom mix it's hard to

770
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:48,450
explain people exactly how it's done and

771
00:30:46,589 --> 00:30:49,769
how to stuff it in there because it's

772
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:52,048
one of those things when I when I

773
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:54,029
actually train people to do this we do

774
00:30:52,048 --> 00:30:55,798
literally hands-on and you have to feel

775
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:58,379
the density at which you put it in and

776
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:59,849
how it's broken up and how much it's

777
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,400
it's it's a little bit more complicated

778
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:04,649
than it sounds you were a hundred

779
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,440
percent just in rock walls so now I get

780
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:08,610
that and then you're using and I'm

781
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,950
blanking because there are a bunch of

782
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:11,399
air pots or smart cause air plots air

783
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,440
pots

784
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:17,580
okay so you have rock wall and then what

785
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:20,820
size containers are using well for that

786
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:23,579
particular plant for the grow up we did

787
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:25,769
a twelve gone air pot I started in a one

788
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:30,149
gallon air bag so you got four pounds of

789
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:31,529
yield out of a 12 gallon air pot and

790
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:34,350
then in the end of the past I've always

791
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:39,869
used sevens and tens we went a little

792
00:31:34,349 --> 00:31:43,949
bit bigger I think it's not huge no it's

793
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:46,859
not a big time yeah okay and then in

794
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:48,750
terms of the nutrients so for me I think

795
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:51,659
of two things one I want to talk about

796
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:54,298
kind of your nutrient mix and what

797
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:57,929
nutrients are using but then also we've

798
00:31:54,298 --> 00:32:01,048
touched on sort of moisture levels and

799
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:03,769
for me I think of like trying to keep

800
00:32:01,048 --> 00:32:06,179
the roots within a band of moisture

801
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:08,548
correct you know so you don't want it to

802
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:10,890
like get super soaked and then like it's

803
00:32:08,548 --> 00:32:13,500
finding that petering you don't--it

804
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:15,540
going like blow past the band and then

805
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,240
come back into the band blow past at the

806
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:20,460
other direction so are you kind of a

807
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,279
proponent of frequent small dose

808
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:26,340
watering absolutely a Mike reducing the

809
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:28,168
water to keep an even saturation or a

810
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:32,279
constant saturation where it's not

811
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:34,799
sopping wet but it's not drying and I

812
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:36,779
think that perfect mixture allows for

813
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:39,509
the right amount of airflow to get to

814
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:42,298
the roots themselves as well it we we

815
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:44,669
cut off oxygen to the roots at a certain

816
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:47,129
point by water logging in them water can

817
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:50,250
only sustain a certain amount of oxygen

818
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:52,320
level for so long and at certain

819
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:54,180
temperatures it depletes rapidly

820
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:56,369
it'll fall out of solution when we're

821
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:58,440
let's just talk about the boiling point

822
00:32:56,369 --> 00:33:02,639
of water right and it's such a rapid

823
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:06,150
rate we're separating this but at let's

824
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,070
say a level of 66 to 68 degrees we could

825
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:10,259
actually scientifically put the most

826
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:12,179
amount of oxygen within that water and

827
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:13,859
and deliver that to the plant if you're

828
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,289
trying to be optimum we'll call it and

829
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:19,919
then finding those small fluctuations of

830
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:22,589
well the nutrient takes this long to mix

831
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,990
it takes this long before the feeding

832
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:27,959
actually occurs the variance of the

833
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:29,339
temperature goes up or down in a certain

834
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:31,170
direction depending on different

835
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:32,819
variables some people are in cold

836
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:36,330
climates where they have cold flooring

837
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:38,399
some people don't have that issue so you

838
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:40,679
know everybody's grows always gonna be

839
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,080
different and I think you know there's

840
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:45,509
no perfect way you know and I think a

841
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:48,750
lot of growers are almost like an art

842
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:49,650
because you you get a canvas it's not

843
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:52,289
always the same

844
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:54,750
and depending on now how the city wants

845
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:57,389
you to have whatever Iowa space and

846
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:59,789
drinking fountains wherever and you know

847
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:01,980
you design it based on that to optimize

848
00:33:59,789 --> 00:34:03,750
what you can do there and it's always

849
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,549
gonna be different for everybody it

850
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,500
doesn't matter who but you you develop a

851
00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:14,579
good recipe to do that and then what's

852
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:16,800
kind of like your preferred not on the

853
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:18,539
commercial level right so set some of

854
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,210
this stuff I want to start exploring

855
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:22,949
more is is like bloom at tensiometer z--

856
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:24,990
they're basically these little carrot

857
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:28,349
looking intense geometers and basically

858
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:30,509
they you can set it so you kind of have

859
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:35,360
your moisture level you want to achieve

860
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:39,360
and if it's less moist they'll release

861
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:41,309
water or water plus nutrients and if

862
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,820
it's you know once it gets to the

863
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:47,070
optimal moisture level it'll stop so

864
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:49,410
let's say I mean think of it let's say a

865
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:50,789
greenhouse grow right one end of the

866
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:52,829
greenhouse that's maybe a little more

867
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:54,570
shady the other end that's hot and sunny

868
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:56,159
you know the air is blowing in one

869
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:58,550
direction so you're gonna have kind of

870
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,929
if everything gets watered the same

871
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:03,600
you're gonna have bok choy shirts yeah

872
00:35:00,929 --> 00:35:04,049
you're gonna have its damp and moldy and

873
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,329
milled

874
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:10,460
we over here it's too dry over there

875
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:13,889
whereas if you have kind of each little

876
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:16,619
carrot steak well as long as companies

877
00:35:13,889 --> 00:35:18,000
make these affordable for our operations

878
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:21,000
because we've seen a lot of that

879
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,590
technology and you know it's not very

880
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,349
cost effective when a lot of these

881
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:26,519
systems are you know ten plus thousand

882
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:28,889
dollars for the monitoring equipment

883
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:31,050
plus an extra thousand dollars per

884
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:33,179
sensory it doesn't make sense because to

885
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:35,460
me the raw materials obviously don't

886
00:35:33,179 --> 00:35:37,529
cost that much so on the irrigation

887
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:40,470
front on the I guess let's say

888
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:42,960
commercial front and the personal grow

889
00:35:40,469 --> 00:35:46,319
front like what do you what do you like

890
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,079
what you exploring you know every

891
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,600
situation is different if it was left up

892
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:54,480
to me you know I'd love keeping my

893
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:59,819
custom Rockwell mix I like using the air

894
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:02,849
pots but you know it really is tailoring

895
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:04,160
to the grows and specific like you said

896
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:07,259
some people are stuck on their ways and

897
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:09,659
for some people that are an ownership to

898
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:12,330
have employees that their success is

899
00:36:09,659 --> 00:36:14,489
based on past experiences and being

900
00:36:12,329 --> 00:36:16,500
familiar with what they're doing you're

901
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:18,149
kind of at the risk and I see a lot of

902
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,400
people getting the runaround where

903
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:23,190
everybody's a master grower today they

904
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,650
walk in and they're failing like I see

905
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:28,619
it all the time you know I was a master

906
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:33,510
grower and it's a foot by 10 foot space

907
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:35,969
and putting the owners and you know into

908
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:38,910
debt and making them feel like they're

909
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:40,859
not gonna make it and at the end of the

910
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:42,869
day it's it's it's it doesn't matter

911
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:46,769
what you do it's about how to scale it

912
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:51,000
and be successful and you know I think

913
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:53,190
if people will you know you can grow it

914
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,829
any way you want I think at the end of

915
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:57,480
the day it's what makes you comfortable

916
00:36:54,829 --> 00:36:59,309
and for me I can't always be there so I

917
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,610
could recommend the system for somebody

918
00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:06,329
and unless they have the people that are

919
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:08,130
competent enough to see that out this

920
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:10,949
way it needs to be done without any

921
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:13,380
screw-ups we'll call it you have to put

922
00:37:10,949 --> 00:37:15,659
face faith into systems that will be

923
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,660
bulletproof we'll call it and you know

924
00:37:15,659 --> 00:37:17,889
whether that's

925
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:19,328
just simple things like at a

926
00:37:17,889 --> 00:37:21,940
conversation with people the other day

927
00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:24,250
about is it better that we go to powder

928
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,588
nutrients versus liquid nutrients and

929
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:29,170
there's advantages to both I said well

930
00:37:26,588 --> 00:37:30,969
you know let's ask ourselves well with

931
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:33,099
the powder nutrients there's a couple

932
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:34,838
variables that could change meaning

933
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:37,269
let's say the scale that you're using

934
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:38,828
isn't properly calibrated and or it's

935
00:37:37,269 --> 00:37:40,509
reading a certain way but you don't

936
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:42,789
necessarily know if that was calibrated

937
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:45,130
or in calibration correctly which could

938
00:37:42,789 --> 00:37:46,990
cause your measurements to be off too if

939
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:49,180
you have somebody that's weighing it

940
00:37:46,989 --> 00:37:52,328
themselves you have to look out the way

941
00:37:49,179 --> 00:37:55,210
it's you know being done meaning a lot

942
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:57,280
of people will necessarily different

943
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:59,079
products can't be in conjunction meaning

944
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,670
and a and B aren't in the same container

945
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:03,220
because they need to be mixed separately

946
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:05,260
and when you take certain concentrations

947
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:07,239
when you're weighing out powders and you

948
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:09,039
put an A in there and you have residue

949
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:11,348
from the a still in the container and

950
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:14,440
you have an employee that just fills and

951
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:17,079
back up with B you have to ask yourself

952
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,369
okay how do we eliminate small issues

953
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:20,410
like that we go to a liquid fertilizer

954
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:23,230
where it's very simple we don't have to

955
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:25,480
worry about the consistency being off or

956
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:29,048
contamination of nutrients creating a

957
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:31,000
lock out there's just little things like

958
00:38:29,048 --> 00:38:34,960
that is based on the help that you have

959
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,969
and have hired you know from my

960
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,490
experience it's always been best to find

961
00:38:36,969 --> 00:38:42,759
people that had no knowledge of the grow

962
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:45,098
industry whatsoever you know in fact I

963
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,990
called my protege but you know one of

964
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:49,809
the best people I know in this industry

965
00:38:46,989 --> 00:38:54,098
he came from Craigslist he knew nothing

966
00:38:49,809 --> 00:38:56,349
about growing his family it was you know

967
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:58,450
not from the United States and barely

968
00:38:56,349 --> 00:39:00,849
spoke English and hated that he smelled

969
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:02,588
like weed coming home every day and you

970
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:05,200
know from working in the garden and and

971
00:39:02,588 --> 00:39:06,909
the guy now can you know build an

972
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:10,629
irrigation system for you and do all

973
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:12,519
these cool things and it wasn't because

974
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:14,528
he was arguing he sees a common sense at

975
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:16,179
the factory I call it I don't care how

976
00:39:14,528 --> 00:39:19,389
you do it but every situation is gonna

977
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:21,338
be a little bit different you know and

978
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:22,629
and and the thing is is when you have

979
00:39:21,338 --> 00:39:24,308
people that always know what they're

980
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:26,410
doing they go into these situations

981
00:39:24,309 --> 00:39:28,420
based on prior knowledge there's a lot

982
00:39:26,409 --> 00:39:29,489
of science behind this whether it's the

983
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:32,338
water pressure

984
00:39:29,489 --> 00:39:34,559
the the water to the emitters the the

985
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:37,858
the amount of flow rate the emitters are

986
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:39,960
that the actual things that are actually

987
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:41,699
dividing this water out meaning it's an

988
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,130
octa bubbler or whatever type of system

989
00:39:41,699 --> 00:39:46,980
you have calculating the amount of water

990
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:49,079
and how much pressure and you know just

991
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:53,338
even the the PVC pipe size all these

992
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:55,079
things matter and you know this is no

993
00:39:53,338 --> 00:39:57,239
different from any other industry that's

994
00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:00,029
been doing agriculture it's just now

995
00:39:57,239 --> 00:40:01,739
that people are seeing it is less taboo

996
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,420
I think you're getting the people that

997
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:06,389
are real professionals getting involved

998
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:07,829
and you know it's gonna put some people

999
00:40:06,389 --> 00:40:09,929
out of jobs if they don't get out of

1000
00:40:07,829 --> 00:40:13,108
their mindset of their ways is the best

1001
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:15,149
you have to open your mind when you are

1002
00:40:13,108 --> 00:40:17,279
doing the two plants for the growth did

1003
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:19,858
you just bolt them on as two additional

1004
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,839
plants of a commercial operation or was

1005
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:24,659
this like at home no this is a

1006
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:26,608
commercial operation okay and so you

1007
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:28,529
basically like you know your your

1008
00:40:26,608 --> 00:40:31,259
commercial irrigation system you just

1009
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:33,330
added one for each of those two pots and

1010
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:35,730
I originally only plan for a four by

1011
00:40:33,329 --> 00:40:38,309
four section for the plant okay just

1012
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:41,190
because I didn't see it using very much

1013
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:43,049
more than that and even with that four

1014
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:45,990
by four section technically we had about

1015
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:49,230
fifty inches almost in each direction

1016
00:40:45,989 --> 00:40:51,088
for it and you know for instance the

1017
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:52,858
plant wasn't a very stretching plant

1018
00:40:51,088 --> 00:40:55,079
whatsoever so even by the end of week

1019
00:40:52,858 --> 00:40:56,639
three I think I have a video I could

1020
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:58,619
send to you where we took the tape

1021
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:59,989
measure out and it was already about 52

1022
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:04,230
inches in diameter in all directions

1023
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:07,259
only three weeks into bloom so you know

1024
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:09,420
it covered quite a bit of space but you

1025
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,540
know I think that going back into this

1026
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:15,358
and you know once we do a competition

1027
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:18,719
that involves more of the commercial

1028
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:21,179
operations again it would be nice to you

1029
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:22,980
know I I already have some plans for it

1030
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:25,049
but you know I'd like to put you know a

1031
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:26,730
room together or maybe you know maybe we

1032
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:28,859
put like four to four to eight plants

1033
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:30,539
over one light and really make a

1034
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:33,269
spectacle out of it and see if we can

1035
00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:37,980
get you know 10 20 pounds off a plan

1036
00:41:33,269 --> 00:41:40,199
you know so that then those two plants

1037
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:43,019
were also on the same nutrient regimen

1038
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:44,609
as all the other plants in the room well

1039
00:41:43,019 --> 00:41:46,860
I didn't grow them both out I

1040
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:48,900
I killed the second plant through the

1041
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:50,579
veg cuz the halfway through the veg

1042
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,500
already knew which one we tagged was

1043
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:55,079
they all-star so once we tagged him I

1044
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,610
didn't need the other planet anyways so

1045
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:58,319
you were talking about liquid nutrients

1046
00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:01,970
drying nutrients what are you using for

1047
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,970
nutrients are you making at home

1048
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:08,910
including manufacture well I've been

1049
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:11,429
very fond of Mills nutrients for a while

1050
00:42:08,909 --> 00:42:13,889
and it really started back in the day

1051
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:15,779
where my philosophy was is you're

1052
00:42:13,889 --> 00:42:18,269
changing the additives to manipulate the

1053
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,830
growth throughout the stages and seeing

1054
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:21,659
you know working in the hydroponic

1055
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:24,710
business to see it all the time they

1056
00:42:21,659 --> 00:42:27,960
have a veg and they have a bloom Y and

1057
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:30,360
for me I was like well they have an A

1058
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,980
and B that works for veg and bloom and

1059
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,690
you're just actually changing the

1060
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,849
stimulates based on the plant's needs

1061
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:38,849
throughout its cycle which really makes

1062
00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:40,559
sense to me in you know knowing the

1063
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:41,909
secrets of the industry it's like a lot

1064
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:43,230
of products aren't necessarily just

1065
00:42:41,909 --> 00:42:43,889
developed from scratch they're just

1066
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:46,469
remodeled

1067
00:42:43,889 --> 00:42:48,269
it's another large AG product that's

1068
00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:53,608
remodeled and packaged and sold to you

1069
00:42:48,269 --> 00:42:55,259
for 300% more yeah and if you worked in

1070
00:42:53,608 --> 00:42:56,989
a hydro store right oh I know all the

1071
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:00,090
secrets that's that's the sad thing is

1072
00:42:56,989 --> 00:43:01,709
you know knowing all that - it's it's no

1073
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:04,200
different from any other industry really

1074
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:06,750
you know if people didn't really pay

1075
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:08,549
attention so much to the marketing and

1076
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:10,320
hype of certain items and really looked

1077
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:15,480
into the actual products they'd see that

1078
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:18,539
this is really no different it's for

1079
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,608
instance uh you know it could be wrong

1080
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:22,800
but I'm pretty sure the DuPont family

1081
00:43:20,608 --> 00:43:24,989
and stuff like that owns several

1082
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,190
different entities of products all these

1083
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:28,108
different companies are large

1084
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:29,369
manufacturers owned so many different

1085
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:31,829
products that we would never realize

1086
00:43:29,369 --> 00:43:33,119
it's all the same company so if you're

1087
00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:34,759
against one you should be against them

1088
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,750
all you know

1089
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,720
everything gets like that when you

1090
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:40,920
perfect it somebody perfected a nutrient

1091
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:43,709
to the point where they could sell it to

1092
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,530
large scale farmers my hat's off to you

1093
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:45,909
and because

1094
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,560
if they're sitting there buying liquid

1095
00:43:45,909 --> 00:43:50,649
fertilizer at our prices and this

1096
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:53,440
industry we wouldn't see farmers using

1097
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:55,030
any of that stuff whatsoever right and

1098
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,130
is there anything else you're adding in

1099
00:43:55,030 --> 00:44:00,640
that various stages of the lifecycle I

1100
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:03,880
do a weekly tea regimen I could do my

1101
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:06,339
own teas I have my own IPM that I

1102
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,920
integrate into the plant cycle whether

1103
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:11,950
it's just for preventative preventive

1104
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:14,380
and you know we talked about responses

1105
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:16,029
in the plant and I don't want to give

1106
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:18,300
out too much information about what I

1107
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:20,320
use but just just to put it out there

1108
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:23,050
there's something called systemic

1109
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:25,420
acquired reaction in a plan and what

1110
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:27,400
this really is is how do we tell the

1111
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,289
plant that it's under attack just like a

1112
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,750
human body has its own immune and

1113
00:44:29,289 --> 00:44:33,849
defense system and everybody's is better

1114
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:35,710
some people have better tolerance to

1115
00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:38,500
getting sick than others plants are the

1116
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:40,329
same and the thing is is how to trick

1117
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,769
your plant into doing what you needed to

1118
00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:43,630
do throughout the cycle and how to

1119
00:44:41,769 --> 00:44:44,019
manipulate those reactions out of the

1120
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:48,280
plant

1121
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:50,500
is is is all part of you know trial and

1122
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:53,019
error really I think all plants will

1123
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,639
react differently and you know these are

1124
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:58,719
these are some secrets that I'll keep to

1125
00:44:54,639 --> 00:45:02,559
myself but you know I've done a lot of

1126
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:04,959
we'll call it nerdy experiments I've

1127
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:07,119
done everything you could think of by

1128
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:13,199
trying to simulate gravitational pull

1129
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:13,199
effects in vibrations - root systems -

1130
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:21,099
different types of frequencies of sound

1131
00:45:17,639 --> 00:45:23,889
you know you name it different types of

1132
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:28,779
music we did rooms with rap music rooms

1133
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:31,389
with classical music we've you know and

1134
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:34,600
did you notice a difference what what

1135
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:37,420
are your plants like to jam out to me

1136
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:43,299
personally my favorite thing to use in

1137
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:47,079
the garden is a just old school radio AM

1138
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:49,750
FM frequency type thing to me I feel

1139
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:52,059
like there has to be some kind of Voodoo

1140
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:54,519
to the the frequency of the sound coming

1141
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:56,739
in through reception and the frequency

1142
00:45:54,519 --> 00:45:58,449
of an old speaker being a little bit

1143
00:45:56,739 --> 00:46:01,239
more higher pitched we'll call it then a

1144
00:45:58,449 --> 00:46:04,629
lot of the new-age style of speakers was

1145
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:08,169
their study on like the sound of birds

1146
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:10,059
chirping in the morning I haven't seen

1147
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:13,780
much of that what my favorite studies

1148
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:15,670
were looking at tectonic plates and

1149
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,980
vibrational sound patterns and what they

1150
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:20,740
do to sand you look up different

1151
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:22,780
university research and certain

1152
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:25,899
frequencies will make the sand develop

1153
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:28,930
certain patterns and I think that really

1154
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:31,300
had something to do with opening up the

1155
00:46:28,929 --> 00:46:36,309
plants actual called skin or its pores

1156
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:39,670
whether that's to transpire or to being

1157
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:42,009
able to absorb more co2 levels more

1158
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:45,490
effectively these are all studies that

1159
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:47,770
you know I'm interested in but you know

1160
00:46:45,489 --> 00:46:50,559
I think that there's a lot to vibration

1161
00:46:47,769 --> 00:46:52,960
and sound well so first of all with the

1162
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,449
T's that means you're introducing sort

1163
00:46:52,960 --> 00:47:05,110
of microbes and okay so you're not a

1164
00:46:55,449 --> 00:47:08,169
just a pure synthetic nutrients to see

1165
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:10,539
you know people could say organically dr

1166
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:12,250
synthetically derived but to me in all

1167
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:13,840
aspects it's not about what we think

1168
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:16,150
it's about what the plant can absorb

1169
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:19,090
most effectively and I think in a

1170
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:22,389
medicinal quality standpoint for me how

1171
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:25,030
a calcium or magnesium is derived is

1172
00:47:22,389 --> 00:47:28,269
pointless because I want to have the

1173
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:30,010
cleanest most available source it's kind

1174
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:31,869
of like the same difference between

1175
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:35,770
calcium carbonate and calcium nitrate

1176
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:38,019
calcium carbonate is a much needs to be

1177
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:39,789
broken down it's it's very slowly

1178
00:47:38,019 --> 00:47:42,070
absorbed or readily available to the

1179
00:47:39,789 --> 00:47:43,690
plant compared to a calcium nitrate

1180
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:46,480
which is already chelated in a form that

1181
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:48,880
the plant can absorb immediately so you

1182
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,039
know when it comes down to organic or

1183
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,619
not to me it doesn't matter it's all

1184
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:55,509
about just raw minerals and nutrition

1185
00:47:53,619 --> 00:47:57,309
just like a human body if we need

1186
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:58,900
certain types of nutrition or minerals

1187
00:47:57,309 --> 00:48:00,469
to do whatever it is we're training

1188
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:02,690
ourselves to do and

1189
00:48:00,469 --> 00:48:05,179
a hyper-competitive level which we're

1190
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:06,800
dealing with plants in an aspect where

1191
00:48:05,179 --> 00:48:09,079
we need to obviously maximize

1192
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,060
profitability for the people that keep

1193
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:12,889
things running but at the same time we

1194
00:48:11,059 --> 00:48:15,619
want to create a substantially better

1195
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:17,480
product than anybody else and in doing

1196
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:20,059
that you know you have to look at all

1197
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:22,039
those key factors do you have different

1198
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:24,108
tea brewing strategies for different

1199
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:26,559
phases of growth like are you more

1200
00:48:24,108 --> 00:48:30,650
fungal dominant earlier you more

1201
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:33,699
bacterial dominant later you know as far

1202
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:36,680
as the teas I think that it's a very

1203
00:48:33,699 --> 00:48:38,899
simple tea is necessary for anybody

1204
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:42,348
whether it's and this is where it's

1205
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:44,809
going into like what I needed I think

1206
00:48:42,349 --> 00:48:46,430
there's a lot of products out there just

1207
00:48:44,809 --> 00:48:49,699
put a few out there that are very

1208
00:48:46,429 --> 00:48:51,980
similar products like extreme gardening

1209
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:54,679
has Mike oohs and ahhs oohs and there's

1210
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:56,889
great white there's life powder and a

1211
00:48:54,679 --> 00:48:59,029
lot of these different inoculants have

1212
00:48:56,889 --> 00:49:00,920
relatively the same agents in them

1213
00:48:59,030 --> 00:49:02,630
people need to realize that that powder

1214
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,430
you see is a carrier that's not

1215
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:06,108
necessarily what the plants absorbing

1216
00:49:04,429 --> 00:49:09,348
it's a talent it's a pharmaceutical

1217
00:49:06,108 --> 00:49:11,690
grade tell that this biology could stick

1218
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:15,890
to so you could transport that into the

1219
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:17,838
water and suspend them like I said I

1220
00:49:15,889 --> 00:49:19,879
think that a lot of these beneficial

1221
00:49:17,838 --> 00:49:23,539
microorganisms are a way for the plant

1222
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:25,970
to help them chelate and effectively

1223
00:49:23,539 --> 00:49:28,940
uptake nutrients I think that there is

1224
00:49:25,969 --> 00:49:31,449
benefits for them as far as immunity and

1225
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:34,519
defense in them but at the same time

1226
00:49:31,449 --> 00:49:37,608
when you get microbiology and an indoor

1227
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:39,019
system and you know everybody system is

1228
00:49:37,608 --> 00:49:40,789
different you have a lot of problems

1229
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:43,460
with that so running a clean irrigation

1230
00:49:40,789 --> 00:49:46,400
system to me is a lot more beneficial on

1231
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:48,949
a large scale project versus going fully

1232
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,139
organic with that you just have a lot of

1233
00:49:48,949 --> 00:49:54,250
problems along the down the line you

1234
00:49:51,139 --> 00:49:57,949
know and a lot more maintenance issues

1235
00:49:54,250 --> 00:50:01,250
for me it's about how to use those T's I

1236
00:49:57,949 --> 00:50:03,139
think that using them in accordance to

1237
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:06,679
where you are in the plant cycle meaning

1238
00:50:03,139 --> 00:50:09,049
a weekly cycle we typically increase our

1239
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:10,940
food regimens as we increase the amount

1240
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:12,869
of time the plant grows whether it's

1241
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:14,639
from beginning of edge to

1242
00:50:12,869 --> 00:50:16,950
vej beginning a flower to end the flower

1243
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:18,118
and by increasing those nutrient

1244
00:50:16,949 --> 00:50:20,429
regiments for me

1245
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:22,528
you also have salt build-up and the

1246
00:50:20,429 --> 00:50:24,449
thing is is we need to realize obviously

1247
00:50:22,528 --> 00:50:26,400
as an accumulation of salt builds up

1248
00:50:24,449 --> 00:50:28,798
you're gonna create possibility for

1249
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:31,318
plants to lock out nutrients so we need

1250
00:50:28,798 --> 00:50:36,028
to flush out those excess minerals by

1251
00:50:31,318 --> 00:50:38,130
releasing these bonds to me teas this is

1252
00:50:36,028 --> 00:50:40,739
one thing I can guarantee you the best

1253
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:42,858
time for me and anyone to apply them in

1254
00:50:40,739 --> 00:50:47,129
my opinion would be when you're actually

1255
00:50:42,858 --> 00:50:49,920
flushing your plant or leaching those

1256
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:51,329
out on a weekly basis because what

1257
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,579
better to have these beneficial

1258
00:50:51,329 --> 00:50:55,829
microorganisms that are in there that

1259
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:58,318
can help chelate and break down these

1260
00:50:55,829 --> 00:51:00,420
minerals that are accumulating and we're

1261
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:03,509
not having to add food at that point so

1262
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:05,068
you know in a large-scale agricultural

1263
00:51:03,509 --> 00:51:07,409
project you're gonna have to in my

1264
00:51:05,068 --> 00:51:08,759
opinion I always like to splash these on

1265
00:51:07,409 --> 00:51:10,230
top of the plants and not running them

1266
00:51:08,759 --> 00:51:12,539
through the irrigation so we'll have

1267
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:15,059
somebody that goes through and literally

1268
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:16,950
hand feeds teeth you know and we're

1269
00:51:15,059 --> 00:51:19,528
talking about a micro dose so it's not

1270
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:21,509
like we're talking like foliar or into

1271
00:51:19,528 --> 00:51:25,469
the rock into the into the rock wall

1272
00:51:21,509 --> 00:51:28,440
itself absolutely you know and being

1273
00:51:25,469 --> 00:51:32,998
able to any foliar spraying you know as

1274
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:35,269
far as folios one good tip I could say

1275
00:51:32,998 --> 00:51:37,528
is it depending on your situation

1276
00:51:35,268 --> 00:51:39,449
there's different technology than I've

1277
00:51:37,528 --> 00:51:41,579
been able to incorporate now to cut down

1278
00:51:39,449 --> 00:51:43,980
on some of the uses for different types

1279
00:51:41,579 --> 00:51:45,568
of foliar sprays whether it's to prevent

1280
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:47,400
different types of fungal or different

1281
00:51:45,568 --> 00:51:50,190
pathogens from attaching themselves to

1282
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,079
the plant so everybody's environments

1283
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:53,579
gonna be a little bit different I think

1284
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,410
a lot of people are getting more into

1285
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:57,839
the preventive aspect of knowing that

1286
00:51:55,409 --> 00:52:00,598
your room may look clean but you

1287
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:03,989
bringing in outside contaminants is huge

1288
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:05,190
so having a good practice of making sure

1289
00:52:03,989 --> 00:52:09,059
that you don't bring them into the grow

1290
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:11,159
in the first place is critical as far as

1291
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:14,400
you know with large scale grows it's

1292
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:16,679
hard for people to say we're gonna have

1293
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,079
these things hand sprayed a lot of these

1294
00:52:16,679 --> 00:52:19,469
systems big systems are a beautiful

1295
00:52:19,079 --> 00:52:22,710
thing

1296
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:25,199
they're so automated you have track

1297
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:26,740
systems with fogging machines that will

1298
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:29,739
literally spray whatever you

1299
00:52:26,739 --> 00:52:31,689
to spray when you need to spray it some

1300
00:52:29,739 --> 00:52:33,909
people like for instance that actually

1301
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:36,970
manually apply these you know great ways

1302
00:52:33,909 --> 00:52:39,909
to cut down on the amount of application

1303
00:52:36,969 --> 00:52:41,829
rates would be to atomize this or you

1304
00:52:39,909 --> 00:52:45,009
know use paint sprayers a lot of times

1305
00:52:41,829 --> 00:52:46,659
and meaning you can have a little bit go

1306
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:49,000
a long way instead of going through five

1307
00:52:46,659 --> 00:52:51,549
to ten gallons you may go through one to

1308
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,929
two gallons of foliar spray depending on

1309
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:55,780
what type of application you're applying

1310
00:52:52,929 --> 00:52:58,569
it for but getting down to the

1311
00:52:55,780 --> 00:53:01,390
application of folders I like it

1312
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:03,760
throughout the veg cycle I try and not

1313
00:53:01,389 --> 00:53:06,609
do it past maybe week three or four the

1314
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:08,350
bloom cycle and even in that it really

1315
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:11,349
depends on the situation if you know you

1316
00:53:08,349 --> 00:53:13,569
have strains that are finicky meaning

1317
00:53:11,349 --> 00:53:16,659
that they are a little bit more prone to

1318
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:19,930
pathogens or mold then yeah you have to

1319
00:53:16,659 --> 00:53:21,789
keep a regimen of different types of

1320
00:53:19,929 --> 00:53:25,569
chemicals will call them whether it's

1321
00:53:21,789 --> 00:53:27,610
something organic like a I think maroon

1322
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:29,769
was one of the sponsors so they make

1323
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:32,490
products from regalia grande Evo

1324
00:53:29,769 --> 00:53:34,719
venerate all products that I use you

1325
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:36,669
know there's other great products out

1326
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:39,250
there that necessarily would kind of

1327
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:40,869
contradict that because let's say you

1328
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:45,159
use something like a plant therapy that

1329
00:53:40,869 --> 00:53:48,880
has alcohol you know and and different

1330
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:51,639
types of extracts in it and citric acid

1331
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,500
you can't necessarily apply that to

1332
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:54,819
something that you put beneficial

1333
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,440
organisms but let's say you're spraying

1334
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:58,269
a fungal dominant tea you're not gonna

1335
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:02,050
spray plant therapy right after it's

1336
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:04,599
kind of pointless so it just depends on

1337
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:06,820
when you grow more you know in a lot of

1338
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:09,130
people you know with a lot of different

1339
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:11,590
apple applications whether it's the type

1340
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:14,730
of protection equipment whether it's the

1341
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:16,960
respirators the protective clothing

1342
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:19,900
being able to simplify all those

1343
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:22,349
practices for people is is one thing

1344
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:25,690
everybody is getting better at and I

1345
00:54:22,349 --> 00:54:28,739
don't there's no perfect way to do it

1346
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:31,179
everybody situation is different and

1347
00:54:28,739 --> 00:54:32,559
like I said it also depends on the

1348
00:54:31,179 --> 00:54:36,549
people you have they're actually doing

1349
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:39,559
the applications right so getting back

1350
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:44,120
to the initial grow off topic

1351
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:46,039
so you basically didn't it was almost

1352
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:48,619
like an Iron Chef competition where like

1353
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:50,840
you ran out of time obviously I'm sure

1354
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:52,369
everybody felt the same way whereas like

1355
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,470
I could have just done that one last

1356
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:57,109
thing well they did originally give us a

1357
00:54:54,469 --> 00:54:58,939
date that was further out but because of

1358
00:54:57,110 --> 00:55:01,610
the law changed it was out of their

1359
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:03,200
control so even though we properly

1360
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:04,849
planned our schedule to pull down on a

1361
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:07,879
certain date it was out of our control

1362
00:55:04,849 --> 00:55:09,019
at that point what ultimately I forget

1363
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,869
you said this earlier but what

1364
00:55:09,019 --> 00:55:15,320
ultimately was the strain grapefruit

1365
00:55:11,869 --> 00:55:18,199
Romulan okay describe what you saw at

1366
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:20,510
the you know as these you know buds

1367
00:55:18,199 --> 00:55:22,460
started to develop or you you you kind

1368
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:25,220
of had a general sense of what it was

1369
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:28,010
well I mean I had my guesses it was a

1370
00:55:25,219 --> 00:55:30,109
sweet smelling plant it put it this way

1371
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:34,060
it smelled a lot better growing than a

1372
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:36,890
they'd smoke died I'm sad to say it I

1373
00:55:34,059 --> 00:55:39,469
call it the boofie kind of a poufy

1374
00:55:36,889 --> 00:55:41,809
strain it's it's nothing special about

1375
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:43,669
it I think that there's a lot of strains

1376
00:55:41,809 --> 00:55:45,619
out there that are nostalgic for very

1377
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:48,019
different attributes of it whether it's

1378
00:55:45,619 --> 00:55:50,869
the color the smell the taste the high

1379
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:52,429
and the effects of it and you know we

1380
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:53,719
can joke about it there's strains like

1381
00:55:52,429 --> 00:55:55,159
blue dream that people would be like

1382
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:55,879
I'll get that out of here but people

1383
00:55:55,159 --> 00:55:57,319
loved it

1384
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:58,849
you know there's strains like green

1385
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:01,039
crack that people are like what's that

1386
00:55:58,849 --> 00:56:04,429
some people are like oh man no more that

1387
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:11,210
people loved it you know I think strains

1388
00:56:04,429 --> 00:56:13,489
like OG Kush now OG Kush you can get any

1389
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:15,409
strain that's named something different

1390
00:56:13,489 --> 00:56:17,659
and just by smoking if it is really an

1391
00:56:15,409 --> 00:56:19,670
OG Kush it's gonna taste very similar

1392
00:56:17,659 --> 00:56:21,469
and by putting all these different names

1393
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:22,760
on has always been kind of a joke to me

1394
00:56:21,469 --> 00:56:25,399
over the years that people do this

1395
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,870
because we've lost sense of what truly

1396
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,340
what it is they're all kind of the same

1397
00:56:26,869 --> 00:56:30,559
planet and now that people that are

1398
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:33,110
breeding and doing their own Fino hunts

1399
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:36,739
will realize is they all came from a

1400
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:39,620
seed they're all very different but

1401
00:56:36,739 --> 00:56:41,479
they're similar and we get different

1402
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:44,210
types of attributes out of different

1403
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:46,940
phenotypes meaning the structure and the

1404
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:49,220
way that the calyx is grow the structure

1405
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:52,200
of the Leafs and how they form the

1406
00:56:49,219 --> 00:56:54,000
amount it yields the potency of the plan

1407
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:55,949
how tolerant it is to environmental

1408
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,420
conditions and/or different types of

1409
00:56:55,949 --> 00:57:02,548
attacks from mold or bugs you know and

1410
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,349
being able to hone in and I think that's

1411
00:57:02,548 --> 00:57:06,809
where your tissue culture is a great

1412
00:57:04,349 --> 00:57:09,150
thing where we can not only clean up

1413
00:57:06,809 --> 00:57:11,400
strains that people damage over the

1414
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:12,869
years by using toxic chemicals that in

1415
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,150
some case that we're out of our control

1416
00:57:12,869 --> 00:57:17,670
I make the comment people complain about

1417
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:19,650
equal 20 but they use Spinoza Spinoza

1418
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:22,170
was labeled organic but it was a

1419
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:25,710
neurotoxin when in combustion toot

1420
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:28,380
inhale so that was organic as labeled

1421
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:30,630
organic still by it is organic so when

1422
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:34,559
people say organics healthier sometimes

1423
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:35,910
I'm like well is it mercury organic you

1424
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:42,359
know there's certain things that'll just

1425
00:57:35,909 --> 00:57:44,699
kill you this was a purple punch yeah

1426
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:46,289
that's a purple plant okay so talk to me

1427
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:48,629
about

1428
00:57:46,289 --> 00:57:50,670
I view cannabis in the same way I view

1429
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:53,160
music there is the Katy Perry strains

1430
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:55,318
which may be the most popular okay

1431
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:58,048
popularity in my mind doesn't mean the

1432
00:57:55,318 --> 00:58:01,369
best and then there's like the Miles

1433
00:57:58,048 --> 00:58:07,230
Davis of strains or the you know

1434
00:58:01,369 --> 00:58:09,298
experiment being played on every major

1435
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:12,500
LA radio station so everybody's

1436
00:58:09,298 --> 00:58:16,318
different right so can you talk about

1437
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:22,889
just from what you're seeing snapshot in

1438
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:26,190
time 2019 what's becoming popular in the

1439
00:58:22,889 --> 00:58:29,279
LA market and then contrast that with

1440
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:31,740
just what are you personally into right

1441
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:35,819
now in terms of genetics and breed like

1442
00:58:31,739 --> 00:58:37,739
what's exciting you like who's your I'm

1443
00:58:35,818 --> 00:58:41,009
excited right now our artist who's

1444
00:58:37,739 --> 00:58:43,828
coming in versus the the the purple

1445
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:46,290
punch or the blue dream or the well I'm

1446
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:48,269
just happy that people are over just

1447
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:50,699
there's still people that are diehard OG

1448
00:58:48,269 --> 00:58:53,250
Kush fans but forever it's like oh if

1449
00:58:50,699 --> 00:58:55,439
it's not og I don't want it and I see

1450
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:57,780
the times are kind of changing and where

1451
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:00,179
people like more exotic flavors and in

1452
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:02,640
meaning there's so many good weeds now

1453
00:59:00,179 --> 00:59:03,269
that people are finding what they like

1454
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:06,690
the best

1455
00:59:03,269 --> 00:59:08,400
and with that you know you go over to a

1456
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:10,019
friend's house and they have whatever

1457
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,480
strain it is and you have whatever

1458
00:59:10,019 --> 00:59:14,068
strain it is and you've never tried this

1459
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,280
strain and now you like this strain

1460
00:59:14,068 --> 00:59:19,318
before it was like let's just put it

1461
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,510
this way black market days you go over

1462
00:59:19,318 --> 00:59:23,039
to your you know person's house to pick

1463
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:25,650
up a bag of weed or even at the

1464
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:28,798
dispensary it was like 13 different

1465
00:59:25,650 --> 00:59:32,670
types of OG Kush and like three others

1466
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:35,639
and you know I think that now people are

1467
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:38,309
seeing better variety I see that people

1468
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:40,798
are really into colorful strains and and

1469
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:43,019
more of a kind of exotic smells or

1470
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:45,929
fruity smells and I think that really

1471
00:59:43,019 --> 00:59:48,780
goes to the point where they're all very

1472
00:59:45,929 --> 00:59:51,029
similar in THC I think until we really

1473
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:52,920
feel a full spectrum of what's in that

1474
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:54,960
plant that makes us feel the way that we

1475
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:58,230
do that we like that maybe somebody else

1476
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:00,510
doesn't it's all about flavor for me at

1477
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:03,960
least you know I'll smoke enough to get

1478
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:05,339
high I don't care what strain it is and

1479
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:07,769
I and I have you kind of where we are

1480
01:00:05,338 --> 01:00:10,588
with cannabis right now as as alcohol

1481
01:00:07,769 --> 01:00:12,539
came out of prohibition kind of everyone

1482
01:00:10,588 --> 01:00:14,849
was so focused during alcohol

1483
01:00:12,539 --> 01:00:17,039
prohibition on highest proof so you had

1484
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:19,798
kind of like your whiskey's in your

1485
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:25,289
bathtub gin your gran outcalls

1486
01:00:19,798 --> 01:00:27,530
and kind of like a fine craft wine sort

1487
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:30,539
of came later on right it wasn't like

1488
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:33,119
1935 that there's always those Krauts

1489
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:35,759
but you had to know the people right now

1490
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:39,599
I'm thinking of the general public like

1491
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:42,180
for me like you like I could drink six

1492
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:42,869
glasses of wine and my goal is to get

1493
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:45,328
drunk

1494
01:00:42,869 --> 01:00:47,700
I can appreciate each one and what

1495
01:00:45,329 --> 01:00:49,980
you're saying is you know your cannabis

1496
01:00:47,699 --> 01:00:52,679
doesn't need to go up to 11 on the THC

1497
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:55,710
scale you just smoke a little bit more

1498
01:00:52,679 --> 01:00:57,269
and what you're more focused on what I'm

1499
01:00:55,710 --> 01:01:00,449
more focused on is kind of like the

1500
01:00:57,269 --> 01:01:04,199
flavor the terpenes the kind of overall

1501
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:07,259
the quality of the excitement and but I

1502
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:10,099
feel like there's still a lot of the

1503
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:12,830
market who is kind of THC driven like

1504
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:15,199
you know this one's 90-proof yeah but

1505
01:01:12,829 --> 01:01:15,909
it's like D once and that's to say like

1506
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:18,649
okay

1507
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:21,109
alcohol gets you drunk right at a

1508
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:23,329
certain point but to me I've never

1509
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:25,309
really liked the taste of like people

1510
01:01:23,329 --> 01:01:27,289
love whiskey and bourbon it to me it's

1511
01:01:25,309 --> 01:01:29,690
like it burns when you drink that stuff

1512
01:01:27,289 --> 01:01:31,460
and to me it's like okay if I'm chasing

1513
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:34,130
this effect don't I want it to taste

1514
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:36,019
good and not be so harsh so the thing is

1515
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:38,360
is well we will look at high

1516
01:01:36,019 --> 01:01:41,269
concentrations of THC and concentrates

1517
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:42,980
for instance some people don't like vape

1518
01:01:41,269 --> 01:01:45,739
pens because it's real harsh and I know

1519
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:47,240
for me at least one vape cartridges the

1520
01:01:45,739 --> 01:01:48,949
more you smoke em is kind of like that

1521
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:50,989
old effect you'd get from a vaporizer

1522
01:01:48,949 --> 01:01:55,039
you kind of get this cough I feel like

1523
01:01:50,989 --> 01:01:57,799
or you smoke dabs and it's 70 plus

1524
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:59,989
percent THC but there's people out there

1525
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:04,310
that can just do dam after dam after dam

1526
01:01:59,989 --> 01:02:06,469
but they can't smoke three joints why is

1527
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:09,289
that they've consumed so much more THC

1528
01:02:06,469 --> 01:02:11,419
so that already tells you that everybody

1529
01:02:09,289 --> 01:02:12,980
is slightly different what is that

1530
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:15,470
difference that's what we need to really

1531
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:17,900
focus on so what's your preferred do you

1532
01:02:15,469 --> 01:02:19,129
like rolling joints do you like I like

1533
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:23,360
everything okay

1534
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:25,490
III got off the tee like okay like tapas

1535
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:27,079
a little bit of everything well you know

1536
01:02:25,489 --> 01:02:29,269
getting involved with different

1537
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:30,980
companies and just getting involved into

1538
01:02:29,269 --> 01:02:32,389
the testing process like a lot of people

1539
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:33,530
don't realize like I had an argument

1540
01:02:32,389 --> 01:02:37,219
today with somebody I was like look

1541
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:40,430
papers blunts hemp raps to me the

1542
01:02:37,219 --> 01:02:43,009
ultimate goal in life would be to smoke

1543
01:02:40,429 --> 01:02:44,480
weed wrapped in weed and it doesn't

1544
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:47,270
change the flavor how do we do that

1545
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:49,880
that's what we need to do because in a

1546
01:02:47,269 --> 01:02:52,699
real rural health aspect is it really

1547
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:54,559
healthy to smoke paper probably not

1548
01:02:52,699 --> 01:02:56,809
whether Trice paper had paper any paper

1549
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:58,789
how about kombucha paper which that's

1550
01:02:56,809 --> 01:03:00,409
how in the market well the thing is is

1551
01:02:58,789 --> 01:03:01,699
all these things have a subtle taste

1552
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:03,170
difference and it's like the same

1553
01:03:01,699 --> 01:03:04,819
argument with people be like oh I only

1554
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:06,980
smoke with big lighters well it's

1555
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:08,960
because you like the taste of the the

1556
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:10,490
lighter fluid if you change the lighter

1557
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:11,929
on them they could taste the difference

1558
01:03:10,489 --> 01:03:14,419
what are you tasting you're not tasting

1559
01:03:11,929 --> 01:03:16,879
the weed completely it's it's almost

1560
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:19,070
like a mixology at that point you know

1561
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,599
even if you go into like a hemp wick you

1562
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:22,910
know it's like even hemp foot

1563
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:24,860
their own certain flavor profile when

1564
01:03:22,909 --> 01:03:26,929
you put them out you're smelling this

1565
01:03:24,860 --> 01:03:28,160
kind of burnt smell in you know at the

1566
01:03:26,929 --> 01:03:33,169
same time when you're trying to inhale

1567
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:35,000
your weed so you know finding out what

1568
01:03:33,170 --> 01:03:38,059
what really suits people don't chase

1569
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:40,460
after the THC content because that's

1570
01:03:38,059 --> 01:03:42,139
just like going to the bar and saying I

1571
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:44,090
want the strongest thing you have on the

1572
01:03:42,139 --> 01:03:45,920
menu and that's all I want I don't care

1573
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:47,269
because that's the effect I'm chasing

1574
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,700
and I don't care what it feels like to

1575
01:03:47,269 --> 01:03:51,590
get there I don't think you know when

1576
01:03:49,699 --> 01:03:53,389
people are really getting approached and

1577
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:56,030
that that way that they're gonna say

1578
01:03:53,389 --> 01:03:58,609
yeah give me the strongest thing now you

1579
01:03:56,030 --> 01:04:00,500
know realistically if I gave you a glass

1580
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:02,329
of wine that was 12 percent alcohol and

1581
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,739
14 percent alcohol and you drink six

1582
01:04:02,329 --> 01:04:07,039
glasses of each you're probably not

1583
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:10,069
gonna see much of a difference who's a

1584
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:12,380
reader who you respect and what what

1585
01:04:10,070 --> 01:04:15,080
some of the new genetics that you're

1586
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:17,950
excited to play with one of the people

1587
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:20,840
I'm gonna mention it takes me back to

1588
01:04:17,949 --> 01:04:23,119
working behind the counter and seeing

1589
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:25,400
where they got today

1590
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:28,670
for instance the the vault seed bank

1591
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:30,170
guys were a longtime customer of ours

1592
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:32,840
through a company called green coast

1593
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:35,539
hydroponics where I originally met the

1594
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:39,260
owner of that company and just seeing

1595
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:40,639
the the evolving you know times for

1596
01:04:39,260 --> 01:04:44,450
everybody and seeing what they've been

1597
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:47,210
able to do it's really cool because the

1598
01:04:44,449 --> 01:04:48,529
strains that they're able to create you

1599
01:04:47,210 --> 01:04:51,619
know there's people that they have

1600
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:53,450
promoting these strains for them people

1601
01:04:51,619 --> 01:04:57,679
that I looked up to you like people like

1602
01:04:53,449 --> 01:05:00,500
be real or everybody's heard the song I

1603
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:03,339
got five on it and you got people like

1604
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:05,840
the the yuck mouth cool ah no strain or

1605
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:08,960
whether that's the strain for me or not

1606
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:10,460
you know I'll say it's not bad but it's

1607
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,780
it's some people really like it some

1608
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:14,809
people aren't just like any other weed

1609
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:16,640
but I think that you know what they've

1610
01:05:14,809 --> 01:05:19,159
been able to do to this point and seeing

1611
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:20,719
the the whole kind of progression of

1612
01:05:19,159 --> 01:05:22,849
it's almost like watching your kid grow

1613
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:26,269
up you see somebody start at one level

1614
01:05:22,849 --> 01:05:27,289
where you mentioned the word IPM to them

1615
01:05:26,269 --> 01:05:29,659
and they're like what the fuck is that

1616
01:05:27,289 --> 01:05:33,099
to seeing where they're at today it's

1617
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:36,769
really cool to see people all involved

1618
01:05:33,099 --> 01:05:41,720
you know I know that a lot of people do

1619
01:05:36,769 --> 01:05:45,429
a lot of marketing and at the end of the

1620
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:48,019
day there's so many different strains

1621
01:05:45,429 --> 01:05:50,000
that it's it's really hard for you to

1622
01:05:48,019 --> 01:05:52,550
say that one is better than the other

1623
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,210
because really wheat is different for

1624
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:56,180
everybody

1625
01:05:53,210 --> 01:06:01,130
and for me I always have the strains

1626
01:05:56,179 --> 01:06:02,598
that I like in all aspects I don't

1627
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:04,519
research a lot of the stuff that's

1628
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:06,019
nostalgic for instance you know there's

1629
01:06:04,519 --> 01:06:08,960
strains that I've had for years I have

1630
01:06:06,019 --> 01:06:10,909
no idea who made them I have no idea

1631
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:14,240
where they came from I know how to grow

1632
01:06:10,909 --> 01:06:16,639
them and what are some of those trains

1633
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:19,039
oh man

1634
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:24,319
seeing one strain that I really like is

1635
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:28,670
I have a cut of I call it j1 but we've

1636
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:32,030
had this cut for man probably two

1637
01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:35,119
thousand four or five something like

1638
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:37,420
that never really had a long term mom of

1639
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:40,309
it's always been cloned of cloned and

1640
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:43,519
this is something that we were given at

1641
01:06:40,309 --> 01:06:44,809
a Orange County normal meeting at a long

1642
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:48,139
time ago I got the privilege of meeting

1643
01:06:44,809 --> 01:06:50,480
Jack Herer and I mentioned that I loved

1644
01:06:48,139 --> 01:06:53,170
the strain so much somebody that was

1645
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:57,800
there with him gave me a plant of this

1646
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:59,659
years ago and it was always a fun plant

1647
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:03,200
to grow I've always liked the taste of

1648
01:06:59,659 --> 01:07:05,118
it it's one of those plants that just

1649
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:07,098
gets enormous buds too so I don't know

1650
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:08,900
if anybody's ever grown it or gets the

1651
01:07:07,099 --> 01:07:12,440
chance to grow one of those strains like

1652
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:14,960
a jack or j1 but you know it has those

1653
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:19,130
huge pineapple buds like you get from

1654
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:22,550
the skunk and you know for me before it

1655
01:07:19,130 --> 01:07:25,099
was just og cush days you know there was

1656
01:07:22,550 --> 01:07:27,859
a gray market aspect of things and for

1657
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:30,950
me it was like well I can get a pound

1658
01:07:27,858 --> 01:07:33,980
and a half for light of OG Kush or I can

1659
01:07:30,949 --> 01:07:35,569
get three pounds of light of this right

1660
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:37,699
there's a hundred dollar difference in

1661
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:40,039
the market it's a no-brainer which way

1662
01:07:37,699 --> 01:07:42,319
I'm gonna go so it was one of those

1663
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:44,139
strains that I just really started to

1664
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:46,570
grow especially going after the

1665
01:07:44,139 --> 01:07:49,119
one plant perlite and it was just easy

1666
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:51,130
for me and you know I just fell in love

1667
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:53,889
with that strain in particular and I

1668
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:55,650
think that you know going into a lot of

1669
01:07:53,889 --> 01:07:58,359
strains today I get a lot of that like

1670
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:59,920
it it almost gives you that hint of kind

1671
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:02,200
of like where that you get that tangi

1672
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:04,180
smell or there's certain aspects to the

1673
01:08:02,199 --> 01:08:06,429
smell that I get different aromas from

1674
01:08:04,179 --> 01:08:11,460
it all the time it's it's a fun plant to

1675
01:08:06,429 --> 01:08:15,969
grow and you know besides that I think I

1676
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:19,720
have a new strain that we developed it

1677
01:08:15,969 --> 01:08:21,670
was a cross of OG Kush and cookies and

1678
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:24,490
cream I have no idea what we're gonna

1679
01:08:21,670 --> 01:08:26,829
call it but we're waiting to see five

1680
01:08:24,489 --> 01:08:28,210
more weeks and they'll be done and for

1681
01:08:26,829 --> 01:08:31,750
the second time we ran it just see

1682
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:33,340
stability wise but I'm excited about

1683
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:35,500
just being able to be a part of

1684
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:37,449
something like that it was cool we never

1685
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:40,899
really knew what we were doing with the

1686
01:08:37,449 --> 01:08:42,699
breathing thing we had a dispensary

1687
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:45,519
owner that had a bunch of male plants in

1688
01:08:42,699 --> 01:08:47,979
his backyard and decided to do his own

1689
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:49,360
breeding and that was kind of the start

1690
01:08:47,979 --> 01:08:53,469
of a lot of the different strains we

1691
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:55,689
developed and one of the cultivations I

1692
01:08:53,470 --> 01:08:57,190
worked with is no longer so being able

1693
01:08:55,689 --> 01:09:00,159
to hold on to those strains was kind of

1694
01:08:57,189 --> 01:09:02,019
a nice thing just because they're no

1695
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:04,029
longer cultivating themselves that was

1696
01:09:02,020 --> 01:09:07,600
actually the the place they originally

1697
01:09:04,029 --> 01:09:08,920
did the grow off with and since then the

1698
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:13,329
the cultivation has been turned into

1699
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:16,690
manufacturing and distribution the seeds

1700
01:09:13,329 --> 01:09:20,649
find it more profitable but is what it

1701
01:09:16,689 --> 01:09:23,139
is you know what's something that you

1702
01:09:20,649 --> 01:09:26,139
remember from 10 15 years ago that

1703
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:28,990
you're like I wish I could find that

1704
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:31,390
again or recreate it I love smoking

1705
01:09:28,989 --> 01:09:33,579
snowcap was a big one to mean back in

1706
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:35,770
the day it was a cool strain it it was

1707
01:09:33,579 --> 01:09:38,199
just so fresh and kind of like pepper

1708
01:09:35,770 --> 01:09:39,670
mini it was a unique smell and where did

1709
01:09:38,199 --> 01:09:42,189
it originate from or what's the back I

1710
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:45,250
think that was a Mendocino County strain

1711
01:09:42,189 --> 01:09:46,960
Humboldt constraint I always loved

1712
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:48,060
trainwreck was a big one back in the day

1713
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:55,230
I love the the kind

1714
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:57,720
lemony smell and taste there's another

1715
01:09:55,229 --> 01:10:01,229
one when I was really getting into

1716
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:03,780
growing around 2003 I want to say 2004

1717
01:10:01,229 --> 01:10:06,389
we called it juicy fruit and it smelled

1718
01:10:03,779 --> 01:10:10,319
and tasted just like the gum did it was

1719
01:10:06,390 --> 01:10:12,060
it was incredible there's all kinds of

1720
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:13,859
strains back there remember one was like

1721
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:15,300
a squirt that was kind of a version of

1722
01:10:13,859 --> 01:10:20,609
it I believe but it was just more

1723
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:23,420
citrusy shit we used to do the original

1724
01:10:20,609 --> 01:10:28,799
skunk number one we did a lot of that

1725
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:31,109
White Widow another old one it was funny

1726
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,270
there wasn't much to choose from back

1727
01:10:31,109 --> 01:10:36,889
then it was like if people had seeds or

1728
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:41,040
if you knew the person with the cut I

1729
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:43,380
remember paying $5,000 to have a cut of

1730
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:46,739
Bubba cash just to grow the original

1731
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:49,920
Bubba back in like 2004 we were growing

1732
01:10:46,739 --> 01:10:51,149
bubba kush you know in 2003 the same

1733
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:54,659
person that gave me the Bubba I had the

1734
01:10:51,149 --> 01:10:56,460
OG Kush from and you know that's kind of

1735
01:10:54,659 --> 01:10:58,710
what the the dominating strains were

1736
01:10:56,460 --> 01:11:00,359
then it was like the Bubba was huge for

1737
01:10:58,710 --> 01:11:04,710
a long time I actually love that strain

1738
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:07,739
I don't see it ever and this was all

1739
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:09,930
your kind of like OC scene is that kind

1740
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:12,300
of where you're sort of epicenter is I

1741
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:15,180
mean I came from Michigan to California

1742
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:17,369
I grew up we'll call it high school days

1743
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:19,050
more in like Southern California Garden

1744
01:11:17,369 --> 01:11:22,260
Grove Long Beach area so you came to

1745
01:11:19,050 --> 01:11:27,720
California in high school like junior

1746
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:30,600
high or junior high but so cannabis wise

1747
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:33,000
for you growing up was SoCal it wasn't

1748
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:35,850
yes you hundred percent is SoCal okay so

1749
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:37,710
you're so cowboy you know we're we were

1750
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:40,910
highly influenced in the area I was at

1751
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:44,460
by like the Kottonmouth Kings kind of

1752
01:11:40,909 --> 01:11:45,868
music scene and a lot of the people that

1753
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:50,059
were connected into the egg

1754
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:52,738
up in that area and not only that like

1755
01:11:50,059 --> 01:11:54,409
just that whole scene back then and was

1756
01:11:52,738 --> 01:11:58,168
different it was it was kind of like

1757
01:11:54,408 --> 01:12:00,058
smoking weed in your car we loved

1758
01:11:58,168 --> 01:12:01,948
driving in traffic on the freeway for an

1759
01:12:00,059 --> 01:12:05,369
excerpt ooh - because you can hotbox and

1760
01:12:01,948 --> 01:12:07,288
not get in trouble it was different

1761
01:12:05,368 --> 01:12:10,109
everybody has different experiences for

1762
01:12:07,288 --> 01:12:11,158
me it was kind of nice because you know

1763
01:12:10,109 --> 01:12:13,139
I was one of those people that always

1764
01:12:11,158 --> 01:12:16,018
had a cigarette on me or a cigarette in

1765
01:12:13,139 --> 01:12:18,090
my car because you know you can't smell

1766
01:12:16,019 --> 01:12:19,829
like weed and go home so I puff the

1767
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:21,779
thing blow it in my shared a bunch of

1768
01:12:19,828 --> 01:12:24,328
times and blow it all over myself and I

1769
01:12:21,779 --> 01:12:26,698
remember getting a bunch of messages

1770
01:12:24,328 --> 01:12:28,228
posted to my room for my mom one day

1771
01:12:26,698 --> 01:12:31,498
about like how I shouldn't smoke

1772
01:12:28,229 --> 01:12:35,309
cigarettes bad for you and he's anti

1773
01:12:31,498 --> 01:12:37,498
cigarette ad tapes and pamphlets and I

1774
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:39,119
remember just like going to my drawer

1775
01:12:37,498 --> 01:12:41,849
and I pulled out this film container

1776
01:12:39,118 --> 01:12:44,808
with a fat noggin it I was like mom I'm

1777
01:12:41,849 --> 01:12:47,309
not smoking cigarettes I'm smoking this

1778
01:12:44,809 --> 01:12:49,918
and what was your reaction to that I

1779
01:12:47,309 --> 01:12:52,489
mean she was happy actually like she'd

1780
01:12:49,918 --> 01:12:55,139
rather me smoke pot than drink alcohol

1781
01:12:52,488 --> 01:12:57,118
it was more like look if you're gonna be

1782
01:12:55,139 --> 01:12:58,229
doing stupid stuff like that at this age

1783
01:12:57,118 --> 01:13:00,719
don't get in trouble

1784
01:12:58,229 --> 01:13:04,559
you know don't let your dad see that

1785
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:07,679
you're smoking pot obviously but you

1786
01:13:04,559 --> 01:13:09,899
know I think that was the the start of

1787
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:12,090
having a good education about it for me

1788
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:13,829
is being open and having some of you

1789
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:17,489
could be open with at that point of your

1790
01:13:13,828 --> 01:13:19,918
life because I mean my parents my mom I

1791
01:13:17,488 --> 01:13:22,109

1792
01:13:19,918 --> 01:13:25,288
hippies you know went to Woodstock naked

1793
01:13:22,109 --> 01:13:27,198
type shit so they were very

1794
01:13:25,288 --> 01:13:30,118
understanding people when it comes to

1795
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:33,658
whether it's psychedelic type stuff or

1796
01:13:30,118 --> 01:13:37,618
