I'm very pleased to be moderating this

3
00:00:10,289 --> 00:00:15,239
panel today really looking in depth at

4
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:16,800
some of the lessons from early regulated

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,420
markets across the country including

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,980
California Oregon and Colorado again

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,618
that Lindsey Robinson California

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,539
cannabis Industry Association so I'm

9
00:00:25,618 --> 00:00:30,839
gonna pass this over to Caitlin first

10
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,399
off hi I'm Caitlin or so I work for the

11
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,149
Colorado Department of Public Health and

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,939
Environment

13
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:40,079
I have been with CDP for 10 years in

14
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:42,390
January yeah it's been a while I have a

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,780
mechanical engineering degree I have

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,239
played several roles at CDP from writing

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,710
actual regulations writing drinking

18
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:52,078
water regulations was one of my first

19
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,628
roles to doing community outreach

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,189
projects the role that I'm in now is

21
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:57,869
very dynamic and interesting I'm

22
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,968
basically a free environmental

23
00:00:57,869 --> 00:01:02,189
consultant for all small businesses in

24
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:04,379
Colorado I personally happen to

25
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:06,810
specialize in craft brewing in cannabis

26
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,900
a lot of people laugh and say like is

27
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:12,210
that your real job it is those those are

28
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,520
two small business sectors in Colorado

29
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:16,109
that are large growth industries that

30
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,478
both use a lot of environmental

31
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:21,359
resources just inherent in their process

32
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,459
and so that's kind of the the Nexus of

33
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:24,959
my role and really I'm here to just help

34
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:29,158
make the cannabis industry more

35
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:33,419
environmentally friendly and I have to

36
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,700
follow that so my name is Jesse Peters I

37
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,070
was a co-founder of eco firma farms

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,549
which was a cultivation operation up in

39
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:43,978
Oregon we sold that business in June of

40
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,979
2018 and time that we sold it we were

41
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:49,200
cultivating indoor cannabis for $199 a

42
00:01:46,978 --> 00:01:50,849
pound we were doing it on a hundred

43
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,109
percent renewable energy and we were

44
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:57,000
almost carbon neutral I since then have

45
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:59,670
founded mantas growth investments we are

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,218
an MSO consolidating companies primarily

47
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,990
across the west coast and I was a

48
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:05,218
founding member of the organ cannabis

49
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:07,548
Association and still a board member

50
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:07,548
there

51
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:13,889
I'm Gary court lat I'm an engineer with

52
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:16,489
Southern California Edison I work in our

53
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,750
energy analysis and customer outreach

54
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:23,719
organization work with our business

55
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:26,330
customers with energy efficiency and

56
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:28,500
I've been doing that for about 10 years

57
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,320
through that time I've been working with

58
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,090
our agricultural customers and for the

59
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:39,180
last four years I've been dedicated to

60
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:42,120
indoor horticulture okay

61
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:45,810
so let's dig in as many of you know if

62
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,629
you operate in California we have local

63
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,159
and state level laws that govern what

64
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:51,990
you can do in various jurisdictions

65
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,659
across the state and it is a very

66
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,070
complicated patchwork we have some

67
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:58,799
communities that are quite friendly to

68
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,870
cannabis and are regulating you know

69
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,060
manufacturing distribution retail

70
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:06,900
cultivation and some were it's a

71
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,000
complete ban de facto prohibition so I'd

72
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,950
love to talk first off with Gary just a

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,050
little bit about what you see in the

74
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:15,599
challenges particularly in Coachella

75
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:20,760
Valley and what some of your the main

76
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:23,579
factors that you focus on currently so

77
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:26,989
the the the main issues that we have in

78
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:31,320
the Coachella Valley originally were

79
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:32,820
that our infrastructure wasn't capable

80
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:35,870
of providing the power that's required

81
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:38,579
for these facilities the initial

82
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:43,409
investments there were made in Desert

83
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,850
Hot Springs and the city in their wisdom

84
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:47,579
when they were doing this decided that

85
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:50,669
they wanted to make a cannabis business

86
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:54,020
park and they did that in an area of

87
00:03:50,669 --> 00:04:00,949
desert that was was zoned for five acre

88
00:03:54,020 --> 00:04:03,000
single-family homes and suddenly we have

89
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:06,349
actually about twelve different

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,959
facilities there and about thirty acres

91
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:13,889
so and each of them takes about you know

92
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:17,370
one one to five megawatts so that's the

93
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:20,608
same as having a megawatt that serves

94
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,870
about 750 homes in California so it's

95
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:24,930
the same as having between

96
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:28,110
you know 750 and 3,000 homes on a five

97
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,728
acre lot we you know we kind of jump on

98
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,290
this from a lot of topics I think this

99
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:33,240
is a really kind of important one to

100
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,189
look at where as California and Oregon

101
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,860
kind of did the same thing right we have

102
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:40,680
this free market for licensing which I

103
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,240
am a huge fan of because whereas some

104
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,009
people say it's a race to the bottom I

105
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,500
would say it's a race to be more

106
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:49,490
efficient and if you are looking at

107
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:53,100
building a cultivation facility in

108
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:55,228
Desert Hot Springs and your exit

109
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,150
strategy hopefully that you have one is

110
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:59,490
to be acquired by someone else in the

111
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:02,339
future I can tell you personally as a

112
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,168
West Coast MSO operator I am NOT looking

113
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:05,849
at your company we're looking at

114
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:08,129
potential for interstate commerce when

115
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,020
we move forward in the world California

116
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:11,699
and Oregon are known for growing a large

117
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:16,859
quantity of the whole country's cannabis

118
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:18,389
in the north where you can get power for

119
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,788
better prices where there's renewable

120
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:23,280
resources and so as much as I appreciate

121
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:24,959
all of it I think it's you know when you

122
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,549
hear these numbers not only coming from

123
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,739
a power perspective or coming from an

124
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,228
environmental standpoint but you have to

125
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,030
think of it economically as well what is

126
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:35,219
your exit strategy what is your plan I

127
00:05:33,029 --> 00:05:37,168
mean everybody who goes to work every

128
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,160
day has an exit strategy it's to retire

129
00:05:37,168 --> 00:05:42,389
so you've got an exit strategy if you

130
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,039
haven't thought about it yet and that's

131
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:45,509
the either that you're going to retire

132
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:46,939
from this company and give it to someone

133
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:50,909
else which means it needs to

134
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:52,649
substantially survive through what is

135
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:54,410
going to be a very difficult and Tremmel

136
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:57,120
Jewess market over the next two decades

137
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:59,039
or you need to think of where it's at

138
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,930
and be really efficient with it and so I

139
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:03,029
think that this any of these things and

140
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,189
heeding warnings to thinking of what

141
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:08,359
you're doing moving forward is crucially

142
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:10,529
important at conferences like this I

143
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,240
think they covered it pretty well but I

144
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:13,918
think the only thing that I have to add

145
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,810
is you know coming from Colorado's

146
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,538
perspective and being one of the most

147
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,160
mature markets in the country we you

148
00:06:18,538 --> 00:06:23,490
know we learned a lot of hard lessons

149
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,830
really early on and we also there was a

150
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,870
lot of fear around being the first to

151
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:30,149
legalize in the way that we did and so

152
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,370
all of our regulatory structure was

153
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:33,620
centered around safety security and no

154
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,079
diversion to the black market

155
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,689
environmental and if

156
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,550
see standards were not considered that's

157
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,470
that's why we have the situation in

158
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,560
Colorado where most of our cannabis has

159
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,110
grown indoors under lock and key

160
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,038
and it creates a lot of environmental

161
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:53,500
detriment so yeah and I think you know

162
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:55,718
we as going through the process with

163
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,000
with California over the last several

164
00:06:55,718 --> 00:07:02,050
years we have tried to look at Colorado

165
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,259
as as a roadmap on what worked and what

166
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:07,449
what didn't and I have to say a lot of

167
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:09,038
California regulators um did not really

168
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:11,439
heat a lot of the warnings that we saw

169
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:14,228
from Colorado and have implemented

170
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,939
regulations in California that are that

171
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:17,589
are caught that are proving to be

172
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:19,509
problematic and I think one of the

173
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:21,279
things that we talked a bit about

174
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:23,379
earlier and we really also wanted this

175
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,908
to just be a conversation amongst us and

176
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:27,129
then obviously open it up to all of you

177
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:28,990
and be able to learn from each other is

178
00:07:27,129 --> 00:07:31,658
the stress on the on the grid and I

179
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:35,769
think that you're seeing a really

180
00:07:31,658 --> 00:07:38,228
dramatic case of that down in them in

181
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:39,728
the desert areas so can you expand a

182
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:42,579
little bit about that and if you've gone

183
00:07:39,728 --> 00:07:44,168
through if there's been any significant

184
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:46,389
complications that have in some ways

185
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:52,568
affected people's businesses or their

186
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:54,460
ability to maintain yes so Desert Hot

187
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:57,039
Springs is actually one of the better

188
00:07:54,459 --> 00:08:00,878
examples of what we've been able to do

189
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:03,759
to accommodate they're real close we

190
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,500
have wind power that's out in that area

191
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,439
it's designated for other parts of the

192
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,569
the grid but it means that we have a

193
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:13,718
distribution level or I'm sorry a

194
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:17,560
transmission level substation in in that

195
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:20,019
area so we were able to expand an

196
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,459
existing distribution substation to

197
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:23,049
provide a little bit of power and we

198
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:28,680
were able to bring power in from other

199
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:31,629
areas to support the facilities there

200
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:36,129
the the other extreme to that is

201
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:39,038
California City where that's a community

202
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:41,679
that's basically it was a retirement

203
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:44,429
community there's no no industry to

204
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,429
speak of there

205
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:50,100
was a large housing tract that was

206
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:52,679
planned and power was put in for it but

207
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:56,399
it never developed so that allowed us to

208
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:58,949
pull some power but the major issue is

209
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,750
that they again put all of their

210
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,750
cannabis facilities in the cannabis

211
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:07,350
Business Park that Business Park was

212
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:11,039
located a half mile or so from the

213
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:13,440
nearest distribution line and not only

214
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:18,569
for electricity but also for gas and

215
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:21,209
water and so the the basically nobody

216
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,850
out there has power or any other

217
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:29,669
utilities there because of that so

218
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:30,750
that's the other extreme yeah so for

219
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,639
those who aren't familiar with it and

220
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,990
we're kind of newer into the California

221
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,328
market so I apologize that I'm not

222
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,789
completely up to speed on on all

223
00:09:36,328 --> 00:09:40,199
California regulations so no one's

224
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:43,199
allowed to hold me to any of this

225
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,600
disclaimer but no there's a green zone

226
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,120
up around Arcada that where California

227
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,300
established some regulations that remove

228
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:54,209
the taxation and basically said for lack

229
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:56,490
of a lot more red tape apply for a

230
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:58,439
license pay the fee and it's yours we're

231
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,810
not going to play the game of continuing

232
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,480
to look at regulation upon regulation

233
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:06,119
upon regulation and and so of course for

234
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,610
me looking at MSOs this this is a giant

235
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,490
flag waving around the sky that says

236
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,629
come by my company because if you think

237
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,370
about the way the California market

238
00:10:12,629 --> 00:10:16,019
works and some of the things that in my

239
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:19,110
opinion we're starting to see as an

240
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:22,320
issue in California is you're looking at

241
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,579
the the every as everybody makes

242
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,199
regulation and we spoke about this

243
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:26,879
earlier Santa Barbara just came out and

244
00:10:25,198 --> 00:10:29,159
said that you can cultivate cannabis and

245
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:32,129
we are doing that there oh by the way

246
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:37,919
wait you can't dry it it's a big fire

247
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:41,490
hazard what was your plan with all of it

248
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,929
when we got done growing it so you look

249
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,799
at this regulation and now we've got to

250
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:45,929
figure out what we're gonna do with it

251
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:48,000
okay we're gonna turn it to fresh frozen

252
00:10:45,929 --> 00:10:50,909
or are we going to ship it to a drying

253
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,078
facility you know when I send it to the

254
00:10:50,909 --> 00:10:57,120
manual to vation tax and then when the

255
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:58,299
processor sends it to the manufacturer

256
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,460
to package it they need to

257
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:02,139
pay a manufacturing tax and then when

258
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,730
you send it to the distributor you pay a

259
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:05,889
distribution tax and then they give it

260
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:10,509
to the delivery or the retail where you

261
00:11:05,889 --> 00:11:12,460
pay attacks and now I'm spending $62 for

262
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:15,720
a gram of cannabis that's been handled

263
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:19,330
47 times in a bag that I can't see or

264
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,730
potentially even recycle when my friend

265
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,710
Rick has been selling me bags for 40

266
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,420
bucks that now grows like 18 different

267
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,660
strains I love all of them and it's

268
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:31,509
still 40 bucks why don't we have a giant

269
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:33,309
market in California I feel like we're

270
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:35,919
figuring that out and so when you look

271
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:37,629
at the green zone you look at this space

272
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,639
where I don't have to pay any of that

273
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:41,740
tax in the middle so if we get really

274
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,240
efficient with those locations and I

275
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,289
don't pay all that tax in the middle and

276
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,389
we vertically integrate ourselves

277
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:47,919
throughout there maybe we can start

278
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:50,730
getting a product to consumers at a

279
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:53,979
competitive price and start getting the

280
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:55,659
unregulated market do you want to come

281
00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:01,600
into the regulated market that's the

282
00:11:55,659 --> 00:12:02,980
goal right yeah so I mean I again I

283
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,930
think that there are a lot of lessons

284
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:09,820
that we're learning in California real

285
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:12,399
time we obviously have we you know the

286
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,110
the local access and local control has

287
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,809
been a huge component of how California

288
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,669
has regulated cannabis which has turned

289
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:21,549
some communities into much friendlier

290
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:24,189
zones than others and then even within

291
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:25,809
those communities they have green zones

292
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,420
or areas that are much more friendly but

293
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:30,549
oftentimes we've heard from our members

294
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:33,159
that those areas are not necessarily

295
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:34,990
conducive for running businesses and so

296
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:38,289
I think you know we touched a little bit

297
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:40,930
about on that with access and and just

298
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:42,370
over taxing of the grid especially and

299
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:44,379
then really just making sure that these

300
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,870
businesses are kind of you know grouped

301
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:49,509
into a certain area I think is

302
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:52,539
beneficial in certain ways but also

303
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:54,069
problematic in others and so we're like

304
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:56,230
I said trying to figure all of this out

305
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,090
in real time in California and it's

306
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,519
basically like running a small country

307
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:03,940
or even a medium-sized country really

308
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:05,379
and we love over-regulation so one of

309
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,820
the things that I I thought was really

310
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:08,710
interesting about what Caitlin said

311
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,320
earlier is and I'd love for you to

312
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:13,680
elaborate on your 30 different

313
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,680
conversations that you

314
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:21,409
yes so when you know one of the things

315
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,449
that the roles that I play is I am

316
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:26,659
researching the air quality impacts of

317
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:27,910
the cannabis industry something that not

318
00:13:26,659 --> 00:13:30,860
a lot of people are talking about

319
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:34,100
besides you know the secondary impacts

320
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:37,250
of power generation but inherent within

321
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,830
the cultivation and processing is is air

322
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:42,799
emissions terpenes are volatile organic

323
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:45,770
compounds they're not just an odor

324
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:48,319
nuisance volatile organic compounds I

325
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:50,000
have a slide on this but I'll show it to

326
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,770
you guys in a little bit volatile

327
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,889
organic compounds are ozone precursors

328
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:56,899
ozone is toxic for us to breathe it's an

329
00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:58,819
it's an issue that that's pretty big in

330
00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:01,458
Colorado and with the way that we

331
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,800
legalized marijuana in Colorado not only

332
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:05,838
did we force it all indoors but we zoned

333
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:08,179
it industrial and we put all these other

334
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,580
regulatory restrictions on setbacks from

335
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:11,958
schools and other cannabis businesses I

336
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,700
mean there's a lot of regulation now

337
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:16,099
surrounding where you can grow marijuana

338
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,720
in Colorado and what it did is it forced

339
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,930
about 60 to 70 percent of the

340
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,690
cultivation into our metropolitan area

341
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:25,338
the reason why that's important is not

342
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:27,020
only we stressing our grid but we're

343
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:29,990
stressing our municipal drinking water

344
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:33,919
supply our wastewater effluent our air

345
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:36,470
quality because ozone is VOCs and

346
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,759
combustion emissions combined so when

347
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:39,200
you put it in the city that's where all

348
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,990
of our power plants are that's where all

349
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,610
of our traffic is that's where all of

350
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,190
our combustion activities are and so

351
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,470
it's just compounding issues with the

352
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,270
way that we legalized and forcing you

353
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,778
know what should be an agricultural

354
00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:57,679
commodity into a literally manufacturing

355
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:59,299
environment yeah and I think one of the

356
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,809
the items that we had touched on earlier

357
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:04,819
as well is that you know in in you

358
00:15:02,809 --> 00:15:09,078
having conversations on the regulatory

359
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,879
level in terms of air quality compared

360
00:15:09,078 --> 00:15:12,500
comparing Colorado to California I'd

361
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,028
love for you to highlight an example of

362
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,600
how difficult it is to regulate here

363
00:15:14,028 --> 00:15:18,919
yeah so in Colorado we have one Colorado

364
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,159
Department of Public Health and

365
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:24,259
Environment California has many many

366
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,110
many just from an air pollution

367
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:27,569
standpoint

368
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:30,440
we have over 26 air pollution districts

369
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:34,050
that all make up you know one big carb

370
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:36,240
California Air resource board and so you

371
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:38,099
know when I am working with other states

372
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,259
and other entities to try to educate

373
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,079
them on these issues and inform them

374
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:44,639
about how to make smart policy it's

375
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:46,708
really difficult when you go into a

376
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,750
state like California to advise them and

377
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:50,849
you've got this whole patchwork of of

378
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,070
not only different regulations per area

379
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,730
you have different regulatory bodies you

380
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:58,740
have different perspectives you have

381
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:00,959
it's a lot so it you know what takes one

382
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,810
phone call to educate another state like

383
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:05,729
maybe you know Michigan or Oregon takes

384
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:09,958
about 30 phone calls to educate

385
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:11,180
California and it's all piecemeal yes

386
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:13,768
they don't all talk to each other

387
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:15,870
surprising well maybe this would be a

388
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:17,339
good time for us to segue into your

389
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,310
PowerPoint because I think that that

390
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:22,529
will generate more conversation amongst

391
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:23,909
the panelists but then also is just a

392
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:26,009
ton of information that we hope you all

393
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:30,929
can will comment on as well and you need

394
00:16:26,009 --> 00:16:32,458
this our first two slides we're going to

395
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:34,528
share as a group and we're really going

396
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:36,899
to focus on the environmental impacts of

397
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:38,399
the cannabis industry and not just the

398
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:40,019
energy impacts I know that this

399
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,019
conference is really focused on the

400
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:46,919
energy impacts if you want to click it

401
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:48,299
for me I can just cue you but I want to

402
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:51,120
point out the other environmental

403
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:53,189
impacts and so just inherent in the

404
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,659
cultivation and processing and camp of

405
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:56,910
cannabis there's many environmental

406
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:59,309
impacts so we've talked about energy but

407
00:16:56,909 --> 00:17:01,799
what about water and in whether you're

408
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:03,899
growing indoor or outdoor there's water

409
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:06,418
impacts in an indoor environment you're

410
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,250
taking the drinking water water supply

411
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:10,500
that's treated to drinking water

412
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,990
standards and put it in that towards an

413
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,058
agricultural commodity that has a lot of

414
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:19,759
energy impacts it takes a lot of energy

415
00:17:15,058 --> 00:17:23,160
to treat that water all right we got it

416
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:25,798
and so there's there's also in an

417
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,779
outdoor environment or use all you also

418
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:29,039
have a lot of irrigation systems and you

419
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:30,710
need to be efficient with those and so

420
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,509
that kind of gets that water efficiency

421
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:36,240
in an outdoor environment you got runoff

422
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:38,069
and erosion issues and then also indoor

423
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,730
you've got wastewater effluent so you're

424
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:41,369
putting all the

425
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,630
pesticides nutrients you know you got to

426
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:43,979
be aware of what you're putting down the

427
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,330
drain because those wastewater

428
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,839
municipalities that weren't

429
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:50,879
traditionally set up to support a large

430
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:54,240
influx of indoor agriculture are now

431
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,190
taking on that burden there's there's a

432
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,259
lot of waste from the industry plant

433
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,970
waste Universal wastes like your

434
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:02,339
lighting your ballasts your electronic

435
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:04,410
waste and then there's also hazardous

436
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:06,509
waste your leftover solvents cleaning

437
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:09,269
supplies chemicals those types of things

438
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:11,369
as I mentioned air emissions terpenes

439
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:13,168
are volatile organic compounds I got a

440
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:15,689
really great slide to explain why that's

441
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:17,429
important and then also just you know be

442
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,990
aware of the chemical use associated

443
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,419
with cultivation you've got pests if I

444
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,609
pesticides fertilizers solvents and

445
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:26,520
outdoor agro environment you also got a

446
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:28,439
lot of rodenticides so just kind of

447
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:30,869
being aware of this inherent in the

448
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,110
process whether you're indoor or outdoor

449
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:35,909
there is a environmental burden that

450
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:37,979
you're putting on the community and we

451
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:40,558
all need to be smarter about how we run

452
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,509
our businesses to reduce that burden so

453
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,700
I'm going to turn it over to these two

454
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:48,839
guys to comment on environmental impacts

455
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:51,330
of cannabis cultivation yeah you know I

456
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:53,399
look at a lot of these and obviously we

457
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:58,918
look at environmental efficiencies right

458
00:18:53,400 --> 00:19:00,960
but I also look at economic efficiencies

459
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,759
and you start looking at these things

460
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,259
and you look at for example water

461
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:06,629
treatment irrigation runoff erosion

462
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:07,859
waste water effluent and you start

463
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,429
thinking about if I'm in a facility

464
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:14,039
where I pay a water bill and I pay a

465
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:15,419
sewage bill and eventually I'm told I

466
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,849
need to start separating out my

467
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:20,490
fertilizer which should be something I'm

468
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:22,230
doing on my own you start looking at a

469
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,179
cost associated to that and that cost

470
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:26,339
Association breaks down to price per

471
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,110
gram that is going to be a cost under

472
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:30,199
how much it costs me to cultivate hands

473
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:33,899
down and then I look at my competitor

474
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:37,798
who say is in agricultural land they're

475
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:39,960
on a well they have literally dug a hole

476
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:42,119
and got native plants that all of their

477
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,910
runoff goes into and cooks off all of

478
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:45,989
that which is a fancy BIOS well but in

479
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,669
the end it's cooking off all your

480
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:50,640
nutrient that is if you're using too

481
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:51,710
much nutrient I I have just erased that

482
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,259
cost from

483
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:56,600
bottom line so now we're competing and

484
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:58,640
this goes down plant waste

485
00:19:56,599 --> 00:20:00,589
am I in a gland where I can put a fence

486
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,480
around it put a camera on it and I can

487
00:20:00,589 --> 00:20:04,220
let it compost and then I can reuse that

488
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,308
compost and then save myself on

489
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,990
fertilizer or am I using a dumpster am I

490
00:20:07,308 --> 00:20:11,538
having to pay to have it removed through

491
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:14,000
waste are you having to mix it with 50%

492
00:20:11,538 --> 00:20:16,158
non marijuana waste before you put it in

493
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,829
the dumpster right and as we go through

494
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,539
this chemical use pesticides automation

495
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:22,548
to understand that we're using the exact

496
00:20:20,538 --> 00:20:24,740
amount of fertilizer that we need to use

497
00:20:22,548 --> 00:20:27,349
at the exact times under the exact

498
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,849
conditions per strain the research that

499
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:29,658
we talked about yesterday when you're a

500
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:31,428
cultivator and

501
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:33,350
you know we're all kind of used to it

502
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:35,710
you've got these cultivators all of us

503
00:20:33,349 --> 00:20:38,298
I've been guilty of it a thousand times

504
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:40,669
well we can figure that out later

505
00:20:38,298 --> 00:20:42,230
because the margins are there three

506
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:43,788
years ago I had a two years ago had a

507
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,798
conversation with cultivator from here

508
00:20:43,788 --> 00:20:47,778
in California said we get $2,800 a pound

509
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:49,308
that's not going to change for at least

510
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:51,890
three years I don't care what my price

511
00:20:49,308 --> 00:20:53,418
per pound is I haven't called him lately

512
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,669
but I got a feeling that that is not his

513
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:58,399
statement today

514
00:20:54,669 --> 00:21:00,740
so you look at all of those pieces and

515
00:20:58,398 --> 00:21:02,808
and you think to yourself while I have

516
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,179
time I have time to get to it or I need

517
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:07,519
to be able to produce a facility to be

518
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:09,409
able to do that and these are decisions

519
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,710
that need to be made now while you have

520
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:14,480
the time while those margins are there

521
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:17,000
no matter what your equipment says it

522
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,528
can tell you it's 99% efficient at the

523
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,990
end of the day you have humans running

524
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:22,190
these machines it's not going to be 99%

525
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:23,929
efficient

526
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,090
think about you know even when you take

527
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:28,130
the plant material out of the system

528
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:30,250
after it's gone through its you know

529
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:32,990
it's regenerative evaporative process

530
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,700
that those inherent within that plant

531
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:36,319
material still going to be solvent so

532
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:41,140
that solvents going to continue to off

533
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:43,879
gas that those solvents butane propane

534
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,620
ethanol those are all volatile organic

535
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,960
compounds and again I'll talk about the

536
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:50,178
importance of VOCs in a second

537
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,220
also co2 releases you know you can use

538
00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:54,409
pressurized co2 for extraction as well

539
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,179
there's co2 releases from that and also

540
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:58,130
you know worth noting in the indoor

541
00:21:56,179 --> 00:22:01,190
cultivation environment there's a lot of

542
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:03,528
CO supplemental co2 that's used within

543
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,890
that environment as well then once that

544
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:07,410
solvent is spent

545
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,900
doesn't last forever right it goes bad

546
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,610
we have to dispose of it as hazardous

547
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,620
waste and so those are the other

548
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:16,049
environmental impacts and then being

549
00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:17,219
aware of plant waste - you know there's

550
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:19,440
all these regulations out there

551
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,120
especially in Colorado we have a 50/50

552
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,700
waste mixing rule where you have to mix

553
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:26,039
it with 50% non marijuana waste before

554
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,620
it can leave the facility that doubles

555
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:30,659
our landfill footprint on it and

556
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:33,119
honestly we don't have a lot of issues

557
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:35,250
of people stealing trash marijuana trash

558
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,929
so that's something I'd like to see a

559
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:40,259
change to that and we have seen a

560
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:43,680
positive regulatory change as of January

561
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:45,839
1st in Colorado we now have a rule where

562
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,150
the composting truck if it rolls up

563
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:50,429
under surveillance and the dumpsters

564
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,230
under lock and key of the plant waste by

565
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:53,730
a way of tit the truck taking that

566
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,700
dumpster and putting it in the back of

567
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:58,160
the truck that's your 50/50 waste

568
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,970
compliance point and that's acceptable

569
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,220
that's really important because that

570
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,200
also makes composting more accessible

571
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,450
for cultivators because you pay per

572
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,950
pound to compost so if you're doubling

573
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:09,150
the amount that you have to compost

574
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:12,059
you're doubling the amount you have to

575
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:13,920
pay to compost so just things to be

576
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,750
aware of that it doesn't just stop at

577
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,940
the cultivation environment that it's

578
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:20,460
also processing and then you know

579
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,820
distribution as well with all of the

580
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,319
packaging and distribution so yeah I

581
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,500
think that California's had a hard time

582
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:29,429
learning these lessons from Colorado

583
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,579
especially around the environmental

584
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:34,890
waste piece so I think having a few

585
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:37,829
years advance on California has really

586
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:39,780
shaped and informed the regulations that

587
00:23:37,829 --> 00:23:42,119
you're now dealing with and again we're

588
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:44,339
a larger state but I would love to hear

589
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:47,729
maybe a little bit on Oregon on how how

590
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:53,220
things are going up there with you know

591
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:55,650
waste management in Oregon has been it's

592
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:58,170
been I would like to say easy in the

593
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:00,420
sense of it hasn't been over regulated

594
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,880
but that being said when we look at

595
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,710
processors and you know honestly there's

596
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,900
a lot of stuff that Oregon is starting

597
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,549
to look to Colorado for a lot of the

598
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,710
studies that are being put out now what

599
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:13,379
we're talking about right now this is

600
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,150
going to be sensible for us to turn to

601
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,740
when it comes to waste management and as

602
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:20,019
far as farm waste management

603
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:22,150
we're we're looking more towards

604
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:24,339
regulators an organ are concerned that

605
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:26,110
that there's diversion potentially

606
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:28,269
happening through waste

607
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:31,329
so when organ looks at waste it looks

608
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:34,150
more on the regulatory side of diversion

609
00:24:31,329 --> 00:24:36,519
that is rapidly going to change probably

610
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,960
across the industry but especially an

611
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:40,569
organ and looking to Colorado on the

612
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,059
processor side because just the volatile

613
00:24:40,569 --> 00:24:44,829
chemicals the VOCs the look towards what

614
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:46,000
is happening is we can refine that down

615
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:47,619
with processors

616
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,289
I believe that Oregon's gonna turn to a

617
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:51,989
higher regulatory stature there um and

618
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:56,409
that that's obviously going to affect

619
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:57,460
pricing so it's another one of those

620
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,950
things talking about where if you're

621
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,019
trying to be economically viable

622
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:04,330
building a c1 d1 facility even though

623
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:08,650
you're not required to and always trying

624
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:10,659
to be have ingenuity in trying to decide

625
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:12,280
how you're going to handle waste with a

626
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:15,060
moral structure that not only goes

627
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:17,410
behind environmentally friendly but also

628
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:19,599
considering what could happen regulatory

629
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:26,950
wise in the future and being prepared

630
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:27,309
for that we're juggling all this all

631
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,170
right

632
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:32,980
so I'm gonna go into a little bit more

633
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:35,050
Colorado specific issues and and some of

634
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,360
the work that I'm doing just very

635
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:38,470
briefly and I say that because this

636
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,809
could literally be a three-hour

637
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:44,680
conversation and I'm gonna do my best to

638
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:47,859
keep it very short so why are VOCs

639
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,600
important we mentioned that VOCs are

640
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:52,179
coming off of the plants as they grow

641
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:55,990
and in the form of terpenes right we've

642
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:57,730
got mersin pining lemony meter pennilyn

643
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,319
those are all being released into the

644
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,360
atmosphere and those are volatile

645
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:03,460
organic compounds it happens to be that

646
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,229
the terpene emission profile associated

647
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,210
with cannabis is highly reactive for

648
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,490
ozone formation

649
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:11,829
so when VOCs go up into the atmosphere

650
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,329
they react with other types of pollution

651
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:15,789
those other types of pollution are

652
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:17,829
specifically nitrogen oxide we get

653
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:20,859
nitrogen oxide from combustion sources

654
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:22,869
cars power plants oil and gas activity

655
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:24,849
anytime you're burning something it

656
00:26:22,869 --> 00:26:26,709
could be agricultural burns um it could

657
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:28,329
be wood burning activities if there's

658
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,850
combustion there's going to be nitrogen

659
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:33,788
oxide again

660
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:36,158
really important for Colorado we we are

661
00:26:33,788 --> 00:26:38,200
not meeting EPA health standards for

662
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,600
ambient ozone concentrations are ready

663
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,028
and then we regulated cannabis in a way

664
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:45,548
that we forced everybody into our

665
00:26:43,028 --> 00:26:48,250
metropolitan area co-located next to all

666
00:26:45,548 --> 00:26:50,408
of our sources of nitrogen oxide what we

667
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:52,630
don't know right now is how many pounds

668
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:54,669
of VOCs are emitted per pound of

669
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,169
cannabis grown that's a question that

670
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:58,480
I'm trying to answer with my research

671
00:26:56,169 --> 00:26:59,799
currently I've got a research grant

672
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,599
through Colorado Department of Public

673
00:26:59,798 --> 00:27:03,638
Health and Environment where I'm

674
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,798
actually collecting air quality samples

675
00:27:03,638 --> 00:27:07,628
at commercial cultivation environments

676
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:10,089
to answer this question of how many

677
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:12,189
pounds of VOCs are emitted per pound of

678
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:15,038
marijuana grown once we're able to

679
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:18,340
answer that question we have really good

680
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:20,648
plant count tracking or you know

681
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:22,480
production tracking in Colorado through

682
00:27:20,648 --> 00:27:24,969
our marijuana Enforcement Division so

683
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,620
then we can couple it that data with

684
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,329
okay how many pounds of marijuana are

685
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:30,308
grown in the state and where what are

686
00:27:28,329 --> 00:27:32,349
all the other sources of nitrogen oxide

687
00:27:30,308 --> 00:27:35,288
and VOCs and really at the end of the

688
00:27:32,349 --> 00:27:37,898
day come to how much of our total ozone

689
00:27:35,288 --> 00:27:41,259
problem in Colorado is attributed to the

690
00:27:37,898 --> 00:27:42,548
cannabis industry some people they hear

691
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:44,169
my research and they think that maybe

692
00:27:42,548 --> 00:27:44,558
I'm picking on cannabis or something

693
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:46,778
like that

694
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:48,759
definitely not we do this for all

695
00:27:46,778 --> 00:27:51,190
regulated industries in Colorado we want

696
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:53,860
to know what everyone's air quality

697
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,750
impact is in Colorado and typically when

698
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:59,319
you get new industries that come online

699
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:01,359
EPA the federal Environmental Protection

700
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:04,269
Agency would be the one to do this type

701
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,128
of research to universally establish

702
00:28:04,269 --> 00:28:07,778
what we call emission factors pounds of

703
00:28:06,128 --> 00:28:10,178
VOCs produced per pound of marijuana

704
00:28:07,778 --> 00:28:12,669
grown EPA is not gonna do that for you

705
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:14,470
guys so Colorado is stepping in and

706
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:17,350
trying to fill that gap in knowledge for

707
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:20,200
other states I'm not the first one to

708
00:28:17,349 --> 00:28:21,699
research this issue there there is other

709
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,490
studies that are out there

710
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,259
however when Colorado looked at those

711
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:28,419
studies we didn't feel they were robust

712
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:30,639
enough to base you know any regulatory

713
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:33,850
or policy decisions on it's also worth

714
00:28:30,638 --> 00:28:36,758
noting that cannabis is a agricultural

715
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:38,349
process especially the cultivation not

716
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:40,569
the manufacturing but the cultivation is

717
00:28:38,349 --> 00:28:42,250
an agricultural process and agricultural

718
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:43,990
processes are exempt from air quality

719
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,440
regulations so at the end of the day

720
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,029
this is

721
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:51,070
fact-finding we want to know what the

722
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:53,589
impact is other states and and Canada do

723
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:56,470
you plan to make regulatory policy

724
00:28:53,589 --> 00:29:01,809
decisions based on this research so

725
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:03,069
something to know about when mine was

726
00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:06,460
only going back to the last point like

727
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:08,289
we talked about earlier this opens up a

728
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:11,950
space eventually to start looking at

729
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:13,720
incentives to get away from industrial

730
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,700
zones that could create this ozone from

731
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,500
VOCs right because originally like

732
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,840
Oregon we talked about when they were

733
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:21,730
looking at scent mitigation they were

734
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:23,409
looking at it because politicians were

735
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:27,099
considering what voters were telling

736
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:28,930
them and so somehow I got invited to be

737
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:31,449
on the three-person Commission to decide

738
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:34,390
how we were gonna regulate the scent

739
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,890
which is essentially the VOCs and what I

740
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:38,680
loved about it was the other two people

741
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:40,540
was the owner of fresh filters who make

742
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,390
carbon filters and the owner of can fans

743
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:45,279
who make vans that hook to those filters

744
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:48,910
just going out on a limb here I feel as

745
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:51,129
though maybe there's an agenda so so of

746
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:54,400
course we created indoor agricultural

747
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:55,930
rules around evacuating all of the air

748
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,090
through a carbon filter that need to be

749
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,440
changed on a regular basis and there's

750
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:02,319
there's better ways to do this and

751
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:05,529
obviously I believe that this study I

752
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:07,689
will work with the OCA and we will

753
00:30:05,529 --> 00:30:09,519
attempt to push down this path for

754
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:11,410
something a little more logical and of

755
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:13,450
course try to incentivize those that are

756
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,100
in the right zones and also to I mean

757
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,569
this research is a benefit for industry

758
00:30:15,099 --> 00:30:18,909
too because right now no one's really

759
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:20,980
quantifying the emissions at the moment

760
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:24,100
and carbon filters are not one size fits

761
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:25,450
all if you know these specific molecules

762
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:27,219
that you're trying to capture within

763
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:29,380
that carbon filter you can actually

764
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,210
manipulate the pores within the carbon

765
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,490
filter to be just the right size to

766
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:35,680
capture those specific emissions and so

767
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:37,029
you can be a lot more efficient if you

768
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,920
know exactly what you're trying to

769
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:40,930
control so that's the other piece of

770
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,550
this too is you know by capturing these

771
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,960
VOCs within the carbon you're

772
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:46,029
controlling odor but you're also

773
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,170
controlling the vo C so it's not emitted

774
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:49,359
in the atmosphere and then you're not

775
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:52,390
getting that those ozone impacts as well

776
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:54,490
so this really puts a new lens on on

777
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:57,190
odor mitigation in that it's not just a

778
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:57,849
nuisance there is public health impacts

779
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,769
and

780
00:30:57,849 --> 00:31:02,649
and there's probably gonna be some

781
00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:07,410
regulatory impact on the road based on

782
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:09,759
this so we'll move to fun stuff so

783
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:12,160
here's a project that I hold near and

784
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:14,259
dear to my heart and it was in the news

785
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:17,798
a lot lately so if you guys have heard

786
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:19,450
about it I'm excited so you know I

787
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:21,849
mentioned before that I specialized in

788
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:23,319
in helping both craft brewing and

789
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:26,589
cannabis become more environmentally

790
00:31:23,319 --> 00:31:28,569
friendly in Colorado and I saw this

791
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:31,750
project as an opportunity to bring those

792
00:31:28,569 --> 00:31:33,609
two two industries together in a way

793
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:36,339
that's economically and environmentally

794
00:31:33,609 --> 00:31:39,009
viable and so what's happening here is

795
00:31:36,339 --> 00:31:41,319
the first picture is at a brewery a

796
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:44,589
local brewery in Colorado Denver beer

797
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:46,990
company and those shiny tanks behind us

798
00:31:44,589 --> 00:31:49,359
are the fermentation tanks the last step

799
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:51,909
in the brewing process is where the

800
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:54,819
yeast eat the sugars they produce

801
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:57,640
alcohol and co2 we keep the alcohol in

802
00:31:54,819 --> 00:32:00,548
the beer co2 just gets vented this is a

803
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:03,159
every craft brewery out there co2 is

804
00:32:00,548 --> 00:32:06,779
vented in large large amounts so it's a

805
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:08,530
very it's a big source of co2 now at

806
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:11,019
larger scale breweries like

807
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:12,700
anheuser-busch and Coors they capture

808
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:14,288
the co2 and compress it off the

809
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,880
fermentation and reuse it back in the

810
00:32:14,288 --> 00:32:18,308
brewing process because we carbonate our

811
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,690
beer with co2 we pressurize our lines we

812
00:32:18,308 --> 00:32:21,399
use it as a void space within the

813
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:24,519
fermentation tanks because oxygens bad

814
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:26,380
for beer we use a lot of co2 but all

815
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:28,210
that co2 at craft breweries that's used

816
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,850
within the process is purchased from an

817
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:33,130
outside supplier so they purchase co2

818
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:35,980
and they generate co2 right there's an

819
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:38,130
opportunity here then when you look at

820
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:40,480
the cannabis cultivation side

821
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:43,960
photosynthesis right you - it takes

822
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,000
light and it takes co2 you in that

823
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,909
process the plant is taking in that co2

824
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,038
stripping the carbon using it as energy

825
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:52,900
for plant growth right so it's a carbon

826
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:56,798
sink it takes in this carbon and it

827
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:59,950
breeze out the oxygen so with this

828
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:01,960
project we are capturing co2 off the

829
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:04,090
breweries fermentation tanks then we're

830
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,009
putting it through you know some really

831
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:08,769
great technology that's provided by

832
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:10,450
earthly labs that basically scrubs that

833
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:12,368
co2 and compresses

834
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:17,288
and then we release it within the

835
00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:19,509
cultivation environment so projects

836
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:22,358
gained a lot of press support from the

837
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:23,919
governor it's just been it's been really

838
00:33:22,358 --> 00:33:24,548
great all around to work with these

839
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,278
folks

840
00:33:24,548 --> 00:33:29,528
governor Poulos actually came and toured

841
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:31,989
both the cultivation facility and the

842
00:33:29,528 --> 00:33:34,298
brewery and did a press release on this

843
00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:37,119
because it's a really great illustration

844
00:33:34,298 --> 00:33:40,118
of small businesses coming together to

845
00:33:37,118 --> 00:33:42,128
combat climate change essentially in a

846
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,849
way that's economically feasible for

847
00:33:42,128 --> 00:33:44,980
both of them

848
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:47,288
these projects are both the brewery and

849
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,878
the cultivation have a 22-month ROI

850
00:33:47,288 --> 00:33:51,249
that's less than two years

851
00:33:48,878 --> 00:33:52,959
it saves during the pilot phase when

852
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:54,608
we're only feeding one bedroom in one

853
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,108
flower room at the cultivation it stays

854
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:58,118
a thousand dollars a month right off the

855
00:33:56,108 --> 00:33:59,528
bat once we get it up to scale at the

856
00:33:58,118 --> 00:34:01,238
facility it'll save the cultivation

857
00:33:59,528 --> 00:34:05,169
facility six thousand dollars a month

858
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:06,730
that's huge savings and that's co2 that

859
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:08,318
would just otherwise be vented from the

860
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:12,369
brewery and it becomes a revenue stream

861
00:34:08,318 --> 00:34:17,579
for the brewery yeah right isn't that

862
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:19,750
exciting it can be done Russian River

863
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:21,250
you know there's a lot of different

864
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,648
options for California to take on that

865
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:25,418
model for sure yeah and since we proved

866
00:34:23,648 --> 00:34:27,398
that it's both economically and

867
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:29,259
environmentally feasible there's no

868
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,539
reason that this can't be reject can't

869
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:33,099
be repeated you don't need someone like

870
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:34,838
me and the government pushing and

871
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:37,559
rallying behind this project to get it

872
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:40,000
done you guys can just do it yourselves

873
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:42,940
but it helps to have somebody like me

874
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,309
rallying to be like do this and we hope

875
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:46,898
to see it be a repeatable project and I

876
00:34:45,309 --> 00:34:49,119
think we're running a little short on

877
00:34:46,898 --> 00:34:52,269
time but I wanted to just briefly cover

878
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,429
some regulatory lessons from Colorado

879
00:34:52,269 --> 00:34:55,719
and so we've taken a little bit

880
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:57,039
different approach than some of the

881
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,719
other states when it comes to

882
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,849
environmental efficiencies for the

883
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:03,068
cannabis industry and that we don't

884
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:05,170
mandate them we just open up our

885
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:06,759
regulatory structure to allow them to

886
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:09,909
make those more environmentally-friendly

887
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,069
decisions because if we force them there

888
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:13,389
they may not be economically viable and

889
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,068
so that's that's kind of a different

890
00:35:13,389 --> 00:35:19,000
philosophy that we have in Colorado but

891
00:35:15,068 --> 00:35:22,058
we allow fiber recovery for an exemption

892
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,639
from the 50/50 waste rule if it's going

893
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:25,470
to fiber recovery

894
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:26,998
as I mentioned in the previous session

895
00:35:25,469 --> 00:35:29,639
if you guys were here we allow take back

896
00:35:26,998 --> 00:35:34,259
programs at retail facilities for

897
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:37,528
packaging and vape waste we also allow

898
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:38,940
you waste recyclers to process marijuana

899
00:35:37,528 --> 00:35:41,759
vape cartridges without a special

900
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:44,278
marijuana license because the intent is

901
00:35:41,759 --> 00:35:47,039
recycling and we allow for irrigation of

902
00:35:44,278 --> 00:35:49,469
hemp with reclaimed water that's mostly

903
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:51,239
because hemp has grown outdoors in an

904
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:53,159
indoor environment we don't allow that

905
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:56,130
in marijuana because that reclaimed

906
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:59,278
water could aerosolize bacteria and

907
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:01,140
viruses so can't do it inside and better

908
00:35:59,278 --> 00:36:03,268
access to composting like I mentioned

909
00:36:01,139 --> 00:36:05,098
allowing that the composting truck to

910
00:36:03,268 --> 00:36:06,209
pick up your plant waste put it in the

911
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:09,380
back and that'd be the point of

912
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:12,239
compliance for the 50:50 waste rule

913
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:14,999
Thanks great thank you so much so

914
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:17,789
obviously amazing lessons to be learned

915
00:36:14,998 --> 00:36:20,308
from from Colorado California is a

916
00:36:17,789 --> 00:36:23,759
little slow on the uptake on a lot of

917
00:36:20,309 --> 00:36:25,230
those and you know I think that there's

918
00:36:23,759 --> 00:36:27,298
certainly ways that we can build on the

919
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:29,248
knowledge of other states we'd love to

920
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:33,748
hear from folks if you have any specific

921
00:36:29,248 --> 00:36:35,818
questions are you measuring this is for

922
00:36:33,748 --> 00:36:39,088
Caitlyn are you measuring VOCs at the

923
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:42,088
like at the unit level that grow rooms

924
00:36:39,088 --> 00:36:44,788
or is it estimated based on production

925
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:47,969
and known releases that is a great

926
00:36:44,789 --> 00:36:51,778
question so we actually took samples at

927
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:54,480
the exhaust points to measure what is

928
00:36:51,778 --> 00:36:56,639
the output for ozone but then we also

929
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,739
took samples within the cultivation

930
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:01,679
facility in the bedrooms and the flower

931
00:36:58,739 --> 00:37:04,949
rooms harvesting processing so that we

932
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:07,048
can get unique emission factors that

933
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:09,568
kind of add up to that ratio of exhaust

934
00:37:07,048 --> 00:37:10,768
so that because every facility is going

935
00:37:09,568 --> 00:37:12,420
to be different and we can't just say

936
00:37:10,768 --> 00:37:14,548
the exhaust from one facility is going

937
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:16,650
to be the same as another and so we want

938
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:18,239
to get that relationship established

939
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,579
between activities that are happening

940
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:23,159
within the cultivation facility compared

941
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:26,519
to what's at the exhaust point all of

942
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:29,098
our samples to were taken pre carbon

943
00:37:26,518 --> 00:37:31,798
filtration because again carbon

944
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:34,230
filtration is highly dependent on on the

945
00:37:31,798 --> 00:37:37,050
size of the pores and the filter weather

946
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:38,340
what is your HVAC exchange flow rate

947
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,960
if you have it too high what's the

948
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,030
temperature what's the humidity is so

949
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,699
variable on what is going to be that

950
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:47,100
carbon if filter efficiency so we only

951
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:49,079
did pre carbon filtration basically

952
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:56,549
without any controls what is the

953
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:59,099
contribution to ozone depends on where

954
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:00,750
is its parts per billion in harvesting

955
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:03,059
for sure it's more parts per million

956
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:04,860
when you're in flowered veg I thought

957
00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:08,400
this was gonna be about growing mediums

958
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:09,780
so I do y'all can you all express your

959
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,789
opinions or just thoughts on

960
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:17,750
sustainability issues related to peat

961
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:20,480
moss first coco and where that's going I

962
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:23,460
mean yeah so we all know that

963
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,409
sustainability wise coco is better than

964
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:27,480
peat moss right like that that's kind of

965
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:29,339
been the standard statement for a while

966
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,659
even though we've have some new peat

967
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,460
moss beds coming out of Canada we're

968
00:38:30,659 --> 00:38:36,029
saying no it's actually just as

969
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:38,659
sustainable I think that's a debate that

970
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:41,130
can be had over and over I I think for

971
00:38:38,659 --> 00:38:43,829
mediums and we worked a lot at this at

972
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:45,119
eco before we sold that company and it's

973
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:46,559
something that I definitely look forward

974
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,009
to working with with some of our new

975
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:51,989
companies is the thought process of

976
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:53,610
being able to recycle your soil whether

977
00:38:51,989 --> 00:38:55,739
you're using peat moss whether you're

978
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:57,900
buying and mixing your own whether

979
00:38:55,739 --> 00:38:59,129
you're bringing it in through bags you

980
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,530
know a lot of farms it's really

981
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:04,920
commonplace that you use this soil you

982
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:07,110
put it a lot of times in a in a cloth

983
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,300
bag that are as thrown away at the end

984
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,430
and not cleaned or if it is going into a

985
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:13,260
pot that's being recycled they're still

986
00:39:11,429 --> 00:39:14,940
taking the dirt and they're dumping it

987
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:17,450
they're bringing into landfills or

988
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:20,700
composting it they're 50/50 mixing it

989
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:22,049
but in reality with some soil science

990
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:23,609
and some work if you were on the right

991
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:25,620
property you could you could regenerate

992
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:27,960
that soil and continue to reuse it with

993
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:29,250
a good IPM program and I think that that

994
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,199
is something that we really need to look

995
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,519
at is cultivators in all of our

996
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:35,399
cultivation methodology for

997
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,139
sustainability to say that my cocoa is

998
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,690
more sustainable or less sustainable

999
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:43,980
than my peat moss is a moot point if I'm

1000
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:45,630
recycling whichever one I have yeah and

1001
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,699
I also think to the illicit industry

1002
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,960
plays a really strong role in a lot of

1003
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:50,489
the environmental issues that we're

1004
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,380
seeing in California

1005
00:39:50,489 --> 00:39:55,979
because it is unregulated and we're

1006
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:58,349
seeing massive pesticide use and trash

1007
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,809
and debris and and discard and you know

1008
00:39:58,349 --> 00:40:02,699
that those that soil is often being put

1009
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:05,099
into large contractor bags and being

1010
00:40:02,699 --> 00:40:06,989
brought to the dump and I totally can

1011
00:40:05,099 --> 00:40:11,239
understand the dank dirt confusion on

1012
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:11,239
that I just I just put that together but

1013
00:40:11,269 --> 00:40:15,900
yeah I think that you right the more

1014
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,250
regulated the industry hopefully the

1015
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,690
less environmental issues you're gonna

1016
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:20,550
have but then again when we look at

1017
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:23,639
California we're not able to regulate

1018
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:25,590
any or recycle any packaging yet and we

1019
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:28,589
are going for the most environmentally

1020
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:30,660
unfriendly packaging protocols possible

1021
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:34,440
and part of it is because the industry

1022
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:37,170
is the right on the regulated side is is

1023
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,700
really struggling in California and so a

1024
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:41,130
lot of it is just trying to put out

1025
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:42,269
fires to stay alive with the hopes of

1026
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:44,160
tackling some of these environmental

1027
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:48,179
issues and in the next few years to come

1028
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:50,339
so yes okay I have a question for Gary

1029
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:53,940
so it sounds like you were fairly

1030
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:57,960
successful in accommodating the growers

1031
00:40:53,940 --> 00:41:00,090
in Desert Hot Springs but if let's say

1032
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,220
jesse is correct and maybe they aren't

1033
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:04,079
the most sustainable business model and

1034
00:41:02,219 --> 00:41:06,329
longer term do you have a back-up plan

1035
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,099
because I know working with SMUD they

1036
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:10,079
accommodated all these growers in a very

1037
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:11,730
specific region and upgraded their

1038
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:13,139
distribution facilities and then those

1039
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:15,480
growers have a lot of them already taken

1040
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:18,000
off to go grow in like the Central Coast

1041
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:22,380
so are you planning for that do you have

1042
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,510
any idea yeah we are we are looking at

1043
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:27,800
that I can't tell you exactly what that

1044
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:30,690
plan is cuz I'm not involved with it but

1045
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:33,359
our main concern from from the very

1046
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:40,079
beginning has been stranded assets out

1047
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:42,539
in these remote locations the you know

1048
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,608
we're kind of in a bind because we're

1049
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:49,469
we're obligated to provide power to

1050
00:41:44,608 --> 00:41:51,599
anybody that asks and so we try to do

1051
00:41:49,469 --> 00:41:54,000
that one of the ways that we offset that

1052
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,549
is because it's a high risk industry

1053
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,269
we're allowed to charge them a little

1054
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:02,369
bit of the cost upfront so that they

1055
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:04,170
they have to share in that

1056
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:09,500
but it still leaves us with the

1057
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:12,450
potential of stranded assets the the

1058
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:15,809
desert Hot Springs area Atlanta area

1059
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:17,759
those areas are are pretty well built

1060
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:19,950
out with other industries that can pick

1061
00:42:17,759 --> 00:42:21,389
up that that load so we're not too

1062
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:23,939
worried about it there are other areas

1063
00:42:21,389 --> 00:42:25,858
like California City where there are no

1064
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:30,389
other industries and so that's a concern

1065
00:42:25,858 --> 00:42:34,739
out there to provide we kind of seen a

1066
00:42:30,389 --> 00:42:37,409
rise in non-volatile extraction methods

1067
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:40,199
and production especially among smaller

1068
00:42:37,409 --> 00:42:43,018
to mid-sized producers I wonder if

1069
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:46,230
you've taken a look at that at all to

1070
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:47,939
assess if they're more environmentally

1071
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:50,400
friendly and you know why couldn't they

1072
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:53,579
get be a Green Zone unto themselves and

1073
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,720
get some tax breaks to - you know

1074
00:42:53,579 --> 00:43:00,390
emphasize non-volatile yeah I think

1075
00:42:57,719 --> 00:43:02,038
that's a that's a really great idea and

1076
00:43:00,389 --> 00:43:04,259
you know our regulatory structure is

1077
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:05,609
constantly evolving and you know I would

1078
00:43:04,259 --> 00:43:08,548
like to see more of an incentive

1079
00:43:05,608 --> 00:43:11,489
structure for instance in the in the co2

1080
00:43:08,548 --> 00:43:13,440
project there's actually no tax breaks

1081
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:15,838
involved in that at all and there should

1082
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,480
be we should you know just like we get

1083
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:21,420
tax breaks for solar we should have you

1084
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,818
know carbon capture tax breaks that are

1085
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:26,159
there to incentivize we should have

1086
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:29,730
incentives for these take back programs

1087
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:31,858
that we've now allowed but what's in it

1088
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:33,420
for the dispensary you know we're trying

1089
00:43:31,858 --> 00:43:35,369
to pitch it as you know you'll get

1090
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:37,259
loyalty points for maybe bringing it

1091
00:43:35,369 --> 00:43:40,200
back and good customer retention and you

1092
00:43:37,259 --> 00:43:41,429
know better relationships but honestly I

1093
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:44,368
think there should be some tax breaks

1094
00:43:41,429 --> 00:43:48,298
for that as well and I think that with

1095
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:50,278
cannabis being so new in Colorado kind

1096
00:43:48,298 --> 00:43:52,409
of leading the way we're still kind of

1097
00:43:50,278 --> 00:43:54,088
fumbling around in the dark and trying

1098
00:43:52,409 --> 00:43:56,879
to figure out what are those policies

1099
00:43:54,088 --> 00:43:58,679
and so you know organizations like this

1100
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,740
in Derrick's resource innovation

1101
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:03,659
Institute and and all an NCI a all of

1102
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:05,818
those those bodies out there that are

1103
00:44:03,659 --> 00:44:08,219
built on bringing us together and

1104
00:44:05,818 --> 00:44:09,358
bringing government and cultivators into

1105
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:11,608
the same room to have these

1106
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:14,278
conversations is really really essential

1107
00:44:11,608 --> 00:44:15,568
so that folks like myself can go back to

1108
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:16,289
the government and say hey this is what

1109
00:44:15,568 --> 00:44:18,409
industries

1110
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:21,420
asking for that last slide I landed on

1111
00:44:18,409 --> 00:44:23,460
all of the environmental efficiency

1112
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:25,710
regulations those were all new of a

1113
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:28,110
January 1st this year and that was all

1114
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:30,420
because our regulated cannabis industry

1115
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:32,220
worked with our marijuana Enforcement

1116
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:35,940
Division and made them make those

1117
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:37,379
changes so be a voice that's heard I'd

1118
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:39,599
love to add kind of a side note on that

1119
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:43,710
as well and one of the challenges that

1120
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:46,440
we've had in California is is creating a

1121
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:48,929
sustainable and workable social equity

1122
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,030
program so for lessons to be learned

1123
00:44:48,929 --> 00:44:53,909
from other states I would say don't

1124
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:56,100
follow California's lack of leadership

1125
00:44:53,909 --> 00:44:59,309
on that because we don't have a

1126
00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:01,409
statewide program that can help folks

1127
00:44:59,309 --> 00:45:03,630
enter into the industry there's really

1128
00:45:01,409 --> 00:45:05,399
high barriers there's obviously a it's

1129
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:07,380
hard to access capital there's no

1130
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:09,990
traditional banking system so if you're

1131
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,849
trying to transition you know into a

1132
00:45:09,989 --> 00:45:14,039
legal market and you know you're coming

1133
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:15,869
from a community that's been severely

1134
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:17,969
disadvantaged and targeted by the war on

1135
00:45:15,869 --> 00:45:20,549
drugs it's it's almost insurmountable

1136
00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:23,579
and so we have a patchwork of regulation

1137
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:25,890
on the local level and anything that we

1138
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:27,509
do in terms of trying to lower barriers

1139
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,949
to entry often has to go through the

1140
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:30,800
legislature and if you guys have ever

1141
00:45:28,949 --> 00:45:33,449
dealt with the California Legislature

1142
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,630
its pain in the ass and it takes a

1143
00:45:33,449 --> 00:45:38,669
really long time and so I would say be

1144
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:40,349
very thoughtful about those are things

1145
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:41,849
that states can be very proactive on and

1146
00:45:40,349 --> 00:45:44,190
can learn from the mistakes that we've

1147
00:45:41,849 --> 00:45:47,759
are making and probably will continue to

1148
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:50,360
make in California yeah Colorado does

1149
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,640
not have a social equity program either

1150
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:56,760
and I also want to point out to you from

1151
00:45:53,639 --> 00:46:00,420
an environmental justice standpoint with

1152
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:02,460
the way that we zoned cannabis and we

1153
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,950
forced them all into our industrial

1154
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,599
zoned areas those are also our poorest

1155
00:46:04,949 --> 00:46:08,069
communities those are also our sickest

1156
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:11,610
communities those are also our most

1157
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:13,830
diverse communities you know those are

1158
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:16,470
health equity environmental justice

1159
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:18,599
priority areas in our state and we force

1160
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:21,389
the cannabis industry to operate solely

1161
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:22,920
in those areas and so I think that's

1162
00:46:21,389 --> 00:46:25,579
something interesting to point out when

1163
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:29,180
we're talking about social equity

1164
00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:29,179
question in the back yeah

1165
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:36,289
hey there um I wanted to say the brewery

1166
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:38,750
co2 to cannabis projects just about the

1167
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:41,659
coolest thing I've ever heard of so so

1168
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:44,119
two questions on that one is is there is

1169
00:46:41,659 --> 00:46:45,679
there any report or data or something

1170
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:48,109
publicly available those of us who are

1171
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:51,889
interested in it can learn more from and

1172
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:55,099
then the second is is there an estimate

1173
00:46:51,889 --> 00:46:57,519
of what percentage of the co2 that's

1174
00:46:55,099 --> 00:47:00,170
absorbed by the photosynthetic process

1175
00:46:57,519 --> 00:47:05,630
ends up being re-released via being lit

1176
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:07,369
on fire yes so we are definitely in the

1177
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:11,800
data collection phase of this project

1178
00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:15,650
right now we are one month in to capture

1179
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:18,380
mr. jared Polis was so excited about our

1180
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:20,780
project our Colorado Governor that we

1181
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:22,640
did a press release after only capturing

1182
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:25,940
and successfully doing the project for

1183
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:28,369
one week and we have a three month pilot

1184
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:32,300
timeframe where we are collecting data

1185
00:47:28,369 --> 00:47:35,449
points to beer quality on plant quality

1186
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:37,400
on logistics of the capture on the

1187
00:47:35,449 --> 00:47:39,679
carbon footprint of the trucks going

1188
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,480
back and forth compared to you know

1189
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:43,549
vehicle miles traveled from a

1190
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,530
traditional distribution system of

1191
00:47:43,550 --> 00:47:47,090
having a bunch of co2 loaded on a truck

1192
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,880
it's usually truck from much farther

1193
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:51,800
away because it comes from a power plant

1194
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,480
it's a byproduct of combustion so that's

1195
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,700
an environmentally friendly practice in

1196
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,500
itself to capture that co2 off of off of

1197
00:47:55,699 --> 00:47:59,480
the power plants but then we truck at a

1198
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,730
very long way to get it to both the

1199
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,230
cultivation and the brewery and so we

1200
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:04,940
want to look at that and then to get at

1201
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:07,639
your question of you know what is the

1202
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:09,740
co2 sequestration rate of marijuana in

1203
00:48:07,639 --> 00:48:12,319
an indoor grow environment that's

1204
00:48:09,739 --> 00:48:14,989
something that I would love to study and

1205
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:17,059
I want to study but I cannot get the

1206
00:48:14,989 --> 00:48:20,299
funding to study it because the ultimate

1207
00:48:17,059 --> 00:48:22,279
pathway for cannabis is combustion and

1208
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:24,110
so that's something to be aware of at

1209
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,760
least from you know Public Health and

1210
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:28,190
Environment is you know if we're looking

1211
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,470
at life cycle analysis knowing the co2

1212
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:32,300
sequestration rate of the plants is kind

1213
00:48:30,469 --> 00:48:34,759
of a moot point if the ultimate pathway

1214
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:37,460
is combustion and so when we look at the

1215
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:39,890
via you know the environmental benefit

1216
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:41,300
of this project we're mostly focusing on

1217
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:44,509
the vehicle miles traveled

1218
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:46,400
reducing that that burden there we know

1219
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,900
that there is some environmental benefit

1220
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,639
of taking you know what would be just

1221
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,349
vented from the brewery and feeding it

1222
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:54,079
to the plants because it doesn't all end

1223
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:55,579
up in combustion but you know it could

1224
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,130
ultimately end up in the landfill as

1225
00:48:55,579 --> 00:49:00,829
well and or you know when we compost

1226
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:04,070
plants I want everyone to be aware of

1227
00:49:00,829 --> 00:49:07,519
yes composting is one step above

1228
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:09,559
landfill but when plants biologically

1229
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:12,949
break down they release methane and co2

1230
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:14,929
and we should be aware of that those can

1231
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:16,639
be used as commodities if we change the

1232
00:49:14,929 --> 00:49:18,739
way we manage our waste stream if we

1233
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:20,539
didn't have this 50/50 waste rule we

1234
00:49:18,739 --> 00:49:22,759
could have on-site anaerobic digestion

1235
00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:24,820
of cannabis plant material where we are

1236
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,960
doing this and basically a black box

1237
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,370
breaking down that plant material then

1238
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,800
we can capture the methane as a

1239
00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:33,920
commodity we methane is natural gas we

1240
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,600
burn it and also co2 I mean that's a

1241
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,820
commodity as well that we use within our

1242
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:40,130
grow rooms and our extraction processes

1243
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:41,990
so that's another opportunity there with

1244
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:43,579
the plant waste I think I got a little

1245
00:49:41,989 --> 00:49:47,869
off track on your questions but I hope I

1246
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:49,789
answer them thanks this questions for

1247
00:49:47,869 --> 00:49:52,940
Kaitlyn as well so the with the brewery

1248
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:53,900
to cannabis project I was curious you'd

1249
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:56,869
mentioned that some of the larger

1250
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:58,670
breweries capture on-site and reuse and

1251
00:49:56,869 --> 00:50:00,650
I was curious it was there a particular

1252
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:02,869
driver for these smaller breweries to

1253
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:06,369
capture and then sell off-site rather

1254
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:08,409
than to reuse on-site yes so Bree

1255
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:11,269
depending on the size of the brewery

1256
00:50:08,409 --> 00:50:13,960
they are gonna generate way more co2

1257
00:50:11,269 --> 00:50:16,940
than what they need in their process and

1258
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:19,190
actually when I ran into earthly labs at

1259
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:21,260
the the Colorado craft brewers

1260
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:23,630
conference and they showed me their

1261
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:25,940
technology in their plan to implement it

1262
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:28,820
their plan was to just implement this

1263
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:31,190
technology at breweries to only capture

1264
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:33,050
maybe 15 to 20 percent of their co2

1265
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:34,970
emissions because that's all they need

1266
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:36,830
as input to the rest of their process

1267
00:50:34,969 --> 00:50:39,079
and then they just vent the rest because

1268
00:50:36,829 --> 00:50:41,719
it there's no economic driver there and

1269
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:44,360
when I saw that I jaw hit the floor I

1270
00:50:41,719 --> 00:50:46,189
was like from an environmental sample as

1271
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,289
much as you can from an economic

1272
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:51,440
standpoint capture as much as you can

1273
00:50:48,289 --> 00:50:53,150
and sell it and so this is really the

1274
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,409
first time that that's been that this

1275
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,880
has been done but I'm

1276
00:50:54,409 --> 00:50:57,618
you know I'm really excited about this

1277
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:00,200
project because I think it's such an

1278
00:50:57,619 --> 00:51:03,349
inspiration point just start looking at

1279
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:05,858
waste as a commodity to start looking at

1280
00:51:03,349 --> 00:51:08,990
partnering with different industries to

1281
00:51:05,858 --> 00:51:11,719
create independent localized economies

1282
00:51:08,989 --> 00:51:15,229
among small businesses you know we just

1283
00:51:11,719 --> 00:51:17,169
cut out a large co2 company by doing

1284
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:19,730
this that wasn't very happy about it but

1285
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:22,970
you know it's new ways of thinking and I

1286
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:24,949
think that one thing that I always like

1287
00:51:22,969 --> 00:51:27,019
to drive home to people is this is true

1288
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:28,429
today and every day moving forward we

1289
00:51:27,019 --> 00:51:30,139
have the most amount of people on this

1290
00:51:28,429 --> 00:51:31,818
planet and the least amount of resources

1291
00:51:30,139 --> 00:51:36,108
we've ever had we've got to change the

1292
00:51:31,818 --> 00:51:37,759
way we do things great well I want to

1293
00:51:36,108 --> 00:51:39,980
thank the experts on this panel for all

1294
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,900
of your wisdom thank you so much for for

1295
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:44,110
sharing it with everyone today and we

1296
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,090
hope you all enjoyed it thank you

1297
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:46,599
