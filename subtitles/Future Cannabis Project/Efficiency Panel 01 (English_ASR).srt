1
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:21,439
so welcome to the heart of cannabis 2019

2
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:23,809
hopefully the first of many this is the

3
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,439
efficiency panel and we have a awesome

4
00:00:23,809 --> 00:00:29,689
group up here from all walks of life in

5
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,399
the cannabis realm to my left we have

6
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:36,789
drupal bonnie he's a commercial grower

7
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:39,079
consultant all-around amazing helper guy

8
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:41,838
I'll let him speak a little bit more on

9
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,728
what he does and second uh to my left

10
00:00:41,838 --> 00:00:47,268
dr. Nadia Saba

11
00:00:43,728 --> 00:00:49,070
she's with dr. greenhouse if you want to

12
00:00:47,268 --> 00:00:51,460
talk greenhouses this is the person to

13
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:54,768
talk to so you don't setup for failure

14
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:57,228
to her left is Anya Gordon she's from

15
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:58,640
Gro tech Builders they're the ones to

16
00:00:57,228 --> 00:01:00,649
talk to when you're just thinking about

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,058
what you're gonna do so she's the one

18
00:01:00,649 --> 00:01:05,000
that's going to help you not fail in the

19
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:05,719
process so I will give it up to them and

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
they can give a little bit more

21
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:10,000
introduction on themselves

22
00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:23,228
you guys can hear me all right hey good

23
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:26,609
afternoon everyone my name is Giovanni

24
00:01:23,228 --> 00:01:29,379
thanks for the intro I'm the founder and

25
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:32,049
CEO presently a commercial cultivator

26
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:33,879
Inc it's pretty special for me to sit

27
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:36,189
here honestly on stage as I used to live

28
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:37,839
up here on the ridge you guys can't hear

29
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:43,419
me at all is that better

30
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,439
alright anyways you know I as I was

31
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,640
saying I used to live up here on the

32
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:47,859
ridge so it's pretty special for me to

33
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,539
sit up here on stage and talk to you

34
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:51,609
guys sort of you know my background is

35
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:54,849
in cultivation and before that in

36
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:56,739
geology and environmental science and so

37
00:01:54,849 --> 00:02:00,159
you know from the from the background of

38
00:01:56,739 --> 00:02:02,318
a cultivator the cost of production

39
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,549
became pretty important and you know

40
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,618
going forward as the industry has

41
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:07,810
evolved you know cost of production is

42
00:02:05,618 --> 00:02:10,799
now much broader and much more involved

43
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:13,420
than you know maybe in in the old model

44
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:15,430
so where the company really started as

45
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:19,018
both nutrient supply chains or a

46
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:21,430
solution to that growth store model

47
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:24,909
we've sort of progressed into offering

48
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:27,040
efficiency services and consulting and

49
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:29,650
project management and owner for owners

50
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:31,870
rep stuff for new builds and I guess

51
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:38,290
that's my interest so I'll pass the mic

52
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:40,120
down can you guys hear me alright so I

53
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:46,209
am Nadia Saba I'm the president and

54
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:48,789
owner of dr. greenhouse we are an

55
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:52,000
agricultural and mechanical engineering

56
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:55,090
firm so we design environmental control

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,719
and HVAC systems for greenhouses and

58
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,530
indoor farms my PhD is in agricultural

59
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:01,659
engineering

60
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:05,549
I studied evaporative cooling

61
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:08,799
ventilation water use efficiency for

62
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:12,340
commercial tomato production houses for

63
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:13,989
my PhD and after that I went on and to

64
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,579
learn how to be a mechanical engineer so

65
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:17,139
then I design HVAC systems for

66
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:19,719
commercial high-rise residential

67
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:23,200
buildings and the such in about

68
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:25,469
two-and-a-half years ago I was able to

69
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,849
bring my two passions together

70
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:30,189
agriculture and mechanical engineering

71
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:30,750
to form dr. greenhouse so we've been in

72
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:33,960
business for about

73
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:37,139
two and a half years and we help growers

74
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,550
all over the country and and in a few

75
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:41,429
different countries

76
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:43,500
we've just finished store just started

77
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,140
our 60th project in the last two and a

78
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,949
half years and a lot more growers are

79
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:52,579
looking into greenhouses as a

80
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:56,219
cost-effective and efficient way of

81
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:59,460
cultivating their cannabis crop and so

82
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:03,900
we do a lot of studies energy modeling

83
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:06,330
studies looking at the benefits of using

84
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,730
shade systems of using different types

85
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,709
of covering systems looking how it

86
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:13,079
interplays with the crop that you're

87
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,060
growing the lighting system the

88
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,129
irrigation system and so we're really

89
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,930
trying to help growers learn how to

90
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:21,298
maybe come out of their indoor facility

91
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,850
and go into a greenhouse and what works

92
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:25,529
there or people who are coming from say

93
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,050
tomatoes and cucumbers trying to grow

94
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:35,189
cannabis then in a greenhouse and what

95
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:37,860
the nuances are there so not really a

96
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:40,709
microphone person but uh my name is anya

97
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,710
gordon i am the co-owner of gro tech

98
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:47,129
builders and we are exactly what we

99
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:48,810
sound like we are builders primarily

100
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:51,300
actually what we spend most of our time

101
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,129
doing now is project development so

102
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,860
early-stage project development working

103
00:04:53,129 --> 00:05:03,329
with various municipalities utilities

104
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:05,669
and city county state code and processes

105
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:07,800
to navigate a project from start to

106
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:10,609
finish and make sure that all the t's

107
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,110
get crossed and the I's get dotted and

108
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,180
working on the planning stages from the

109
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,979
very beginning to make sure that the

110
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:23,340
process can be as efficient and

111
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:25,019
functional as possible yep yep it's all

112
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:28,649
too often when the eyes get crossed and

113
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:30,060
the t's get dotted these days so

114
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:31,859
essentially this panel is pretty much

115
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,319
what you need to get going with an

116
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:37,530
efficient project and something that's

117
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:40,019
going to actually succeed and be a long

118
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:41,819
term solution so one thing that we've

119
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:43,709
been talking about is the knowledge that

120
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:46,949
we've had within the cannabis community

121
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:48,419
where that's come from an agriculture in

122
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:51,269
another crop science has had the ability

123
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,890
to to you know look within itself look

124
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:55,709
within studies from university to find

125
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:58,110
out what their crops are doing how to

126
00:05:55,709 --> 00:06:00,479
cultivate the crops what proper nutrient

127
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,040
ratios what environment they like and

128
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,500
really dive into the breeding to

129
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,270
specifically cultivate and breed crops

130
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,459
for certain purposes and now we're

131
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:09,959
finally getting to the point we're

132
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:11,939
actually starting to understand what's

133
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:14,430
going on with this specific plant which

134
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:16,019
is really cool and all the breeding that

135
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,550
we've been doing over the years and all

136
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:19,829
the cultivation without really

137
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,939
understanding why and how we're actually

138
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:22,709
able to bring that out into the

139
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:27,240
forefront and one of my really favorite

140
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:30,120
areas is data collection I'm a data geek

141
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,889
I really love information on every

142
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,720
single aspect of cultivation whether

143
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:35,579
it's something to do with the substrate

144
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,100
the biology the environment or the

145
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:40,349
genetic itself I'm a plant nerd I'm a

146
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,400
data geek so data collection is a big

147
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,930
one for me

148
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,699
and we're starting to see that a lot

149
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,240
more and more with a lot more automated

150
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:49,469
systems a lot more sensing equipment so

151
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,590
let's kind of talk about data collection

152
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,940
what kind of points of data are

153
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:56,639
extremely important for a cultivator to

154
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:58,050
not only start out understanding but to

155
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,610
develop throughout their process to help

156
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:04,530
them succeed we can just kind of go all

157
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,810
right well I mean I think you know

158
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:09,389
there's obviously a few facets in the

159
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,970
current commercial cannabis paradigm in

160
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:14,339
terms of you know the various data sets

161
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:17,550
that we might be looking at you know on

162
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:18,959
the cultivation side solely I would say

163
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,500
you know obviously you know you

164
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:24,209
mentioned quite a few of them I think

165
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,790
really what I'd like to point out in a

166
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:28,349
certain way is you know if you're doing

167
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,730
experiments right if you're in a

168
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,430
greenhouse environment if you're in an

169
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,830
indoor environment how rep you know what

170
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,740
is the replicability of that experiment

171
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:40,729
you know and as you're going forward and

172
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,019
sort of perhaps on the fly even you know

173
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:45,480
encountering new dynamics where you say

174
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:47,490
oh man I need to monitor you know that

175
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,470
particular aspect that perhaps I wasn't

176
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:52,560
keying in on in a different environment

177
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:55,310
because the dynamic is somewhat distinct

178
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,528
you know so on the cultivation side

179
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:02,668
it really depends on the model you know

180
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:04,829
and for me that a big piece of it is if

181
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:06,389
you're not collecting data even if you

182
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:08,329
don't know where you're going you know

183
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:11,610
and trying to get as much as you can

184
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:13,680
it's tough to hone in on that model you

185
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:17,639
know when you're ready to otherwise

186
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,999
you're sort of flying by night and so

187
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,560
data is is a big piece of what we do and

188
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:26,159
a lot of what we're missing

189
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,899
in this industry as Casey mentioned you

190
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:29,449
know with other horticultural crops

191
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:31,168
there's a lot of university research

192
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:34,379
historical research that's been done

193
00:08:31,168 --> 00:08:37,198
over 50 years or more depending on what

194
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:39,360
you're growing that we have been able to

195
00:08:37,198 --> 00:08:42,149
develop growth models on production

196
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,339
models on understand how much light the

197
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:46,559
crop needs what the nutrient mixes

198
00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,839
should be to get the best qualities and

199
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,479
the best highest yields but with

200
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,709
cannabis you know we don't have that

201
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,209
same level of data right now

202
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:55,500
universities aren't doing that research

203
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,969
because they feel like their hands are

204
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,850
tied behind their back because it's not

205
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:02,250
federally legal and so we rely on you

206
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:05,699
growers to help us fill in those gaps

207
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:07,828
but you guys also come from a history of

208
00:09:05,698 --> 00:09:10,349
not wanting to keep records for good

209
00:09:07,828 --> 00:09:12,929
reason right and so a lot of it has been

210
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,449
anecdotal which has been a great place

211
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:17,309
to start but now we really need to rely

212
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:19,620
on you to collect that data what you

213
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:21,689
know if you're in a greenhouse having a

214
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,850
weather station and knowing the dynamics

215
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,250
of temperature and humidity and rain and

216
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:29,339
wind and how that might affect then

217
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,649
should you open up event to naturally

218
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:33,870
ventilate do you shut it down to use

219
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:36,778
fans and maybe an evaporative cooling

220
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,899
system can you use shade well if you

221
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:42,448
shade will it reduce the yield of your

222
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:44,250
crop or if you're not pumping the

223
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:46,528
greenhouse with carbon dioxide anyway

224
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:49,379
maybe you can shade and you know or

225
00:09:46,528 --> 00:09:50,759
maybe you don't shade because or maybe

226
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:52,828
you do shade because you're not gonna

227
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:54,929
get the full benefit of all that

228
00:09:52,828 --> 00:09:57,689
sunlight if you're not also pumping the

229
00:09:54,929 --> 00:10:01,289
greenhouse with co2 but we don't have

230
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:03,510
that data we don't know how much light

231
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:05,759
these plants need we know they need a

232
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:08,950
lot of plant a lot of light but where's

233
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:11,500
the threshold we know they they

234
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:14,470
use a lot of co2 but where's the

235
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:16,330
threshold both high and low and really

236
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,810
we need to tie it to production data

237
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:22,030
into quality data right and and we

238
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:24,129
really need that information from all of

239
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:26,709
you rather than it being anecdotal is if

240
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:29,889
we have some record-keeping if we can

241
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:33,009
even standardize what variables what

242
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:34,870
parameters were monitoring and then what

243
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:37,419
the outcomes are so that we can make

244
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:39,429
direct connections rather than oh this

245
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:42,009
will happen to be a sunny dry year and I

246
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:43,659
got a really good crop so I'm gonna hope

247
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:46,269
for another sunny dry year next year

248
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:47,919
when actually it had to do with I don't

249
00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:51,549
know the strain you were growing that

250
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:54,069
year right so data is key to the success

251
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:58,569
and moving forward in this industry and

252
00:10:54,070 --> 00:11:01,510
being as efficient as possible I'm

253
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:03,850
actually also gonna I mean maybe talk

254
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:07,029
even from a server 10,000 foot level

255
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,830
about data because in Casey you know

256
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:12,909
this because I've spoken with you at a

257
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:15,700
number of events that for me then from

258
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:17,259
our lens as a as a builder and as

259
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:21,790
somebody who helps to develop these

260
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:25,389
projects data is the key it's the

261
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:27,909
primary component that ultimately drives

262
00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:29,500
the industry towards success or failure

263
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:31,779
it's the threshold of what are the

264
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:34,990
minimum baseline requirements that I

265
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:37,149
need to meet in order to be up and

266
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:40,029
running in a functional way that in the

267
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:43,240
long run sets me up to actually be able

268
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:45,639
to produce my product efficiently both

269
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,350
from an energy standpoint from an

270
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:51,250
environmental standpoint and from an

271
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:54,490
economic standpoint so a lot of what I

272
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,860
find happening now is there's this rush

273
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,659
to entry rush to entry rush to entry and

274
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,159
then it's kind of you're in a chicken

275
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:02,740
and an egg situation a little bit right

276
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,179
we don't have the data because of where

277
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,029
the industry has come from and because

278
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:09,459
of sort of all of the various reasons

279
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:11,350
that there was never a reason to collect

280
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:15,250
the data and there were never any

281
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:18,190
supporting entities doing that well the

282
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:21,789
ultimate cause of that is that we don't

283
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:22,720
really know how much is reasonable for

284
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:25,059
it to cost

285
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,370
to build a facility and we don't really

286
00:12:25,059 --> 00:12:29,289
know how long it's going to take for

287
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:32,139
that to pay back dividends in the long

288
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:35,049
run and we don't really know whether or

289
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:37,480
not we can maintain an economically

290
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:41,289
successful production cycle without

291
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:44,379
those data points because not only can

292
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:46,750
we not sort of compare with ourselves

293
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:48,129
from year to year but we can't compare

294
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:52,110
with anybody else

295
00:12:48,129 --> 00:12:55,240
which ultimately means there's no

296
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:59,350
successful healthy equitable competition

297
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,600
so from a 10,000 square foot view it's

298
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,240
not even just the purpose of being able

299
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,610
to cultivate effectively it's being able

300
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,889
to operate as a business and as an

301
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:14,019
industry effectively over the long term

302
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:16,090
just to Anya's point to the first

303
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:18,610
candidates project endure a project that

304
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:22,000
I worked on about four four or five

305
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,649
years ago we told the grower look there

306
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,929
here's these two or three different you

307
00:13:23,649 --> 00:13:28,059
know HVAC system options you could use

308
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:31,209
this one's really efficient and it has

309
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:34,509
an 18-month return or an 18-month

310
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:36,160
payback like it from coming from

311
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:38,529
commercial buildings anything that's

312
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:42,219
less than a 10-year payback is a score

313
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:44,259
right and and the grower literally said

314
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,090
unless it has a six-month payback I

315
00:13:44,259 --> 00:13:48,429
don't want to hear about it and that's

316
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:51,040
because you know the risks were real of

317
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:52,659
being shut down now you know fast

318
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,639
forward four or five years later now

319
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:57,699
efficiency is starting to become part of

320
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,529
this conversation and so you know it's

321
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:01,390
just we have to get over that artifact

322
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:03,879
of where the industry has come from and

323
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:06,819
where it is now and where it can go and

324
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:09,970
we can be a real leader in agriculture

325
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:12,330
itself to be very efficient we have that

326
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:12,330
opportunity

327
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,000
you
