[Music]

2
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:16,910
all the aspects of cannabis cultures so

3
00:00:15,388 --> 00:00:20,070
first of all we're gonna start off with

4
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,660
Dale Shaffer I'll introduce him I've had

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,609
the honor of representing him very

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:29,250
briefly and he has been a martyr of the

7
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:32,520
war on cannabis in the sense that he did

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:36,480
time in federal prison for standing up

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,210
for his beliefs about the righteousness

10
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:41,909
of cannabis and refusing to plead guilty

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,128
to something that should not be a crime

12
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:47,069
so can you give us a little bit of

13
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:48,449
background on how you know what inspired

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,659
you to become a lawyer we're gonna start

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:55,500
like way back I wanted to be a physician

16
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:56,819
okay okay so I was on the track to be a

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,789
medical doctor I went in the military

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,859
learned medicine was on my way there and

19
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,228
my friend said you don't be a doctor

20
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,990
it's gonna get crazy and so I taught

21
00:01:04,228 --> 00:01:08,400
high school did antique furniture and a

22
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:11,789
friend of mine went to law school I went

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,380
oh there's an idea and when I started it

24
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,630
I was still in the practice so I went

25
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:17,399
right from law school into medical

26
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:19,438
malpractice work because I was working

27
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,990
in medicine and I talked the language

28
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:25,798
and I had patients every day that moved

29
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:28,828
me into the law and as you know Molly my

30
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,799
ex-wife is a medical doctor yeah and she

31
00:01:28,828 --> 00:01:33,719
got breast cancer and we both smoked pot

32
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,618
it wasn't like a big secret knurl family

33
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,840
knew all about it

34
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:39,090
but now it was serious and I want we

35
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,770
just passed a law so I wanted to do this

36
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,840
the right way and the cops showed up and

37
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:44,489
into who we were and they asked her to

38
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,469
do recommendations so they knew the

39
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:47,759
right people were and we started doing

40
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:50,039
that everything's cool until you give it

41
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,868
to the wrong person and she told my met

42
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,659
a cop you're not a doctor gotta go to

43
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:56,670
die and then that brings us into the

44
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,030
light of Barry McCafferty and the

45
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,010
Clinton administration and then

46
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,829
time let's rewind back in time a little

47
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:08,909
bit to your first experience with

48
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:12,659
cannabis you know yeah I was in high

49
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:14,280
school it was junior year and a buddy of

50
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:19,650
mine had to be something he said this is

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:21,680
Acapulco gold well cool and from there

52
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,670
it was all history because I went oh

53
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,500
it's like those guys that are

54
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:29,639
colour-blind put the glasses on you go

55
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,500
is this what it really looks like and

56
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,119
where did you go to high school I went

57
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,759
to high school in just north of

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,739
Sacramento if you know who Rush Limbaugh

59
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:39,509
is he used to make fun of our hometown

60
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:41,159
real Linda it was started right there

61
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:44,579
it's like all the trailer-trash out

62
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:49,769
there yeah why okay yeah that's where I

63
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:53,420
grew up you know did you use where you

64
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:56,789
have frequent cannabis user daily daily

65
00:02:53,419 --> 00:03:00,359
from then on even in the military we

66
00:02:56,789 --> 00:03:02,549
figured it out how you managed to use

67
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,350
cannabis in the military well the MPs

68
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:07,140
and the guys that did the drug test were

69
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:08,879
partying buddies of mine so when you had

70
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:11,279
a drug test he wrote the number of the

71
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,019
bottle on the palm of your hand and you

72
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,390
showed it to your buddy and it was a

73
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:18,599
negative test and when they were

74
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:21,569
checking the gates the MPS ago six is

75
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,090
hot so we went to five or whatever that

76
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:25,560
we just we we party with the guys who

77
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:27,719
would do this stuff to get you in

78
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,340
trouble so you didn't get in trouble so

79
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,819
you had the hustle was we figured it out

80
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,530
yeah

81
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:35,449
you're like hacking the system basically

82
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:38,069
I I first got to know you through Tony

83
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:38,548
boney theorem Tony Serra he tried my

84
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:40,949
case

85
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:43,469
yeah and he's everybody's rock star we

86
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:46,608
love the guy and I got to meet you there

87
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:49,799
what was it that brought you to Tony

88
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:52,680
it was cannabis actually like Tony Serra

89
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,659
was speaking at Stanford Law School and

90
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,239
most of the speakers at Stanford Law

91
00:03:54,659 --> 00:04:00,719
School were super boring like Antonin

92
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,730
Scalia or some corporate lawyer he made

93
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,889
a lot of money for corporations and to

94
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:07,259
me that was not interesting but when

95
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:09,719
Tony Sarah came he was the most animated

96
00:04:07,259 --> 00:04:12,419
and the most alive of all the speakers

97
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:15,300
who had ever gone to Stanford Law School

98
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,000
and watching that made me think like and

99
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:20,189
I was pretty young I was like I think

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,038
twenty-one years old and you know in law

101
00:04:20,189 --> 00:04:25,620
school as a first year student I didn't

102
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:27,300
have like the wealth to like take a leap

103
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,490
year or whatever they call it like the

104
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,689
year to go to Europe I didn't I couldn't

105
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,360
afford it had to go straight from

106
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:36,538
college straight to law school and so I

107
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,490
was kind of burned out but locally I had

108
00:04:36,538 --> 00:04:41,250
discovered cannabis while I was in

109
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,810
undergrad and so when I was in law

110
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,418
school I didn't have a connection and

111
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,829
this guy Tony Serra shows up and he has

112
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,959
long hair and he's talking about

113
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:52,560
cannabis and so I figured he had a

114
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:54,569
connection and so after his speech all

115
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,728
the law students were asking him like

116
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:58,829
hey mr. Serra can we apply to work with

117
00:04:56,728 --> 00:05:01,288
you over the summer and Tony psyche and

118
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:03,029
yeah I don't really do it that way you

119
00:05:01,288 --> 00:05:06,300
know you got to come to my office and

120
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:09,449
then we asked him a question do you ever

121
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,340
get high after 7 p.m. and he said what

122
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:13,649
time is it oh it's 7:30

123
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:15,119
all right he's like this this is over we

124
00:05:13,649 --> 00:05:18,179
gotta go get high so we went to a law

125
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,209
school dorm and this was after the for

126
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:23,519
the Supreme Court justice who was denied

127
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:27,089
his Supreme Court seat and rightfully so

128
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,949
cannabis the Saturday night massacre and

129
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:31,619
all that good stuff yeah yeah and so

130
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:33,930
nobody wanted to go with Tony Serra to

131
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,538
get high except like a few you know kind

132
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:39,120
of counterculture rebels from the law

133
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:41,310
school and so we went to the law school

134
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,680
dorm we got super high with Tony Serra

135
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,389
and then to me that was like pretty

136
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,250
entertaining like you know like I

137
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:51,658
decided that my clients would be human

138
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:54,240
beings not corporations and so I got a

139
00:05:51,658 --> 00:05:57,418
job with a federal public defender then

140
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,728
I got a job with a civil rights law firm

141
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:02,339
and then when I graduated law school I

142
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:05,879
didn't have a job and Tony Serra was

143
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:08,218
doing the bare Lincoln case for free pro

144
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,348
bono and so I knew Tony Sara he's my

145
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:13,139
friend and he's like come on you know

146
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:15,418
come work on this case you know we got a

147
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:17,519
house we can put you up come work on the

148
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:19,419
case and so back then I you know I've

149
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,639
supported myself by selling cannabis

150
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,540
so I would saw cannabis on the weekend

151
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,310
all right

152
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,680
I would sell cannabis on the weekends

153
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,870
and you know I had to arrange all my

154
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,610
deals to during on the weekends and then

155
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:33,160
during the deal during the week we'd go

156
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,410
up to Mendocino County to Redwood Valley

157
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,960
is where we live and then we would go to

158
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:40,330
court in Ukiah every morning so we wake

159
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:42,579
up at 5:00 a.m. be at the courthouse by

160
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:45,250
like 8:00 a.m. you know court would

161
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:48,459
start around 8:15 and it was three

162
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:50,769
months of like super exciting experience

163
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:52,870
and after Tony got Bear Lincoln

164
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:54,939
acquitted and I was kind of working on

165
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,649
the case like doing a lot of juror

166
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:58,480
investigation but I was working more on

167
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:00,819
like the gag order they put a gag order

168
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,530
on Tony and I'm Bear Lincoln and so he

169
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:06,250
took the gag order all the way up to the

170
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:08,619
Cal Supreme Court and you know it was

171
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,680
awesome like we would have like Native

172
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,449
American supporters would fish salmon

173
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,759
and they would like cook it for us like

174
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:18,159
every evening so we'd be eating well

175
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,870
we'd be like defending Bear Lincoln all

176
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,240
day and then at night like people would

177
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:25,240
feed us like fresh salmon that had been

178
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,930
caught the week before and you know I

179
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,389
think like the local winery free wines

180
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:33,100
would like give us a hook-up on you know

181
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:36,490
cheap wine and so like it was like a

182
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,890
very nice convivial Envivio attitude

183
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:40,420
working on the defense team you know

184
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:42,579
trying to save somebody's life and we

185
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:47,230
were successful and so after that I was

186
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:49,359
hooked on trial law and working you know

187
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:52,650
like righteous cases like with Tony and

188
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,870
I did that for 12 years at pier 5

189
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:58,120
eventually moved my practice to a Sonoma

190
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:01,300
County I just got sick of driving from

191
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,009
like living in Berkeley driving to 506

192
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,199
Broadway which is Broadway in Kearny

193
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:07,629
right in the middle of North Beach you

194
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,519
know and then going to port every day

195
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:12,930
and so most of my cases were in

196
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:15,189
Mendocino and so I just moved closer to

197
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,449
Mendocino County but I don't want to

198
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:18,519
live in the county where I was defending

199
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:20,439
all the cases so I moved to Sonoma

200
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:22,509
County where there was very few cases

201
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:24,579
there's a ton of cases in Mendocino that

202
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:27,399
I was defending and then there's a

203
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:29,469
to Mendocino County like two years after

204
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:33,668
I moved there and so then I had a ton of

205
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:35,469
cases in Sonoma County and then that

206
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:39,338
pretty much continued until prop

207
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:41,620
64 successfully passed and then a lot of

208
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:44,229
the cases just went away becoming like

209
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:47,589
misdemeanors or infractions or getting

210
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:49,360
outright dismissed but you know the way

211
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:51,700
up meeting Tony Tony has been really

212
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,120
instrumental in my life like he's you

213
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:58,300
know what I know for me the pivot from

214
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,179
being an insurance defense lawyer to

215
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:04,299
setting up these businesses was it was a

216
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:06,250
difficult dive and you came from the

217
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:07,599
criminal side coming back on the same

218
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,549
thing I know I didn't pay enough

219
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,889
attention in law school to corporate and

220
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:13,958
business law and contracts done it all

221
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:16,179
but I didn't really want to do it right

222
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:18,879
and all of a sudden now you have to how

223
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:21,399
was how was that for you coming from the

224
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,708
courtroom to building businesses and

225
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,629
anticipating problems well it was it was

226
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:29,559
not something I've been trained and

227
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:31,720
luckily like in October or this year the

228
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:35,559
continuing education of the bar set up a

229
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,480
program called the basics of / business

230
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,828
law and so I went there and I saw Paul

231
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,629
Gallegos there and he was doing the same

232
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:42,639
thing I was like brushing up on the

233
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:44,679
basics and so they basically taught us

234
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,259
all about like contract law real estate

235
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:49,659
leases you know licensing agreements

236
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:51,370
like everything which I found really

237
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:53,588
helpful it kind of like rounded me out

238
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:55,539
and I was thankful that such a resource

239
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:59,100
was available at the right time in my

240
00:09:55,539 --> 00:10:02,980
career then I could avail myself of it

241
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:05,680
but definitely like it's been a vertical

242
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,920
learning curve since I graduated law

243
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,989
school I feel fortunate that I've been

244
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:12,819
able to utilize like maybe a little bit

245
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,980
more than 10% of my brain just like

246
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,540
there's so much to learn that you're

247
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,240
always like having to learn in the

248
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:20,948
cannabis law world for a while I was

249
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,720
kind of like resting in my laurels like

250
00:10:20,948 --> 00:10:25,088
right before prop 64 I've been doing

251
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,459
cannabis defense for so long and I was

252
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:29,470
so good at it that it's almost like oh

253
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:32,449
yeah I've followed the moon and then

254
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:35,120
I'll do my prelim and you know set up my

255
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:38,000
our motion and what you know they it was

256
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,610
almost like automatic but then the law

257
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,889
changed until now I had to like you know

258
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,980
learn all about administrative law the

259
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:47,659
administrative rulemaking process

260
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,610
regulations you know that eventually

261
00:10:47,659 --> 00:10:52,129
there's gonna be like disciplinary

262
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:55,370
process for all these licensees that

263
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:57,559
becomes activated they haven't yet

264
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:00,590
activated it because they hadn't come up

265
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:03,169
with an appellate framework what what I

266
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:07,129
find curious and I want to get your take

267
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:09,769
on this I see the next one to two grow

268
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:12,500
seasons as furiously getting more supply

269
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:15,079
chain members and then as the supply

270
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,000
chain matures the enforcement is going

271
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,070
to come along which brings the local

272
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,379
permit being jerked or find the state

273
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:26,960
doing it and do you see yourself doing

274
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:30,799
that and if so how are you anticipating

275
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:33,470
you're gonna help your clients maneuver

276
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,120
through that as it as it comes towards

277
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,129
them what's your plan to get them ready

278
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,799
to handle that next phase of enforcement

279
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:42,889
well probably compliance and like you

280
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:45,949
know really buckling down and I'm paying

281
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:48,169
attention performing audits you know

282
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,900
like vesting somebody with

283
00:11:48,169 --> 00:11:52,639
responsibilities in the organization for

284
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:55,759
making sure that compliance happens and

285
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,710
periodic reviews take place because I

286
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,480
think a lot of the problems with

287
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:01,700
compliance can be that it can be dialed

288
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,340
in but then the regulations change and

289
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,780
they're constantly evolving right now

290
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,730
and so when the regulation is to change

291
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:11,120
and somebody has a dial then it just

292
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:12,800
means that they're outdated and I think

293
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,769
that's what we're seeing a lot but the

294
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:17,689
regulators right now are super what they

295
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:20,179
call in the instructional mode they're

296
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,400
very forgiving and so I haven't seen

297
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:22,879
much enforcement and on the criminal

298
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,919
side

299
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:27,529
nobody's getting busted except people at

300
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:29,240
the airport and on you know the

301
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:31,699
administrative enforcement side nobody's

302
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,409
really getting busted unlicensed

303
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,110
cannabis operators are just competing

304
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:37,879
with you know the

305
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,950
regulated market the people's free

306
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:42,799
market is some college it's alive and

307
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:44,870
well in California and because of the

308
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,789
tax burden it's pushing a lot of the

309
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:51,429
more sophisticated consumers who are

310
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:55,099
traditionally patients from this over

311
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:58,039
taxed over regulated system into the

312
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:01,460
legacy free people's market and so I

313
00:12:58,039 --> 00:13:02,750
think the black market is gonna continue

314
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,410
to be an issue until it becomes

315
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:08,720
federally legal there is some

316
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:10,759
encouraging noise coming from Washington

317
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,790
which means that we could see some like

318
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:16,519
you know reform faster than any of us

319
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:18,909
may have expected maybe by 2020 maybe

320
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:22,009
Trump will be smart enough to say as a

321
00:13:18,909 --> 00:13:25,309
you know presidential re-election gambit

322
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:27,769
to get the turnout that he will legalize

323
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:29,119
cannabis or maybe the Democrats will be

324
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:30,919
smarter than Trump and they'll

325
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,929
outmaneuver him on that issue but

326
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:35,929
somebody's gonna take the lead on that

327
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:38,059
issue and claim it as a victory I know

328
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:40,250
and you understand it's about my case

329
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:42,169
that they'll sit on information for a

330
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:45,649
long time and it could come back and

331
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:48,110
haunt you yeah are you how concerned are

332
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:50,209
you in this preliminary phase we're just

333
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,970
checking a box and giving you some

334
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,320
leeway to clean it up at what point do

335
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:56,060
you see that turning into you know

336
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,120
you're not learning you're not really

337
00:13:56,059 --> 00:14:01,219
staying on QA and QC and have your

338
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,350
controls in place we're gonna spank you

339
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:06,009
where do you see that coming along not

340
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:09,470
for a while I think right now like the

341
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:11,960
part of the latest BCC rags in the

342
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:14,690
Disciplinary realm talk about like a

343
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:16,009
notice to cure I think or a notice to

344
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,180
rectify I forgot what it's called

345
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:19,340
there's like some language about like

346
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:21,649
fix the problem you know so right now

347
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,090
they're in the edging in educating

348
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:25,189
people about the problem and giving them

349
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,920
a chance to fix it and I think the ones

350
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:30,500
to ignore repeated opportunities to cure

351
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:33,079
the deficiency are the ones who are

352
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,700
gonna see enforcement and certainly like

353
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,170
the ones who don't even bother getting a

354
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,540
permit or the mustard gas the

355
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:40,639
enforcement just because the locals are

356
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:41,819
they want to see their money you know

357
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,740
there's like a anew

358
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:46,260
I think an assembly bill that allows

359
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:49,080
local jurisdictions to start fining

360
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:51,539
unlicensed cannabis operators and one

361
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:53,250
for legal colleagues recently reached

362
00:14:51,539 --> 00:14:55,679
out to me saying like hey I have a

363
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,120
client and this is like an unprecedented

364
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,419
issue like they're going after the

365
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,370
landlord for something the tenant did

366
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:04,079
impress no and this is all based on a

367
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:06,899
new law which allows the local

368
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,879
jurisdiction to really go hard after the

369
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,929
landlord and you know they're basically

370
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,090
like they don't want to play

371
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:14,309
whack-a-mole they're going after the

372
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:16,410
landlord so every time they hit it

373
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:19,819
they're nuking that hole and the mole

374
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:22,500
can either in yeah I I had a recent

375
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:25,470
referral for the first similar things

376
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,480
the landlord wasn't notified a number of

377
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:29,070
tenants got popped in a row and he ended

378
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,470
up with a three or four hundred thousand

379
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,240
dollar lien and his property and he's

380
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,370
like I didn't get told that so a friend

381
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:38,960
of mine is fighting those due process

382
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:41,929
notice types of issues right now and

383
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:44,759
what I've experienced with some of this

384
00:15:41,929 --> 00:15:46,649
local permitting and basically land you

385
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,870
stuff ain't about having to chicken in

386
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:51,120
your backyard okay because you couldn't

387
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:53,730
afford a lawyer to fight that this one's

388
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,669
gonna bring in top-flight firms and some

389
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:57,930
of those lines that we all ask which

390
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:59,459
sides are going to turn out will get

391
00:15:57,929 --> 00:16:02,339
appellate decisions on will you remember

392
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:04,019
or following after two 15 when mower

393
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:05,160
comes out and you go oh what's that mean

394
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:07,649
and everyone was like what does that

395
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:09,689
mean it's another answer there was a

396
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:12,360
recent decision down south of the trial

397
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:15,240
level about over prohibitive

398
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:17,009
restrictions on the six plans yes okay

399
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,379
tell me what you think about that and do

400
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:21,090
you think the appellate courts gonna

401
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:22,919
help us without well I think in that

402
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:24,690
case the appellate court did strike down

403
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:26,319
like you know

404
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:29,529
restrictions as unreasonable

405
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,230
restrictions on the word reasonable is

406
00:16:29,528 --> 00:16:34,059
like the stuff that innumerable legal

407
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:39,278
opinions are made of because it's sort

408
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:43,859
of your thumb and so because the law is

409
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,860
phrased in terms of reasonableness in it

410
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:52,149
it really it really opens up you know

411
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:55,059
like a lot of discretion in enforcement

412
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:57,370
and so I think in places like Fresno

413
00:16:55,059 --> 00:17:00,250
we're gonna see like maybe them backing

414
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:02,620
off after the legislative loss but in

415
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,298
neighboring counties they may not get

416
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:06,849
the message and they may still play

417
00:17:04,298 --> 00:17:09,990
silly and if this is the kind of impact

418
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:13,269
litigation that requires like several

419
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:17,048
victories in a row so that all the

420
00:17:13,269 --> 00:17:18,699
counties yeah not just one district is

421
00:17:17,048 --> 00:17:20,168
that an opinion yeah once they started

422
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:22,298
seeing a trend and they started seeing

423
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:23,709
everybody's paying attorney fees then I

424
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:25,990
start serving them in their pocketbook

425
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:28,298
where it hurts and really that's how you

426
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:31,480
make systemic change using strategic

427
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:34,509
litigation I I what I'd like to have

428
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:37,900
your thoughts on the delivery across the

429
00:17:34,509 --> 00:17:39,460
entire state and the 26200 local control

430
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:41,798
fight how do you think that's going to

431
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:44,009
turn out well I think right now the

432
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:46,240
fight has been lost by this

433
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:48,279
sheriff's and the cities but they might

434
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,640
take it to court claiming that the

435
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:55,089
regulations are inconsistent with the

436
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:58,210
state law and with prop 64 and local

437
00:17:55,089 --> 00:18:00,129
control and their mandate I don't really

438
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,169
think that ultimately they're gonna win

439
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:04,960
it's almost like tilting at windmills

440
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:07,390
because the ones that do allow bass are

441
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,419
just gonna be like serving the

442
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:13,240
unregulated delivery services which are

443
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:15,370
still advertising on weed maps I think a

444
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,230
bigger issue is like weed maps

445
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:20,199
continuing to advertise all of these

446
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,759
unlicensed delivery services I wish that

447
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,580
regulators would just create like a Wii

448
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,798
Maps license category and stop this

449
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:27,599
charade

450
00:18:25,798 --> 00:18:29,579
right and give everybody a license if

451
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,378
that's the way they're gonna allow it to

452
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:34,199
continue playing out and make everybody

453
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:37,678
kind of be on a more even playing field

454
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,929
and you know but I also understand that

455
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,470
you know local control and local control

456
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:44,820
is required I'm a I anticipate that

457
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:46,429
maybe we'll see like a local

458
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:48,960
jurisdiction start handing out like

459
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:50,850
virtually unlimited number of delivery

460
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,850
licenses you know as long as they have

461
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:56,668
an office in that jurisdiction and maybe

462
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:57,928
they have other locations for the rest

463
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,730
of the operation I don't know like it

464
00:18:57,929 --> 00:19:02,278
gets a little dicey with that but there

465
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:05,639
is no delivery rate radius I know their

466
00:19:02,278 --> 00:19:07,769
regulations well de facto $5,000 in

467
00:19:05,638 --> 00:19:10,558
profitability will limit you some that's

468
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:14,759
right but this last round of elections

469
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:18,118
there were 30-plus ballot initiatives

470
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:20,878
out there and the vast majority one how

471
00:19:18,118 --> 00:19:22,888
do you see that in the next cycle if you

472
00:19:20,878 --> 00:19:24,628
think this is an open more places up to

473
00:19:22,888 --> 00:19:26,908
this is the business let's regulate

474
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:28,378
let's do resource management or do you

475
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:30,509
think the ideologues are going to hang

476
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:31,618
on for a while longer no I think that

477
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:34,319
the ideologues

478
00:19:31,618 --> 00:19:37,168
their most compelling argument was this

479
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:39,358
is untested this is new we don't want to

480
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:41,249
be the guinea pigs that was their

481
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:43,168
strongest argument which carried the day

482
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:44,669
back when they were opposing it but I

483
00:19:43,169 --> 00:19:47,100
think now that's not a very compelling

484
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:49,369
argument once all the tax revenue starts

485
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:52,648
coming in and the figures come in

486
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:54,388
they're gonna have to basically change

487
00:19:52,648 --> 00:19:55,589
their approach and their approach is

488
00:19:54,388 --> 00:19:57,269
probably going to be something more

489
00:19:55,589 --> 00:20:00,599
about like you know we got to be

490
00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:03,569
compatible with local community uses and

491
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:06,238
really try to like put people in the box

492
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:09,749
and the least desirable development area

493
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:11,639
for cannabis and so that may happen in

494
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:13,649
like some of these Bank counties it also

495
00:20:11,638 --> 00:20:15,898
gets complicated with him you know some

496
00:20:13,648 --> 00:20:18,388
counties may choose to become hemp

497
00:20:15,898 --> 00:20:21,329
counties not cannabis counties and

498
00:20:18,388 --> 00:20:25,378
there's the issue of like cross

499
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:27,388
pollination that's my next question the

500
00:20:25,378 --> 00:20:28,888
we've had some overt threats already

501
00:20:27,388 --> 00:20:31,589
from the hemp people we're just gonna

502
00:20:28,888 --> 00:20:34,799
super pollinate all your cents amia yeah

503
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:37,289
and my first thought in

504
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:40,379
was they let her RICO case go through on

505
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:43,259
smell yeah okay we went to the jury the

506
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:46,050
jury said no but the the principle was

507
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:48,390
if there's a damaging impact on your

508
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:51,869
neighbor's property ie you pollinate my

509
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:54,540
stuff and ruin it do you think Rico

510
00:20:51,869 --> 00:20:58,019
could be a way to intervene if someone

511
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:59,909
really wants to weaponize pollen they

512
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:02,339
could in a way you know and it's

513
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:04,440
interesting to see how like the federal

514
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:07,559
court would rule like a may prioritize

515
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,630
hemp over schedule one cannabis just

516
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:12,329
because cannabis is illegal and hemp is

517
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:14,820
now legal thanks to the have farm bill

518
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:17,279
and so that's an interesting question

519
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:22,559
and remains to be decided that could be

520
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:25,200
like a very strategically wise option

521
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,119
that some of these Bank counties could

522
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,009
take and for that reason I have no

523
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,909
hesitation talking about it because you

524
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:32,039
know just because it's strategically

525
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:35,130
wise I'll never implement it they'll

526
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:37,889
yeah they're you know more likely to do

527
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:40,340
something different but hemp is really

528
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:43,620
gonna change the game and we might see

529
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:46,799
cannabis all over California it just

530
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:50,089
depends on this is traditional cannabis

531
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:53,369
or is it you know less than 0.3%

532
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:56,970
industrial hemp you know type cannabis

533
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:59,129
what I read part of that farm bill which

534
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:02,519
seemed to specifically take the rezoned

535
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:04,290
extraction from him yes out of Skid it's

536
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:06,269
no longer scheduled that's and people

537
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:07,230
are talking about concentrating like you

538
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:10,319
know maybe if you're taking like

539
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:13,170
smidgens of THC maybe all those smidgens

540
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:17,039
the THC can be like concentrated to make

541
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:18,900
federally legal concentrates well but if

542
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,649
you understand this is a soil remediate

543
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:24,420
er and a soil extractor one of the

544
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,880
concerns we've talked about you

545
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,900
accumulate if I'm gonna do CBD

546
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,410
concentrates and you grow

547
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:34,600
the seed producing phenotypes and just

548
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:38,200
have them so the chemo type is heavy in

549
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:39,849
CBD and grow it on less physical space

550
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,380
so it has less opportunity to suck crap

551
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:43,240
out of the ground hmm

552
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,560
now I don't know if that's actually

553
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,660
going to play out because California

554
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,970
specifically said unless it comes to the

555
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:50,730
cannabis supply chain you can't put CBD

556
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:53,140
in any finger it's an adulterated

557
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:55,569
substance and that's right and I have

558
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:59,200
yet to see an interstate transport

559
00:22:55,569 --> 00:23:01,659
transportation permit to bring extracted

560
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,819
CBD legally across the state lines there

561
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,040
everybody that contacts me but I asked

562
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:08,679
him where's your federal permits you get

563
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:10,869
crickets yeah but at some point they're

564
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,660
going to have to call a truce because

565
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:15,579
it's everywhere where where do you think

566
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,550
that line is going to be drawn between

567
00:23:15,579 --> 00:23:20,500
the nutritional supplements and trying

568
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:22,119
to over-regulate cannabis like it's

569
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:25,119
vicodin on a bush where do you where do

570
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:28,419
you see that well I think now like the

571
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:31,659
you know with the farm bill FDA is their

572
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:34,360
only impediment to you know CBD really

573
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:38,080
like being in all the products that we

574
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:40,689
see in the mass market and so you're

575
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,970
right CBD has to attain maximum market

576
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:45,009
penetration and it's here to stay I

577
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,890
don't think it's just going to be banned

578
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:50,049
overnight people don't care about his

579
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:52,270
status it never did get make it made

580
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:54,669
illegal I guess it could be prosecuted

581
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:56,799
under the analogue Act that's some sort

582
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:58,779
of analog controlled substance but

583
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,109
there's really no political will to do

584
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:05,589
any of that so I think FDA enforcement

585
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:07,929
has been way chill compared to the DEA

586
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:10,179
and so if they're the ones who are

587
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:13,930
worrying about it they seem to be far

588
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:15,850
more willing to adapt whereas you know I

589
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:17,769
think some of the CBD companies they're

590
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:19,839
gonna start lobbying you know because

591
00:24:17,769 --> 00:24:22,799
it's just got to be too profitable for

592
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:24,839
them not to how like the full

593
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,220
mantich i don't think they have 280e as

594
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:29,279
an issue right like if you have I don't

595
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:31,890
know if it's not a declared illegal

596
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:34,889
substance your tax system

597
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:36,750
there's no Twitty I mean doesn't get to

598
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,520
make tax policy well that is an

599
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:41,970
incredible competitive advantage to us

600
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:46,109
camper versus say the regulated cannabis

601
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:48,150
market what I see coming is taking

602
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:50,009
cannabis and jumping the hoops and

603
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:52,200
comparing it to other comparable

604
00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:54,089
industries and say this isn't fair

605
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,000
how do you see that fight playing out

606
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:58,799
over the next one to two years one to

607
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,019
two years like there's that's a major

608
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,000
priority with a lot of the national

609
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:05,069
advocacy organizations and so they are

610
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,890
getting far more sophisticated there's

611
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:10,879
changes with a new Congress and so I

612
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:13,770
don't want to prejudge the new Congress

613
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,260
but it seems like they are very

614
00:25:13,769 --> 00:25:18,660
motivated to like make changes that have

615
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:20,940
not been made by the previous do-nothing

616
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:23,130
Congress so with a Democratic majority

617
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:27,150
in Congress I'm very hopeful that we'll

618
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:29,850
see tremendous changes yeah well one

619
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:34,280
issue that is continuing up in the air

620
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:36,599
right now is the white labeling yeah

621
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:40,579
intellectual property rights who's the

622
00:25:36,599 --> 00:25:43,829
manager he's just a financial interest

623
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:45,659
tell me how you see any lines that we

624
00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:47,309
can understand around that that you

625
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:49,320
could advise where do you see that

626
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:50,940
playing out sure there was like a lot of

627
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:52,500
guidance in the final statement of

628
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:54,269
reasons that the Bureau of cannabis

629
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:59,599
controlled issued and they basically

630
00:25:54,269 --> 00:26:02,849
said anybody who exert control over a

631
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:05,240
licensee is considered an owner and so

632
00:26:02,849 --> 00:26:08,119
the BCC reg

633
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,759
they have a definition of owner that is

634
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:12,558
very different than what lawyers or

635
00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:16,609
regular people think of when they hear

636
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:19,278
the word owner normally ownership means

637
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:22,609
that you have some sort of interest and

638
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:25,220
that you own whatever the property is

639
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:27,439
well according to the BCC you don't have

640
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:30,140
to have any ownership interests in order

641
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,350
to be an owner you could be an owner by

642
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:36,020
the mere fact that you are basically

643
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:38,209
like directing or managing or

644
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:40,879
controlling the cannabis business and

645
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:44,419
that creates an issue for intellectual

646
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,460
property brand owners you know that's

647
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:48,500
different than a BCC owner just somebody

648
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,470
who owns rights and intellectual

649
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:53,509
property and the issue is if they're

650
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,399
going to sell their intellectual

651
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:57,619
property or assign rights to the

652
00:26:55,398 --> 00:26:59,089
intellectual property great they sold it

653
00:26:57,619 --> 00:27:01,819
it's off their hands they can sell it to

654
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:03,769
the licensee but if they want to license

655
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:05,778
their brand basically rent the

656
00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:10,038
intellectual property they have to

657
00:27:05,778 --> 00:27:13,220
maintain control over it so it's not a

658
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:16,970
naked license which is in trademark law

659
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:20,298
naked licenses when you try to license a

660
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:22,460
brand or a mark but you don't exert any

661
00:27:20,298 --> 00:27:24,710
quality control over how the market is

662
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,659
used and therefore you're basically

663
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:29,659
surrendering control and when you

664
00:27:26,659 --> 00:27:31,929
surrender control it becomes public

665
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:34,399
domain and you no longer have

666
00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:36,440
protectable rights in the market and so

667
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:39,319
basically because of the requirement of

668
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:42,308
not giving up control to avoid giving a

669
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:42,308
naked license

670
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:50,929
a lot of brand owners are now have to

671
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:53,599
exert control over licensees meaning

672
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:56,269
they have to register as owners under

673
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:59,628
five zero zero three of the proposed

674
00:27:56,269 --> 00:28:02,089
regulation that really expands in my

675
00:27:59,628 --> 00:28:03,829
view what most people understood to be

676
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:06,408
an owner they thought like an owner

677
00:28:03,829 --> 00:28:08,269
somebody may be like you know the plant

678
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:09,590
manager could be an owner even though

679
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:13,120
they don't have an actual ownership

680
00:28:09,589 --> 00:28:13,119
interest there there

681
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:20,390
but somebody who is just basically you

682
00:28:18,528 --> 00:28:22,669
know directing and you know the

683
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:24,080
specifications and the way that the

684
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:27,380
product will be built but they're not

685
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:29,599
there on an everyday basis they may be

686
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:32,179
considered an owner so the advice I'm

687
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:34,369
going to give my clients is and the BCC

688
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:37,100
said this isn't in the regulations final

689
00:28:34,369 --> 00:28:39,048
statement of reasons is the BCC will

690
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:41,899
give you guidance come to us and we'll

691
00:28:39,048 --> 00:28:45,019
tell you so I think the safe thing is to

692
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:46,909
ask better safe than sorry and basically

693
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:48,470
say you know the control we exert is

694
00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:50,870
limited but it is some sort of control

695
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:53,028
can you consider this an owner and I

696
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:55,908
think the BCC basically wants to know

697
00:28:53,028 --> 00:28:57,319
anybody who is playing the game yeah if

698
00:28:55,909 --> 00:28:59,659
you got to play the game you got to wear

699
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:01,548
a Jersey you got to be on a team if you

700
00:28:59,659 --> 00:29:03,320
don't want to wear a Jersey get off the

701
00:29:01,548 --> 00:29:06,139
field it's basically what the BCC is

702
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:08,778
saying well and the marketing of

703
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:11,299
products exists yes and this dropped

704
00:29:08,778 --> 00:29:15,019
into it and they just went to work

705
00:29:11,298 --> 00:29:16,730
marketing yes and so we have these weird

706
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:18,710
sets of control rules that are

707
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:21,950
incompatible with the real legal world

708
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:24,470
of IP yes and I we don't have an answer

709
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:27,980
yet but I have some clients who have

710
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:30,100
salaried Plus employees who get a piece

711
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:32,120
of the sales and stuff like that

712
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:35,538
cheering because you know that's like a

713
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:37,209
modern compensation trend it is I take

714
00:29:35,538 --> 00:29:40,038
the business those are those are

715
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:42,019
financial interested people and they

716
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:43,970
have to be declared of course but

717
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:47,658
they're getting more than 20 percent now

718
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:49,429
their owners are not a new rests the how

719
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:52,250
far up they're gonna swim for an

720
00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:54,409
individual let's say that a brand is

721
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,919
owned by another corporation oh good

722
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:57,649
question

723
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:59,750
so my pick is they want to know

724
00:29:57,648 --> 00:30:02,449
everybody their note no more of this

725
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:04,548
hiding behind some some site door that's

726
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:06,259
a regulation the regulations are quite

727
00:30:04,548 --> 00:30:08,720
explicit about exactly what you're

728
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:10,398
talking about that they will be no more

729
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,589
corporate layering it's what they call

730
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:14,269
it it says having you know a shell

731
00:30:12,589 --> 00:30:16,759
corporation owned by a shell corporation

732
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:19,690
owned by another shell corporation owned

733
00:30:16,759 --> 00:30:21,460
by numerous shell corporations

734
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:24,370
now the Bureau of cannabis control to

735
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:27,309
make sure that nobody who shouldn't have

736
00:30:24,369 --> 00:30:29,859
a ownership interest in a laboratory has

737
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:33,009
one they want to get back to individuals

738
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:37,719
so like whenever an owner is a corporate

739
00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:40,750
entity either a corporation or you know

740
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:43,390
LLC limited liability corporation or

741
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:45,819
even a partnership or some sort of like

742
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:49,210
legal entity that is not a natural

743
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:53,049
person they're gonna go to see who owns

744
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:55,029
that entity until only natural persons

745
00:30:53,049 --> 00:30:56,710
are left and they don't call them

746
00:30:55,029 --> 00:30:59,019
natural persons and the regulations that

747
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:01,720
call them individuals which is kind of

748
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:03,369
goofy and I guess individual you know

749
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:08,230
that bring that brings to mind that

750
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:11,049
goofy prop 215 case about people versus

751
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:13,000
Peron where it said a caregiver is an

752
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:14,619
individual who assumes primary

753
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,869
responsibility for the health safety or

754
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:21,129
housing of the patient and therefore a

755
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:24,250
cannabis club is not and cannot be a

756
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:27,610
caregiver yeah but that word individual

757
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:31,509
in the regulations you know is it's kind

758
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:34,179
of basically I I think it's okay for

759
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:36,660
them I want transparency and to see who

760
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:38,980
is pulling the strings because

761
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:41,080
corporations always act through their

762
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:44,170
officers and directors and their

763
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:47,579
employees and so it is good to see who

764
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:50,289
is behind this and if people you know

765
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:52,629
are ashamed to be in the cannabis

766
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:53,950
industry then they shouldn't be in it if

767
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:55,510
people shouldn't be in the cannabis

768
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,850
industry for whatever reason maybe

769
00:31:55,509 --> 00:32:00,309
they're like a convicted fraudster then

770
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:02,589
that should be disclosed and they should

771
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:04,839
not be allowed in the industry it's bad

772
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:07,750
enough the way it is now with you know

773
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:10,839
the checks and you know the regulators

774
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:13,450
are not really enforcing any of the

775
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:15,399
agreements you know there's licensees

776
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:19,150
getting burned left and right on deals

777
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:20,710
court gone wrong and I'm not seeing one

778
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:24,350
of the regulations that says you have to

779
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:28,399
satisfy all court judgments you know

780
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:35,569
and there should be what let me ask you

781
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:38,028
about the metrics to buy products I'm

782
00:32:35,569 --> 00:32:42,109
having a lot of discussions with people

783
00:32:38,028 --> 00:32:44,690
drafting contracts with me and for me so

784
00:32:42,109 --> 00:32:46,189
if I go to court and you don't pay

785
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,899
because she said they didn't give they

786
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:50,630
didn't deliver what you what she

787
00:32:47,898 --> 00:32:52,579
contracted for and I asked you well then

788
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:56,179
what did you contract for and you use

789
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:58,158
terms like it was top-shelf okay and you

790
00:32:56,179 --> 00:33:00,139
and I know that we're taught to break

791
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,990
things into their component parts what's

792
00:33:00,138 --> 00:33:05,178
the metrics if your value is its

793
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:06,970
terpenes and it's cold process what does

794
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:09,798
that mean if you want a certain

795
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:12,798
cannabinoid chemo type profile what does

796
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:14,658
that mean water content have you are you

797
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:18,048
having discussions with attorneys

798
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:21,019
drafting these agreements on dialing in

799
00:33:18,048 --> 00:33:23,720
these terms yes you want to have a level

800
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:25,339
of granularity in the terms like you

801
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,259
know for example if you're gonna do a

802
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:29,808
distribution agreement and somebody's

803
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:32,839
gonna be granting territorial rights

804
00:33:29,808 --> 00:33:35,480
it's better to be granular if you are a

805
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:37,369
distributor and not give exclusive

806
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,960
rights for the whole state of California

807
00:33:37,369 --> 00:33:40,559
to a distributor who can only

808
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,690
effectively destroy

809
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,450
maybe in the Bay Area but does not have

810
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:48,779
any market penetration in LA or San

811
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:51,660
Diego or Fresno or Bakersfield or

812
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:56,039
Sacramento or anywhere else in the state

813
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:59,400
and what you're talking about it's like

814
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:07,740
specifying the product and you know just

815
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:10,650
calling the product marijuana you know

816
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:13,199
ideally you would be specifying like

817
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:15,599
you're saying all of the desirable

818
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,839
characteristics that you want we haven't

819
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,509
seen that level of granularity as a

820
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,880
standard practice yet but we will in the

821
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:27,090
future because there's gonna be like in

822
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:30,750
more accurate testing available and I

823
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:32,280
think a lot of these criteria that

824
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,719
you're discussing are going to be key

825
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,500
into testing you know like the moisture

826
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:40,199
content and the terpenoid and the

827
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:43,079
cannabinoid you know that's a great

828
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:45,389
point well in writing conditions into

829
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:47,250
contracts that if it isn't a it's gonna

830
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:48,779
be B and we're gonna price to be at this

831
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,148
and here it's great and if it's not be

832
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:54,720
at C and rather than have to go hire us

833
00:34:51,148 --> 00:34:56,880
at our reasonable rates to figure this

834
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:00,899
out in court I'm trying to teach people

835
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:02,730
do it now and in when you're like we're

836
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,400
hugging and kissing figure out how

837
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:07,800
you're gonna disagree okay absolutely

838
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,980
yeah the best time I figure out the

839
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,330
break-up is you know maybe before you're

840
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:14,699
hugging and kissing you know it's like

841
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:18,000
before you sign the contract yeah and

842
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:19,739
it's many times like a prenup but it's

843
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,059
good for people to think about like what

844
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:24,479
happens because if they have

845
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:26,099
expectations that they don't want a

846
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,440
breakup to happen and it's gonna be a

847
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:30,989
very painful breakup many times that

848
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,869
will help them a dear to their

849
00:35:30,989 --> 00:35:36,179
obligations and not be so cavalier about

850
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:38,159
I always encourage my clients to put it

851
00:35:36,179 --> 00:35:40,199
in writing and be very definite about

852
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:42,389
the terms and the more you think about

853
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:45,659
the terms like the more granular it can

854
00:35:42,389 --> 00:35:47,609
get is it a good idea to have a template

855
00:35:45,659 --> 00:35:49,379
that gives the client the whole range of

856
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:52,079
possibilities and all the points of

857
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:54,869
negotiation absolutely you know I think

858
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,179
you're doing them a service instead of

859
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:59,309
charging them on a per contract basis to

860
00:35:57,179 --> 00:36:00,839
come up with a master contract and teach

861
00:35:59,309 --> 00:36:03,239
them you know what the points of

862
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:07,950
negotiation are and then they can kind

863
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:10,679
of figure that out on their own and put

864
00:36:07,949 --> 00:36:12,059
that in the contract many times it's

865
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:13,739
always good for them to have it reviewed

866
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:15,900
you know so I always tell my clients

867
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:17,519
like you know you can go ahead and write

868
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,619
your contract but if you want to run it

869
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:21,420
by me you know it's gonna cost a lot

870
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:23,759
less money because it's an edit it's not

871
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,440
writing from scratch and that way you

872
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,620
have like a second pair of eyes on it

873
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,480
and it's always good to like you know

874
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:32,429
have somebody else look at it myself

875
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,429
with my own work I always have somebody

876
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:37,529
look at it and I always sleep on it if I

877
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:41,789
have a chance to look at it with fresh

878
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:44,160
eyes I see a round of cannibalism in

879
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:46,860
some of the legacy people right now who

880
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:48,480
just aren't paying for the products

881
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,160
they're receiving they're spending money

882
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,190
on other things and not paying the

883
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:55,649
suppliers there I see a huge mess oh

884
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:57,720
there's a lot to be fixed somehow I call

885
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:00,450
it cannibalism because the industry team

886
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:02,699
is circular firing squad or eat itself

887
00:37:00,449 --> 00:37:04,439
up tell me what you see coming with that

888
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:05,849
well I think you make a very good point

889
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,800
that you know a lot of people are like

890
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:10,110
robbing Peter to pay Paul and by that I

891
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,850
mean it's usually distribution companies

892
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:14,130
who are getting fronted all this product

893
00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:15,960
and they're making promises that once it

894
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:17,910
sells will pay you and then these poor

895
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,530
farmers are waiting and waiting and

896
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:21,929
waiting and they're not getting paid and

897
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:24,480
there's always a new excuse and so I am

898
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:25,848
I have heard many stories like what your

899
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,818
man

900
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:31,489
you know because right now I think

901
00:37:28,818 --> 00:37:33,469
there's no standard terms in the

902
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:35,869
industry there's no industry standard

903
00:37:33,469 --> 00:37:38,538
anything and so it hasn't really been

904
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:42,230
defined there's definitely going to be

905
00:37:38,539 --> 00:37:45,859
the very ethical distribution companies

906
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:48,528
very ethical cultivators manufacturers

907
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:51,318
retailers who probably will set like

908
00:37:48,528 --> 00:37:53,028
best practices that will just thrive and

909
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:56,630
be successful business models that

910
00:37:53,028 --> 00:37:58,849
everybody will imitate but for now that

911
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:01,430
has not yet emerged and there's a lot of

912
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:04,160
like business models that are basically

913
00:38:01,429 --> 00:38:06,558
underwritten by venture capitalists who

914
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:08,778
are burning money and giving them seven

915
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:11,690
years runway to make stupid decisions

916
00:38:08,778 --> 00:38:15,259
and many companies have that you know

917
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:17,028
kind of long runway and so we're seeing

918
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:20,690
a lot of distortions in the market

919
00:38:17,028 --> 00:38:23,778
because very inefficient operations are

920
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:25,639
gaining market share and they're not

921
00:38:23,778 --> 00:38:27,949
producing any money they're like losing

922
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:31,548
money you know faster than they can gain

923
00:38:27,949 --> 00:38:33,259
it but then they're able to claim that

924
00:38:31,548 --> 00:38:35,719
they're making tens of millions of

925
00:38:33,259 --> 00:38:37,699
dollars in revenues while omitting the

926
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:40,068
inconvenient fact that they're losing

927
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:44,768
far more than well they're being enabled

928
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:47,509
to be inefficient yes there was a recent

929
00:38:44,768 --> 00:38:50,229
laboratory problem in Sacramento yeah

930
00:38:47,509 --> 00:38:52,460
where it looks like there was at least

931
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:55,338
fraudulent activity maybe criminal

932
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:57,650
activity and now the lab director said

933
00:38:55,338 --> 00:38:59,808
that he had been you know keeping it

934
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:02,119
from the owner and from everybody else

935
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:02,930
actly which kind of almost points a

936
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:04,670
gross

937
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:07,190
you know negligence on the part of well

938
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:08,809
others the phrase they had was Pennywise

939
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,700
and pound-foolish because they had no

940
00:39:08,809 --> 00:39:14,329
one watching him

941
00:39:10,699 --> 00:39:16,250
doing it but my question is this may be

942
00:39:14,329 --> 00:39:18,829
the first time or an insurance company

943
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:21,619
says no we're gonna deny a claim because

944
00:39:18,829 --> 00:39:25,970
it was our liabilities based on criminal

945
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:29,570
activity are you seeing any holes in the

946
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:31,098
insurance industry for the supply chain

947
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:32,869
that you have to contract or bridge

948
00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:35,300
around you or do you see that everything

949
00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:36,530
is now covered by a an insurance policy

950
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,140
of some type

951
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:40,519
well there's insurance companies that

952
00:39:39,139 --> 00:39:42,799
will sell insurance for pretty much

953
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:45,108
every need whether or not they actually

954
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,510
pay on these claims or claim that the

955
00:39:45,108 --> 00:39:48,949
exclusions you know are triggered and

956
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:53,180
that they don't have to pay the claim is

957
00:39:48,949 --> 00:39:55,189
a totally different question I happen to

958
00:39:53,179 --> 00:39:57,319
know an insurance executive who

959
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:59,510
basically tells me that a lot of times

960
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:00,950
when they're writing the exclusions

961
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:02,990
they're trying to make it so that

962
00:40:00,949 --> 00:40:05,949
they're paying minimal claims you know

963
00:40:02,989 --> 00:40:09,348
that they can litigate all of these

964
00:40:05,949 --> 00:40:13,578
non-payment of claims against the bad

965
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:15,500
faith insurance denial lawsuit so I

966
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:17,420
think insurance companies are pretty

967
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,280
slick in what they do like they I

968
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:21,289
haven't heard too many cases of

969
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,660
insurance companies paying claims you

970
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:25,608
know and making good on the coverage

971
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:28,879
they're making a killing everybody has

972
00:40:25,608 --> 00:40:30,559
to get insurance these days I was an

973
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,068
insurance defense lawyer so I've had

974
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:36,559
these discussions about reserving money

975
00:40:34,068 --> 00:40:39,380
and I know how they play the game but

976
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:42,108
I've also had some discussions with

977
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:44,690
attorneys who are coverage counsel who

978
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:47,059
specialized in review things that tell

979
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:49,849
me that these these non admitted

980
00:40:47,059 --> 00:40:51,230
carriers are playing fast and loose and

981
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:51,630
you're going to have a hard time doing

982
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,778
anything

983
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:57,239
if they really deny and dump and run on

984
00:40:54,778 --> 00:40:59,639
you sure because they're not like

985
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:02,239
writing their exclusions carefully

986
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:04,048
enough or they're making implied

987
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:05,789
representations you know that are

988
00:41:04,048 --> 00:41:08,038
contrary they're probably doing all

989
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:10,319
sorts of sketchy things you know telling

990
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:12,329
people like hey I'm this was perfect

991
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:14,670
insurance for your business well I I

992
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:17,460
have been involved in some bad phase

993
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:19,349
cases where the people that were selling

994
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:22,739
the policies were making representations

995
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:25,470
and when they got to come anyway I don't

996
00:41:22,739 --> 00:41:26,068
think so yeah and I see a lot of that

997
00:41:25,469 --> 00:41:29,578
coming

998
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:33,599
shann I'm my curiosity who peaked when

999
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:37,410
the first big claim gets denied and a

1000
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:40,019
company takes a nosedive and fails and

1001
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:42,598
they have a bad faith case because the

1002
00:41:40,018 --> 00:41:46,498
appellate courts have lots of precedents

1003
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:48,960
for bad faith but they recently last

1004
00:41:46,498 --> 00:41:50,548
year allowed cannabis specific contracts

1005
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,369
remember when they yeah I'm into those

1006
00:41:50,548 --> 00:41:56,009
rule may be 1150 so now you can write a

1007
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:58,200
cannabis specific California contract

1008
00:41:56,009 --> 00:41:59,849
sure - when Lloyd's of London is writing

1009
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:02,608
it they're right not writing it for

1010
00:41:59,849 --> 00:42:04,680
California so I see some definitional

1011
00:42:02,608 --> 00:42:06,778
problems that will get some denials and

1012
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:08,848
you're right they will fight that and

1013
00:42:06,778 --> 00:42:11,219
pay a claim because it's cheaper to keep

1014
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:13,559
taking the money in yep

1015
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:15,269
do you see any other holes or problems

1016
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:18,690
in the insurance coverage besides

1017
00:42:15,268 --> 00:42:21,629
they're just not cannabis specific I

1018
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:24,349
mean cannabis events you know like also

1019
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:26,329
like there's

1020
00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:28,940
probably got once all the product

1021
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:30,949
liability claims start coming in product

1022
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:33,500
liability insurance it's got skyrocket

1023
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:35,929
oh yes you know there's probably gonna

1024
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:38,030
be a lot of like denials based on that I

1025
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:40,609
mean I think there's like a few lawyers

1026
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:42,320
who specialized in insurance law and

1027
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:44,450
they're gonna have a lot of work in the

1028
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,039
next few years because there's gonna be

1029
00:42:44,449 --> 00:42:47,719
like increasingly more insurance

1030
00:42:46,039 --> 00:42:49,699
companies they're gonna start insuring

1031
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:52,609
cannabis activity and that inevitably

1032
00:42:49,699 --> 00:42:56,000
leads to claims and litigation over

1033
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:57,620
claims I mean like you're saying like

1034
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,719
this whole Lab thing like you know would

1035
00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:01,339
that be covered by the insurance they

1036
00:42:59,719 --> 00:43:03,589
probably have some sort of exclusion

1037
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:05,090
about like ultra various activity and

1038
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,769
they're gonna say this guy was not

1039
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:09,289
acting within the scope of his duties

1040
00:43:06,769 --> 00:43:11,750
you know or maybe they were saying the

1041
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:16,099
owners or whoever the named insured is

1042
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:16,610
was negligent and in breach of policy it

1043
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:18,920
already

1044
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:26,420
Omar oh they didn't have someone

1045
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:29,570
watching him oh they said oh yeah and

1046
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:31,639
when he admitted to defrauding and

1047
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:32,900
official or falsifying an official

1048
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:35,179
statement that carries criminal

1049
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:37,130
sanctions and I would deny it it's like

1050
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:39,799
being drunk and get into an accident and

1051
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:42,680
kill somebody just shot easy drive away

1052
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,920
don't say nothing yeah yeah yeah a party

1053
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:49,909
he's sunk their ship yeah did they have

1054
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:52,039
a lawyer no obviously well if they did

1055
00:43:49,909 --> 00:43:54,629
you just have to wonder was your wait

1056
00:43:52,039 --> 00:43:56,969
yes let them go out and do

1057
00:43:54,630 --> 00:44:00,059
well yes many lawyers sided potted

1058
00:43:56,969 --> 00:44:02,278
plants and yeah well it's part of the

1059
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:04,289
pivot into this industry to understand

1060
00:44:02,278 --> 00:44:06,329
who you're dealing with here mm-hmm

1061
00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:08,819
I had been to the lab and walked around

1062
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:10,229
and you know ask some questions about if

1063
00:44:08,818 --> 00:44:11,909
I had to defend you for what you're

1064
00:44:10,228 --> 00:44:13,439
doing there how do you do that he taking

1065
00:44:11,909 --> 00:44:16,048
pictures keeping track and keeping

1066
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,548
records and they didn't really have a

1067
00:44:16,048 --> 00:44:19,768
lot of answers because I'm a trial

1068
00:44:17,548 --> 00:44:22,288
lawyer you just got sued somebody died

1069
00:44:19,768 --> 00:44:24,419
how do I defend you and prove that it

1070
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:25,739
wasn't you that killed him yeah that's a

1071
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:32,700
really good point those are discussions

1072
00:44:25,739 --> 00:44:36,269
we show that there was a new provision

1073
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:40,318
added into events for a 500 dollars to

1074
00:44:36,268 --> 00:44:42,899
change a premise moderate to modify a

1075
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:45,568
premise and I was talking to Susan's

1076
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,249
Soros this morning about that and she

1077
00:44:45,568 --> 00:44:52,199
goes what's this here for a deal why do

1078
00:44:47,248 --> 00:44:56,969
they add a 500 hours to change the to

1079
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:58,618
modify a premise and I for event and I I

1080
00:44:56,969 --> 00:45:00,298
don't have an answer do you have any I

1081
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:01,710
didn't we went back and looked to the

1082
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:04,199
statement of reasons we couldn't find

1083
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:06,329
anything in there about it

1084
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:08,578
would be that they're trying to

1085
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:10,710
discourage people from last-minute

1086
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:13,170
modifications because like so many of

1087
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:16,380
these event applications they submit an

1088
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:18,240
initial application that is bare-bones

1089
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,640
and then at the last second they're

1090
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:23,368
submitting all these like new change of

1091
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:26,819
premises and new list of vendors and new

1092
00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:28,800
list of participants and you know this

1093
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:31,380
is before like all the new recs kick in

1094
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,539
requiring like responsibility by the

1095
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:36,300
event organizer and babysitting of all

1096
00:45:33,539 --> 00:45:37,769
the every other licensees at the event

1097
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:40,650
and making sure there's no unlicensed

1098
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:43,710
sales - making sure that the 21 and over

1099
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:44,369
area remains 21 and over and cannot be

1100
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,900
seen

1101
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:48,900
you know from outside and all of those

1102
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:52,099
requirements but I think the main reason

1103
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:56,250
they put that in I think is you know

1104
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:57,960
it's all speculative because well and we

1105
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:59,639
don't have the AOL telling us we're

1106
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:03,000
gonna let this do or not let it through

1107
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:05,838
either and that comes January you think

1108
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,838
oh yeah

1109
00:46:10,989 --> 00:46:14,919
ideally they would give everybody a

1110
00:46:12,489 --> 00:46:21,849
Christmas present maybe not they may be

1111
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:24,990
like generating I'm hoping is an issue

1112
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:27,549
that is important to me would be the

1113
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:30,849
cultivation regulations I challenged the

1114
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:33,250
definition of light deprivation as mixed

1115
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:37,059
light and I said and I submit a very

1116
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:40,059
detailed you know opposition and

1117
00:46:37,059 --> 00:46:42,070
strenuous objections saying that mixed

1118
00:46:40,059 --> 00:46:44,049
light according to the statute required

1119
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:46,780
supplemental artificial lighting and

1120
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:49,390
that light deprivation artificial

1121
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:51,460
darkness is not supplemental artificial

1122
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:54,099
lighting you know it may be an

1123
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:56,260
artificial manipulation of the light

1124
00:46:54,099 --> 00:46:57,610
period the photo period but that's not

1125
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:59,890
what the legislature was talking about

1126
00:46:57,610 --> 00:47:02,340
when it came up with three categories so

1127
00:46:59,889 --> 00:47:06,339
really light that should be outdoors and

1128
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:09,519
you know the in the eyesore the initial

1129
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:11,829
statement of reasons I think CDFA said

1130
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:15,550
well because you could get multiple

1131
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:17,440
harbors using light up then we really

1132
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:20,619
believe that it should be classified as

1133
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,030
mixed light and I'm thinking if you

1134
00:47:20,619 --> 00:47:23,619
could get multiple harvests in the

1135
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:26,019
considers increased regulation

1136
00:47:23,619 --> 00:47:28,420
regulatory oversight just give him extra

1137
00:47:26,019 --> 00:47:31,719
inspections you don't need to redefine

1138
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:33,789
I know a lot of outdoor growers who if

1139
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:35,549
they were allowed to use like that it

1140
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:40,000
would really mean the difference between

1141
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:43,390
barely scraping by and making a decent

1142
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:46,840
living not a great living not you know

1143
00:47:43,389 --> 00:47:48,940
the olden days but definitely not barely

1144
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:51,200
scraping about and so it's an important

1145
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:54,320
issue that I have

1146
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:56,239
just kind of like pursued and I know you

1147
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:58,338
know nobody's gonna pay me to write

1148
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:00,649
about that cuz it's really not you know

1149
00:47:58,338 --> 00:48:02,299
the poor farmers who need that can't

1150
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,980
afford a lawyer to evolve in their

1151
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:06,769
behalf so I did it as a citizen it was

1152
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:11,900
like my you know pro bono contribution I

1153
00:48:06,769 --> 00:48:14,000
had an issue with no new CoA without

1154
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,780
remediation if it turns out the labs

1155
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,608
wrong

1156
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:19,280
yes I've I have my armaments on that

1157
00:48:16,608 --> 00:48:20,598
testing it shows that I've got this or

1158
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:22,400
that's not there and all of a sudden he

1159
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:24,079
shows up and I can't get a new co a

1160
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,019
without remediation and there's nothing

1161
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:29,390
to remediate and sometimes so the lab

1162
00:48:27,019 --> 00:48:33,349
will readily admit we're wrong you know

1163
00:48:29,389 --> 00:48:36,739
we it did not pass testing there's no

1164
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:37,940
CoA but under the previous

1165
00:48:36,739 --> 00:48:39,799
interpretations they couldn't do

1166
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:41,960
anything about it and so I don't know

1167
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,900
what is the latest draft of the regs at

1168
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:48,470
December and draft say there there's a

1169
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:51,019
remediation plan and when I asked Laurie

1170
00:48:48,469 --> 00:48:53,149
this at a meeting so if I tell you I've

1171
00:48:51,019 --> 00:48:54,980
got R&amp;D testing all along the line that

1172
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:57,318
this batch was clean and now it comes

1173
00:48:54,980 --> 00:49:00,889
out dirty can I submit that on the plan

1174
00:48:57,318 --> 00:49:02,779
and get a new retest and I didn't know

1175
00:49:00,889 --> 00:49:05,299
language change that I'm aware of

1176
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:08,420
so I don't know I would I would still do

1177
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:10,099
it I submitted a remediation plan that I

1178
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,260
want a new Seaway because they're wrong

1179
00:49:10,099 --> 00:49:14,300
and I can prove it sure and I think that

1180
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:15,890
I could probably get one yeah there

1181
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:18,050
needs to be like some error correction

1182
00:49:15,889 --> 00:49:19,549
and maybe they should give like I would

1183
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:22,150
like to see a regulation that gets the

1184
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:25,550
regulator's some discretion you know

1185
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:27,710
just to like correct everybody yeah the

1186
00:49:25,550 --> 00:49:32,119
old common law I don't have a word for

1187
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:33,740
but it's the right thing to do and I

1188
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:35,180
don't know what that would be maybe I

1189
00:49:33,739 --> 00:49:36,409
was just like an error correction

1190
00:49:35,179 --> 00:49:38,449
regulation you know they have the power

1191
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:41,179
to like make it make it right and

1192
00:49:38,449 --> 00:49:43,789
effectuate things well it it can kill

1193
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:46,940
let's say a cultivator has his entire

1194
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:49,309
harvest in something fails a CoA and you

1195
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:51,530
know I started testing from day one and

1196
00:49:49,309 --> 00:49:53,809
it's clean I can't get paid and I'm

1197
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:55,550
gonna go bankrupt and you won't give me

1198
00:49:53,809 --> 00:49:56,179
a retest until he fix it there's nothing

1199
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:58,490
wrong with it

1200
00:49:56,179 --> 00:50:01,998
yeah and that's the concern I always had

1201
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:03,408
a big person or a big corporation

1202
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:04,759
moving a lot of biomass they could

1203
00:50:03,409 --> 00:50:06,889
probably set on something for a minute

1204
00:50:04,759 --> 00:50:09,559
if these smaller people can't absolutely

1205
00:50:06,889 --> 00:50:12,169
I agree with you um I'm very interested

1206
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:14,509
in organizing up in El Dorado where I'm

1207
00:50:12,168 --> 00:50:18,228
doing work these small cannabis

1208
00:50:14,509 --> 00:50:21,259
cooperative associations nice and so I

1209
00:50:18,228 --> 00:50:24,458
have if you have an idea about this they

1210
00:50:21,259 --> 00:50:26,869
exempt antitrust for the coke that

1211
00:50:24,458 --> 00:50:29,808
associates itself but it's got a limit

1212
00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:30,979
on four acres but if four or five of

1213
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:32,809
them come together

1214
00:50:30,978 --> 00:50:36,198
I've been started asking questions

1215
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:39,559
where's the antitrust line for them

1216
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:41,869
yeah combination of cooperatives I think

1217
00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:43,278
they don't have any antitrust protection

1218
00:50:41,869 --> 00:50:45,559
the co-operative itself has none of a

1219
00:50:43,278 --> 00:50:47,208
choice protection there's no limit on

1220
00:50:45,559 --> 00:50:51,889
the size of the cooperative is there

1221
00:50:47,208 --> 00:50:53,748
there's a four acre cap oh well then I

1222
00:50:51,889 --> 00:50:55,789
think these cannabis cooperatives need

1223
00:50:53,748 --> 00:50:58,968
to start lobbying to lift that four acre

1224
00:50:55,789 --> 00:51:00,439
cap for a Cure cap is is ridiculously

1225
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:04,398
low considering that some of these

1226
00:51:00,438 --> 00:51:06,768
santabarbara licensees own far more than

1227
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:09,798
four acres you know with cumulative

1228
00:51:06,768 --> 00:51:12,068
permits I think it makes sense to like

1229
00:51:09,798 --> 00:51:14,838
change it so that these cooperative

1230
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:17,239
associations could have maybe forty

1231
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:18,558
acres which is not really that much when

1232
00:51:17,239 --> 00:51:20,688
you think about it you know that's the

1233
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,879
traditional forty acres and a meal which

1234
00:51:20,688 --> 00:51:24,828
is enough to like support one family it

1235
00:51:22,878 --> 00:51:27,469
wasn't all that much well there are

1236
00:51:24,829 --> 00:51:29,719
regions I know mindo and and Casey

1237
00:51:27,469 --> 00:51:33,168
O'Neil I've talked to him Hezekiah was

1238
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:35,329
working in that same area to organize

1239
00:51:33,168 --> 00:51:37,518
them and we're gonna take the templates

1240
00:51:35,329 --> 00:51:40,489
over across the valley but we want to

1241
00:51:37,518 --> 00:51:43,218
work in these mountainous production

1242
00:51:40,489 --> 00:51:45,139
areas cooperatively and I don't think we

1243
00:51:43,219 --> 00:51:48,199
have an answer yet as to how far you can

1244
00:51:45,139 --> 00:51:49,190
go to try and sell in bulk without

1245
00:51:48,199 --> 00:51:51,659
getting accused

1246
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:53,670
manipulate a market in a combination and

1247
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:54,960
restraint of trade so that interesting

1248
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:56,159
is roll it out yeah that is very

1249
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,199
interesting that has been Syrah

1250
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:00,059
enforcement by the Attorney General when

1251
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:01,349
it comes to that you know just like

1252
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:03,769
there has been Syrah enforcement by

1253
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:05,849
attorney general when it came to all the

1254
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:09,679
medical cannabis collectives or

1255
00:52:05,849 --> 00:52:12,059
cooperatives and they made a switch from

1256
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:14,190
not-for-profit to for-profit entities

1257
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:15,960
and many times did it without taking

1258
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:18,929
about of the membership or following any

1259
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:21,720
of the rules required of cooperatives

1260
00:52:18,929 --> 00:52:24,059
and the Attorney General was absent in

1261
00:52:21,719 --> 00:52:26,039
the enforcement of the law in tirely I

1262
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:28,349
haven't seen any indication that the

1263
00:52:26,039 --> 00:52:29,759
AG's gonna step in and start saying hey

1264
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:31,319
there's you know somebody trying to

1265
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,290
corner the weed market and make a

1266
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:36,809
killing but I'm sure somebody can and

1267
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:40,050
would because cornering the market is as

1268
00:52:36,809 --> 00:52:42,210
old you know it's just like rocket motor

1269
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:46,289
coordination you know one yeah and until

1270
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:49,139
somebody like you know I'm happy that I

1271
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:51,500
think my curse expressly says that there

1272
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:53,429
shall not be restraints on trade and

1273
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:56,010
combinations which tend to diminish

1274
00:52:53,429 --> 00:52:58,289
competition that's really important then

1275
00:52:56,010 --> 00:53:00,510
it's in there in the statute because

1276
00:52:58,289 --> 00:53:01,800
there is a appreciable risk

1277
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:04,050
unfortunately there's nobody in charge

1278
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:05,880
of it I don't see like an enforcement

1279
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:08,670
unit within the bureau cannabis control

1280
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:11,940
focused on antitrust or you know

1281
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:15,000
anti-competitive yes and there probably

1282
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:17,130
is some anti-competitive actions not

1283
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,530
that I'm aware of but there's gotta be

1284
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:24,298
you know it's just a the natural flow of

1285
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:26,759
capitalism when it's completely

1286
00:53:24,298 --> 00:53:28,829
you know unregulated somebody's gotta

1287
00:53:26,759 --> 00:53:30,358
try to take advantage well we all have a

1288
00:53:28,829 --> 00:53:32,939
hustle some of us have a license to

1289
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:35,068
wrestle you know yeah well II and of

1290
00:53:32,938 --> 00:53:37,858
course cannabis it tends to attract

1291
00:53:35,068 --> 00:53:40,608
people with a high risk tolerance and

1292
00:53:37,858 --> 00:53:43,259
who are usually not gonna be like

1293
00:53:40,608 --> 00:53:45,838
scrupulous adherence of regulatory

1294
00:53:43,259 --> 00:53:52,228
regimes and so you know put those

1295
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:54,088
together and the scofflaws some people

1296
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:55,828
call that the black market the free

1297
00:53:54,088 --> 00:53:56,369
peoples market and I like the latter

1298
00:53:55,829 --> 00:53:59,489
better

1299
00:53:56,369 --> 00:54:01,889
it's lazy fair capitalism yes and we had

1300
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:03,898
that with you know prop 215 and Senate

1301
00:54:01,889 --> 00:54:07,169
bill 420 and everything up until my

1302
00:54:03,898 --> 00:54:09,628
first you know people who blame prop 64

1303
00:54:07,168 --> 00:54:12,778
for ruining the party but it was really

1304
00:54:09,628 --> 00:54:15,719
ruined by the legislature and my curse s

1305
00:54:12,778 --> 00:54:17,208
predecessor Merkerson orma merci merci

1306
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:19,739
merci

1307
00:54:17,208 --> 00:54:24,478
that was a boil on your but we couldn't

1308
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:28,048
say that too much how is money being

1309
00:54:24,478 --> 00:54:30,148
moves between operators now I mean de

1310
00:54:28,048 --> 00:54:32,068
facto how's that being done I think a

1311
00:54:30,148 --> 00:54:33,568
lot of it remains cash which is you

1312
00:54:32,068 --> 00:54:35,208
should eventually take it to the tax

1313
00:54:33,568 --> 00:54:37,579
collector you know

1314
00:54:35,208 --> 00:54:39,318
there's some banking I have a few

1315
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:42,009
clients we have like you know these

1316
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:45,619
marijuana banking accounts and they play

1317
00:54:42,009 --> 00:54:47,539
exorbitant fees for but it makes things

1318
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:49,519
a lot easier but that really

1319
00:54:47,539 --> 00:54:52,249
disadvantages the smaller operators I

1320
00:54:49,518 --> 00:54:54,048
don't see a viable banking solution that

1321
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:56,389
is readily available for the smaller

1322
00:54:54,048 --> 00:54:58,699
operators at this juncture usually they

1323
00:54:56,389 --> 00:55:00,949
have to be you know almost big enough to

1324
00:54:58,699 --> 00:55:03,709
own a bank to get a bank account and

1325
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:05,599
regulated cannabis industry well and I

1326
00:55:03,708 --> 00:55:08,268
know you and I believe that we want to

1327
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:12,588
encourage the smaller craft operators

1328
00:55:08,268 --> 00:55:15,258
and the corporate people coming in have

1329
00:55:12,588 --> 00:55:17,239
the better business acumen and the more

1330
00:55:15,259 --> 00:55:18,829
money yeah you know my heart's not

1331
00:55:17,239 --> 00:55:21,409
really into it it's not that I don't

1332
00:55:18,829 --> 00:55:23,449
have clients like that but you they have

1333
00:55:21,409 --> 00:55:25,428
to agree with my ethos in business

1334
00:55:23,449 --> 00:55:28,608
before I take them on as a client sure

1335
00:55:25,429 --> 00:55:31,548
and one of the one of my big issues

1336
00:55:28,608 --> 00:55:34,308
right now is recycling everything out of

1337
00:55:31,548 --> 00:55:37,699
this industry and putting in sustainable

1338
00:55:34,309 --> 00:55:40,669
practices I'm trying to figure out the

1339
00:55:37,699 --> 00:55:43,489
cultivation waste and the minimum

1340
00:55:40,668 --> 00:55:47,629
composted don't just throw it into a

1341
00:55:43,489 --> 00:55:50,329
landfill somewhere but the the biomass

1342
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:55,239
the post extraction biomass is in

1343
00:55:50,329 --> 00:55:57,619
regulatory hell in the public resources

1344
00:55:55,239 --> 00:56:01,999
recycling environment right now what

1345
00:55:57,619 --> 00:56:04,849
happens well the compost it's being

1346
00:56:01,998 --> 00:56:07,248
stacked in warehouses right now because

1347
00:56:04,849 --> 00:56:10,219
it's off gassing that's got if it's a

1348
00:56:07,248 --> 00:56:13,038
volatile extraction it's off gassing and

1349
00:56:10,219 --> 00:56:15,438
the bureau of toxic substance control

1350
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:17,569
did a test where they put fish in a

1351
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:19,068
barrel of water and they put the stuff

1352
00:56:17,568 --> 00:56:21,139
in and it's supposed to test at what

1353
00:56:19,068 --> 00:56:23,288
level to the toxic well apparently they

1354
00:56:21,139 --> 00:56:27,348
suffocated the fish and no oxygen

1355
00:56:23,289 --> 00:56:29,140
basically is toxic okay so now we have

1356
00:56:27,349 --> 00:56:32,239
declarations of at least especially

1357
00:56:29,139 --> 00:56:34,219
handled waste and if it's hazardous it

1358
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:36,590
really gets ugly if it's toxic it's got

1359
00:56:34,219 --> 00:56:41,280
to be trucked to Utah you got

1360
00:56:36,590 --> 00:56:41,610
transportation permit so it hit a brick

1361
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,680
wall

1362
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:46,170
he's like a ticking time bomb for a lot

1363
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:47,369
of these companies well and one of the

1364
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:50,190
discussions we had with the

1365
00:56:47,369 --> 00:56:52,440
environmentalist who are the on the boot

1366
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:55,980
the group was on the ground is they said

1367
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:58,619
go ask him about eucalyptus leaves post

1368
00:56:55,980 --> 00:57:00,240
extraction what do they do with that ice

1369
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:01,980
and she goes just hang on to this

1370
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:05,039
because when they get released stupid

1371
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:07,889
and you go okay but you just dump post

1372
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:09,800
extract a eucalyptus biomass where what

1373
00:57:07,889 --> 00:57:11,699
do you do with it that's some of the

1374
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:14,160
juxtapositions we're gonna have to make

1375
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:17,789
between what they make us do sure and

1376
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:19,559
the other side you don't care or you go

1377
00:57:17,789 --> 00:57:23,329
to Walmart and right there's the liquor

1378
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:28,139
aisle and right there's the kids toys

1379
00:57:23,329 --> 00:57:31,289
the children I'll ask you first what was

1380
00:57:28,139 --> 00:57:34,799
the biggest surprise at 2018 how

1381
00:57:31,289 --> 00:57:40,159
ill-prepared the industry was for phase

1382
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:43,440
2 testing it was a mate it was a major

1383
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:46,289
fail on a lot of businesses that they

1384
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,240
didn't anticipate and the the

1385
00:57:46,289 --> 00:57:50,699
unregulated market was still trying to

1386
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:53,429
push invert product in and move it

1387
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:55,679
through and and they just got caught

1388
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:58,079
with a bunch of product in places where

1389
00:57:55,679 --> 00:58:00,029
now it's worthless in this system and

1390
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:02,369
now you got to sneak it back out and

1391
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:04,019
they expose themselves to problems and I

1392
00:58:02,369 --> 00:58:06,299
thought somebody just was not awake

1393
00:58:04,019 --> 00:58:07,949
thinking about what was going to happen

1394
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:10,110
when you not have to test for all this

1395
00:58:07,949 --> 00:58:11,789
stuff and your products worthless so I

1396
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:12,769
was a bit surprised at how naive they

1397
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:15,719
were

1398
00:58:12,769 --> 00:58:17,369
and okay what were you most surprised

1399
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:20,129
about in 2018

1400
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:21,660
I wasn't expecting all these extinction

1401
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:23,789
events which we might be seeing another

1402
00:58:21,659 --> 00:58:26,759
one you know with phase three testing

1403
00:58:23,789 --> 00:58:30,420
starting January 1st or December 31st

1404
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:32,849
technically but like you said that July

1405
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:36,329
this location of the market was super

1406
00:58:32,849 --> 00:58:40,890
disruptive you know we thought like by

1407
00:58:36,329 --> 00:58:43,079
now by you know what December 15th 2018

1408
00:58:40,889 --> 00:58:45,239
so regulations would have been permanent

1409
00:58:43,079 --> 00:58:47,519
I don't think anybody expected us to be

1410
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:49,769
still operating under emergency

1411
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:52,170
regulations with high uncertainty about

1412
00:58:49,769 --> 00:58:54,809
what the final form of the final

1413
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:57,750
permanent regulations will take it's

1414
00:58:54,809 --> 00:58:59,279
completely indeterminate and this level

1415
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:01,380
of uncertainty it's not something I

1416
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,290
anticipated I thought it would be pretty

1417
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:06,390
figured out by now I also thought that

1418
00:59:04,289 --> 00:59:08,940
track and trace would be in place by now

1419
00:59:06,389 --> 00:59:10,980
and that's just turned out to be like

1420
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:13,588
some sort of bad joke that nobody wants

1421
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:16,559
to think about I you know I don't know

1422
00:59:13,588 --> 00:59:18,389
what accountability needs to be had but

1423
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:21,179
this whole track and trace has been a

1424
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:24,838
complete snafu and needs to be revisited

1425
00:59:21,179 --> 00:59:26,879
because it's obviously not operational

1426
00:59:24,838 --> 00:59:30,259
and we were promised operation ality

1427
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:33,119
like a long time ago so I didn't really

1428
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:34,859
expect that we'd still be operating

1429
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:38,789
under emergency regs and the tracking

1430
00:59:34,858 --> 00:59:41,639
trace would not be operational you know

1431
00:59:38,789 --> 00:59:44,070
I don't see I don't see a cure Marilyn

1432
00:59:41,639 --> 00:59:46,588
went live and it immediately crashed and

1433
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:50,070
Maryland the state is like a corner of

1434
00:59:46,588 --> 00:59:51,329
one part of LA County like you guys are

1435
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:54,059
killing me you're gonna turn it on it's

1436
00:59:51,329 --> 00:59:57,598
gonna crash and now what there's no plan

1437
00:59:54,059 --> 01:00:00,000
B the paper receipts are a recipe for

1438
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:01,740
fraud and apparently there's a bunch of

1439
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,619
techies in the Bay Area who saw this

1440
01:00:01,739 --> 01:00:07,139
crash coming and there is a plan B that

1441
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:09,660
they're waiting for for tracking place

1442
01:00:07,139 --> 01:00:11,789
to flame out it entirely I have some

1443
01:00:09,659 --> 01:00:13,440
some tech geek friends of mine who the

1444
01:00:11,789 --> 01:00:15,389
same thing it's like they see something

1445
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,519
coming we got some plans here yeah

1446
01:00:15,389 --> 01:00:18,750
but I'm so IT challenged like Oh tell me

1447
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:20,670
I went over my head

1448
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:22,349
you know how it works out exactly

1449
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:25,019
hopefully somebody will come up with a

1450
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:28,259
solution because this track and trace is

1451
01:00:25,019 --> 01:00:29,880
just gonna like the I've bigger than a

1452
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:31,590
regulatory burden just like a tech

1453
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:33,450
headache that nobody needs you remember

1454
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:36,539
the DMV system they kept spending

1455
01:00:33,449 --> 01:00:38,129
millions they finally just burned it at

1456
01:00:36,539 --> 01:00:39,900
what point do you burn it and move on

1457
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:41,670
and then who gets sued for incompetence

1458
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:43,590
for letting them get a contract for this

1459
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:47,159
I don't know it's government procurement

1460
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:49,710
right yes giraffe was started out as a

1461
01:00:47,159 --> 01:00:52,409
horse and sent to the legislature right

1462
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:57,630
so I guess let me ask you what

1463
01:00:52,409 --> 01:01:00,059
predictions will you make for 2019 that

1464
01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:03,390
people who are not willing to accept

1465
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:06,599
that this system exists are going to die

1466
01:01:03,389 --> 01:01:11,099
yeah you keep asking why just go find

1467
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:14,250
another job yeah so and if you really

1468
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:17,130
get the program like George Carlin said

1469
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:18,960
you'd be suddenly just taking notes how

1470
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:19,619
crazy yeah it's really crazy but you

1471
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,309
didn't do it right

1472
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:26,190
we lost 60% of our cultivators because

1473
01:01:23,309 --> 01:01:28,380
they couldn't finish the loop up they

1474
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:31,530
started temporary and just threw their

1475
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:33,690
hands up so we don't have enough of the

1476
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:36,210
market that's got to rebuild itself and

1477
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:38,369
the people who are just not going to get

1478
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:39,449
it are gonna die they're circling the

1479
01:01:38,369 --> 01:01:41,880
drain they don't know it they're

1480
01:01:39,449 --> 01:01:43,500
circling the drain right now like in the

1481
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:46,800
regulated market you mean yeah yeah oh

1482
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:48,980
yeah this is not a game yeah you got to

1483
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:51,560
play by the rules

1484
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:54,050
oh no that's not going away the black

1485
01:01:51,559 --> 01:01:56,929
market black market is still strong and

1486
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:58,339
independent in parallel but yeah we're

1487
01:01:56,929 --> 01:02:00,409
talking about the regulated market he's

1488
01:01:58,338 --> 01:02:02,088
talking about like a lot of the I don't

1489
01:02:00,409 --> 01:02:04,909
know the operators who are just kind of

1490
01:02:02,088 --> 01:02:06,500
like they're they they'd still think

1491
01:02:04,909 --> 01:02:08,838
they can thread water is going to be

1492
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:10,309
okay no you're gonna sink and die you

1493
01:02:08,838 --> 01:02:11,088
better hire people that know what

1494
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,920
they're doing

1495
01:02:11,088 --> 01:02:14,900
and you go in your lane grow good pot

1496
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:16,760
let somebody run the business good a

1497
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:18,980
compliance person quality control

1498
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:22,960
Quality Assurance has to be there or

1499
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:25,608
you're just being stupid that's stupid

1500
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,829
some people aren't educated well it's

1501
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:29,420
just it's like okay then you know what

1502
01:02:27,829 --> 01:02:31,180
meas your lawyer I'm firing myself

1503
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:33,650
goodbye you're not listening

1504
01:02:31,179 --> 01:02:34,699
so I guess my prediction would be

1505
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:36,320
there's probably gonna be increased

1506
01:02:34,699 --> 01:02:38,629
enforcement after the collective and

1507
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:41,660
cooperative defense expires January 9th

1508
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:43,309
and we'll see like I don't know what you

1509
01:02:41,659 --> 01:02:44,868
know type of enforcement we'll see maybe

1510
01:02:43,309 --> 01:02:45,710
all the unlicensed feed Maps

1511
01:02:44,869 --> 01:02:47,750
dispensaries

1512
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:50,210
maybe we maps itself will become subject

1513
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:52,280
to enforcement i I've had an ongoing

1514
01:02:50,210 --> 01:02:54,800
discussion about that because of my

1515
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:57,829
experience that aiding abetting and

1516
01:02:54,800 --> 01:03:00,920
conspiracy to violate the federal law is

1517
01:02:57,829 --> 01:03:03,950
a real thing when you have unlicensed

1518
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:04,849
outside our federal protection firm

1519
01:03:03,949 --> 01:03:07,098
Rohrabacher

1520
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:09,140
you're playing some games here and

1521
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:12,260
there's people watching yeah and they

1522
01:03:09,139 --> 01:03:13,670
they were poking Laurie you can't do

1523
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:15,680
anything to me I've represent enough

1524
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:19,789
cops to know that I didn't get you today

1525
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:21,769
but I know who you are I think that

1526
01:03:19,789 --> 01:03:24,559
kinda explains 503 to they said there's

1527
01:03:21,769 --> 01:03:26,150
a lot of well-known unlicensed batteries

1528
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:28,068
yeah there's another one that was

1529
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:29,960
playing fast and loose where's that

1530
01:03:28,068 --> 01:03:32,059
platform everybody knew what they were

1531
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:34,159
doing there was pictures I was looking

1532
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:37,299
at yes you are delivering and you got

1533
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:39,379
stock in your warehouse so stop it I

1534
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:42,109
always found that finally kind of

1535
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:44,180
announcing prejudice when I would hear

1536
01:03:42,108 --> 01:03:46,098
like you know these tech companies say

1537
01:03:44,179 --> 01:03:48,068
we're a tech platform I'm like really I

1538
01:03:46,099 --> 01:03:51,109
never I was never taught about that in

1539
01:03:48,068 --> 01:03:53,190
law school the tech platform exception

1540
01:03:51,108 --> 01:03:54,989
to every law

1541
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:57,088
yeah don't you know it's in the

1542
01:03:54,989 --> 01:03:59,848
universal convention at The Hague don't

1543
01:03:57,088 --> 01:04:04,409
you no but see people that are that's

1544
01:03:59,849 --> 01:04:06,240
naive or they're there dude my other

1545
01:04:04,409 --> 01:04:08,670
prediction will be like for cannabis

1546
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:11,098
events now with a B 2020 coming in

1547
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:13,139
they're not gonna be justice Fairgrounds

1548
01:04:11,099 --> 01:04:15,088
you know the weird guys see big events

1549
01:04:13,139 --> 01:04:17,308
probably at first but eventually they're

1550
01:04:15,088 --> 01:04:19,798
gonna be medium-sized and smaller events

1551
01:04:17,309 --> 01:04:21,569
and these these are no longer prop 215

1552
01:04:19,798 --> 01:04:24,630
areas these are just like straight-up

1553
01:04:21,568 --> 01:04:26,818
adult eats and consumption and sales we

1554
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:29,280
used to have to sneak our pot into

1555
01:04:26,818 --> 01:04:31,829
concerts you can buy liquor there okay

1556
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:33,480
my kids play in bands and my nephew does

1557
01:04:31,829 --> 01:04:35,400
too it's like you need a venue you can

1558
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:37,048
go there and really let them sneak their

1559
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:39,240
whiskey in but let them get their

1560
01:04:37,048 --> 01:04:41,969
cannabis and consume it and let's let's

1561
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:44,669
open some concerts back up or we can

1562
01:04:41,969 --> 01:04:47,399
they don't have to be Woodstock but

1563
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:49,889
small to medium venues can put on decent

1564
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:52,829
music events have cannabis consumption

1565
01:04:49,889 --> 01:04:54,269
or deliver it there so you follow all

1566
01:04:52,829 --> 01:04:56,670
the directions give them a place to do

1567
01:04:54,269 --> 01:04:58,559
it he'll have a sports bar or something

1568
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:59,608
if you can't make money it's like if the

1569
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:01,410
government can't make money to

1570
01:04:59,608 --> 01:05:03,480
whorehouse you got no business doing it

1571
01:05:01,409 --> 01:05:06,538
you can do this because people want

1572
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:08,639
cannabis they can consume where they go

1573
01:05:06,539 --> 01:05:12,329
it just sounds like booze I mean like

1574
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:13,629
the way the event breaks read like

1575
01:05:12,329 --> 01:05:15,360
temporary

1576
01:05:13,630 --> 01:05:17,369
[Music]

1577
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:20,579
for these temporary cannabis events the

1578
01:05:17,369 --> 01:05:21,869
delivery only retailers can also retail

1579
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:23,849
that event so if you had a delivery

1580
01:05:21,869 --> 01:05:26,039
service you can be selling set up a

1581
01:05:23,849 --> 01:05:28,049
booth at an abandoned course get an

1582
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:29,759
organizer license and set up your own

1583
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:33,030
event and then direct-to-consumer

1584
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:34,680
retailing without having to get one of

1585
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:38,550
those super expensive storefront

1586
01:05:34,679 --> 01:05:41,069
dispensary licenses I we tried to rent a

1587
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:45,180
hall to put on an event and for 50 bucks

1588
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:47,250
I could get a liquor license I could get

1589
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:49,049
a liquor license for fifty dollars

1590
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:51,960
there's like 80 different types you can

1591
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:53,820
get but oh the children we can't let you

1592
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:56,460
have this so eventually they'll catch up

1593
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:59,088
with the reality what people want to do

1594
01:05:56,460 --> 01:06:01,150
but today today

1595
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:01,150
