00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,359
park in uh medford here i think it's a

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,560
yeah i can hear you just fine

7
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:19,358
great great happy season it sounds like

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:22,559
you've been super busy on your farm

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,000
yes indeed definitely have yeah we uh

10
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:26,239
we just got a bunch of hemp in the

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,518
ground about five acres of hemp

12
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:30,159
so it's uh been really really busy time

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:31,839
of year

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,359
uh we've been working on the drip line

15
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,960
trying to get that in

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,039
fortunately we were blessed with some

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,759
rain some unexpected rain so

18
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,640
that that was really a blessing and

19
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,119
really a

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,719
savior really because uh we're a little

21
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:48,878
bit behind on getting our drip

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,879
lines in um you know this is uh

23
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,198
some of the bigger acreage farms that

24
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,519
i've worked on so it's

25
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:56,640
things that would be a small task on a

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,800
smaller farm

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,239
become a giant task you know when you

28
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,718
scale it up

29
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,478
yes yeah so it's new to you to do this

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,000
acreage and it's also new to you to

31
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:09,359
scale up on uh

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,359
korean natural farming right yeah levels

33
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:13,599
so lots of that

34
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,519
definitely yeah and so that's that's

35
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:18,798
what i wanted to talk about today

36
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:22,158
uh was really the last two years of

37
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,799
my trials with k f and jadam more

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,000
you know on a larger scale working with

39
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,520
commercial cannabis

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,040
and hemp farms perfect

41
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,719
yeah because everyone i think that's

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,479
like that's a very

43
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,920
prevalent question is how you know it's

44
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:38,478
great this is great and all but how do

45
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,680
you scale up how you scale up and

46
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,399
right here's the system absolutely yeah

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,320
it's very

48
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,000
uh i've learned that it's a very

49
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,839
systematic approach you know it doesn't

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,640
make sense to

51
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,439
pick dandelions on your your lawn if you

52
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,560
have

53
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:57,118
you know several acres to work on so

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,200
so really for me it's come down to only

55
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,319
a few herbs that i'm working with

56
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,478
on you know five acres of hemp

57
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,839
um you know because i'm very sensitive

58
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,239
also to

59
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,399
uh the wild crafting techniques we use

60
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,640
uh being sustainable

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,080
with our wild crafting practices you

62
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,799
know having a reverence for

63
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,800
for the wild places to truly be

64
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,599
regenerative we need to be

65
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,239
uh sustainable and careful about the way

66
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,199
that we're

67
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,200
we're approaching nature and and in

68
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,839
harvesting

69
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:31,518
absolutely and so yeah definitely we're

70
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,400
going to talk about that and maybe as an

71
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,039
intro

72
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,039
to people who who may not know about you

73
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,799
um i'm fascinated and feel

74
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:42,639
sort of in alignment with you that you

75
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,719
just got a host of different kinds of um

76
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,399
trainings and knowledge going for you

77
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:49,519
you're an herbalist you practice

78
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,319
alchemy your permaculture is correct

79
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,400
and then you add korean natural farming

80
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:55,679
to the to the mix so can you just go

81
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,840
briefly into a little bit of your

82
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,439
history and what brought you

83
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,840
to this place sure yeah uh

84
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,199
you know in the past life i guess you

85
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,680
could say i was an architectural

86
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:10,560
draftsman working in a desk job

87
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,159
uh and did that for over a decade and in

88
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,280
2009

89
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,399
the economy collapsed i found myself out

90
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,959
of work

91
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,800
and kind of wondering well what's next i

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,200
i kind of had the american dream owned a

93
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,080
house

94
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,560
on a nice car all the things kind of did

95
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,640
what

96
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,878
i thought it was supposed to do and it

97
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,359
collapsed and so

98
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:32,560
uh that set me on a whole new kind of

99
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,280
course in life

100
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,039
um i was living in salt lake city utah

101
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,680
at the time so

102
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:41,519
i bought a sleeping bag and tent with my

103
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,799
last paycheck and kind of was

104
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,480
hiking around through the foothills and

105
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,840
camping and learned about you know

106
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:50,719
nettle and and

107
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,719
nettles and uh elderberries and and

108
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:56,400
found that i could sustain off of

109
00:03:52,719 --> 00:04:00,719
these plants alone uh and from there

110
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,120
um you know

111
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,039
i'll just shorten this story but i ended

112
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,599
up in japan i had a japanese girlfriend

113
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,239
at the time

114
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,199
so i moved to japan and the first day i

115
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,640
got there

116
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:15,199
was a day that the tsunami happened so

117
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,919
yeah that was my entrance into living in

118
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,199
japan

119
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,798
and uh dealing with uh natural disaster

120
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,560
and a lot of

121
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:26,159
um instability in in city life so

122
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,478
so what it really did for me was

123
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,160
catalyze um

124
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,758
thinking about like living more

125
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,320
sustainably and how

126
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,360
in society maybe we're not doing the

127
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,240
best job of that

128
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,879
so from japan when i went back to the

129
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,040
states

130
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,000
i had an opportunity to move to humboldt

131
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,240
county

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,519
my sister had been living there for like

133
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,560
20 years

134
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,478
her and her partner and so

135
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,120
i went out to humboldt county from there

136
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:57,120
i had the opportunity to work on

137
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,000
many cannabis farms and medical cannabis

138
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,959
farms

139
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,439
living off the grid um a year of that

140
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,000
time

141
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,279
i i spent living in a in a tent in the

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,120
lost coast

143
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:11,279
really uh isolated from um

144
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,720
a lot of civilization and people and and

145
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,839
just kind of

146
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,600
got to spend time uh you know communing

147
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,799
with the forest and learning about the

148
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,240
plants

149
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,319
and um then i got into some

150
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,319
so really that's what drove me into you

151
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,719
know permaculture ideals

152
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,159
which led me into finding about korean

153
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,520
natural farming

154
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,520
uh and

155
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:37,439
so so yeah i owe a lot to to humboldt

156
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,919
county for

157
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,959
for taking me in and and really teaching

158
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:46,079
me sustainability and regenerative

159
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,839
farming and and so from there i was kind

160
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,599
of offered work

161
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:54,319
in southern oregon for some bigger farms

162
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,879
doing this uh commercially i was offered

163
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,478
a gig

164
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,319
a couple years ago uh

165
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,399
with a company to come out and show them

166
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,240
how to do korean natural farming on a

167
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,959
large scale which was very

168
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,160
attractive to me because i had done it

169
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,799
on

170
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,960
smaller scales even indoors and and seen

171
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,038
a lot of really great results with it

172
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,279
but this was this was an opportunity for

173
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,599
me to um

174
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,359
to scale this up and and show that it

175
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,639
that it worked on a large scale

176
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,520
uh which i did and um really

177
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,400
you know ever since i found k f i've

178
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,519
never gone

179
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,079
back to right other styles of farming

180
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,198
yeah

181
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:37,359
yeah yeah and so you were were you able

182
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,280
to find results from that first year of

183
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,800
scaling up like right away that first

184
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,519
year was it

185
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,560
yes yeah definitely so so the farm that

186
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:48,000
i got to

187
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,680
uh in oregon it was a two tier two

188
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,199
grows so it was about it was about

189
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,918
two and a half acres uh of cannabis

190
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,960
and when i got there you know there's a

191
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,478
lot of clay

192
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:05,839
soil in southern oregon um a lot of

193
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:07,038
volcanic pumice and clay and when i got

194
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,519
there

195
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:10,560
the soil was horrible it was i wouldn't

196
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,598
even call it soil

197
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,280
really it was uh

198
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:18,719
it was clay it looked like the desert

199
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:21,439
you know cracks in the desert

200
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,400
yeah exactly you know very hydrophobic

201
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:25,759
no life in the

202
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:27,679
no life in the soil no worms no nothing

203
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,919
no topsoil really and so

204
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,680
the first thing i did was i came in and

205
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:34,959
i i did a heavy mulch

206
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,840
and i did a very heavy application

207
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,038
of jms jadon microbial solution

208
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,318
alternated that with

209
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,038
lactic acid bacteria and over the course

210
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,520
of uh

211
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,478
three months the winter time the wet

212
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,598
months

213
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,719
totally transformed the soil there from

214
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:54,240
being hard clay

215
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,360
hydrophobic holding no water to

216
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,160
really beautiful soil that you know was

217
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,199
holding water

218
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,160
that had life in it that had worms

219
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,038
so i was really size of that application

220
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,039
did you uh

221
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,560
so the mulch larry did you was it like

222
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,759
how deep did you go on that

223
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,079
that first year uh not not too terribly

224
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:17,520
deep we just did a a straw layer

225
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:20,240
and you know only only about

226
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,799
a half inch of straw i'd say across the

227
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,759
top

228
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,879
yeah okay and uh we were blessed with uh

229
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,639
a lot of rains

230
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,560
and so basically uh i would alternate

231
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,158
one week i would do jms general

232
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,158
microbial solution

233
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,360
uh the next week i would do lactic acid

234
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:39,038
bacteria

235
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,399
and between these three foliar foliars

236
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:44,158
uh well yeah i mean i was i was drenched

237
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,639
i'm not followers drenching i'm sorry

238
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,080
yeah yeah that's all right uh yeah so i

239
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,519
was soil drenching

240
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,639
and uh and yeah it was amazing to me to

241
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,240
see how

242
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,679
just in three months you could really

243
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,720
transform

244
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:00,079
uh clay hard you know cracked

245
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,759
hydrophobic

246
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:07,839
soil into really beautiful uh living

247
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,399
soil yeah so we did yeah and so we saw a

248
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,519
huge

249
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,799
transformation in uh you know the

250
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:18,480
the the health of the plants uh

251
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:20,319
was really really amazing very cool

252
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,159
all right so that that kind of so then

253
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,920
how did you get into your situation

254
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:25,600
now and what are you yeah we can launch

255
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,240
into what you're wanting

256
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,278
to share comes great great like doing

257
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,839
now

258
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:34,480
yeah so so i'm i'm primarily working

259
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,680
with uh hemp now but i also grow

260
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,278
um you know i'm an herbalist and i

261
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,879
and i grow a lot of perennial herbs

262
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,159
annual herbs and work with a lot of

263
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,240
different herbs so

264
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,519
i have a passion for growing herbs and

265
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,720
veggies as well but

266
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:52,159
primarily uh i'm i'm working

267
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,000
full-time on on two hemp farms

268
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,240
at the moment and consulting on some

269
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,360
other hemp farms up in bend in in

270
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,720
around oregon um

271
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,079
so stepping back to the story where i

272
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,040
came out to oregon to work for this

273
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:08,000
company i

274
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,519
at one point the company got absorbed by

275
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,320
a larger company

276
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,879
and i had some ethical dilemmas with

277
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,519
with that

278
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,360
and teaching korean natural farming to

279
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,519
these big scale companies so

280
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,480
i was fortunate i left that company and

281
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,519
now i'm working with uh some smaller

282
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,000
uh my partners um on some smaller you

283
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,639
know hemp projects so

284
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,120
hemp is primarily my focus and that's

285
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,319
what i'm

286
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,919
using the jadom k f practices on really

287
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,959
right now

288
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:41,278
right um yeah

289
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,639
so are you finding that the ups like

290
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:46,399
scaling up

291
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:49,919
has okay how do i ask this is it like

292
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,958
is the sweet spot of application applied

293
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:55,120
large scale seem to be in is there is

294
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:58,879
there a range between

295
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,278
like three to five acres or

296
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,159
you know does it where does it change

297
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,039
where where

298
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:07,199
does the scale-ups seem to shift from

299
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:10,159
maybe not so sustainable to

300
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,278
uh ideal is have your are you know sweet

301
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,958
spot

302
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:16,000
yeah that's a great question well i

303
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:19,359
would say yeah once you get into

304
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
uh above a couple of acres you know when

305
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,159
you're doing

306
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,360
five to ten acres things really start to

307
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,838
change

308
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,639
so uh you know for me i could i can make

309
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,480
inputs

310
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,240
for the most part to be able to cover

311
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,759
that but what gets tricky

312
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,560
is is finding say like uh

313
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,480
you know herbs plants to do fermented

314
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,000
plant juices doing like a totally

315
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,360
traditional style

316
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,078
korean nacho farming approach um

317
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,680
you know so i would say yeah above that

318
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,359
two acreage

319
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,120
once you get up into like you know five

320
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,519
to ten and above that

321
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,679
things really start to change and it's

322
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:02,639
like so where do you find

323
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:06,319
enough um you know plant tops

324
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:09,200
to to make fpjs for that kind of scale

325
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,000
um and so for me it's really narrowed

326
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,360
down to really

327
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
only a few herbs that i'll work with

328
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,039
and and so the thinking that i really

329
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,919
use

330
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,879
uh these days uh i was really inspired

331
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:24,159
by

332
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:27,200
a workshop i went to with um

333
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:30,399
master cho and yang sancho uh

334
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,360
jadam out in williams oregon they came

335
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,480
last year

336
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,519
and so

337
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,200
this idea of growing your own fertilizer

338
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,720
like taking taking a part of your crop

339
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,959
and so thinking ahead of time and

340
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,720
thinking like okay i'm actually growing

341
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:51,278
a percentage of my crop for fertilizer

342
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,959
so that's something that really i took

343
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:56,480
to heart last year

344
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:58,879
and i was so inspired by that idea that

345
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,000
you know we had four greenhouses that

346
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:03,039
were 100 by

347
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,039
30 full of hemp and i convinced my

348
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,879
partners it wasn't easy but

349
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,399
i convinced them to chop down a whole

350
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,519
greenhouse

351
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:15,440
because we could we had time to replant

352
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:18,480
and we used uh all that biomass to make

353
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,680
uh fpga fermented plant juices and

354
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,000
jadam liquid fertilizers from one

355
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:27,199
quarter of the hemp that we were growing

356
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,679
wow yeah so i was really inspired by

357
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,240
that

358
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,278
and so the theory there being that you

359
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,919
know

360
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,879
if we look at nutrient cycling in nature

361
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,958
and how

362
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,759
you know leaves are defoliating dropping

363
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,679
their leaves and creating a mulch layer

364
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,919
and that is creating a protective zone

365
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,039
for all these indigenous microorganisms

366
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,360
to thrive

367
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,599
and start breaking that down and then

368
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,320
nutrient cycling that back to the plant

369
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,360
so

370
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,560
it's really the same idea uh we are

371
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:00,320
using that plant because it is uh

372
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:01,838
in turn the best analog for that plant

373
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,480
uh and i had a moment where i was

374
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:08,000
sitting with with uh master cho

375
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:12,079
and uh we were on a a farm

376
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,159
i'll just call it a tomato farm uh

377
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:15,359
so i'm sitting with master cho and i

378
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,439
asked him you know they were growing

379
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,480
some dynamic accumulators such as

380
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,760
comfrey

381
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,800
and some other herbs and i i asked him i

382
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,759
said so

383
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,479
master cho would you in this situation

384
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,439
here

385
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,199
would you harvest this comfrey this

386
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,120
great dynamic accumulator

387
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,039
to make fertilizer out of or would you

388
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,519
use the plant being grown here and he

389
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,719
said oh

390
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,000
always use a plant you're growing if if

391
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,720
possible

392
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,559
you know so that makes sense all the

393
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,600
ratios are there

394
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:51,439
yeah exactly so it's a perfect analog

395
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,480
for itself you know yeah so i really

396
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,040
took that to heart

397
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,680
and so now i put a lot of thought ahead

398
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,958
of time

399
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:01,278
as as far as like trying to grow my own

400
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,599
fertilizer so before we even have to go

401
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,639
out

402
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,959
into nature to wildcraft

403
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,480
we can be thinking about okay i can grow

404
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:12,319
a certain percentage of my own

405
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,079
fertilizers here yeah yeah so you so you

406
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,000
said you thought were able to harvest

407
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:19,039
that in time for a second heart

408
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,720
for a second planting was there at

409
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,559
so you must so they must have been

410
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,000
fairly young plants and then did you

411
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,838
take the whole plant

412
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,198
or did you just take the tips for the

413
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,880
for the uh

414
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,719
fermented plant juice and then use the

415
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,799
rest as a jlf

416
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,440
is how did you what was the process for

417
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:38,799
that yeah so we did both actually

418
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,759
uh the plants did get to be about oh

419
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,679
you know about three feet tall so we we

420
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,320
planted pretty early in the season

421
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:46,719
and you know we still had enough time

422
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,600
that

423
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,480
we could put in some plants some starts

424
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,360
we had

425
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,399
uh and still get a good yield off that

426
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,759
second

427
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:00,720
round yeah so

428
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,519
we we harvested that one full greenhouse

429
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,240
of hemp

430
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,639
i did go in and i made um fermented

431
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,278
plant juices with all the growth tips

432
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,079
and then i took the rest of it including

433
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:13,439
the roots

434
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:16,479
the whole plant chopped it all down into

435
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,440
ibc totes uh and made a liquid

436
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,278
fertilizer

437
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,440
liquid fertilizer out of the rest of it

438
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,679
so none of that hemp was

439
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,360
wasted whatsoever we used all of it the

440
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,679
roots everything

441
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,839
beautiful yeah and then we're able to

442
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,519
apply the jlf same season or is that

443
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,120
something that you would carry like

444
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,879
would you carry that into the second

445
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,360
season yeah

446
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,078
yeah that's a good question so uh i

447
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,199
found you know

448
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:44,000
working with different plants making uh

449
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,359
jadom liquid fertilizers you know

450
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,240
certain plants will break down

451
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,079
faster and so you know hemp and cannabis

452
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,759
takes a bit more time

453
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:57,120
uh i did end up using some of it

454
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,278
towards towards the end and

455
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,198
this year we're using some of that

456
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:05,199
fertilizer from last year too

457
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:08,639
so i gave it i gave it about you know

458
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:12,880
five weeks to really break down uh

459
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:14,480
and then started using that so

460
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,480
you know different herbs though will

461
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,199
break down much quicker

462
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,120
in a genome liquid fertilizer plants

463
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,880
like uh this for instance

464
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:28,399
per slain here what is that

465
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,840
oh yeah purslane yeah

466
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,640
so purse lane is an all-star

467
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:36,720
this is one of the top recommended herbs

468
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,360
that master cho talks about

469
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,200
for making fermented plant juices it's a

470
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:44,879
dynamic accumulator

471
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,679
and it also has it also has

472
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,720
alkaloids that enhance the color and

473
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,080
flavor

474
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,120
um of of your crop so

475
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:57,839
the cool thing about purslane is when

476
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:01,678
you do a liquid fertilizer with purslane

477
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:04,639
it will break down in liquid in 10 days

478
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,600
so that's pretty awesome like you have

479
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,720
this will fully

480
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,918
liquefy and turn into a liquid ferment

481
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,000
in 10 days time

482
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,080
when you put that in water with you know

483
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
a handful of leaf mold and inoculant in

484
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,639
there some imo

485
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,720
you can break that down into a really

486
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,120
great fertilizer

487
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,798
another one i'd like to mention uh so

488
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,479
these are some of the herbs that that i

489
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,558
am using on a large scale

490
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,679
because they're abundant and they're

491
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,720
very

492
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:35,200
nutrient dense so another one

493
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,360
in that category i'd like to mention is

494
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,480
skunk cabbage

495
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:42,079
and i found a ton of skunk cabbage here

496
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,120
in certain areas

497
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:48,240
and it also uh it has

498
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,599
has some great terpenes in it and

499
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,000
you know so really what we're looking

500
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:55,439
for as you all know tina is like

501
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,319
we're looking for like those plants that

502
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,120
that are like vigorous growers that kind

503
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,000
of dominate

504
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,879
the landscape uh those are generally

505
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,759
what we

506
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,640
look for when when we're making fpgas

507
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,319
and so

508
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,759
to me skunk cabbage is a perfect example

509
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:17,038
of an fpga plant because it's just huge

510
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:20,319
vigorous large plant and

511
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:23,200
so it's it's basically

512
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,798
showing us that it is packed full of

513
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,440
growth hormones

514
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,240
um so that's really what we're looking

515
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,640
for

516
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,079
when we're looking for the fpgas and

517
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,080
like the purslane

518
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,439
in a liquid ferment that skunk cabbage

519
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,960
will break down

520
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,440
uh in less than two weeks it's

521
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,200
completely liquefied

522
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:46,720
completely micronized ready to use

523
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,798
beautiful okay

524
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,240
what are you using in ratio are you

525
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:54,079
using it like how are you using the jlf

526
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,160
yeah good question so this kind of gets

527
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:59,759
into um

528
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,480
how i'm intermixing um jadom

529
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:04,400
and korean nacho farming because for me

530
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,159
i found it really hard to make enough

531
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,919
fpjs to really do kind of the

532
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,760
traditional approach to korean nacho

533
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,799
farming so what i'm doing

534
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,759
is i'm alternating in genome liquid

535
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:19,200
fertilizers

536
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,798
in place of fermented plant uses i still

537
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,080
use fermented plant juices

538
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:27,759
but i'm also alternating in the uh

539
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:31,038
the liquid fertilizers and so you know

540
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:34,558
and in jadam they kind of give a broad

541
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:35,759
spectrum of application for the liquid

542
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:38,000
fertilizers like

543
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,400
i was reading this morning you know

544
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,079
anywhere from 20 to

545
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,440
300 dilution ratio uh for like per slain

546
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:49,199
so what i've been doing is

547
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,759
i usually do about one to a hundred

548
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,519
so i'll do that in place of a fermented

549
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,119
plant juice if i don't have a fermented

550
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,440
plant juice on hand

551
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,359
um are you using it in concert with the

552
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,840
ohns and all that are you using it

553
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:03,599
strictly oh

554
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:07,439
okay you're subbing it in

555
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:10,959
yeah subbing it in yeah so

556
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,640
uh i i have also done just strictly jlf

557
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,200
applications as well

558
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,759
um but yeah lately i've been subbing it

559
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,440
in for fpjs when i don't have

560
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:24,798
fpga on hand so um

561
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,759
a few advantages too of the the liquid

562
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:29,279
fertilizers

563
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:31,679
is that you know well first of all you

564
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:35,200
don't have to buy a bunch of sugar

565
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,280
and secondly you know you can

566
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,640
you don't you don't have to just use the

567
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,839
growth tips

568
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,600
you know like we do in um fermented

569
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,639
plant juices you can really use a whole

570
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,678
plant

571
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:51,280
uh i will actually do different blends

572
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,280
for different stages of the plant growth

573
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,480
so i have like a flowering blend that

574
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:58,000
i'll use

575
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:01,440
um and so that one

576
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,519
uh i i'll just tell you what i i

577
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,880
use what's showing up for me here in

578
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:08,639
southern oregon

579
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:12,000
um so i'll do a jadom liquid fertilizer

580
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:15,759
and this is uh what i would do for say a

581
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,240
flowering uh ferment here um

582
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,720
so wild carrot queen anne's lace this is

583
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,919
in flower right now

584
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:27,038
um really has some nice volatile

585
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:30,240
uh compounds going on um

586
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:31,839
also teasel teasel shows up everywhere

587
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,679
really vigorous grower

588
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,038
been using a lot of teasel in my liquid

589
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,880
ferments

590
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:40,720
um chicory chicory was brought here from

591
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,440
europe uh

592
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,440
as a cattle feed it's really it's a

593
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,720
great dynamic accumulator

594
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,360
high in a lot of elements and minerals

595
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,880
really love to to use chicory in in

596
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:56,719
liquid ferments

597
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:59,039
as well and let's see

598
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,038
um

599
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,759
yeah so that's generally what what kind

600
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,399
of shows up in and around the farm

601
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:08,000
that i'm sourcing that's that's abundant

602
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,360
you know so i'm not

603
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,200
going out you know taking

604
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,359
say i have like a hedge and nettle in

605
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,360
the corner of my my farm i'm not

606
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:18,639
going there and totally you know

607
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:20,879
desecrating that whole

608
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,120
stand so that it's not going to grow

609
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,919
back next year i'm really looking for

610
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,119
um well i should mention blackberry too

611
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,919
you know blackberry

612
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,959
is is one of the invasives that really

613
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,080
shows up

614
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,279
um in the pacific northwest and in many

615
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,000
other places

616
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,480
there's no shortage of it and it's it's

617
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,240
packed full of growth hormones enzymes

618
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,440
all that good stuff

619
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,440
so let's see

620
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,798
are you harvesting it through its cycle

621
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,120
like getting its that's

622
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:53,359
its new growth and then and then later

623
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:57,359
like are you doing different stages of

624
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:59,678
um harvesting yes plant

625
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,558
yeah definitely so with blackberry for

626
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,679
instance

627
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:06,720
i'll uh do an initial harvest

628
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,919
when you know early spring when you're

629
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,558
just seeing those

630
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,038
new growth tips coming off the plant

631
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,879
yeah

632
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:18,319
oh yeah i'll harvest that for a

633
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,720
vegetative uh fpga

634
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:21,839
and then i'll wait for the blackberry to

635
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,919
go into

636
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,918
to bud when it gets those nice white

637
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,559
buds we're just kind of past that stage

638
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,120
here

639
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:30,480
in southern oregon and it's um they went

640
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,798
to flower now

641
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,640
but that but that budding stage the

642
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,119
butting and right at that

643
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,200
like right that that vigorous like just

644
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:42,639
ready to pop kind of thing is that yeah

645
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,558
yeah exactly yeah so i would harvest

646
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,720
at that stage for that transitional

647
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,000
stage you know when our plants

648
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,759
yeah so when our plants are

649
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,960
transitioning from

650
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,919
vegetative to now flower they're going

651
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,679
through that process

652
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,360
and so that's when i would harvest the

653
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,720
blackberry buds

654
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:03,038
to uh to give some of those transitional

655
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,759
hormones and enzymes and all that stuff

656
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:06,000
so then

657
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:07,759
the final stage of the blackberry would

658
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,079
be harvesting the fruit

659
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,960
which you could use in a fermented fruit

660
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:12,839
juice for

661
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,278
you know the later stages of plant

662
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:17,839
growth now are you

663
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:18,960
so whether you know i when are you when

664
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:20,639
are you using your

665
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,360
this is an aside but what are you using

666
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,520
your um fermented fruit juices

667
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,399
like i'm i'm not using them until super

668
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,918
late and

669
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:33,440
yes curious if i shouldn't right okay so

670
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,240
yeah yeah okay yeah um yeah absolutely

671
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,919
that's the same

672
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:41,599
that i use them only uh

673
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:45,600
you know about the last month

674
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:46,879
of growth for for uh cannabis and hemp

675
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,278
is when i'm using them

676
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,640
definitely yeah just only for the real

677
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:54,319
the real finishing

678
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:58,080
um you know the the flavor enhancing

679
00:25:54,319 --> 00:26:01,038
and all that good sugar you know

680
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:03,678
giving that to the plants um so yeah

681
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,759
really only in the last stages there

682
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,519
now are you using soil drenches all the

683
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,440
way through on a large scale or are you

684
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,000
doing any kind of foliars like when do

685
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,440
you do

686
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,880
that when do you transition and all that

687
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:20,000
you know i i primarily uh i found that

688
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:23,760
doing foliars this is another way of

689
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,839
kind of scaling up we're pretty lucky we

690
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,440
just got some fancy equipment so we got

691
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:30,000
this like orchard tractor

692
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,440
that's only like you know four feet wide

693
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,839
that has

694
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,798
sprayers like that go up to about seven

695
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:36,879
feet high

696
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:38,079
and they have three sprayers we just got

697
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,400
this i'm super stoked

698
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,278
this will be congratulations thank you

699
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,400
yeah

700
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:45,759
really stoked to use this it's um it'll

701
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,640
be nice to kind of like

702
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:50,319
get through the rows it's it's you know

703
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,480
it's good because

704
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,599
you can get through really tight spaces

705
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,240
in in your rows

706
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:58,000
and so for for hemp fields you can kind

707
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,960
of get in there and we so we'll plant

708
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,759
you know three rows and then we'll have

709
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,480
basically

710
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,359
a five foot road for our tractor to get

711
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,480
through

712
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:11,278
uh that has our sprayers on it uh

713
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,278
this is brand new so um i'm really

714
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:16,798
excited to be using that for our k

715
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:18,720
f and jadon full ears but generally what

716
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,158
i do is i use like an atomizer or

717
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,558
backpack sprayer

718
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,960
and i have been doing a lot of foliars

719
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:28,558
that way in like our greenhouses

720
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,319
um so i do drenches but

721
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:31,678
you're going to use a lot more inputs

722
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:34,398
that way as well

723
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,440
so you know another a way to kind of

724
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:37,599
scale up

725
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,519
and conserve some of your inputs and

726
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:42,000
make them go a little further i found is

727
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,119
is through foliar sprays and do you

728
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,720
carry your foliars

729
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,199
all the way through bloom or is there a

730
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,240
point when you don't

731
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,480
yeah so we have a light

732
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,359
depth going right now that's a couple

733
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,079
weeks

734
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,038
from harvest i just did generally

735
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,639
towards the end

736
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:03,519
i like to do well the old term

737
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,159
flush from like you know back in the day

738
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,038
from

739
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,080
you know indoors and using like salt

740
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,679
based

741
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:13,119
uh newts um yeah i don't like do you

742
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,480
really use that term anymore

743
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:19,599
but but yeah i do soaks towards the end

744
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,120
of uh the final stages i don't i don't

745
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:22,959
like to do

746
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:24,239
i cut off full years about two weeks

747
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,880
before harvest

748
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,440
i find that yeah you know i find that

749
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,840
you're just

750
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,798
introducing more moisture into the

751
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:33,439
phytosphere like

752
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,558
you can cause you know mildew mold

753
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,880
botrytis

754
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:38,558
uh and maybe damage some of the

755
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,679
trichomes too if you're

756
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:45,759
you know spraying too heavy so

757
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:49,840
generally like yeah i just uh

758
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:52,798
i'll i'll i'll do um soil drenches

759
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:54,480
in the last few weeks yeah that's yeah

760
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:54,720
yeah but i carry a little yeah i carry

761
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,240
it

762
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,200
past the fifth weeks into six weeks okay

763
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,038
so yeah i'm curious i've heard that some

764
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,798
people don't do it that far in but

765
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,398
i've not found a problem with it but

766
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:09,278
yeah way deep into

767
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:10,959
bloom i'm not gonna yeah same reason so

768
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:14,079
that's yeah

769
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,519
yeah so

770
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:19,119
um talk about the talk about

771
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,038
harvesting and when you're wild

772
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:24,639
harvesting for things um

773
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:28,319
let's get into the etiquette around

774
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,799
great great sure

775
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,000
yeah great i i love to get into this

776
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,558
topic so

777
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,038
i have some formal training in herbalism

778
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,639
um

779
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:41,599
uh had a a year

780
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,080
um course that i did in humboldt county

781
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:44,398
with

782
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,398
dandelion herbal center was really

783
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:49,599
fortunate to go through that program

784
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:53,278
and uh jane bothwell my teacher

785
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:55,359
um she's uh you know

786
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:56,960
very very close with rosemary gladstar

787
00:29:55,359 --> 00:30:00,158
which which

788
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,679
um the course also i took rosemary

789
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:05,600
gladstar's course as well

790
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:09,519
sage mountain um so i was able to work

791
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:12,158
um use k f practices

792
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:15,918
at dandelion herbal center to pay for my

793
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:18,559
tuition for herbalism class so

794
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,240
yeah yeah that worked out great that

795
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:22,720
stacked functioning for you

796
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,558
right yeah multi-stacking functions

797
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:29,120
permaculture for sure

798
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:30,720
and so um so anyways

799
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,519
there was there's a lot of etiquette

800
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,720
involved in in wild crafting in

801
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:40,639
approaching the natural world and so

802
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:44,000
um so when you walk into

803
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,120
um a natural place like you know into

804
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,558
nature

805
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:52,158
um we need to be really mindful of

806
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:55,200
of the space we're in and in how we're

807
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,080
approaching wild crafting um i was

808
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,558
always taught

809
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:04,158
to first of all ask permission

810
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:05,200
and always bring an offering as well so

811
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,320
you never go out

812
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,120
just with the intention of taking like

813
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,158
you're always

814
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:15,199
giving something back too so an offering

815
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:17,278
um you know tobacco is used a lot as an

816
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,640
offering but but really anything a piece

817
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,798
of chocolate

818
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,080
just putting the intention out of like

819
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:25,759
gratitude

820
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:28,960
and you know and not just walking into

821
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:32,240
nature and and like i'm here to take

822
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,960
so i was always taught you know

823
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,798
ask for permission and a lot of times

824
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,278
you can talk to the plants and say

825
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:40,639
i would like to harvest you say for a

826
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:44,398
certain reason

827
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:48,000
and so give that intention out um

828
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:50,798
but you know listen for feedback

829
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,558
what do you what is your intention

830
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:55,440
intuition telling you

831
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:56,079
uh from these places that that you're in

832
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,759
um

833
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:00,639
asking to take so let's just say that

834
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:03,759
you

835
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:07,200
do get good feedback and

836
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:09,759
and um so then

837
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:10,480
i would only let's say there's a stand

838
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:14,879
of nettle

839
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:18,558
okay and i would only first of all for

840
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,559
say fpgas we really only need the top

841
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:22,798
you know three to four inches for those

842
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:25,119
growth hormones so we don't have to

843
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,200
rip out all those plants right we can

844
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:30,959
just take the tops off them

845
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,679
to let them regenerate and

846
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,960
so we don't have to rip those plants out

847
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,080
we can just take the tops

848
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,278
of what we actually need now i would i

849
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:42,480
would only

850
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:45,839
harvest about

851
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,480
it tops 40 of what i'm seeing i would

852
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:49,119
always leave

853
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,200
more than half of what i'm seeing so i'm

854
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,918
not going in and i'm not just like

855
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,399
destroying a whole stand of nettles or

856
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,640
you know just as an example nettles um

857
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,398
because you know this this term

858
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,240
regenerative right we don't just want it

859
00:33:00,398 --> 00:33:04,239
to be a catch phrase we want to

860
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,278
live these principles and practices and

861
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,000
so

862
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:10,159
we want we want to assist in in

863
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,319
regeneration we can actually wild

864
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:15,200
crafting you can be really destructive

865
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,918
or you can actually assist in the growth

866
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,120
and health

867
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:21,759
of these wild places yes

868
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:22,959
yeah they thrive by our attention and by

869
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:25,919
our harvesting if we're

870
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,000
we're in like in coordination with the

871
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,000
living system that it's part of right

872
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,599
which is absolutely incorporates the

873
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,720
reciprocity and the listening and the

874
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:34,719
intuition as well

875
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,960
and that we have the responsibility to

876
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,759
attune ourselves to being able to listen

877
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,319
to what

878
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:41,440
the messages are and that it's a real

879
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:43,119
thing

880
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,798
i know it's a spot question do you but

881
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:46,639
do you have any sort of like

882
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,558
magical moments out there harvesting

883
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,080
when you've gotten a message or some

884
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:51,519
kind of intuition about what you're

885
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:53,038
doing that's kind of

886
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,960
led you down a path do you have a

887
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,679
specific moment i know that's putting on

888
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:01,600
the spot i have them too

889
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:04,798
yeah i do i do so another one of the

890
00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:05,199
um herbalism schools that i've gone

891
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:07,679
through

892
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,559
is um the school of evolutionary

893
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,599
herbalism

894
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:14,159
which is uh i'm so jealous

895
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,440
sage apothem who's an amazing herbalist

896
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,960
and um

897
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,039
you know alchemist bajirasist uh

898
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,079
that was kind of my entrance into you

899
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:24,960
know spagyric

900
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,879
alchemy which is herbalism you know

901
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,398
alchemical herbalism

902
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:33,679
so you know he talks about this idea

903
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:36,960
of um you know heart coherence and so

904
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,878
we can actually communicate with plants

905
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,079
by doing plant sits and sitting with

906
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:41,679
them and if we're

907
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,919
we open our hearts like to this

908
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,039
intuitive faculty right it's not

909
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:48,000
it's not this mental like today in this

910
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:51,119
day and age there's

911
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,480
a lot of emphasis put

912
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,679
on the logical reductionistic science

913
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,400
mind right but

914
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,838
the intuitive heart is really important

915
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,358
when we're working with nature when

916
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:04,320
we're working with plants

917
00:35:01,358 --> 00:35:05,519
plants are electromagnetic receivers and

918
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,680
transmitters

919
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:08,960
in in and we can tap into those

920
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:10,960
frequencies

921
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,720
with our heart if we're if we're able to

922
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,000
listen and so

923
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:20,719
uh well one one story i'll give you is

924
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:24,000
um so um devil's club apollo panics

925
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:27,759
um is a really powerful

926
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,079
um plant used by many of the indigenous

927
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,920
tribes of the pacific northwest

928
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:36,240
and it's it's a very very powerful

929
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,119
medicine and so i was on this quest to

930
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:39,759
find

931
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,519
devil's club i was really stoked and

932
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,320
interested to find devil's club

933
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,559
and and i know it grows around the

934
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,838
columbia gorge basically

935
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:52,559
uh kind of northern oregon

936
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:54,239
up into washington and up into like bc

937
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:57,039
and even into alaska

938
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,078
and then it also for some reason it has

939
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:59,759
a

940
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,200
like a cousin that grows around lake

941
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,640
michigan so it's out there too

942
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:09,838
yeah it is huh so the third coast right

943
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:12,960
um so

944
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:14,320
anyways with the devil's club i uh

945
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,159
i'm not going to give the specific

946
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,039
location because it's it's really

947
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:19,039
special to me but

948
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,079
so i'm driving okay so i was it i was

949
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:26,320
over in eugene

950
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,280
and uh i was giving a talk on korean

951
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,359
nacho farming it

952
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,720
uh a permaculture convergence that

953
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:33,838
happened there and so i was

954
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:35,838
heading over to ben to a friend's farm

955
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:38,078
afterwards and heading through the

956
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:41,119
willamette national forest

957
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:44,640
and i stopped by um

958
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,400
at a local waterfall and

959
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:47,679
i had kind of given up on my search

960
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,838
thinking that

961
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:51,358
okay it's i got to go up to like the

962
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:55,279
columbia river

963
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:57,920
to find this plant um and had kind of

964
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,359
given up on on my searches like that

965
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:05,519
south of oregon more central oregon

966
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:08,639
so i go to this waterfall and

967
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:11,759
like i'm walking down

968
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,239
into this ravine and like look up and it

969
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,400
like

970
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:15,519
literally knocked me over like the power

971
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,480
of this plant

972
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:20,559
like put me on my back you know because

973
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,639

maple looking leaves it's such a

975
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:26,400
powerful plant

976
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:27,679
and like the power of that like it

977
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,800
really like

978
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,598
i fell back i just sat there with this

979
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,079
plant in

980
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,119
awe of like i found you and i can't

981
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,079
believe it

982
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,640
like i've been looking for a long long

983
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,760
time

984
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:45,279
and uh so

985
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:48,480
yeah that's a very um special plant

986
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,240
i i've made some spagyric preparations

987
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,760
of this plant and

988
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:57,679
um just very very special it's

989
00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:01,200
it's uh it's been called like um

990
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:04,000
alaskan ginseng it's kind of

991
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:05,039
a term that's not officially accepted

992
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,440
but

993
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,159
it's closely related to ginseng

994
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,400
beautiful

995
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,480
so it works on a lot of different levels

996
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,838
you know with with herbs you can learn a

997
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,639
lot about herbs by

998
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:18,480
by their flavors you know like bitters

999
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:21,519
work on your digestive

1000
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,440
system different um you know sweet herbs

1001
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,880
are very nutritive

1002
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:27,119
um so you can learn a lot about herbs

1003
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,480
and

1004
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,160
and what their function is

1005
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:35,199
physiologically uh

1006
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:38,239
really buy the flavors um

1007
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:38,639
and so devil's club is just all over the

1008
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:41,598
place

1009
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:42,960
super complex flavor so anytime you have

1010
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,720
a really complex

1011
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,320
flavor of a plant you know it's working

1012
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:49,838
on a lot of different

1013
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,960
levels do you have you enjoy

1014
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:54,480
you must have ingested it is it um yeah

1015
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,720
did you have some effects from it that

1016
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,079
you especially

1017
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:04,480
loved you know it's very heart-opening

1018
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:07,359
it's very um it's a very self-empowering

1019
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,559
herb you know i think for for doing

1020
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:11,199
self-work

1021
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:13,279
and growth and and things of that nature

1022
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,838
um

1023
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,280
and i think shamanically this is also

1024
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:19,759
what what tribes of the pacific

1025
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,920
northwest use this herb for as well

1026
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,440
um so really that's kind of the level

1027
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,838
that that i use it

1028
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,400
um i see it as a very sacred um deep and

1029
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:31,679
ceremonial

1030
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,400
yes absolutely that's gorgeous

1031
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,759
thank you for sharing that story yeah

1032
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,680
yeah definitely

1033
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,240
do you do you have i'd love to hear one

1034
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:42,719
of your experiences with with an herb

1035
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:44,479
um maybe that spoke to you well you know

1036
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:45,358
i'll talk about one that's been speaking

1037
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,559
to me

1038
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:50,799
this year a very surprising

1039
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,719
discovery because i actually had bought

1040
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,160
it and planted it and then just kind of

1041
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:55,039
noticed it popping up around the

1042
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,039
property because

1043
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:58,639
what i'm trying to do here is naturalize

1044
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,800
everything's and it takes about three

1045
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,400
years and it'll come it'll present

1046
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,920
but then it'll go away it'll present

1047
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,440
into the second year and then by third

1048
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,440
year it's like

1049
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,960
massive and then by fourth year it's

1050
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,599
found its place usually

1051
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,358
seems to be a pattern so this plant was

1052
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,240
i bought it i planted it even though i

1053
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:17,759
knew it's it's

1054
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:20,479
indigenous i still seeded it here but

1055
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,440
it's wild lettuce actually oh yeah so

1056
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,880
this is the first

1057
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,880
year that i've yeah

1058
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,400
so i stumbled on because i make leaf

1059
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,119
protein which i'm going to get into

1060
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,400
some later time but uh i found out about

1061
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,800
that through my permaculture

1062
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,639
studies it's a way of of isolating the

1063
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,119
proteins in the plant so

1064
00:40:42,639 --> 00:40:45,759
i started out with this plant i i

1065
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,720
finally

1066
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,119
so in weeding like i'll take the plan

1067
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:53,679
i'm actually harvesting i'm not weeding

1068
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,318
so i set it aside and i decided to pull

1069
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:59,440
protein from it i tried the protein

1070
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:01,279
and it had an effect uh and then i i

1071
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,760
just sort of i decided

1072
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,560
i realized that what was left was still

1073
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,800
had a lot of

1074
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:07,679
oiliness and sponginess to it so i

1075
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,760
thought and i

1076
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,519
i don't tend to follow recipes i let the

1077
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,079
plant tell me what to do

1078
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:15,599
yeah right so i really right so i

1079
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,640
realized like this isn't this isn't

1080
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,160
water soluble

1081
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:22,078
so i i put the mass of

1082
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,078
uh stuff that i'd already juiced taken

1083
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,680
the juice taken the protein out of it

1084
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:28,240
put it in alcohol

1085
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:30,399
the alcohol turned the most lovely color

1086
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:33,199
of blue i've ever seen oh wow

1087
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,519
okay green so i was like oh this is

1088
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:38,879
interesting so i tried a bit off of it

1089
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:41,759
yeah and the effect

1090
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,519
was incredible like it acted on the

1091
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,319
central nervous system it got rid of

1092
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:47,519
pain

1093
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:48,000
it definitely but it sort of woke me up

1094
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:50,400
to the

1095
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,838
reality that i'm much because i've had

1096
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,240
issues sleeping for the last year and

1097
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,119
that's

1098
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:56,719
unusual for me but i wasn't really being

1099
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,400
affected in any other way i thought i

1100
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:01,199
was behaving normally

1101
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,079
well this plant taught me that i am

1102
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:04,239
super jacked

1103
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,119
in my central nervous system and that i

1104
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:07,919
need

1105
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,480
a lot of nurturing this plant has opened

1106
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,920
me up

1107
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,920
this year to sort of

1108
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:16,000
being able to surrender deeper being

1109
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:19,039
able to feel at home in my own

1110
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,719
garden being able to feel safe in my own

1111
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:24,400
environment and do some

1112
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:27,439
profound healing awesome yeah

1113
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,838
and it's like plant guided but

1114
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,559
yeah isn't that so cool i love that

1115
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:34,480
that's like the

1116
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:34,799
the initiatic um properties of plants

1117
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,199
you know

1118
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,079
that's really what spider gets into it's

1119
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:39,919
like all

1120
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,839
different plants like you get into the

1121
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,680
archetypes and there's

1122
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:45,039
there's lessons that these plants have

1123
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:48,239
to teach us

1124
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:50,960
each plant i know yeah it's so cool so

1125
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:52,078
cool actually um i could show you some

1126
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:57,920
of the tincture

1127
00:42:52,079 --> 00:43:00,400
oh i loved i loved something yeah

1128
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:02,240
preston sent me some stuff has saved my

1129
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,280
hand crop last year because i

1130
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:06,879
i needed some anyway you did i felt

1131
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,319
really bad because the bottle

1132
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,559
like you sent me a picture of the

1133
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:12,559
package and it was like crushed and like

1134
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,599
you know maybe a quarter of the way full

1135
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:18,239
it was all you know the box was drenched

1136
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,519
right but but ironically it was the

1137
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,159
perfect amount that was

1138
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,838
left to finish out my harvest so you

1139
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:25,358
were saying yeah you might have wanted

1140
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:25,759
more but this is what you're gonna work

1141
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:29,199
with

1142
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:32,640

yeah i love i love to talk about about

1144
00:43:32,639 --> 00:43:35,519
that

1145
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,560
specific plant that i sent you too

1146
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:39,440
please do

1147
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,159
okay yeah do you want to get into that

1148
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,880
right now or

1149
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,399
yeah we might as well okay okay yeah

1150
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:48,160
okay great so

1151
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:51,200
um the plant that i sent to tina was

1152
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:55,838
uh bay california bay laurel that's

1153
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:55,838
californica uh um

1154
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:04,159
excuse me um and it

1155
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:07,199
is a very very potent plant

1156
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:09,960
it has um

1157
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:11,519
it has a compound called umbela

1158
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,960
embellalone

1159
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:18,239
and it's one of the volatile oils of

1160
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:22,480
of california bay and

1161
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:24,399
so how i came upon this plant and

1162
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,838
how i thought about using it as a

1163
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,358
pesticide like a jadom

1164
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:31,759
pesticide was through my herbalism

1165
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:34,159
studies i was looking at

1166
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,640
some of the native american uses of

1167
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:40,000
california bay and

1168
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:44,159
um the

1169
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:48,318
the uses that i found was

1170
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:51,440
um it was used

1171
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:54,960
it was used to protect acorns like

1172
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:58,000
when some of the native tribes um

1173
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,838
were were processing acorns they would

1174
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,280
put california bay

1175
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:03,759
around the acorns to protect that acorn

1176
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,519
meal

1177
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,760
because there's a process of leeching

1178
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:10,079
out those tannins and acorns

1179
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:11,599
to produce bread so they would they

1180
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,359
would protect it

1181
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:17,760
with the california bay leaves to

1182
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:18,960
you know uh keep away insects or

1183
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:21,520
opportunistic

1184
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,119
you know whatever from from you know

1185
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:26,239
getting the acorns

1186
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:29,280
so when i heard that i was like okay

1187
00:45:26,239 --> 00:45:32,559
this has potential for

1188
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:36,560
you know jadom um

1189
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:38,880
yeah a jadom pesticide and sure enough

1190
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,880
it definitely does have way more

1191
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,920
potential i've been using this

1192
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:47,519
um as my primary go-to

1193
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:47,920
for all kinds of problems um for example

1194
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:50,639
uh

1195
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,480
last year when i first got to the hemp

1196
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:54,559
farm i'm currently working with

1197
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,240
there's a horrible infestation of hemp

1198
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,679
aphids and so

1199
00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:02,318
i i had some of the california bay

1200
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:04,480
i made a jadom herbal solution which is

1201
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:05,358
essentially an herbal decoction that you

1202
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:08,960
do

1203
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:12,078
with water uh you know

1204
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,639
just boil it steam it

1205
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,400
trap all those volatile oils and then

1206
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:18,480
you would mix that with

1207
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,039
the uh jadon wetting agent which is

1208
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:25,039
essentially a castile

1209
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:28,880
soap um and so i mixed the two together

1210
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:31,199
and found that perfect rate to where

1211
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:33,039
we had a bunch of ladybugs you know that

1212
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:35,919
came to save the day too

1213
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:37,199
so i was trying to find that perfect

1214
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,480
balance of

1215
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:43,358
okay where can i destroy like

1216
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:44,159
all of the hemp aphids but also save the

1217
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:47,358
ladybug

1218
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:50,399
the lady beetles and their larva so

1219
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:53,279
and i found that balance and so

1220
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,079
we had this crazy infestation of hemp

1221
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,119
aphids

1222
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:59,359
and the first application i used of

1223
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,599
the california bay laurel with the

1224
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,679
waiting agent

1225
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,079
took care of most of the problem i mean

1226
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:08,879
probably 80 percent of the aphids were

1227
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:11,039
gone after one application

1228
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,800
the second application i came back a

1229
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:15,039
week later

1230
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,079
sprayed again totally done two

1231
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:19,279
applications

1232
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:22,480
and uh and they were toast

1233
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:25,599
so i've also used the bay laurel for

1234
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:29,440
uh powdery mildew botrytis

1235
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,079
um russet mites yes wendy was talking

1236
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,119
about

1237
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:36,480
that application uh this year uh at the

1238
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:39,039
regenerative conference um

1239
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,679
and basically our trials your trials

1240
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:42,318
went um

1241
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:43,440
tina and wendy's as well with the with

1242
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:46,480
the

1243
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:50,318
um with the california bay laurel so

1244
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,639
um it's it is an absolute all-star so

1245
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:53,679
i only use a couple of other herbs for

1246
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:56,799
pesticides

1247
00:47:53,679 --> 00:48:00,239
i'll use like bracken fern

1248
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:03,440
ginkgo biloba is you know one of um

1249
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:06,000
cho yongsan's favorite uh but it's just

1250
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:09,519
not as potent and effective i found as

1251
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,920
as the bay laurel is just an all-star

1252
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:13,759
so chris is asking uh chris trump has

1253
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,960
joined the room he says have you used

1254
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,240
the jwa by

1255
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,400
itself yes i think he was trialing that

1256
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:23,519
just this last week so yeah

1257
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,440
i have uh specifically for hemp aphids i

1258
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:28,000
didn't find that it

1259
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,800
it took care of the problem it it does

1260
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,719
help

1261
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,480
i mean even with normal aphids you can

1262
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:35,838
just spray them off with water

1263
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:38,639
yeah and it doesn't kill them but you

1264
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:40,000
you at least kind of make it yeah

1265
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:43,199
disrupt their their

1266
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,920
their flow and uh so

1267
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:48,078
i have used the wedding agent by itself

1268
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,480
but i haven't found that it that it will

1269
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:50,559
kill

1270
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,599
all the aphids when you cup when you

1271
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,640
couple that with the

1272
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:57,359
uh bay laurel the baylor was amazing

1273
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:58,719
no we really got a powerful weapon to

1274
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:00,400
use against them and

1275
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:02,000
it was amazing because it didn't kill

1276
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,920
the ladybugs either they were they

1277
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,599
were surprising that's so cool to hear

1278
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,519
and i can talk about it i can talk about

1279
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:14,000
the ratios that i used

1280
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:16,800
yeah please do okay so um

1281
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,719
let's see here because i i haven't

1282
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,318
written down what i used and i found the

1283
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:21,598
same thing to be true it took two

1284
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:24,800
applications

1285
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:27,039
and also just to comment on the power of

1286
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,400
uh using that korean natural parameter

1287
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,480
natural farming

1288
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,440
methods in conjunction with all this is

1289
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,559
that like

1290
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,318
it gave the plant a break from the

1291
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:39,680
onslaught

1292
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:41,838
in enough time for the application or

1293
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:45,279
it's what it was getting from

1294
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:47,920
the natural farming applications to just

1295
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:48,400
come rushing forth so they both act and

1296
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,880
just

1297
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,480
concern each other which was very

1298
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,240
evident

1299
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:59,280
right yeah so um

1300
00:49:56,239 --> 00:50:01,838
i thought i love you too chris

1301
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,839
we love you i'm glad you're joining i'm

1302
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:07,119
glad to see you

1303
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:10,318
here he just said he loves us both

1304
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:10,318
oh love you too chris

1305
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:16,159
i love the community that is happening

1306
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,639
around natural farming it's like

1307
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:19,679
community happens the best and the most

1308
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:22,719
lasting when we're

1309
00:50:19,679 --> 00:50:25,118
actually doing things that are helpful

1310
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:26,078
and yeah it's really helpful and then

1311
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,838
when we're finding

1312
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,280
when we're abundantly helpful to

1313
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:29,759
ourselves and what's around us then

1314
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,599
we're

1315
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,040
abundantly helpful with each other which

1316
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:36,480
is kind of just this natural

1317
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:38,800
outflow happens and yeah definitely

1318
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,800
absolutely it's such a great community

1319
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,559
you know uh and

1320
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,400
what i find is really cool is just you

1321
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,880
know people sharing their experiences

1322
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,440
being

1323
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,838
open source with yes you know these

1324
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,400
practices in a different region because

1325
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,880
i've been fortunate to to practice this

1326
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,000
you know

1327
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,640
go around and train in hawaii

1328
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,400
and go to you know practice in

1329
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:02,639
california and oregon

1330
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,760
and and out in idaho with chris and the

1331
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:07,679
soilsmiths

1332
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:10,240
and it's so cool to see how

1333
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:11,358
you know those different leverage points

1334
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:13,919
um and how

1335
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:15,679
how it changes so you know it's it's a

1336
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,880
different approach wherever you're at

1337
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:18,000
there's it's going to be a little

1338
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,519
different i think that's really

1339
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,079
important to keep in mind we don't want

1340
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:22,400
to get too

1341
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:24,160
fixed and like oh but so we were going

1342
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,760
to talk about your ratios we might as

1343
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:26,159
well cover that and we got another hour

1344
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,440
yeah

1345
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:32,639
and then three hours

1346
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:35,358
okay cool yeah um so

1347
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:36,000
the ratio that i'm using for uh the

1348
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:38,880
california

1349
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,679
bay laurel yeah with uh jadom wedding

1350
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,960
agent

1351
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:45,598
uh i use this for dealing with

1352
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,800
uh hemp aphids and found that it also

1353
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:51,440
saved the ladybugs

1354
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:55,599
and their larva so that ratio was

1355
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:59,119
um a half ounce of the

1356
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,400
um jadom herbal solution so essentially

1357
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,400
just to go over that for

1358
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,599
for people unfamiliar that's that's a

1359
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,838
decoction of bay laurel you essentially

1360
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:09,280
take all the leaves and you would simmer

1361
00:52:07,838 --> 00:52:11,599
that in a pot

1362
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,480
covered pot and you would you would make

1363
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:16,400
a strong herbal decoction from that so

1364
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,400
you know you'd bring it to boil and let

1365
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,599
that simmer for i usually let it simmer

1366
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,160
for

1367
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,720
an hour and a half or so uh to get all

1368
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:25,920
those good

1369
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:29,279
volatile compounds out of it and then

1370
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:32,639
so then you have your uh your decoction

1371
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:35,680
also known as dom herbal solution

1372
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:38,558
and you can mix that with your uh

1373
00:52:35,679 --> 00:52:41,039
your carrier which is the jwa the dom

1374
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:44,160
wetting agent

1375
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:46,558
so again the uh

1376
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,440
the ratio on that is a half an ounce of

1377
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,079
the

1378
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,358
bay laurel jadam herbal solution the

1379
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,720
decoction

1380
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:55,838
and i would mix two ounces of the jadom

1381
00:52:54,719 --> 00:53:00,078
wetting agent

1382
00:52:55,838 --> 00:53:01,119
per gallon and so i found that was that

1383
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:05,440
really worked

1384
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:08,720
awesome for for dealing with hemp aphids

1385
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,318
and again saving the the lady beetles

1386
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:12,399
so that's kind of that's the kind of the

1387
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:15,279
balance you're looking for and

1388
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,000
uh what you can do is just pull a leaf

1389
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,160
off you know

1390
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,358
create a little laboratory wherever

1391
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:22,399
you're at just

1392
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:24,480
pull a leaf off your your crop that's

1393
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,519
infected with whatever you're trying to

1394
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,358
combat

1395
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:29,440
and then you can just mix these

1396
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:33,679
solutions to find

1397
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:35,679
the the appropriate ratio that's working

1398
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:37,719
so you're basically treating some

1399
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:39,039
infested part and then looking under a

1400
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:41,039
microscopic

1401
00:53:39,039 --> 00:53:42,719
magnifying glass to see the effect on

1402
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:44,079
the population and then going with that

1403
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:47,199
ratio

1404
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:48,400
absolutely yeah yep and also it's

1405
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:51,598
important right to

1406
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,200
use uh non like i i did i

1407
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:55,200
first i made it in with just using

1408
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:57,838
spring water which is heavily mineral

1409
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:58,318
but no you it's like no you want to use

1410
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:01,440
it in

1411
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:02,639
acidic yeah right that's a good point

1412
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,920
you have to use uh

1413
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:09,118
rain water is what i always use because

1414
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,000
it's more it's more acidic if you use a

1415
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,119
more alkaline

1416
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,079
water then um that's it's not going to

1417
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,519
mix correctly

1418
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:20,160
and and if you're making uh liquid soap

1419
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:21,119
such as you know jadon wetting agent um

1420
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,399
a

1421
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:27,599
um you know a liquid

1422
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:30,800
castile soap you have to also use uh

1423
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:33,920
more acidic water if it's too alkaline

1424
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,920
it's not going to work and a good visual

1425
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,119
in case you don't have a ph around this

1426
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,119
already if you don't know what water

1427
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,000
you're using is when it's cloudy it's

1428
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,720
not it that's

1429
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,880
outlined but when it's more clear it's

1430
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:45,679
more acidic so you can know that way

1431
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,960
right

1432
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:52,159
exactly yep that's true

1433
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:55,440
cool and it does make a difference

1434
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:57,199
big difference yeah big difference

1435
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,599
yeah well it won't mix correctly you'll

1436
00:54:57,199 --> 00:55:03,279
see like when you when you have it

1437
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:06,798
mixed properly you'll see bubbles form

1438
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,839
uh whereas you don't it it it becomes

1439
00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:10,880
cloudy and

1440
00:55:07,838 --> 00:55:11,920
it doesn't look the same so so yeah you

1441
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:16,000
definitely know when

1442
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:20,159
you've made correct um you know soap

1443
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:23,199
very cool so do you ever use the jwa

1444
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:25,358
in uh or are you what do you what are

1445
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:28,798
your thoughts on using it

1446
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:32,318
in concert with like applications of

1447
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:34,400
um you know type two or type three

1448
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:37,039
do you feel like because i just okay so

1449
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:41,280
i just did a type 2 which is using the

1450
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:43,119
fish amino acids and i had so much oil

1451
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,440
that i ended up adding a little of the

1452
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:48,559
jwa just to get the oil to

1453
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,720
um to mix with the water a bit

1454
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:52,960
do you do how do you feel about that do

1455
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:56,078
you think that's kind of a

1456
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:58,240
adulteration or is that no no like i'm

1457
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:01,359
open to that kind of experimentation

1458
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:04,318
uh i don't think it's adulteration um

1459
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:06,159
i just haven't personally had a need for

1460
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:09,199
that i know i know some people are

1461
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:12,798
scraping the the oils off of their faa

1462
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:16,078
i generally keep my my faa i keep it

1463
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:17,599
uh i like to keep it whole so i like to

1464
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,960
keep those oils in there

1465
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:21,280
yes you just shake it up while you're

1466
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:24,159
applying and yeah exactly

1467
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,920
yep so i haven't really experimented

1468
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:28,960
with using oils of fish

1469
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,358
in that in that way that approach

1470
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,240
um but if if it's working for you then

1471
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:34,078
yeah i

1472
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:36,159
yeah i just did it i just did it this

1473
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:40,640
last time i don't know if it's cool

1474
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:43,118
okay i just wanted to know if you knew

1475
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:45,279
yeah you know i've i've been so stoked

1476
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:47,200
with my results with the the bay laurel

1477
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,280
in the wedding region it's such a

1478
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:52,558
powerful combination that

1479
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:55,839
honestly i don't even really uh look for

1480
00:56:52,559 --> 00:57:01,280
um other herbs to really use

1481
00:56:55,838 --> 00:57:03,358
and i'd like to say this much okay so

1482
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,640
at the regenerative conference this last

1483
00:57:03,358 --> 00:57:06,639
year there was a speaker

1484
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:08,000
and i'm not going to name names or you

1485
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:10,159
know throwing anyone

1486
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,318
under the bus but there was a speaker

1487
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:15,358
talking about pesticides

1488
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:18,798
and and she mentioned that a

1489
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:22,719
petroleum based product was less

1490
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:24,960
of a um had less of an environmental

1491
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:26,480
impact than using certain herbs and she

1492
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,400
was totally

1493
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:30,240
putting down the use of herbs as

1494
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:32,559
pesticides and i was just like mind

1495
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:33,199
blown like what this lady is talking

1496
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,400
about this

1497
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:37,919
at a regenerative conference

1498
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,760
basically saying the environmental

1499
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,000
impact of harvesting herbs is greater

1500
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,680
than

1501
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:47,039
using some petroleum extracted product

1502
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:48,719
okay so we have to be careful

1503
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:50,159
let's call it let's call it out because

1504
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:51,919
this to me is one of the major

1505
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:54,078
conversations that needs to happen out

1506
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,880
there for us to sort of wake up to

1507
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:58,720
our regenerative place in the world i

1508
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,880
feel like there are basically two camps

1509
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:01,679
of people there are the people who feel

1510
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,240
like

1511
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:04,798
we are part of nature and that we're our

1512
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:06,798
place

1513
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:08,480
is necessary here that we're part of the

1514
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:10,000
ecosystem and then there are people who

1515
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,838
are being convinced and

1516
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,358
taught and believed that that people are

1517
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:16,558
the problem

1518
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:18,078
and like i'm and like so um

1519
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,040
in it like for instance in wild

1520
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:23,680
harvesting and wild crafting

1521
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:25,279
it's been shown that like if you're

1522
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:26,719
doing proper harvesting and you're

1523
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,119
keeping to that 40

1524
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:29,759
ratio that you spoke to earlier then

1525
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,480
that

1526
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,920
stand of wild plants will actually

1527
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:37,280
flourish and thrive

1528
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:39,200
under your stewardship and care

1529
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,040
and so if we come into proper

1530
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:43,679
stewardship with our planet we are

1531
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:44,318
very much a part of the garden

1532
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:47,440
absolutely

1533
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:48,960
yes essential to the garden right so i

1534
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,639
feel like you know yeah maybe

1535
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,480
you know making the argument that us

1536
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:54,159
harvesting and wild crafting is going to

1537
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:57,199
be harmful is just

1538
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:59,358
it's just it's because we need to learn

1539
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:01,759
how to come into harmony with our world

1540
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:04,078
yeah i agree and it could be like if

1541
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,599
you're if we go back to like devastating

1542
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:07,599
that stand and nettle we were talking

1543
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:10,079
about then it could be destructive

1544
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:11,119
uh but i i think the argument is very

1545
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,160
hard to make that

1546
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:17,440
a petroleum extracted product is

1547
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:18,318
less damaging uh to the earth than using

1548
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,318
herbs and

1549
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:22,159
for me it comes down to bay laurel again

1550
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:23,440
it's like these massive trees grow in

1551
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:26,558
northern california

1552
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:29,200
in oregon it's known as um oregon myrtle

1553
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:30,559
it's the same plant oregon up here up

1554
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:32,558
here we have our own

1555
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,240
name down there it's california bay

1556
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:37,440
laurel um

1557
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:39,759
but anyways so i mean these

1558
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:42,000
these trees grow massive and there's and

1559
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,200
it's so potent like you don't need much

1560
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,679
like a branch of this

1561
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:47,199
i can make enough to spray four

1562
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:50,000
greenhouses

1563
00:59:47,199 --> 00:59:52,000
um you know 100 foot by 30 foot and take

1564
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,838
care of an aphid infestation with one

1565
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,679
branch off of a huge tree

1566
00:59:53,838 --> 00:59:57,358
so there's not much of an environmental

1567
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:59,279
impact going on there

1568
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:00,960
yeah and i'm working and i'm doing this

1569
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,119
on a large scale too

1570
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:05,119
do you think that you're losing i mean

1571
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:06,720
i'm i'm sold on the method because it

1572
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:07,599
works so well but have you ever thought

1573
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:10,078
about like

1574
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:12,559
capturing being a spajaris capturing the

1575
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:14,640
essential oils first and then sort of

1576
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:16,880
using a spagheric approach of re you

1577
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:20,159
know like adding those volatiles

1578
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:22,640
back into have you done that interesting

1579
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:22,639
you ask

1580
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:28,639
here is uh the sulfur or the um

1581
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:30,078
essential oil of bay laurel and so

1582
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:34,000
that's beautiful

1583
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:37,359
now now i'm doing distillations of um

1584
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:40,400
the you can see the the bubbles are

1585
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:42,400
that's gorgeous so yeah did you have to

1586
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,920
open your windows and doors to do that

1587
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,358
yeah oh that's another thing i should

1588
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,119
mention if you're working with bay

1589
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:48,159
laurel you do not want to do this in

1590
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:50,160
your house

1591
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:51,519
i mean there's a reason it's a powerful

1592
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:54,879
pesticide

1593
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:56,000
and um it is very very powerful i mean

1594
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,559
it's actually one of its

1595
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,838
nicknames is is a headache tree because

1596
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:02,880
it causes

1597
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:05,440
gives umbelalone that volatile

1598
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,160
oil causes headaches in a lot of people

1599
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,838
um

1600
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:10,558
i'm unfortunate it doesn't for me

1601
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:13,440
absolutely love the the smell of bait

1602
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:14,079
um but this is this is really powerful

1603
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,880
stuff

1604
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:18,880
now how much how much uh material did it

1605
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:23,280
take to do that

1606
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:26,318
yeah so this this was uh this much here

1607
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:29,519
yeah was um i'm working with

1608
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:32,639
a 2-liter distillation apparatus

1609
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:35,759
that's what i have okay cool nice

1610
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:39,199
uh so this was uh

1611
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:42,480
let's see like two

1612
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:43,039
two distillations so my bio flask my bio

1613
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,079
flask

1614
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:49,759
um essentially this is is two

1615
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:52,798
distillations of two two liters

1616
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:55,760
of um bay laurel so honestly like

1617
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:56,318
not all that much it's very high in

1618
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,000
these

1619
01:01:56,318 --> 01:01:59,599
in these volatile compounds and they're

1620
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,358
very powerful so

1621
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:03,039
i am experimenting now with doing

1622
01:02:01,358 --> 01:02:06,078
distillations and adding

1623
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:09,039
straight essential oils into

1624
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,559
my jadon wetting agent rather than

1625
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:12,559
rather than doing the the herbal

1626
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:15,519
decoction but the herbal decoction

1627
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:17,680
works really well too it is plenty right

1628
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:19,440
are you going so far as to burn to white

1629
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:20,078
ash and add the minerals or anything

1630
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,639
like that

1631
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:23,359
crazy you know i haven't done like a

1632
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:26,558
spagyric

1633
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:27,358
application uh for the plants but i

1634
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:29,599
think it would be

1635
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:31,440
very effective i really do yeah it's

1636
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:32,798
just you know what i want to use it you

1637
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,920
know where i want to use it

1638
01:02:32,798 --> 01:02:38,239
is in the is in the vinegars so after

1639
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,079
so after making the fpjs taking that

1640
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:41,919
plant material making the vinegar and

1641
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:43,599
then taking the leftover plant material

1642
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,960
taking it to white ash deriving the

1643
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:46,000
minerals and putting it back into the

1644
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,639
vinegars

1645
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,960
yes it's going to change the ph so i'm

1646
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:53,598
kind of like

1647
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:55,358
anyway right we'll have another

1648
01:02:53,599 --> 01:02:55,838
discussion about spherics one of these

1649
01:02:55,358 --> 01:02:57,598
days

1650
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:59,199
yeah we should because that that's a

1651
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:01,119
that's a deep rabbit hole

1652
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:03,439
right there and uh it's it's a very

1653
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:06,880
exciting um

1654
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:07,519
method and very ancient um ancient roots

1655
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:11,519
into

1656
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:13,119
antiquity so um what's your feeling on

1657
01:03:11,519 --> 01:03:15,358
the relationship between

1658
01:03:13,119 --> 01:03:16,559
spagyrics and natural farming because i

1659
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:19,519
see them kind of like

1660
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:21,039
pretty hand in hand are you caught by

1661
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:25,358
that

1662
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:27,599
um you know i've often wondered uh

1663
01:03:25,358 --> 01:03:28,639
some of the approaches to korean natural

1664
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:32,559
farming do have

1665
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:35,440
some alchemical kind of background

1666
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:35,440
and uh

1667
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:40,000
you know i think i think one of them

1668
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,640
that strikes me

1669
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,760
is the the preparation of ohn for

1670
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:47,199
instance we do

1671
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:50,559
a fermentation before we actually uh

1672
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:52,558
do a tincture and so that's very

1673
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:54,319
that's very similar to how you would

1674
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:56,960
approach a spagyric too

1675
01:03:54,318 --> 01:03:58,000
um and it's budgeric you would you would

1676
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:01,280
release the

1677
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,719
uh the sulfur or the essential oil first

1678
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,640
the soul of that plant

1679
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:06,318
and then you would do a fermentation to

1680
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:09,440
release the spirits

1681
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:10,400
so in korean nacho farming we are doing

1682
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:14,000
fermentation

1683
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:17,119
along with our uh with

1684
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,199
our distillation so it's it gets it's

1685
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:22,240
similar to the alchemical approach

1686
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:25,598
for sure yeah we're not taking it as far

1687
01:04:22,239 --> 01:04:28,078
as is calcinating down the plant matter

1688
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,640
and you know adding the salts back to it

1689
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:30,640
but

1690
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:31,920
you know there are elements of of

1691
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:34,879
alchemy within

1692
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,519
uh korean acts of farming is definitely

1693
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:38,640
um

1694
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:40,880
you know an esoteric science yeah and i

1695
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:43,279
know uh i i believe one of master cho's

1696
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:46,720
teachers was really inspired by

1697
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,280
uh rudolph steiner of uh biodynamic

1698
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:49,598
farming

1699
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:51,920
and you know he was very much into

1700
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:55,039
alchemy

1701
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:59,680
interesting interesting yeah

1702
01:04:55,039 --> 01:05:02,480
it's it's fun to explore the interface

1703
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:03,679
so we touched on everything that you

1704
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,760
have that's in your outline

1705
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:07,919
preston preston prepared an outline for

1706
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,440
this i was so like thrilled with that

1707
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:11,599
but i want to know

1708
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,039
i i did however i've been bouncing all

1709
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:16,400
over the place not really

1710
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:19,039
using it um so i guess i could go back

1711
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,318
and just kind of talk more about you

1712
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:23,839
know my favorite herbs

1713
01:05:20,318 --> 01:05:26,558
as far as fpgas okay great

1714
01:05:23,838 --> 01:05:27,838
so you know as i was talking about

1715
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:31,280
earlier the idea

1716
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:33,599
of of really trying to grow your own

1717
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,640
fertilizer so part of your crop thinking

1718
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:36,240
ahead of time like

1719
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:39,279
how many how many eight like if we're

1720
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:39,279
doing acre um

1721
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,559
oh phone battery is getting kind of low

1722
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:48,839
here

1723
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:51,599
uh-oh okay i'm gonna talk fast okay

1724
01:05:48,838 --> 01:05:54,239
okay i might have to go plug in here

1725
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:54,960
um do you want to do you want to try to

1726
01:05:54,239 --> 01:05:56,558
do that

1727
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:58,559
or what are you doing yeah i'm going to

1728
01:05:56,559 --> 01:06:00,400
make my way over and plug in while

1729
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,920
while i'm talking here yeah let's do

1730
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,400
that

1731
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:06,240
we don't want to lose you okay because

1732
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,720
we'll distill all this stuff down

1733
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:10,399
talking about spagyrics like my intent

1734
01:06:08,719 --> 01:06:12,318
for these uh

1735
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,240
conversations is to gather as much

1736
01:06:12,318 --> 01:06:15,199
material as possible and then condense

1737
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:17,279
down later and

1738
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:18,480
come out with you know some kind of a

1739
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:21,760
podcast that we can

1740
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:23,760
all use together so we want to make sure

1741
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,640
we get all the information from you that

1742
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:28,319
you

1743
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:30,838
wanted to share yeah so i would

1744
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:32,880
i would be thinking first and foremost

1745
01:06:30,838 --> 01:06:34,318
about throwing some of your own

1746
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:38,079
fertilizers

1747
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:41,440
um so that would be on my mind first

1748
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,960
secondly i would be looking for plants

1749
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:46,240
that are really showing up

1750
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:50,639
for you that are in abundance you know

1751
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:50,639
different um

1752
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:55,679
you know plants that are

1753
01:06:55,838 --> 01:07:01,920
possibly invasives in your area that are

1754
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:03,679
are taking over um they make great

1755
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:07,760
fertilizers

1756
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:10,879
you know things like fennel really juicy

1757
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:14,079
horsetail fennel um

1758
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:16,550
comfrey they make great fertilizers

1759
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:18,480
because they they render a lot of juices

1760
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:21,039
[Music]

1761
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:23,358
yeah somebody's asking about seaweed fpj

1762
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:25,839
seaweed fpj is awesome

1763
01:07:23,358 --> 01:07:28,558
definitely because it's very abundant if

1764
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:32,078
you live on the coast

1765
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:34,559
and excuse me and just plug it in

1766
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:34,559
real quick

1767
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:40,558
so yeah seaweed fpga it's it's very

1768
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:43,838
abundant

1769
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:46,720
so i like to look for you know herbs

1770
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:46,719
plants like that

1771
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:50,000
that are that are very abundant you know

1772
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:53,038
because

1773
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:56,960
there's never going to be a shortage so

1774
01:07:53,039 --> 01:08:00,400
seaweed fpj is awesome i also like to do

1775
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:01,519
um you know jadom style liquid ferments

1776
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:04,798
with seaweed

1777
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:04,798
that can be really fun too

1778
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:10,160
so let's see look at my list are you

1779
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:12,078
are your horsetail are you making a

1780
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:14,798
traditional fpga out of that and are

1781
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:16,798
you find that to be a juicy plant oh

1782
01:08:14,798 --> 01:08:17,119
absolutely it's one it renders one of

1783
01:08:16,798 --> 01:08:19,838
the

1784
01:08:17,119 --> 01:08:20,798
like the most juices out of a lot of the

1785
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:24,079
fpgas

1786
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:28,719
that i i make um you know

1787
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:30,559
so right now it's getting more mature so

1788
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:31,920
as the name implies it looks like a

1789
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:35,199
horse tail the

1790
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:37,359
um the leaves kind of fray

1791
01:08:35,198 --> 01:08:39,358
out and it looks like a horse tail the

1792
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:41,279
best time really to harvest it is before

1793
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:41,679
it does that when their shoots are just

1794
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:44,319
coming

1795
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:45,359
right out of the ground okay um before

1796
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:48,000
it opens up

1797
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:49,279
and there's a ton of juices in in

1798
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,319
horsetail so

1799
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:54,159
it's one of my favorite fpgas because

1800
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:56,319
you know let's just compare it with

1801
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:59,599
nettle what i was finding from

1802
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:01,600
nettle fpj to horsetail fpga i would get

1803
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,880
about twice the juices from

1804
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:06,400
horsetail that i would nettles so

1805
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:08,960
being strategic about what we're

1806
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:12,479
harvesting too for a large scale

1807
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:13,600
um nettle is a lot of work to it makes a

1808
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:16,718
great fpga

1809
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:19,759
super nutrient dense um but it's

1810
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:20,960
you know it's a lot of work to harvest

1811
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:23,679
um

1812
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:26,158
for making large scale you know fpga

1813
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:28,239
fermented plant juices so

1814
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:29,278
i like to use skunk cabbage because it's

1815
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:32,399
very abundant

1816
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:33,040
it it's very juicy fennel again is

1817
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:36,238
awesome

1818
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:40,000
also very abundant on the coast

1819
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:43,278
very juicy uh comfrey growing comfrey

1820
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:44,399
makes a great fpj also renders a lot of

1821
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:47,679
juice

1822
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:49,679
so really there's only

1823
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:51,199
for larger scale stuff there's really to

1824
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:54,239
me it's

1825
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:58,079
even using nettle it's like i do

1826
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:59,839
make nettle fpjs but i'm very careful

1827
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:03,279
with my application of those i'll use

1828
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:05,600
them in a foliar spray because

1829
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:07,279
you know it's it's just so hard to to

1830
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:11,280
render a lot of juice

1831
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:13,279
from it so um

1832
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:15,119
this is where your application rate i

1833
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:17,519
mean what's your uh

1834
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:18,960
what's how much material are you using

1835
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:22,800
per acre

1836
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:23,679
typically that's a great question like

1837
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,039
um

1838
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:28,719
material as far as making fpgas

1839
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:30,079
yeah like how much are you having to

1840
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:32,079
harvest per

1841
01:10:30,079 --> 01:10:33,359
acre do you have that number or do you

1842
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:36,079
know

1843
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:36,719
i haven't done those calcs because for

1844
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:38,719
me

1845
01:10:36,719 --> 01:10:39,920
as i mentioned earlier i'm i'm

1846
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:43,279
substituting in

1847
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:46,880
jadom liquid fertilizers as well so

1848
01:10:43,279 --> 01:10:48,800
um it's hard for me to say um you know i

1849
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:52,880
do pickle barrel

1850
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:56,640
batches of nettle and horsetail

1851
01:10:52,880 --> 01:11:01,119
so um you know i'm able to

1852
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:04,480
i have about 10 gallons of um

1853
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:08,000
you know nettle fpj and horsetail

1854
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:12,000
uh i get about 10 gallons from

1855
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:15,039
from the same amount of material so um

1856
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,359
okay you know i'm using that very

1857
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:19,760
carefully in foliar sprays

1858
01:11:17,359 --> 01:11:22,000
i do some soil drenches but primarily

1859
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:25,440
i'm using the foliar sprays

1860
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,760
uh to help make that go further um

1861
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:30,639
and then as i mentioned substituting in

1862
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:33,840
the jadom liquid fertilizers is also

1863
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:36,079
i find that to um

1864
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:38,239
yeah it's just it's easier to to make

1865
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:39,760
genome liquid fertilizer than it is

1866
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:41,839
fermented plant juice there's there's

1867
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:44,640
more resource sources for it

1868
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:46,800
you essentially just chop up you know

1869
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:50,400
grasses and weeds and whatever you have

1870
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:52,320
and throw it in a ferment in water

1871
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:54,238
and you have a fertilizer so it really

1872
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:55,599
simplifies it you don't have to go buy a

1873
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:58,879
bunch of sugar

1874
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:02,079
um so so anyways yeah i like

1875
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:03,679
i like the combination of the two nice

1876
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:05,279
what are you doing for your vinegars are

1877
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:07,279
you making your own vinegars from your

1878
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:09,198
material from your fpjs are you using

1879
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:12,639
brown rice vinegar

1880
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:13,359
yeah i am i am yeah um i love making

1881
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,560
vinegars

1882
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:17,119
i love um in korean nacho farming i'm

1883
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,280
always

1884
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:20,640
it's i'm always joking and it's not

1885
01:12:19,279 --> 01:12:23,039
really a joke it's true

1886
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,159
but like the byproducts of korean

1887
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:27,600
natural farming are

1888
01:12:24,158 --> 01:12:30,879
are cheese and wine and vinegar

1889
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:34,800
gorgeous so i love that and so

1890
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:36,560
with the spent um you know the fpga

1891
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:38,239
solids that are left over after your

1892
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,159
fermented plant juices

1893
01:12:38,238 --> 01:12:41,759
uh yeah you can you can make vinegars

1894
01:12:40,158 --> 01:12:44,879
from those you can throw it

1895
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:48,719
in a tub full of you know so one part

1896
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:51,119
plant with like two parts water and some

1897
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:51,920
usually there's enough extra sugar that

1898
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:53,920
you'll be all right

1899
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:56,000
you could toss some extra sugar in there

1900
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:58,239
and then you could pitch like a kombucha

1901
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,319
or a jun scoby in there

1902
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:03,519
that really kick starts the process i

1903
01:13:00,319 --> 01:13:05,439
used john's gobies with all my vinegars

1904
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:08,000
made some really nice like mugwort

1905
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:10,319
vinegars and nettle vinegars

1906
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,479
um you can also make wines you know

1907
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:13,920
which essentially it's the same thing

1908
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:16,319
only you would do

1909
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:18,079
an anaerobic ferment rather than aerobic

1910
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:21,279
ferment for the vinegars

1911
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:23,439
anaerobic for the wine uh do you throw

1912
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:26,399
extra yeast in there

1913
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:27,279
yeah yeah i do pitch my own ease yeah i

1914
01:13:26,399 --> 01:13:30,839
mean

1915
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:32,000
theoretically you could you could pitch

1916
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:34,480
some uh

1917
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,439
local material some plant matter some

1918
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:38,079
fruit and

1919
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:39,759
inoculate with a local yeast but i

1920
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:42,880
usually kick start like uh

1921
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:46,480
primarily i'm using a jun culture uh

1922
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:50,159
for for all my vinegars um

1923
01:13:46,479 --> 01:13:52,559
and then so to take that a step further

1924
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:54,879
with these plants so let's say we made

1925
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:57,760
fermented plant juice

1926
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,880
of mugwort let's just say so then you

1927
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,719
would

1928
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:02,960
collect your juices you'd have those

1929
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:04,319
solids you can make a wine or vinegar

1930
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,719
out of those right

1931
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:08,559
and then when you're done with that what

1932
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:11,679
i'm doing with those scraps now

1933
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:15,199
is i'm actually making a mixed compost

1934
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:17,840
and this year i made um

1935
01:14:15,198 --> 01:14:19,519
with all my food scraps i did a mixed

1936
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:22,960
compost with all my

1937
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:24,080
spent vinegar and fpga solids and then

1938
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:27,359
all my food scraps

1939
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:29,359
and i was amazed at i did this mixed

1940
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:32,479
compost pile with all that

1941
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:36,079
layered in um you know

1942
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:38,959
cardboard and did kind of a lasagna with

1943
01:14:36,079 --> 01:14:40,719
imo sprinkled in and soaked my cardboard

1944
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:44,000
and lactic acid bacteria

1945
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:46,319
and just kind of did layers and created

1946
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,479
the most beautiful compost

1947
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:50,079
that i'm gonna make an im05 with it's a

1948
01:14:48,479 --> 01:14:53,279
mixed compost

1949
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:56,000
and um i mean just from my food scraps

1950
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:56,800
and the the solids from these vinegars

1951
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,119
and stuff

1952
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:00,960
you know i made like a whole truck bed

1953
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:03,760
full of compost and

1954
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:05,439
uh i just uh top dressed my veggie

1955
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:08,800
garden with all that

1956
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:09,198
that's beautiful yeah so so really we we

1957
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:12,079
can

1958
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:13,039
we have three steps to using that plant

1959
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:16,079
i mean

1960
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:16,399
you know there there is no waste um you

1961
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:19,439
know

1962
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:22,960
waste is a human design flaw in nature

1963
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:23,599
there is no waste uh it's a principle i

1964
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,520
take

1965
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:31,440
seriously that's beautiful

1966
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:33,280
good job oh thank you you too i love

1967
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:35,198
i love what you're up to these clay

1968
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:36,880
balls have me fascinated

1969
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:38,960
oh i'm gonna send you some i'm gonna

1970
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:40,400
send you some and i want to i want your

1971
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:43,159
feedback on them they're

1972
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:46,079
they they surprise me all the time

1973
01:15:43,159 --> 01:15:47,920
[Music]

1974
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:50,479
yeah so where did you get the

1975
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:53,520
inspiration for that was that

1976
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:55,198
well i'm still i'm everybody i'm still

1977
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,560
planting out there i'm still going to be

1978
01:15:55,198 --> 01:15:58,000
working on this video which is full

1979
01:15:56,560 --> 01:15:59,440
disclosure but i might as well take this

1980
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,920
opportunity to do it

1981
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:03,039
i mean the recipe for the fermented clay

1982
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:07,039
comes from the

1983
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:09,760
the green book the swamp right

1984
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:12,479
right so basically that's going to give

1985
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:16,159
you the basic fermented clay recipe

1986
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:19,759
and then i took that further and uh

1987
01:16:16,158 --> 01:16:21,198
added um and did the bokashi from that

1988
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:23,119
and i also actually

1989
01:16:21,198 --> 01:16:24,559
will take that opportunity i'm gonna be

1990
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:25,760
i have this is

1991
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:27,760
i'll send you some of this too this is

1992
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:30,800
the bokashi from the same

1993
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,800
nice the same inoculant um so everybody

1994
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,400
can do it

1995
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,480
i still think we should be supporting

1996
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:37,679
each other in economy so please do still

1997
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,639
buy my balls but

1998
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:40,640
make your own as well

1999
01:16:41,039 --> 01:16:44,880
yeah absolutely i'll buy it yeah i got

2000
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,800
the recipe from that

2001
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,560
so it's like you know it's a whole

2002
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:51,600
process so you're

2003
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:53,360
um utilizing pond water and

2004
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:56,079
i mean i'm i'm throwing a bunch of stuff

2005
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:56,960
in there like the i'm making sure that

2006
01:16:56,079 --> 01:17:00,399
i'm

2007
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:03,439
getting into that bio film at the in the

2008
01:17:00,399 --> 01:17:04,079
in the in the pristine pond areas and

2009
01:17:03,439 --> 01:17:07,839
just

2010
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:11,920
trying to capture um as much of that

2011
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:12,480
strata as i can and what i mean what i'm

2012
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:14,800
just

2013
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:16,559
talking about this sort of crosstalk

2014
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:18,079
that happens when we get involved with

2015
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,840
these natural systems and how our

2016
01:17:18,079 --> 01:17:22,158
intuition works and how

2017
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,880
you know i mean natural farming really

2018
01:17:22,158 --> 01:17:25,039
does bring

2019
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:27,119
forward this ability to communicate with

2020
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:30,399
nature in ways that we're not used to

2021
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:32,079
right so just working with balls and

2022
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:34,238
working with the facultatives and the

2023
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:37,519
anaerobic bacteria

2024
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:39,919
i'm i'm looking at the entire

2025
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:42,159
world differently like i'm seeing

2026
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,880
everything from the clays the salts the

2027
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:44,399
silts

2028
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:46,560
all the way up to the layers of

2029
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:49,039
vacutative into the aerobics

2030
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:50,719
and into those top layers and into the

2031
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:51,840
trophic layers of insects and animals

2032
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:55,039
and plants and then

2033
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:58,960
like trees and clouds and sky like we're

2034
01:17:55,039 --> 01:18:02,079
all in these stre it's a stratification

2035
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:03,439
and like it we're all this crosstalk

2036
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:06,640
going on

2037
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:08,399
all through that system and there is no

2038
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,560
waste and we are a part of it

2039
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:12,319
a part of nature and there is just this

2040
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,000
infinite level of communication that

2041
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:16,399
happens all the way from the clays

2042
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,760
to the clouds and a circular motion all

2043
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:22,399
the way back through

2044
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:26,159
so anyway that

2045
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:28,399
i sounded stoned just now

2046
01:18:26,158 --> 01:18:30,238
but it's just he's bought they just be

2047
01:18:28,399 --> 01:18:31,279
working with these guys working with the

2048
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:35,439
fat potatoes

2049
01:18:31,279 --> 01:18:38,319
has taught me so much about

2050
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:40,238
the layers i guess the stratification

2051
01:18:38,319 --> 01:18:43,279
the way

2052
01:18:40,238 --> 01:18:43,919
the way nature is the way life evolved

2053
01:18:43,279 --> 01:18:47,039
the way

2054
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:49,920
the way life evolves from

2055
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:50,479
from clay the way we come from clay

2056
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:52,640
right

2057
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:54,000
and the way that's the amplification

2058
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,880
moment that's kind of the moment

2059
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,719
when clay becomes food and there's this

2060
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:01,039
like amplification that happens from

2061
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:04,319
there and if we can start

2062
01:19:01,039 --> 01:19:06,479
you um riding that wave and helping that

2063
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:07,439
amplification to happen then we start to

2064
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:10,799
see this

2065
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:14,479
this regenerative cycle start to happen

2066
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:18,560
right yeah i love that it's great

2067
01:19:14,479 --> 01:19:20,799
very cool yeah so yeah i learned

2068
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:22,560
huh i haven't experimented with the

2069
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,000
clays or um

2070
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:26,000
yeah there's some really cool stuff in

2071
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,719
that that sarn book i've been checking

2072
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,439
out

2073
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:31,039
yeah yeah yeah yeah um and i think as a

2074
01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:33,359
community if we're if we're playing

2075
01:19:31,039 --> 01:19:35,039
let's be transparent about it all and

2076
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:36,559
you know supportive of each other so

2077
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:38,319
yeah i'll send you some of these and i'd

2078
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,360
love to hear back what you end up doing

2079
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:42,079
with them

2080
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:43,839
great they're so easy you can just like

2081
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:45,439
in the reservoir you just drop them in

2082
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,480
you don't even have to aerate i mean i

2083
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:49,439
love the anaerobics

2084
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:50,799
wow it's just very low left like low

2085
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:52,639
maintenance

2086
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:54,960
nice so where are you and they're

2087
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:58,079
actually cleaning my pumps

2088
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:59,920
well really are you getting the clay are

2089
01:19:58,079 --> 01:20:02,079
you getting the clay from the pond too

2090
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:04,000
or where do you harvest your clay yeah

2091
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:06,079
i'm getting i'm actually working with

2092
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:09,439
different kinds of clay right now

2093
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:10,000
um i think every clay probably has a

2094
01:20:09,439 --> 01:20:13,119
different

2095
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:14,238
a different quality um this particular

2096
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:17,840
clay i'm getting from an

2097
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:19,198
area that's very has been extremely

2098
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:21,199
active like there's

2099
01:20:19,198 --> 01:20:22,479
you can find dinosaur bones in this

2100
01:20:21,198 --> 01:20:24,638
canyon like it's

2101
01:20:22,479 --> 01:20:26,959
you know i think the clay is pretty uh

2102
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:30,800
phenomenal it's a red clay

2103
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:32,960
um oh nice but it's yeah

2104
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,560
but i'm done experimenting with greens

2105
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:37,198
and white clays right now too

2106
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:39,280
oh cool yeah there's uh there's a lot of

2107
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:42,638
gray clay along the coast i found

2108
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:45,198
you know big sections of gray clay so

2109
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:47,520
it'd be fun to experiment with that oh

2110
01:20:45,198 --> 01:20:49,678
yeah and jess i know when she did some

2111
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:53,199
fermented clay she got a lot of the

2112
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:56,639
um the purple sulfur

2113
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:58,238
loving stuff so oh nice but i don't i

2114
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:59,840
didn't get some i don't know

2115
01:20:58,238 --> 01:21:01,359
leighton is going to help me figure out

2116
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:03,360
what's in these

2117
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:07,519
great but but i can talk about

2118
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:07,519
observation being a guide like

2119
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:10,960
just understanding that these that this

2120
01:21:10,238 --> 01:21:14,559
clay

2121
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:18,239
is an insane food supply

2122
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:21,360
for insects informs me

2123
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:22,000
of what kind of anaerobes we're dealing

2124
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:25,359
with

2125
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,198
and that there's actually a natural

2126
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:30,238
source

2127
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:33,439
of chitin oh

2128
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:34,718
yes from the anaerobic community oh

2129
01:21:33,439 --> 01:21:37,119
really

2130
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:38,560
yes yes but i don't need to go collect

2131
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:42,399
crab shells from the beach

2132
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:44,239
and do it uh style liquid ferment

2133
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:45,920
no i think it's simpler i think you can

2134
01:21:44,238 --> 01:21:50,638
get it

2135
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:54,480
wow cool i like that idea right i know

2136
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:55,279
yeah i have done some of the um jadon

2137
01:21:54,479 --> 01:21:59,119
style

2138
01:21:55,279 --> 01:22:01,759
like the chitin with um crab shells

2139
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:03,760
yeah what was the new result from that

2140
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:07,199
um i really liked it yeah

2141
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:10,400
i i found it to be very effective

2142
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:12,000
and just it's so i always joke with

2143
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:14,719
jadom it's like

2144
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,639
yeah just toss it in a bucket of water

2145
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:20,880
with leaf mold and

2146
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:20,880
you're good exactly

2147
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:24,399
you know from from human waste to you

2148
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:28,000
know from

2149
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:30,319
food scraps to plants to you know

2150
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,520
shells to to whatever i mean that's kind

2151
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:34,719
of the approach

2152
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:39,360
yeah it's kind of breakdown yeah

2153
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:42,319
let nature do it right

2154
01:22:39,359 --> 01:22:44,079
oh so cool all right well i have a huge

2155
01:22:42,319 --> 01:22:45,759
package to get off to you it's going to

2156
01:22:44,079 --> 01:22:48,960
include some of the

2157
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:52,719
some of the uh lettuce awesome

2158
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:55,119
awesome oh my god i can't

2159
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:56,880
it's gonna have clay balls in it and i

2160
01:22:55,119 --> 01:22:57,439
promise you i'm gonna get that off today

2161
01:22:56,880 --> 01:23:00,000
actually

2162
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:01,759

2168
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:11,359
as we kind of

2169
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:15,199
you know while we're on the wedding

2170
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:18,559
agent um

2171
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:20,238
yeah i would like to talk about real

2172
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:22,159
quick i mean pretty much covered what i

2173
01:23:20,238 --> 01:23:26,000
wanted to as far as

2174
01:23:22,158 --> 01:23:29,759
um plants and wild crafting

2175
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:34,079
and kind of mixing jadam and

2176
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:36,480
um and knf both if anybody wants to

2177
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:38,399
add some questions on on any of that you

2178
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:40,479
know we could take some questions but

2179
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:41,839
um you know while we're kind of talking

2180
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:45,039
about jadom

2181
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:46,960
wedding agent um

2182
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:48,560
there's so many uses for this you know

2183
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:51,039
it's a surfactant

2184
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:51,679
it's it's a it's a wetting agent so you

2185
01:23:51,039 --> 01:23:54,719
can put it

2186
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:56,480
in your reservoirs to help with the

2187
01:23:54,719 --> 01:24:00,158
lateral disbursement

2188
01:23:56,479 --> 01:24:02,000
of feeds in your soil um you know it's a

2189
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:05,119
surfactant so you can use it

2190
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:07,439
in your foliar sprays to help as a

2191
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:07,760
carrier to carry some of these herbs and

2192
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:10,719
and

2193
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,520
other additives sulfur or or what have

2194
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:15,520
you

2195
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:18,880
um you know mineral sands are also

2196
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:22,000
good to intensify insecticides in

2197
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:23,920
you know in this horticultural soap

2198
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,760
um but i'd like to share this so i've

2199
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,039
been making i've been making a lot more

2200
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,360
biochar

2201
01:24:27,039 --> 01:24:30,800
uh this last couple years been doing a

2202
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:34,158
lot of biotar

2203
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:37,119
super stoked about biochar i think it's

2204
01:24:34,158 --> 01:24:37,599
yeah um it's the best amendment you

2205
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:39,840
could put

2206
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:41,120
in the ground especially when you charge

2207
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:44,319
it and i feel like

2208
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:45,679
korean nacho farming has amazing tools

2209
01:24:44,319 --> 01:24:48,799
so does jadam

2210
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:51,279
for helping to charge biochar so

2211
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:52,400
i know this wasn't scheduled in for the

2212
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:56,319
subjects

2213
01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:58,960
uh of talk on on this specific talk but

2214
01:24:56,319 --> 01:24:59,759
um one other application i thought was

2215
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:03,119
really cool

2216
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:06,320
in regards to um biochar was

2217
01:25:03,119 --> 01:25:07,279
so i was in bend i was um i was doing a

2218
01:25:06,319 --> 01:25:09,679
burn

2219
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:11,599
in bend at a friend's farm i was being

2220
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:12,639
consulted to make some biochar and we

2221
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:15,039
had

2222
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:16,319
four acres of hemp residue this massive

2223
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:19,359
pile of hemp

2224
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:21,599
and so we dug this huge pit and

2225
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:22,639
um you know like 10 guys from the

2226
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:25,120
neighborhood

2227
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:25,679
came over and we started a fire and

2228
01:25:25,119 --> 01:25:28,880
we're just

2229
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:31,840
you know chucking big trees of you know

2230
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:33,119
hemp trees into this fire to keep this

2231
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:35,840
fire fed

2232
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:36,319
and um we burned all the way through the

2233
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:39,600
day

2234
01:25:36,319 --> 01:25:41,198
and then it you know it got dark and so

2235
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:42,800
we were burning a bit into the dark and

2236
01:25:41,198 --> 01:25:44,879
then the fire department showed up and

2237
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:46,480
they're like you guys can't burn

2238
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,800
into the dark you're like you're good

2239
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:51,599
you're on ag land like you

2240
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:53,199
you dug this huge pit you guys are all

2241
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:54,639
good there but like

2242
01:25:53,198 --> 01:25:56,399
you just can't burn into the night and

2243
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:58,319
we're like okay we'll put it out

2244
01:25:56,399 --> 01:25:59,759
and then he kind of like the firefighter

2245
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:00,319
laughed at me because we have this huge

2246
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:03,840
pile

2247
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:04,479
like this volcano of you know biochar

2248
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,800
that's still

2249
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:08,000
smoldering and um yeah so i'm out there

2250
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,880
with a hose just hosing

2251
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,840
it down and he said he's he mentioned

2252
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:14,079
he's like

2253
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,440
well just use a wedding agent go get

2254
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:17,359
some dish soap and it like

2255
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:19,198
triggered in my mind i was like yes

2256
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:20,960
that's it because

2257
01:26:19,198 --> 01:26:22,799
when when you're trying to extinguish a

2258
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,198
pile of biochar

2259
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,079
like yeah first of all that's a big pile

2260
01:26:25,198 --> 01:26:28,000
like that

2261
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:30,000
there's evaporation happening but a lot

2262
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,399
of it's going straight down

2263
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:33,760
whereas like if you add so what you can

2264
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:37,359
do is add some

2265
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:39,679
of the the wetting agent to that water

2266
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:41,759
that you're quenching your biochar with

2267
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:43,520
and it's going to help extinguish that

2268
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:45,520
better because it helps with the lateral

2269
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:48,840
disbursement rather than just

2270
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:51,280
going vertical down so you can put out a

2271
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:54,319
fire a lot easier

2272
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:56,960
yeah i bet it has a quality too

2273
01:26:54,319 --> 01:26:58,000
i bet it kind of helps with the uh

2274
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:00,319
penetration

2275
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,479
i bet it helps with the inoculation i'll

2276
01:27:00,319 --> 01:27:05,039
bet it has qualities

2277
01:27:02,479 --> 01:27:07,279
i think so too yeah i'm i'm continuously

2278
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:10,880
amazed at all the applications for

2279
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:11,679
for wedding agents um i mean household

2280
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:14,000
uses too

2281
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:15,359
but but in the in the garden it's it's

2282
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,279
amazing

2283
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:21,039
so i thought that was cool yes of course

2284
01:27:19,279 --> 01:27:24,319
like you can use jwa

2285
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:26,960
like to extinguish biochar too

2286
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:28,000
um because i mean we literally had a

2287
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:31,119
sprinkler on our

2288
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:33,119
this massive pile of biochar four acres

2289
01:27:31,119 --> 01:27:35,519
of hemp that was reduced down

2290
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:36,719
and i had a sprinkler sprinkler going

2291
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:40,080
all night

2292
01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:42,079
and uh and um

2293
01:27:40,079 --> 01:27:43,679
you know it still was is still

2294
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:46,479
smoldering the next day

2295
01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:47,119
so you know we weren't super efficient

2296
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:48,718
some of it

2297
01:27:47,119 --> 01:27:50,399
went to ash you know if you don't put it

2298
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:52,239
out it just goes to ash you know you

2299
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:55,519
don't sequester that carbon

2300
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:57,678
so uh i was really stoked on just

2301
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,960
you know that idea of adding the wedding

2302
01:27:57,679 --> 01:28:02,000
agent to um

2303
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:03,760
to quenching you know the fire that's

2304
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,600
gorgeous thank you for

2305
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:07,760
thank you for that i'm def cause i

2306
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,079
learned i learned how to do biochar from

2307
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,800
you

2308
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:12,479
that that video you put out on facebook

2309
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:15,360
the next day i was out there making

2310
01:28:12,479 --> 01:28:18,158
biochar and i'm nice

2311
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:19,039
right now so yeah now even in this

2312
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:21,119
product now

2313
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:23,600
it's all my own biochar and it's hemp

2314
01:28:21,119 --> 01:28:25,760
and it's all the sort of stems from last

2315
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,480
year's harvest like orac i do a lot with

2316
01:28:25,760 --> 01:28:29,280
orac

2317
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:29,919
and nice and i've been um putting out

2318
01:28:29,279 --> 01:28:33,439
the fire

2319
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:35,440
using rice hall so i'll get a huge

2320
01:28:33,439 --> 01:28:37,279
container of rice hole so as i'm burning

2321
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:38,479
the fire and i'll start with the big

2322
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:40,000
pieces first

2323
01:28:38,479 --> 01:28:42,000
and then i go to the smaller and smaller

2324
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:45,198
and i'll suffocate the fire as i

2325
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,600
go with the rice with the rice hall

2326
01:28:45,198 --> 01:28:49,039
right okay so it's literally made the

2327
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:52,719
biochar at the end is

2328
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:54,639
probably at least a third

2329
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:56,000
um rice hole in addition to everything

2330
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:58,480
else i see

2331
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,560
so you're not quenching with water then

2332
01:28:58,479 --> 01:29:02,319
i am at the very very end but i'm

2333
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:04,960
definitely quenching as i go

2334
01:29:02,319 --> 01:29:06,238
so i'm not having to do that major work

2335
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:09,359
at the end of putting it

2336
01:29:06,238 --> 01:29:10,559
yeah right like right it does do the

2337
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:13,599
work of suffocation

2338
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:16,960
as it goes so it's kind of cool yeah

2339
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:18,480
very cool yeah excellent yeah i'll have

2340
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:21,600
to try that with the rice holes

2341
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:22,399
uh it's cool you know that's ricehole

2342
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:25,199
biochar

2343
01:29:22,399 --> 01:29:26,559
is some of the most ancient biochar um i

2344
01:29:25,198 --> 01:29:28,399
mean i think

2345
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,320
different cultures across the globe are

2346
01:29:28,399 --> 01:29:32,638
making biochar

2347
01:29:30,319 --> 01:29:32,639
out of

2348
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:39,839
oops where'd you go is it me

2349
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:44,399
that might be our end how's it is

2350
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:52,079
everybody else still getting

2351
01:29:44,399 --> 01:29:54,960
a reception or did we lose preston

2352
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:55,920
we certainly got a lot of information in

2353
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:57,279
um

2354
01:29:55,920 --> 01:30:00,480
this session i'm sure we're going to be

2355
01:29:57,279 --> 01:30:00,479
talking to preston again

2356
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:06,480
to to share and the sooner that we can

2357
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:09,759
get yeah he went

2358
01:30:06,479 --> 01:30:11,678
um the sooner that we can get together

2359
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:13,600
as a working community actually doing

2360
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:14,399
the work of regeneration the sooner that

2361
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,719
we can

2362
01:30:14,399 --> 01:30:18,238
i believe we can restore our planet in a

2363
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:19,760
matter of

2364
01:30:18,238 --> 01:30:21,599
i used to think it was seven years with

2365
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:22,000
permaculture i believe that we can if we

2366
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:23,840
all

2367
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:25,520
do a concerted effort we can do this in

2368
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:27,760
three years and um

2369
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,280
preston with his earlier part of this

2370
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,360
talk

2371
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:33,679
talked about how he remediated his pr

2372
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:35,519
his property that was basically cliche

2373
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:36,399
and hard clays in a matter of three

2374
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:40,320
months

2375
01:30:36,399 --> 01:30:43,679
using a mixture of lab and um

2376
01:30:40,319 --> 01:30:46,840
jns so i'm super excited

2377
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:48,560
uh about the talk that we just had and

2378
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:51,920
um

2379
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:51,920
and i'm definitely going to be

2380
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:56,960
getting this live to you all on facebook

2381
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:58,239
and instagram so if you missed anything

2382
01:30:56,960 --> 01:31:00,639
you can join

2383
01:30:58,238 --> 01:31:01,599
um wood shavings work like the rice

2384
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:04,480
halls

2385
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:06,079
sure i mean but the right i like the

2386
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:09,759
rice holes especially

2387
01:31:06,079 --> 01:31:11,920
for well for so many reasons um

2388
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:12,960
it has the silica in it but also just

2389
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:16,158
the shape of it

2390
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:18,800
is i don't know there's something just

2391
01:31:16,158 --> 01:31:19,759
aesthetically beautiful and i think

2392
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:21,760
aesthetics and

2393
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:23,280
function go hand in hand sometimes that

2394
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:25,600
little moon shape

2395
01:31:23,279 --> 01:31:27,759
that it has i think it's just it's good

2396
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:29,199
for aerating the soil and

2397
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:33,199
all kinds of things harry he's coming

2398
01:31:29,198 --> 01:31:33,198
back let's say good let's get him back

2399
01:31:37,359 --> 01:31:43,439
happy mid-summer from sweden i'll be

2400
01:31:40,079 --> 01:31:46,319
re-watching i'm so happy to see you here

2401
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:46,319
hi monica

2402
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:51,199
i'm sorry again i was so sad to see you

2403
01:31:50,079 --> 01:31:53,039
i was like

2404
01:31:51,198 --> 01:31:53,919
well i told everybody we're gonna have

2405
01:31:53,039 --> 01:31:55,760
to have another one of these

2406
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:59,520
conversations though

2407
01:31:55,760 --> 01:32:01,199
okay yeah we will um well i mean it's

2408
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:04,480
just signaling the

2409
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:04,719
the height of the solar day here you

2410
01:32:04,479 --> 01:32:08,559
know

2411
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:10,719
us being on the um the eve of the summer

2412
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:12,560
solstice my phone

2413
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:13,760
my phone just turned off from heat

2414
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:16,639
temperature so

2415
01:32:13,760 --> 01:32:18,800
i think that's a sign hilarious do you

2416
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:19,359
have any ceremonies planned for this

2417
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,000
evening

2418
01:32:19,359 --> 01:32:22,000
or any kind of

2419
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:27,039

in the alley when we were in boise yeah

2427

um you know i would like to i would like

2430
01:32:47,198 --> 01:32:50,479
to you know it's

2431
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,600
it's possible to make it what is that

2432
01:32:50,479 --> 01:32:54,959
october

2433
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:58,400
it's august

2434
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:59,359
yeah possibly if i can sneak away yeah i

2435
01:32:58,399 --> 01:33:00,960
i would love to be

2436
01:32:59,359 --> 01:33:02,559
i would love to that's always such a

2437
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:04,480
good i'd like to find i'd like to find a

2438
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:04,800
way to see you again or visit anyway but

2439
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:08,000
like

2440
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:10,800
that so so that night um i did a

2441
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
poll downstairs in the in the basement

2442
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,719
of that dinner

2443
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,679
to find out how many geminis were in the

2444
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:17,760
room

2445
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:19,039
and do you know of the soil stewards

2446
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:22,000
probably a good

2447
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:22,639
more than half of us are geminized

2448
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,439
really

2449
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:26,880
wow isn't that weird like i think gemini

2450
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:28,960
gemini's tend to

2451
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:31,039
be natural farmers for some reason it

2452
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:34,880
seems to suit us

2453
01:33:31,039 --> 01:33:38,000
yeah yeah interesting okay anyway

2454
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:38,560
happy birthday fellow gemini thank you

2455
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,960
you too

2456
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:42,239
and and happy uh happy solstice we're

2457
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:45,679
right on

2458
01:33:42,238 --> 01:33:45,678
the eve and and um

2459
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:52,159
fire ring eclipse too

2460
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:53,919
so that's that's really powerful as well

2461
01:33:52,158 --> 01:33:56,960
powerful

2462
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:59,920
um so speaking of firing somebody just

2463
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:00,480
asked about making biochar in a fire pit

2464
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,319
and

2465
01:34:00,479 --> 01:34:05,439
yeah you can make biochar on a fire pit

2466
01:34:02,319 --> 01:34:08,479
for sure i make it that's how i do it

2467
01:34:05,439 --> 01:34:09,198
yeah likewise uh you know i've made it

2468
01:34:08,479 --> 01:34:12,238
in little

2469
01:34:09,198 --> 01:34:14,638
hibachis you know little um

2470
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:16,319
barbecue hibachis i did a demonstration

2471
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:18,880
in hawaii when i was there

2472
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:20,960
uh and did it in a little hibachi it was

2473
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:22,239
all i had and we made biochar on a real

2474
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:26,000
small scale

2475
01:34:22,238 --> 01:34:28,399
um but that fire pit is essentially um

2476
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,399
i use really like archaic technology i

2477
01:34:28,399 --> 01:34:30,960
love like archaic technologies and so

2478
01:34:30,399 --> 01:34:33,920
like

2479
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:35,119
you know i'll just dig a pit and so this

2480
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:38,000
is like the

2481
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:39,840
kontiki kiln which essentially you can

2482
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:43,118
just dig a pit in the ground

2483
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:44,239
to do biochar and then the specific

2484
01:34:43,118 --> 01:34:46,238
angle

2485
01:34:44,238 --> 01:34:48,079
you know really works with the thermal

2486
01:34:46,238 --> 01:34:51,118
dynamics and producing it

2487
01:34:48,079 --> 01:34:55,118
um you know in a very um

2488
01:34:51,118 --> 01:34:55,118
in a method that's very efficient

2489
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:58,880
so so yeah that question absolutely you

2490
01:34:58,479 --> 01:35:01,599
can

2491
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:02,480
you can um make biochar in a fire pit

2492
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:04,639
it's

2493
01:35:02,479 --> 01:35:06,638
it's uh it's really basic it just comes

2494
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:09,359
down to pyrolysis you know

2495
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:11,440
you need a really hot core and then you

2496
01:35:09,359 --> 01:35:13,439
want to reduce oxidation so anytime

2497
01:35:11,439 --> 01:35:14,079
you're seeing white ash is when you want

2498
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:16,879
to

2499
01:35:14,079 --> 01:35:17,920
feed that fire fuel so you need a really

2500
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,639
hot core

2501
01:35:17,920 --> 01:35:21,039
and then you need to continuously feed

2502
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:23,440
that

2503
01:35:21,039 --> 01:35:25,359
fire um and like you were saying about

2504
01:35:23,439 --> 01:35:26,799
the rice holes almost put it out so

2505
01:35:25,359 --> 01:35:30,559
usually you start with

2506
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:32,560
you know bigger uh fuel and then you

2507
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:35,119
you reduce that the smaller pieces and

2508
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:37,119
kind of almost suffocated out

2509
01:35:35,118 --> 01:35:38,559
yeah um so that you're you're

2510
01:35:37,118 --> 01:35:40,399
sequestering that carbon

2511
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:42,080
because if you're seeing smoke you're

2512
01:35:40,399 --> 01:35:44,479
not burning efficiently

2513
01:35:42,079 --> 01:35:46,960
you're you're releasing carbon um and

2514
01:35:44,479 --> 01:35:49,039
those volatiles off

2515
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:50,319
yeah and then yeah not seeing getting to

2516
01:35:49,039 --> 01:35:51,920
that point where it's hot enough not to

2517
01:35:50,319 --> 01:35:53,198
see smoke and then every time you see

2518
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:55,118
ash is when i take

2519
01:35:53,198 --> 01:35:56,799
basically a handful of char and i throw

2520
01:35:55,118 --> 01:35:59,439
it right at that spot

2521
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,920
and then if you're just like managing

2522
01:35:59,439 --> 01:36:02,079
the

2523
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:03,279
white ash at that point then you can

2524
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:06,479
really

2525
01:36:03,279 --> 01:36:08,079
you can really control how much um

2526
01:36:06,479 --> 01:36:10,000
you can keep it a pretty efficient

2527
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:12,960
production of char

2528
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,760
yeah definitely yeah it's it got kind of

2529
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,439
tricky on

2530
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:17,440
on a large scale when i was you know

2531
01:36:15,439 --> 01:36:19,198
that burn i didn't bend where

2532
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:21,359
we had the four acres i mean literally

2533
01:36:19,198 --> 01:36:23,919
we had 10 guys throwing

2534
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:25,039
you know hemp trees on that thing and it

2535
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:27,440
was like

2536
01:36:25,039 --> 01:36:29,198
talk about like feeding a dragon that

2537
01:36:27,439 --> 01:36:32,559
thing was insane

2538
01:36:29,198 --> 01:36:35,279
so um

2539
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:37,039
yeah we could have been more efficient

2540
01:36:35,279 --> 01:36:37,679
there was definitely some oxidation we

2541
01:36:37,039 --> 01:36:40,639
were seeing

2542
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:42,719
like some some white ash but you know we

2543
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:43,920
we also at the end of that burn we had

2544
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:47,198
uh

2545
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:50,319
i think we got about four you know

2546
01:36:47,198 --> 01:36:51,039
f-150 truck beds of biochar from that

2547
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:54,799
burn

2548
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:59,279
that's gorgeous we uh we inoculated that

2549
01:36:54,800 --> 01:37:00,159
charged it with um jms genome microbial

2550
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:03,519
solution

2551
01:37:00,158 --> 01:37:06,319
um seawater and uh

2552
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:07,440
some humic acid before applying that out

2553
01:37:06,319 --> 01:37:09,840
to the fields

2554
01:37:07,439 --> 01:37:10,479
did you let that sit and did you did you

2555
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,920
uh

2556
01:37:10,479 --> 01:37:17,519
do it to saturation basically yes

2557
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:19,760
yes definitely i'm a big proponent of

2558
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:21,280
being patient with your biochar there's

2559
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,000
kind of some different information

2560
01:37:21,279 --> 01:37:24,719
online

2561
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,679
uh about charging i think charging

2562
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:28,960
biochar is

2563
01:37:25,679 --> 01:37:32,000
is is one of the

2564
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:33,600
most overlooked things with biochar like

2565
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,719
there's a lot of biotar out there for

2566
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:38,880
sale and it is not all created equal

2567
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:40,480
charging is like really crucial because

2568
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:41,920
if you don't charge your biochar you're

2569
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:44,718
essentially putting out

2570
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:46,399
a carbon sponge that's going to leach up

2571
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:48,800
any nutrients

2572
01:37:46,399 --> 01:37:50,719
in your soil and that might take years

2573
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,480
for it to charge it's going to rob

2574
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:54,719
those nutrients from your plants so

2575
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:57,039
charging is absolutely crucial

2576
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:58,719
i think it's even some of these bigger

2577
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:00,800
companies that are using like fish

2578
01:37:58,719 --> 01:38:02,158
hydrolysate i don't think that's a good

2579
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:05,360
way to to

2580
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:06,960
charge biochar there's a pretty i was

2581
01:38:05,359 --> 01:38:09,039
privy to be part of a

2582
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:10,158
uh interesting conversation when i was

2583
01:38:09,039 --> 01:38:11,760
in hawaii

2584
01:38:10,158 --> 01:38:14,238
and uh you know i was sitting with

2585
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:17,039
master cho and

2586
01:38:14,238 --> 01:38:17,759
and this guy came to the workshop who

2587
01:38:17,039 --> 01:38:20,880
was making

2588
01:38:17,760 --> 01:38:22,880
all this faa fish amino acids and

2589
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:24,000
he was kind of using this method that

2590
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:26,079
was not

2591
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:27,760
like the way master cho teaches it you

2592
01:38:26,079 --> 01:38:29,600
know essentially what he was doing was

2593
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:32,079
filling buckets with fish

2594
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:33,920
and then actually adding some water in

2595
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:37,198
there and then capping it with sugar

2596
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:39,440
so he wasn't equally using you know

2597
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:41,039
fish and sugar together he was just

2598
01:38:39,439 --> 01:38:43,439
capping it with sugar

2599
01:38:41,039 --> 01:38:44,560
and had this so he brought like a sample

2600
01:38:43,439 --> 01:38:47,678
of this stuff

2601
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:49,440
and uh and it was super watered down

2602
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:51,199
and it was just it was really funny

2603
01:38:49,439 --> 01:38:53,198
because i'm sitting there with him

2604
01:38:51,198 --> 01:38:55,359
and master cho and master cho's

2605
01:38:53,198 --> 01:38:58,799
granddaughter is translating for him

2606
01:38:55,359 --> 01:39:00,319
and uh and so just the expression on his

2607
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:04,960
face when this guy

2608
01:39:00,319 --> 01:39:09,599
showed his um the the biochar

2609
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:12,319
and uh in his fa well the faa

2610
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:13,039
was super you know watered down and the

2611
01:39:12,319 --> 01:39:14,960
master cho

2612
01:39:13,039 --> 01:39:17,519
is just like no no no no like you need

2613
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:20,639
to layer this with sugar

2614
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:21,679
and um but then he was talking about

2615
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:24,239
charging it

2616
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:25,199
with his charging the biochar with the

2617
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:28,718
f8

2618
01:39:25,198 --> 01:39:30,879
well the faa that he was creating and

2619
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:32,480
master cho was like no no no no you're

2620
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:35,679
not gonna get like

2621
01:39:32,479 --> 01:39:36,559
a good enough spectrum of microbes from

2622
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:40,480
using

2623
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:43,360
like fish emulsion or a fish product

2624
01:39:40,479 --> 01:39:43,759
charging your biochar so this is where

2625
01:39:43,359 --> 01:39:45,920
like

2626
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:47,119
imo really comes in because you have

2627
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:49,920
this like

2628
01:39:47,118 --> 01:39:51,198
broader spectrum of microbes you know

2629
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:54,719
and so

2630
01:39:51,198 --> 01:39:55,599
i love adding biochar to making uh imo 3

2631
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:57,118
piles

2632
01:39:55,600 --> 01:39:59,600
i find that's that's a really good

2633
01:39:57,118 --> 01:40:03,039
approach to starting the process

2634
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:05,039
of charging but um yeah i'll i'll

2635
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:06,880
generally let my biochar

2636
01:40:05,039 --> 01:40:08,158
i like to make it in the burn months you

2637
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:10,000
know because right now like

2638
01:40:08,158 --> 01:40:11,679
burn season's over it can't even burn

2639
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,840
right now yeah you know

2640
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:14,880
it's really sensitive here in oregon

2641
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:18,079
california

2642
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:19,840
and um so

2643
01:40:18,079 --> 01:40:21,359
i'll make it in those burn months and

2644
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:26,000
then i put it in barrels

2645
01:40:21,359 --> 01:40:29,198
and i make my jms my

2646
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:33,039
imots liquid imots and

2647
01:40:29,198 --> 01:40:35,519
charge it uh for two to three months

2648
01:40:33,039 --> 01:40:36,158
i think it's necessary to charge biochar

2649
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:38,000
um

2650
01:40:36,158 --> 01:40:39,198
i'm not somebody who thinks you can just

2651
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,158
like charge biochar

2652
01:40:39,198 --> 01:40:43,039
in a week and there is some information

2653
01:40:42,158 --> 01:40:45,198
out there

2654
01:40:43,039 --> 01:40:46,880
you know saying stuff like that so i

2655
01:40:45,198 --> 01:40:49,599
think it takes time

2656
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:50,000
yeah so i was listening to some of uh

2657
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:53,280
master

2658
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,639
cho's um lectures and there was i kind

2659
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:57,759
of pulled a

2660
01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:58,719
soil recipe and he was he mentioned that

2661
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:02,159
he was um

2662
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:04,158
treating the biochar with vinegar and

2663
01:41:02,158 --> 01:41:07,519
you know biochar is naturally

2664
01:41:04,158 --> 01:41:09,279
alkaline do you ever do any and i

2665
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:12,080
kind of figured out what it would take

2666
01:41:09,279 --> 01:41:13,039
to get it to about a 6.8 or something

2667
01:41:12,079 --> 01:41:18,238
was about an

2668
01:41:13,039 --> 01:41:20,399
ounce of vinegar to saturated char

2669
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:21,839
so that's kind of what i do okay yeah i

2670
01:41:20,399 --> 01:41:25,118
do that even before

2671
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:28,560
i uh charge it are you finding

2672
01:41:25,118 --> 01:41:31,118
that the alkalinity are you

2673
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:32,639
do you have any insight into that well

2674
01:41:31,118 --> 01:41:34,719
one one thing to add is one of the

2675
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:37,359
by-products of making biochar

2676
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:38,239
is what's called wood vinegar which is

2677
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:40,559
being used

2678
01:41:38,238 --> 01:41:42,399
it has some really interesting uh some

2679
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:45,440
research is being done and it

2680
01:41:42,399 --> 01:41:47,839
has a history of being used uh in japan

2681
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:47,839
and elsewhere

2682
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:53,118
there you go again

2683
01:41:54,158 --> 01:42:00,799
i guess there's a saturation point for

2684
01:41:56,479 --> 01:42:03,439
uh shared knowledge

2685
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:06,639
okay we should have taken that

2686
01:42:03,439 --> 01:42:06,638
opportunity to say goodbye

2687
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:11,440
this is going to be fun this could be

2688
01:42:09,439 --> 01:42:13,118
fun can talk about so um there was a

2689
01:42:11,439 --> 01:42:15,839
question about talking about fermented

2690
01:42:13,118 --> 01:42:15,839
seawater

2691
01:42:17,118 --> 01:42:21,759
on the coast so i'm not able to utilize

2692
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:24,800
real sea water so i end up using

2693
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:29,840
um sea salt a lot and

2694
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:29,840
my fermentations hey you're welcome

2695
01:42:31,039 --> 01:42:34,238
it's really nice to see you all here and

2696
01:42:33,039 --> 01:42:36,639
um

2697
01:42:34,238 --> 01:42:37,759
so yeah i'm my fermented seawater takes

2698
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:42,159
the form of just

2699
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:44,560
adding you know uh following the recipe

2700
01:42:42,158 --> 01:42:46,158
that i have um and leaving it for 24

2701
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:47,440
hours but i'm sure that um

2702
01:42:46,158 --> 01:42:49,039
preston would have something different

2703
01:42:47,439 --> 01:42:50,559
to say about fermented seawater so we'll

2704
01:42:49,039 --> 01:42:52,319
get some information

2705
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:54,080
at the next conversation i'll put a mark

2706
01:42:52,319 --> 01:42:56,238
i'll put a note in to

2707
01:42:54,079 --> 01:42:58,639
to talk about um or some of you coast

2708
01:42:56,238 --> 01:43:00,399
dwellers we'll talk about seawater

2709
01:42:58,639 --> 01:43:02,159
chris might have some insight to that

2710
01:43:00,399 --> 01:43:03,118
too as well so we'll get some

2711
01:43:02,158 --> 01:43:06,319
information out

2712
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:07,920
um it's been really fun you guys i'm

2713
01:43:06,319 --> 01:43:09,359
i'm really enjoying these friday

2714
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:13,520
sessions

2715
01:43:09,359 --> 01:43:15,118
and uh get in touch with me if there's

2716
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:17,040
anything you want to know about or if

2717
01:43:15,118 --> 01:43:19,599
anybody wants to come on and talk

2718
01:43:17,039 --> 01:43:20,719
about their experiences or you know i

2719
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,960
just feel like this is an

2720
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:26,800
oh this should be a platform for us to

2721
01:43:22,960 --> 01:43:26,800
have conversations and really

2722
01:43:27,359 --> 01:43:30,479
have conversations about the things that

2723
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:31,039
are really beginning to matter in our

2724
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:33,118
world

2725
01:43:31,039 --> 01:43:35,279
like i'm just coming into this awareness

2726
01:43:33,118 --> 01:43:38,639
of what's actually happening

2727
01:43:35,279 --> 01:43:41,359
with with uh the plant's immune

2728
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:42,239
function and our relationship with this

2729
01:43:41,359 --> 01:43:45,920
with the micro

2730
01:43:42,238 --> 01:43:49,039
microbial world including the anaerobics

2731
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:51,840
um right

2732
01:43:49,039 --> 01:43:52,560
as the coronavirus is coming into our

2733
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:55,520
awareness

2734
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:57,840
and i just there's just such a

2735
01:43:55,520 --> 01:44:00,159
disconnect between

2736
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:02,719
what's really happening in our world and

2737
01:44:00,158 --> 01:44:06,879
how where it's being interpreted for us

2738
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:09,039
as far as policy and uh

2739
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:10,960
and in trying to isolate us so i feel

2740
01:44:09,039 --> 01:44:12,158
like these platforms are really

2741
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:15,359
important because

2742
01:44:12,158 --> 01:44:18,559
we need to be able to come together and

2743
01:44:15,359 --> 01:44:20,399
talk openly and uh free source

2744
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:22,159
about these things so we're going to go

2745
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:26,638
live one more time

2746
01:44:22,158 --> 01:44:28,479
and we're going to say probably give it

2747
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:30,719
let this be an opportunity to say

2748
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:34,238
goodbye and we will see you again soon

2749
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:37,760
probably we're connecting back hi

2750
01:44:34,238 --> 01:44:40,638
again hello i'm so sorry

2751
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:42,239
no hey it's the way it is i'm sitting in

2752
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:42,960
the shade now because i keep getting

2753
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:44,319
temperature

2754
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:46,239
like my phone keeps dying from

2755
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:48,880
temperature it's getting so hot

2756
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:50,479
wow well i appreciate you taking time

2757
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:53,039
out of your busy schedule

2758
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:55,198
and doing what you're doing to to share

2759
01:44:53,039 --> 01:44:56,960
so much information preston

2760
01:44:55,198 --> 01:44:58,719
i'm happy to thank you for having me

2761
01:44:56,960 --> 01:45:01,600
here yes

2762
01:44:58,719 --> 01:45:02,719
pleasure for sure i love i love the open

2763
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:05,840
source community

2764
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:07,760
in natural farming and uh

2765
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:08,880
you know permaculture and really

2766
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:12,079
herbalism too

2767
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:14,239
so um yeah i think that's

2768
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:16,559
it's a really beautiful thing to to have

2769
01:45:14,238 --> 01:45:19,678
people share their experience and

2770
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:22,400
and uh you know support and um

2771
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:22,800
i just want to continue you know doing

2772
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:24,879
so

2773
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:25,840
in in that in this beautiful community

2774
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:28,800
that we all

2775
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:29,679
are in yeah and somebody did ask about

2776
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:31,199
seawater do you

2777
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:32,960
fermented seawater do you have any

2778
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:34,158
insights to share real quick before we

2779
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:36,960
say goodbye on that one

2780
01:45:34,158 --> 01:45:39,759
or um well yeah i have been doing

2781
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:42,840
fermented seawater and i love it um

2782
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:44,239
i did get these like blooms of like

2783
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:48,000
purple

2784
01:45:44,238 --> 01:45:51,198
uh bacteria from from my seawater so

2785
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:54,800
um i think i am getting some you know

2786
01:45:51,198 --> 01:45:57,759
um photobacteria in my seawater

2787
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:58,000
so that's really exciting um so anyways

2788
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:00,880
the

2789
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,000
the the wa the seawater that i'm adding

2790
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:05,039
to

2791
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:08,158
my um my feeds is

2792
01:46:05,039 --> 01:46:10,158
fermented seawater and and i love it i

2793
01:46:08,158 --> 01:46:12,559
i think it just micronizes everything

2794
01:46:10,158 --> 01:46:16,479
down you get a nice

2795
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:17,360
um array of some some just another layer

2796
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:20,479
of

2797
01:46:17,359 --> 01:46:22,000
of microbes you know from the sea so

2798
01:46:20,479 --> 01:46:25,039
you're adding more diversity

2799
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:27,118
from that biology from the ocean mixing

2800
01:46:25,039 --> 01:46:30,158
that with like your imo's and your

2801
01:46:27,118 --> 01:46:30,880
faculty of anaerobes um and you're

2802
01:46:30,158 --> 01:46:32,960
creating

2803
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:34,800
more diversity which is the name of the

2804
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:37,118
game for me right that's

2805
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:38,239
the game that's how nature works you

2806
01:46:37,118 --> 01:46:41,279
know diversity

2807
01:46:38,238 --> 01:46:43,678
diversity is king yeah you know there

2808
01:46:41,279 --> 01:46:44,960
there is if we have time there is oh we

2809
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:48,319
have so much time you go

2810
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:49,118
okay so i guess like i was earlier i was

2811
01:46:48,319 --> 01:46:51,519
talking about

2812
01:46:49,118 --> 01:46:53,118
um kind of jumping all over the place i

2813
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:57,199
apologize but earlier

2814
01:46:53,118 --> 01:47:00,158
um i was talking about like mixing

2815
01:46:57,198 --> 01:47:02,559
jadam and k f and so the major

2816
01:47:00,158 --> 01:47:05,359
differences in the approach of the two

2817
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:05,679
is that with korean natural farming you

2818
01:47:05,359 --> 01:47:09,118
are

2819
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:12,158
actually relying on the resilience

2820
01:47:09,118 --> 01:47:12,479
of your soil building your soil um and

2821
01:47:12,158 --> 01:47:16,559
the

2822
01:47:12,479 --> 01:47:19,678
immunity of your plants so um

2823
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:22,560
it's preventative measures whereas jadam

2824
01:47:19,679 --> 01:47:23,520
you have this whole arsenal of uh

2825
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:27,440
pesticides

2826
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:30,480
to use and jadam has a protocol

2827
01:47:27,439 --> 01:47:31,919
where you you know on a regular basis

2828
01:47:30,479 --> 01:47:34,158
you are applying

2829
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:35,760
the the pesticides whether or not you're

2830
01:47:34,158 --> 01:47:37,920
seeing any problems

2831
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:39,039
you you're you're always applying the

2832
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:42,319
pesticide

2833
01:47:39,039 --> 01:47:45,279
uh in intervals and so um if you're

2834
01:47:42,319 --> 01:47:48,479
mixing jadam and knf together

2835
01:47:45,279 --> 01:47:50,960
you can't really be spraying for me

2836
01:47:48,479 --> 01:47:53,198
it's still a matter of preventative

2837
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:56,480
measures and i'm only spraying

2838
01:47:53,198 --> 01:47:58,719
you know bay laurel and other um

2839
01:47:56,479 --> 01:47:59,919
pesticides only when i have problems

2840
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:02,158
because

2841
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:03,359
if you take a jadon approach to knf

2842
01:48:02,158 --> 01:48:05,920
there is a clash

2843
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:07,118
in where those regular pesticide

2844
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:10,960
applications are going to

2845
01:48:07,118 --> 01:48:12,719
affect those uh the beneficial biology

2846
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:14,560
that you're building in korean nacho

2847
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:18,719
farming this is something i had a

2848
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:18,719
direct talk to young sancho from

2849
01:48:19,279 --> 01:48:22,479
i was asking him about the connection of

2850
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:24,480
the two

2851
01:48:22,479 --> 01:48:26,319
korean natural farming in jadam and so

2852
01:48:24,479 --> 01:48:27,118
that was a concern that he mentioned was

2853
01:48:26,319 --> 01:48:30,000
that

2854
01:48:27,118 --> 01:48:30,319
the the application say sulfur things

2855
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:33,840
like

2856
01:48:30,319 --> 01:48:36,000
some of those um uh you know different

2857
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:38,319
pesticides that you can make in jadam

2858
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,600
can have an adverse effect like on your

2859
01:48:38,319 --> 01:48:43,920
beneficial biology

2860
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:46,480
so um so my approach mixing the two

2861
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:48,560
oh we're so resilient we just keep

2862
01:48:46,479 --> 01:48:48,959
coming back i i need to learn about this

2863
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:51,360
i

2864
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:52,719
i have yet to be i haven't even read the

2865
01:48:51,359 --> 01:48:54,158
jadon book yet so i'm

2866
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:56,079
fascinated by what you're talking about

2867
01:48:54,158 --> 01:48:58,479
i have so much to learn

2868
01:48:56,079 --> 01:49:00,880
um so let's go just back to that real

2869
01:48:58,479 --> 01:49:02,959
quick because i yeah i got cut off right

2870
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:06,079
when i was trying to make a point about

2871
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:09,279
yeah about using the two so really

2872
01:49:06,079 --> 01:49:11,519
um you can't take if you're doing korean

2873
01:49:09,279 --> 01:49:14,559
natural farming with imo and lactic acid

2874
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:18,000
bacteria and all these beneficials um

2875
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:20,480
a regular application of like sulfur or

2876
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,920
even something like bay can really have

2877
01:49:20,479 --> 01:49:25,759
an adverse effect on

2878
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:28,880
on that so um anyways i'll only use that

2879
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:32,239
for preventative measures

2880
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:34,960
and i'm not doing regular spray

2881
01:49:32,238 --> 01:49:35,519
because jadam does uh the protocol for

2882
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:37,439
jadam

2883
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:39,360
is you're spraying some of these

2884
01:49:37,439 --> 01:49:40,399
pesticides whether you're seeing any

2885
01:49:39,359 --> 01:49:42,960
problems or not

2886
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:44,960
that's kind of the difference sir so

2887
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:45,599
what did he have to say when you were

2888
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:48,960
talking

2889
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:52,239
so was he supportive of this kind of uh

2890
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:56,399
hybrid approach um using

2891
01:49:52,238 --> 01:49:58,238
jadam and um korean natural farming

2892
01:49:56,399 --> 01:50:00,719
when you had that conversation was that

2893
01:49:58,238 --> 01:50:02,000
a supported

2894
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:04,079
yeah you know there's kind of been

2895
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,639
rumors flying for a while and you know

2896
01:50:04,079 --> 01:50:08,158
jason

2897
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:12,239
riesling talking to him about this but

2898
01:50:08,158 --> 01:50:16,079
the the you know um

2899
01:50:12,238 --> 01:50:16,879
shohanku and chilyon-san like combining

2900
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:20,079
their

2901
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:21,760
their practices into into one um

2902
01:50:20,079 --> 01:50:24,000
i don't know if that'll ever happen or

2903
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:26,079
not but

2904
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:28,000
because the father took a different

2905
01:50:26,079 --> 01:50:29,920
approach and

2906
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,599
and so has the son and he's kind of off

2907
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:34,960
on you know and master cho

2908
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:38,000
says that jadam is the future um

2909
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:40,158
now so uh

2910
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,599
i did get some positive feedback when i

2911
01:50:40,158 --> 01:50:45,039
talked to chile yongsan

2912
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:48,319
about um mixing the two but that

2913
01:50:45,039 --> 01:50:49,760
that was the biggest um concern that he

2914
01:50:48,319 --> 01:50:53,759
had was that

2915
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:57,599
you know using using the imo

2916
01:50:53,760 --> 01:51:01,119
and lactic acid bacteria um

2917
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:03,840
along with some of these pesticides

2918
01:51:01,118 --> 01:51:05,679
you know those pesticides can have an

2919
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:07,599
adverse effect on that so that was the

2920
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:10,319
biggest concern that he brought up

2921
01:51:07,599 --> 01:51:11,599
with that but but yeah he he did seem to

2922
01:51:10,319 --> 01:51:15,118
think like

2923
01:51:11,599 --> 01:51:16,560
um you know i use jidon microbial

2924
01:51:15,118 --> 01:51:19,679
solution

2925
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:21,520
in tandem with with imo and i have a

2926
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:22,319
protocol of how i do that i'll i'll

2927
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:24,320
apply

2928
01:51:22,319 --> 01:51:25,920
genome microbial solution which is more

2929
01:51:24,319 --> 01:51:28,799
of a facultative

2930
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:29,760
um slightly more anaerobic and i'll use

2931
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:33,199
that for that

2932
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:35,360
deeper soil um horizon you know

2933
01:51:33,198 --> 01:51:36,719
where there's no oxygen and and that

2934
01:51:35,359 --> 01:51:40,158
really helps to break up

2935
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:42,079
hard soils clay rock whereas

2936
01:51:40,158 --> 01:51:43,279
um then i'll come back you know with

2937
01:51:42,079 --> 01:51:45,679
with imo

2938
01:51:43,279 --> 01:51:47,198
and apply that just for the topsoil you

2939
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:48,319
know yeah and i'm

2940
01:51:47,198 --> 01:51:50,559
i'm the kind of the same way because

2941
01:51:48,319 --> 01:51:53,279
i've got hard clays too and i'm finding

2942
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:54,560
are you finding this to be true like

2943
01:51:53,279 --> 01:51:56,319
once i started bringing in the

2944
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:59,520
facultatives through the cl it

2945
01:51:56,319 --> 01:52:02,479
seemed to support the fungal growth

2946
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:03,280
from uh the more aerobic like they seem

2947
01:52:02,479 --> 01:52:04,879
to be

2948
01:52:03,279 --> 01:52:06,639
it seemed to give this kind of

2949
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:09,840
foundational support and i got

2950
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:12,239
much like more vigorous growth

2951
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:12,960
from um the fungi that i was getting

2952
01:52:12,238 --> 01:52:16,000
from my

2953
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:18,800
my imo piles than before so i

2954
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,679
feel like there's some function that's

2955
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:23,039
allowing

2956
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:26,000
them to be extremely uh cooperative

2957
01:52:23,039 --> 01:52:26,719
i yeah definitely i agree and i'm seeing

2958
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,760
similar

2959
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:30,480
results you know using the of the jms it

2960
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:32,400
could

2961
01:52:30,479 --> 01:52:34,000
could have to do with you know the jms

2962
01:52:32,399 --> 01:52:36,399
going in doing the job first

2963
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,079
of breaking apart clay you know

2964
01:52:36,399 --> 01:52:40,079
micronizing down

2965
01:52:38,079 --> 01:52:42,479
some of that into available minerals and

2966
01:52:40,079 --> 01:52:45,840
then the imos are feeding on that

2967
01:52:42,479 --> 01:52:46,638
i think so yeah so i you know and this

2968
01:52:45,840 --> 01:52:49,520
to me is just

2969
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:50,480
it it's it shouldn't be this battle of

2970
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:53,760
um

2971
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:55,519
you know aerobic versus anaerobic and

2972
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:57,360
you know they're they're both necessary

2973
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:58,000
in nature there's no discrimination

2974
01:52:57,359 --> 01:53:00,479
between the two

2975
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,679
they both have roles within nature so

2976
01:53:00,479 --> 01:53:04,158
within the farm

2977
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:05,199
within our gardens they both have a role

2978
01:53:04,158 --> 01:53:08,319
as well

2979
01:53:05,198 --> 01:53:11,279
yeah i so agree and finding that balance

2980
01:53:08,319 --> 01:53:11,840
is the tricky part but um but it's

2981
01:53:11,279 --> 01:53:15,198
doable

2982
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:16,719
yeah for sure that's beautiful

2983
01:53:15,198 --> 01:53:18,799
and i also feel like some way like

2984
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:21,359
there's i can't believe how much

2985
01:53:18,800 --> 01:53:23,440
food this provides for for like let's

2986
01:53:21,359 --> 01:53:25,118
say earthworms and earthworms eat fungi

2987
01:53:23,439 --> 01:53:26,079
like left on their own they're gonna eat

2988
01:53:25,118 --> 01:53:29,118
all the fungal growth

2989
01:53:26,079 --> 01:53:32,319
that you have so maybe also a function

2990
01:53:29,118 --> 01:53:35,359
of this um this

2991
01:53:32,319 --> 01:53:37,679
breakdown of our clays into food are

2992
01:53:35,359 --> 01:53:39,679
actually just like we're starving and

2993
01:53:37,679 --> 01:53:41,039
our world is starving through this kind

2994
01:53:39,679 --> 01:53:44,800
of

2995
01:53:41,039 --> 01:53:48,158
you know disruption that

2996
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:51,840
maybe the facultatives are giving these

2997
01:53:48,158 --> 01:53:54,000
um insects the food that they need to

2998
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:56,560
kind of let the fungi do what they need

2999
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,679
to do maybe it's even just as simple as

3000
01:53:56,560 --> 01:54:01,639
that

3001
01:53:57,679 --> 01:54:03,760
yeah could be we need to remy

3002
01:54:01,639 --> 01:54:05,359
re-mineralize you know not only

3003
01:54:03,760 --> 01:54:08,960
ourselves but our

3004
01:54:05,359 --> 01:54:10,799
insect world as well right

3005
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:12,480
yeah and you're working with the clay is

3006
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:13,520
doing doing a lot of that so that's

3007
01:54:12,479 --> 01:54:16,879
