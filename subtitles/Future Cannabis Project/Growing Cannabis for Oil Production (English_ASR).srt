1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,129
I don't give a shit what what terpene

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,528
profile you put together it is not the

3
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:09,750
same as a cannabis derived you can't get

4
00:00:07,528 --> 00:00:11,849
the complexity straight and you can't

5
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,519
get the ratio straight and so ultimately

6
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,079
the the experience is diminished so what

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,028
we realized was that if we put in

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,948
commercial level

9
00:00:17,028 --> 00:00:21,899
stripping operations I can then have

10
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,179
farmers who have locations that are

11
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:26,549
optimal for higher quality do my crude

12
00:00:24,179 --> 00:00:28,320
production and then I can have farms

13
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,359
that have better situations to do my

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,250
Turk production and then I take your

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,200
cannabis I pull the Terps

16
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,299
the rest of the flower gets blown as

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,460
crude so this way you make crude money

18
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:40,769
you make Turk money the Terps now can

19
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,570
get infused with the crude from others

20
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,559
because you're you're having a radical

21
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:49,590
amount of product that can be created

22
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:52,320
from serbian infusion and so it starts

23
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,590
to let me find how do we stabilize

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,590
markets
