00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,200
in uh high school and

62
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,879

63
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,158
smoke so like every time

64
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,359

66
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,519
traveling hockey teams so we go from

67
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,360
like ren which is the capital of

68
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,640
brittany where we were

69
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,000
to like nance or brest or other cities

70
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,839
and uh all all the french

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,120
all the french dudes on the team would

72
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,000
smoke cigarettes

73
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,439
and and put hash in it i mean not all of

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,639
them but like everyone smoke chain

75
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:22,479
smokes

76
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,919
and you'd like get off the bus right

77
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,359
before your game

78
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,359
and everyone would chain smoke a

79
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,680
cigarette between like

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,319
first and second period everybody's in

81
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,319
the locker room chain smoking after the

82
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,238

yeah they smoked a lot of hash there and

87
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,239
and what's interesting is

88
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,759
as an american who smokes flour that

89
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,878
shit knocks you out

90
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,560
like the nicotine hash combo but then

91
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,518
for them when you're like yeah let's

92
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,280
